she,was,going,home,and,anything,that,would,take,her,there,was,fine,[END]

delilah,listens,out,for,mammy,from,the,kitchen,[END]
scarlett,allowed,will,to,help,her,to,her,feet,[END]
she,was,numb,all,over,even,her,heart,[END]
she,followed,him,silently,to,the,living,room,[END]
suellen,started,immediately,to,berate,her,taking,up,her,complaints,where,she,had,left,off,but,will,hushed,her,[END]
scarlett's,suffered,a,deep,blow,sue,leave,her,alone,[END]
he,poured,whiskey,into,a,glass,and,placed,it,in,scarlett's,hand,[END]
the,whiskey,helped,[END]

she,held,out,her,empty,glass,to,will,and,he,poured,some,more,whiskey,into,it,[END]
hello,darlings,she,said,to,her,children,come,give,mother,a,hug,[END]
scarlett,heard,her,own,voice,it,sounded,as,if,it,belonged,to,someone,else,but,at,least,it,was,saying,the,right,thing,[END]
she,spent,all,the,time,she,could,in,mammy's,room,at,mammy's,side,[END]
she,had,fastened,all,her,hopes,on,the,comfort,of,mammy's,arms,around,her,but,now,it,was,her,strong,young,arms,that,held,the,dying,old,black,woman,[END]
scarlett,lifted,the,wasted,form,to,bathe,mammy,to,change,mammy's,linen,to,help,her,when,breathing,was,too,hard,to,coax,a,few,spoonfuls,of,broth,between,her,lips,[END]
she,sang,the,lullabies,mammy,had,so,often,sung,to,her,and,when,mammy,talked,in,delirium,to,scarlett's,dead,mother,scarlett,answered,with,the,words,she,thought,her,mother,might,have,said,[END]
sometimes,mammy's,rheumy,eyes,recognized,her,and,the,old,woman's,cracked,lips,smiled,at,the,sight,of,her,favorite,[END]
then,her,quavering,voice,would,scold,scarlett,as,she,had,scolded,her,since,scarlett,was,a,baby,[END]
your,hair,looks,purely,a,mess,miss,scarlett,now,you,go,brush,a,hundred,strokes,like,mammy,taught,you,[END]
or,you,ain't,got,no,call,to,be,wearing,a,frock,all,crumpled,up,like,that,[END]
go,put,on,something,fresh,before,folks,see,you,[END]
or,you,looks,pale,as,a,ghost,miss,scarlett,[END]
is,you,putting,powder,on,your,face,[END]
wash,it,off,this,minute,[END]
whatever,mammy,commanded,scarlett,promised,to,do,[END]
there,was,never,time,enough,to,obey,before,mammy,slid,back,into,unconsciousness,or,that,other,world,where,scarlett,did,not,exist,[END]
during,the,day,and,evening,suellen,or,lutie,or,even,will,would,share,the,work,of,the,sickroom,and,scarlett,could,snatch,a,half,hour's,sleep,curled,in,the,sagging,rocking,chair,[END]
but,at,night,scarlett,kept,solitary,vigil,[END]
she,lowered,the,flame,in,the,oil,lamp,and,held,mammy's,thin,dry,hand,in,hers,[END]
while,the,house,slept,and,mammy,slept,she,was,able,at,last,to,cry,and,her,heartbroken,tears,eased,her,pain,a,little,[END]
once,in,the,small,quiet,hour,before,dawn,mammy,woke,[END]
what,for,is,you,weeping,honey,[END]
she,whispered,[END]
old,mammy,is,ready,to,lay,down,her,load,and,rest,in,the,arms,of,the,lord,[END]
there,ain't,no,call,to,take,on,so,[END]
her,hand,stirred,in,scarlett's,freed,itself,stroked,scarlett's,bent,head,[END]
hush,now,[END]
nothing's,so,bad,as,you,think,[END]
i'm,sorry,she,sobbed,i,just,can't,stop,crying,[END]
mammy's,bent,fingers,pushed,scarlett's,tangled,hair,away,from,her,face,[END]
tell,old,mammy,what's,troubling,her,lamb,[END]
scarlett,looked,into,the,old,wise,loving,eyes,and,felt,the,most,profound,pain,she,had,ever,known,[END]
i've,done,everything,wrong,mammy,[END]
i,don't,know,how,i,could,have,made,so,many,mistakes,[END]
i,don't,understand,[END]
miss,scarlett,you,done,what,you,had,to,do,[END]

the,good,lord,sent,you,some,heavy,burdens,and,you,carried,them,[END]
no,sense,asking,why,they,was,laid,on,you,or,what,it,took,out,of,you,to,tote,them,[END]
what's,done,is,done,[END]
don't,fret,yourself,now,[END]
mammy's,heavy,eyelids,closed,over,tears,that,glistened,in,the,dim,light,and,her,ragged,breathing,slowed,in,sleep,[END]
how,can,i,not,fret,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,shout,[END]
my,life,is,ruined,and,i,don't,know,what,to,do,[END]
i,need,rhett,and,he's,gone,[END]
i,need,you,and,you're,leaving,me,too,[END]
she,lifted,her,head,wiped,her,tears,away,on,her,sleeve,and,straightened,her,aching,shoulders,[END]
the,coals,in,the,pot-bellied,stove,were,nearly,used,up,and,the,bucket,was,empty,[END]
she,had,to,refill,it,she,had,to,feed,the,fire,[END]
the,room,was,beginning,to,chill,and,mammy,must,be,kept,warm,[END]
scarlett,pulled,the,faded,patchwork,quilts,up,over,mammy's,frail,form,then,she,took,the,bucket,out,into,the,cold,darkness,of,the,yard,[END]
she,hurried,toward,the,coal,bin,wishing,she'd,thought,to,put,on,a,shawl,[END]
there,was,no,moon,only,a,crescent,sliver,lost,behind,a,cloud,[END]
the,air,was,heavy,with,night's,moisture,and,the,few,stars,not,hidden,by,clouds,looked,very,far,away,and,icy-brilliant,[END]
scarlett,shivered,[END]
the,blackness,around,her,seemed,formless,infinite,[END]
she,had,rushed,blindly,into,the,center,of,the,yard,and,now,she,couldn't,make,out,the,familiar,shapes,of,smoke-house,and,barn,that,should,be,nearby,[END]
she,turned,in,sudden,panic,looking,for,the,white,bulk,of,the,house,she'd,just,left,[END]
but,it,too,was,dark,and,formless,[END]
no,light,showed,anywhere,[END]
it,was,as,if,she,were,lost,in,a,bleak,and,unknown,and,silent,world,[END]
nothing,was,stirring,in,the,night,not,a,leaf,not,a,feather,on,a,bird's,wing,[END]
terror,plucked,at,her,taut,nerves,and,she,wanted,to,run,[END]
but,where,to,[END]
everywhere,was,alien,darkness,[END]
scarlett,clenched,her,teeth,[END]
what,kind,of,foolishness,was,this,[END]
i'm,at,home,at,tara,and,the,dark,cold,will,be,gone,as,soon,as,the,sun's,up,[END]
she,forced,a,laugh,the,shrill,unnatural,sound,made,her,jump,[END]
they,do,say,it's,always,darkest,before,the,dawn,she,thought,[END]
i,reckon,this,is,proof,of,it,[END]
i've,got,the,megrims,that's,all,[END]
i,just,won't,give,in,to,them,there's,no,time,for,that,the,stove,needs,feeding,[END]
she,put,a,hand,out,before,her,into,the,blackness,and,walked,toward,where,the,coal,bin,should,be,next,to,the,woodpile,[END]
a,sunken,spot,made,her,stumble,and,she,fell,[END]
the,bucket,clattered,loudly,then,was,lost,[END]
every,exhausted,frightened,part,of,her,body,cried,out,that,she,should,give,up,stay,where,she,was,hugging,the,safety,of,the,unseen,ground,beneath,her,until,day,came,and,she,could,see,[END]
but,mammy,needed,warmth,[END]
and,the,cheering,yellow,light,of,the,flames,through,the,isinglass,windows,of,the,stove,[END]
scarlett,brought,herself,slowly,to,her,knees,and,felt,around,her,for,the,coal,bucket,[END]
surely,there'd,never,been,such,pitch,darkness,before,in,the,world,[END]
or,such,wet,cold,night,air,[END]
she,was,gasping,for,breath,[END]
where,was,the,bucket,[END]
where,was,the,dawn,[END]
her,fingers,brushed,across,cold,metal,[END]
scarlett,scrabbled,along,on,her,knees,toward,it,then,both,hands,were,clasping,the,ridged,sides,of,the,tin,coal,scuttle,[END]
she,sat,back,on,her,heels,holding,it,to,her,breast,in,a,desperate,embrace,[END]
oh,lord,i'm,all,turned,around,now,[END]
i,don't,even,know,where,the,house,is,much,less,the,coal,bin,[END]
i'm,lost,in,the,night,[END]
she,looked,up,frantically,searching,for,any,light,at,all,but,the,sky,was,black,[END]
even,the,cold,distant,stars,had,disappeared,[END]
for,a,moment,she,wanted,to,cry,out,to,scream,and,scream,until,she,woke,someone,in,the,house,someone,who,would,light,a,lamp,who'd,come,find,her,and,lead,her,home,[END]
her,pride,forbid,it,[END]
lost,in,her,own,backyard,only,a,few,steps,from,the,kitchen,door,[END]
she'd,never,live,down,the,shame,of,it,[END]
she,looped,the,bail,of,the,scuttle,over,her,arm,and,began,to,crawl,clumsily,on,hands,and,knees,across,the,dark,earth,[END]
sooner,or,later,she'd,run,into,something,the,house,the,woodpile,the,barn,the,well,and,she'd,get,her,bearings,[END]
it,would,be,quicker,to,get,up,and,walk,[END]
she,wouldn't,feel,like,such,a,fool,either,[END]
but,she,might,fall,again,and,this,time,twist,her,ankle,or,something,[END]
then,she'd,be,helpless,until,someone,found,her,[END]
no,matter,what,she,had,to,do,anything,was,better,than,lying,alone,and,helpless,and,lost,[END]
where,was,a,wall,[END]
there,had,to,be,one,here,someplace,she,felt,as,if,she'd,crawled,halfway,to,jonesboro,[END]

she,was,scarlett,o'hara,she,told,herself,[END]
she,was,at,tara,and,she,knew,every,foot,of,the,place,better,than,she,knew,her,own,hand,[END]
so,what,if,she,couldn't,see,four,inches,in,front,of,her,[END]
she,knew,what,was,there,all,she,had,to,do,was,find,it,[END]
and,she'd,do,it,on,her,feet,not,on,all,fours,like,a,baby,or,a,dog,[END]
she,lifted,her,chin,and,squared,her,thin,shoulders,[END]

the,way,she,was,carrying,on,you'd,think,wade,was,a,dancing,partner,to,flirt,with,[END]
he,was,a,nice-looking,boy,she,realized,with,surprise,[END]

what,could,she,say,how,could,she,answer,ella's,question,[END]

ella,had,the,ginger-colored,curly,hair,of,her,father,frank,kennedy,[END]
it,stuck,out,around,her,tear-blotched,face,like,rusted,coils,of,wire,always,escaping,from,the,tight,braids,prissy,plaited,no,matter,how,much,she,slicked,it,down,with,water,[END]
ella's,body,was,like,wire,too,skinny,and,angular,[END]
she,was,older,than,susie,almost,seven,compared,to,susie's,six,and,a,half,but,susie,was,half,a,head,taller,already,and,so,much,heftier,that,she,could,bully,ella,with,impunity,[END]

that's,grown-ups',business,she,said,[END]
i'm,going,to,see,to,mammy,[END]
she,couldn't,bear,to,think,about,rhett,now,she'd,think,about,all,that,later,when,she,wasn't,so,upset,[END]
it,was,more,important,much,more,to,coax,mammy,into,swallowing,her,broth,[END]
just,one,more,little,spoonful,mammy,darling,it'll,make,me,happy,[END]
the,old,woman,turned,her,head,away,from,the,spoon,[END]

mammy,was,eating,less,and,less,every,day,[END]
miss,ellen,[END]
mammy,called,weakly,[END]
i'm,here,mammy,scarlett,replied,[END]
it,always,hurt,when,mammy,didn't,know,her,when,she,thought,the,hands,that,tended,her,so,lovingly,were,the,hands,of,scarlett's,mother,[END]
i,shouldn't,let,it,bother,me,scarlett,told,herself,every,time,[END]

mother,was,kind,to,everyone,she,was,an,angel,she,was,a,perfect,lady,[END]
i,should,take,it,as,praise,to,be,mistook,for,her,[END]
i,expect,i'll,go,to,hell,for,being,jealous,that,mammy,loved,her,best,[END]
except,that,i,don't,much,believe,in,hell,any,more,[END]
or,heaven,either,[END]

but,he's,gone,mammy,[END]
i,can't,give,you,what,you,want,[END]
she,saw,that,mammy,had,slipped,into,a,near-coma,again,and,she,was,fiercely,grateful,[END]
at,least,mammy,was,free,of,pain,[END]
her,own,heart,was,aching,as,if,it,were,full,of,knives,[END]
how,she,needed,rhett,especially,now,with,mammy,sliding,ever,faster,down,the,slope,to,death,[END]
if,he,could,just,be,here,with,me,feeling,the,same,sorrow,i,feel,[END]
for,rhett,loved,mammy,too,and,mammy,loved,him,[END]
he'd,never,worked,so,hard,to,win,anyone,over,in,his,life,rhett,said,and,he'd,never,cared,as,much,for,anyone's,opinion,as,he,did,mammy's,[END]
he'd,be,broken-hearted,when,he,learned,that,she,was,gone,he'd,wish,so,much,that,he'd,been,able,to,say,goodbye,to,her,[END]
scarlett's,head,lifted,her,eyes,widened,[END]
of,course,[END]
what,a,fool,she,was,being,[END]

unless,maybe,you,weren't,fixing,to,go,to,jonesboro,yourself,for,anything,were,you,[END]
she,held,her,breath,while,she,waited,for,his,answer,[END]
will,looked,at,her,calmly,[END]
he,understood,scarlett,better,than,she,realized,[END]

if,i,was,planning,to,go,to,jonesboro,that,is,[END]
oh,will,you,are,a,dear,sweet,thing,[END]

she's,asking,for,him,and,he's,always,been,so,fond,of,her,he'd,never,forgive,himself,if,he,let,her,down,[END]
she,fiddled,with,the,horse's,mane,[END]
he's,in,charleston,on,family,business,his,mother,can,barely,draw,breath,without,asking,rhett's,advice,[END]
scarlett,looked,up,saw,will's,expressionless,face,then,looked,away,[END]
she,began,to,braid,pieces,of,the,mane,staring,at,her,work,as,if,it,were,of,vital,importance,[END]
so,if,you'll,just,send,a,telegram,i'll,give,you,the,address,[END]
and,you'd,better,make,it,from,you,will,[END]
rhett,knows,how,i,adore,mammy,[END]
he's,liable,to,think,i,was,exaggerating,how,sick,she,is,[END]
she,lifted,her,head,and,smiled,brilliantly,[END]
he,thinks,i,haven't,any,more,sense,than,a,june,bug,[END]

scarlett,helped,him,with,it,[END]
she,felt,full,of,energy,[END]
she,was,sure,rhett,would,come,[END]
he,could,be,at,tara,in,two,days,if,he,left,charleston,as,soon,as,he,got,the,wire,[END]
but,rhett,didn't,come,in,two,days,[END]
or,three,or,four,or,five,[END]
scarlett,stopped,listening,for,the,sound,of,wheels,or,hoof,beats,on,the,drive,[END]
she,had,worn,herself,ragged,straining,to,hear,[END]
and,now,there,was,another,sound,that,took,all,her,attention,the,horrible,rasping,noise,that,was,mammy's,effort,to,breathe,[END]
it,seemed,impossible,that,the,frail,wasted,body,could,summon,the,strength,needed,to,draw,air,into,her,lungs,push,it,out,again,[END]
but,she,did,time,after,time,the,cords,on,her,wrinkled,neck,thick,and,quivering,[END]
suellen,joined,scarlett's,vigil,[END]
she's,my,mammy,too,scarlett,[END]
the,life-long,jealousies,and,cruelties,between,them,were,forgotten,in,their,joint,need,to,help,the,old,black,woman,[END]
they,brought,down,all,the,pillows,in,the,house,to,prop,her,up,and,kept,the,croup,kettle,steaming,constantly,[END]
they,spread,butter,on,her,cracked,lips,spooned,sips,of,water,between,them,[END]
but,nothing,eased,mammy's,struggles,[END]
she,looked,at,them,with,pity,[END]
don't,wear,yo'selves,out,she,gasped,[END]
nothin',you,kin,do,[END]
scarlett,put,her,fingers,across,mammy's,lips,[END]
hush,she,begged,[END]
don't,try,to,talk,[END]
save,your,strength,[END]
why,oh,why,she,raged,silently,to,god,why,couldn't,you,let,her,die,easy,when,she,was,wandering,in,the,past,[END]
why,did,you,have,to,wake,her,up,and,let,her,suffer,so,[END]
she,was,good,all,her,life,always,doing,for,other,people,never,anything,for,herself,[END]
she,deserves,better,than,this,i'll,never,bow,my,head,to,you,again,as,long,as,i,live,[END]
but,she,read,aloud,to,mammy,from,the,worn,old,bible,on,the,nightstand,by,the,bed,[END]
she,read,the,psalms,and,her,voice,gave,no,sign,of,the,pain,and,impious,anger,in,her,heart,[END]
when,night,came,suellen,lit,the,lamp,and,took,over,from,scarlett,reading,turning,the,thin,pages,reading,[END]

but,i'm,not,leaving,mammy,[END]
i,can't,[END]
she,sat,on,the,floor,and,leaned,her,tired,back,against,the,wall,listening,to,the,terrifying,sounds,of,death,[END]
when,the,first,thin,light,of,day,showed,at,the,windows,the,sounds,suddenly,became,different,each,breath,more,noisy,longer,silences,between,them,[END]
scarlett,scrambled,to,her,feet,[END]

oh,rhett,don't,just,look,at,me,that,way,[END]
why,don't,you,put,your,arms,around,me,and,comfort,me,[END]
you,promised,mammy,[END]
rhett,shook,his,head,a,faint,smile,on,his,lips,[END]
you,are,such,a,child,scarlett,[END]
you've,known,me,all,these,years,and,yet,when,you,want,to,you,can,forget,all,you've,learned,[END]
it,was,a,lie,[END]
i,lied,to,make,a,dear,old,woman's,last,moments,happy,[END]
remember,my,pet,i'm,a,scoundrel,not,a,gentleman,[END]
he,walked,toward,the,door,[END]
don't,go,rhett,please,scarlett,sobbed,[END]
then,she,put,both,hands,over,her,mouth,to,stop,herself,[END]
she'd,never,be,able,to,respect,herself,if,she,begged,him,again,[END]
she,turned,her,head,sharply,unable,to,bear,the,sight,of,him,leaving,[END]
she,saw,the,triumph,in,suellen's,eyes,and,the,pity,in,will's,[END]
he'll,be,back,she,said,holding,her,head,high,[END]
he,always,comes,back,[END]
if,i,say,it,often,enough,she,thought,maybe,i'll,believe,it,[END]
maybe,it,will,be,true,[END]
always,she,said,[END]
she,took,a,deep,breath,[END]
where's,mammy's,petticoat,suellen,[END]
i,intend,to,see,to,it,that,she's,buried,in,it,[END]
scarlett,was,able,to,stay,in,control,of,herself,until,the,dreadful,work,of,bathing,and,dressing,mammy's,corpse,was,done,[END]
but,when,will,brought,in,the,coffin,she,began,to,shake,[END]
without,a,word,she,fled,[END]
she,poured,a,half,glass,of,whiskey,from,the,decanter,in,the,dining,room,and,drank,it,in,three,burning,gulps,[END]
the,warmth,of,it,ran,through,her,exhausted,body,and,the,shaking,stopped,[END]
i,need,air,she,thought,[END]
i,need,to,get,out,of,this,house,away,from,all,of,them,[END]
she,could,hear,the,frightened,voices,of,the,children,in,the,kitchen,[END]
her,skin,felt,raw,with,nerves,[END]
she,picked,up,her,skirts,and,ran,[END]
outside,the,morning,air,was,fresh,and,cool,[END]
scarlett,breathed,deeply,tasting,the,freshness,[END]
a,light,breeze,lifted,the,hair,that,clung,to,her,sweaty,neck,[END]
when,had,she,last,done,her,hundred,strokes,with,the,hairbrush,[END]
she,couldn't,remember,[END]
mammy,would,be,furious,[END]
oh,she,put,the,knuckles,of,her,right,hand,into,her,mouth,to,contain,her,grief,and,stumbled,through,the,tall,grasses,of,the,pasture,down,the,hill,to,the,woods,that,bordered,the,river,[END]
the,high-topped,pines,smelled,sharply,sweet,they,shaded,a,soft,thick,mat,of,bleached,needles,shed,over,hundreds,of,years,[END]
within,their,shelter,scarlett,was,alone,invisible,from,the,house,[END]
she,crumpled,wearily,onto,the,cushioned,ground,then,settled,herself,in,a,sitting,position,with,a,tree,trunk,at,her,back,[END]
she,had,to,think,there,must,be,some,way,to,salvage,her,life,from,the,ruins,she,refused,to,believe,different,[END]
but,she,couldn't,keep,her,mind,from,jumping,around,[END]
she,was,so,confused,so,tired,[END]
she'd,been,tired,before,[END]
worse,tired,than,this,[END]
when,she,had,to,get,to,tara,from,atlanta,with,the,yankee,army,on,all,sides,she,hadn't,let,tired,stop,her,[END]

when,she,picked,cotton,until,her,hands,were,raw,when,she,hitched,herself,to,the,plow,like,she,was,a,mule,when,she,had,to,find,strength,to,keep,going,in,spite,of,everything,she,hadn't,given,up,because,she,was,tired,[END]
she,wasn't,going,to,give,up,now,[END]
it,wasn't,in,her,to,give,up,[END]
she,stared,ahead,facing,all,her,demons,[END]
melanie's,death,[END]
mammy's,death,[END]
rhett's,leaving,her,saying,that,their,marriage,was,dead,[END]
that,was,the,worst,[END]
rhett,going,away,[END]
that,was,what,she,had,to,meet,head-on,[END]
she,heard,his,voice,nothing's,changed,[END]
it,couldn't,be,true,[END]
but,it,was,[END]
she,had,to,find,a,way,to,get,him,back,[END]
she'd,always,been,able,to,get,any,man,she,wanted,and,rhett,was,a,man,like,any,other,man,wasn't,he,[END]
no,he,wasn't,like,any,other,man,and,that's,why,she,wanted,him,[END]
she,shivered,suddenly,afraid,[END]
suppose,that,this,time,she,didn't,win,[END]
she,had,always,won,one,way,or,another,[END]
she'd,always,gotten,what,she,wanted,somehow,[END]
until,now,[END]
above,her,head,a,bluejay,cried,raucously,[END]
scarlett,looked,up,heard,a,second,jeering,cry,[END]
leave,me,alone,she,shouted,[END]
the,bird,flew,away,a,whirr,of,gaudy,blue,[END]
she,had,to,think,to,remember,what,rhett,had,said,[END]
not,this,morning,or,last,night,or,whenever,it,was,that,mammy,died,[END]
what,did,he,say,at,our,house,the,night,he,left,atlanta,[END]
he,talked,on,and,on,explaining,things,[END]
he,was,so,calm,so,horribly,patient,the,way,you,can,be,with,people,you,don't,care,enough,about,to,get,mad,at,them,[END]
her,mind,seized,on,an,almost-forgotten,sentence,and,she,forgot,her,exhaustion,[END]
she,had,found,what,she,needed,[END]
yes,yes,she,remembered,it,clearly,[END]
rhett,had,offered,her,a,divorce,[END]
then,after,her,furious,rejection,of,the,offer,he,had,said,it,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,eyes,hearing,his,voice,in,her,head,[END]
i'll,come,back,often,enough,to,keep,gossip,down,[END]
she,smiled,[END]
she,hadn't,won,yet,but,there,was,a,chance,[END]
a,chance,was,enough,to,go,on,with,[END]
she,stood,up,and,picked,the,pine,needles,off,her,frock,out,of,her,hair,[END]
she,must,look,a,mess,[END]
the,muddy,yellow,flint,river,ran,slowly,and,deeply,below,the,ledge,that,held,the,pine,woods,[END]
scarlett,looked,down,and,threw,in,the,handful,of,pine,needles,[END]
they,swirled,away,in,the,current,[END]
moving,on,she,murmured,[END]
just,like,me,[END]
don't,look,back,what's,done,is,done,[END]
move,on,[END]
she,squinted,up,at,the,bright,sky,[END]
a,line,of,brilliant,white,clouds,was,rushing,across,it,[END]
they,looked,full,of,wind,[END]
it's,going,to,get,colder,she,thought,automatically,[END]
i'd,better,find,something,warm,to,wear,this,afternoon,at,the,burial,[END]
she,turned,toward,home,[END]
the,sloping,pasture,looked,steeper,than,she,remembered,[END]
no,matter,[END]
she,had,to,get,back,to,the,house,and,tidy,herself,[END]
she,owed,it,to,mammy,to,look,neat,[END]
mammy,had,always,fussed,when,she,looked,messy,[END]
3,[END]
scarlett,swayed,on,her,feet,[END]
she,must,have,been,as,tired,as,this,sometime,before,in,her,life,but,she,couldn't,remember,[END]
she,was,too,tired,to,remember,[END]
i'm,tired,of,funerals,i'm,tired,of,death,i'm,tired,of,my,life,falling,away,a,piece,at,a,time,and,leaving,me,all,alone,[END]
the,graveyard,at,tara,was,not,very,large,[END]
mammy's,grave,looked,big,ever,so,much,bigger,than,melly's,scarlett,thought,disjointedly,but,mammy,had,shrivelled,up,so,that,she,probably,wasn't,any,bigger,at,all,[END]
she,didn't,need,such,a,big,grave,[END]
the,wind,had,a,bite,in,it,for,all,that,the,sky,was,so,blue,and,the,sun,so,bright,[END]
yellowed,leaves,skittered,across,the,burial,ground,blown,by,the,wind,[END]
autumn's,coming,if,it's,not,here,already,she,thought,[END]
i,used,to,love,the,fall,in,the,country,riding,through,the,woods,[END]
the,ground,looked,like,it,had,gold,on,it,and,the,air,tasted,like,cider,[END]
so,long,ago,[END]
there,hasn't,been,a,proper,riding,horse,at,tara,since,pa,died,[END]
she,looked,at,the,gravestones,[END]
gerald,o'hara,born,county,meath,ireland,[END]
ellen,robillard,o'hara,born,savannah,georgia,[END]
gerald,o'hara,jr,three,tiny,stones,all,alike,[END]
the,brothers,she'd,never,known,[END]
at,least,mammy,was,being,buried,here,next,to,miss,ellen,her,first,love,and,not,in,the,slaves',burial,plot,[END]
suellen,screamed,to,high,heaven,but,i,won,that,fight,soon,as,will,came,in,on,my,side,[END]
when,will,puts,his,foot,down,it,stays,put,[END]
too,bad,he's,so,stiff-necked,about,letting,me,give,him,some,money,[END]
the,house,looks,terrible,[END]
so,does,the,graveyard,for,that,matter,[END]
weeds,all,over,the,place,it's,downright,shabby,[END]
this,whole,funeral,is,downright,shabby,mammy,would,have,hated,it,[END]
that,black,preacher,is,going,on,and,on,and,he,didn't,even,know,her,i'll,bet,[END]
mammy,wouldn't,give,the,time,of,day,to,the,likes,of,him,she,was,a,roman,catholic,everybody,in,the,robillard,house,was,except,grandfather,and,he,didn't,have,much,say,about,anything,to,hear,mammy,tell,it,[END]
we,should,have,gotten,a,priest,but,the,closest,one,is,in,atlanta,it,would,have,taken,days,[END]
poor,mammy,[END]
poor,mother,too,[END]
she,died,and,was,buried,without,a,priest,[END]
pa,too,but,likely,it,didn't,matter,so,much,to,him,[END]
he,used,to,doze,through,the,devotions,mother,led,every,night,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,unkempt,graveyard,then,over,at,the,shabby,front,of,the,house,[END]
i'm,glad,mother,isn't,here,to,see,this,she,thought,with,sudden,fierce,anger,and,pain,[END]
it,would,break,her,heart,[END]
scarlett,could,for,a,moment,see,the,tall,graceful,form,of,her,mother,as,clearly,as,if,ellen,o'hara,were,there,among,the,mourners,at,the,burial,[END]
always,impeccably,groomed,her,white,hands,busy,with,needlework,or,gloved,to,go,out,on,one,of,her,errands,of,mercy,always,soft-voiced,always,occupied,with,the,perpetual,work,required,to,produce,the,orderly,perfection,that,was,life,at,tara,under,her,guidance,[END]
how,did,she,do,it,[END]
scarlett,cried,silently,[END]
how,did,she,make,the,world,so,wonderful,as,long,as,she,was,there,[END]
we,were,all,so,happy,then,[END]
no,matter,what,happened,mother,could,make,it,all,right,[END]
how,i,wish,she,was,still,here,[END]
she'd,hold,me,close,to,her,and,all,the,troubles,would,go,away,[END]
no,no,i,don't,want,her,to,be,here,[END]
it,would,make,her,so,sad,to,see,what's,happened,to,tara,what's,happened,to,me,[END]
she'd,be,disappointed,in,me,and,i,couldn't,bear,that,[END]
anything,but,that,[END]
i,won't,think,about,it,i,mustn't,[END]
i'll,think,about,something,else,i,wonder,if,delilah,had,sense,enough,to,fix,something,to,feed,people,after,the,burial,[END]
suellen,wouldn't,think,of,it,and,she's,too,mean,to,spend,money,on,a,collation,anyhow,[END]
not,that,it,would,set,her,back,all,that,much,there's,hardly,anybody,here,[END]
that,black,preacher,looks,like,he,could,eat,enough,for,twenty,though,[END]
if,he,doesn't,stop,going,on,about,resting,in,abraham's,bosom,and,crossing,the,river,jordan,i'm,going,to,scream,[END]
those,three,scrawny,women,he,calls,a,choir,are,the,only,people,here,who,don't,look,twitchy,from,embarrassment,[END]
some,choir,[END]
tambourines,and,spirituals,[END]
mammy,should,have,something,solemn,in,latin,not,climbing,jacob's,ladder,[END]
oh,it's,all,so,tacky,[END]
a,good,thing,there's,almost,nobody,here,just,suellen,and,will,and,me,and,the,children,and,the,servants,[END]
at,least,we,all,really,loved,mammy,and,care,that,she's,gone,[END]
big,sam's,eyes,are,red,from,crying,[END]
look,at,poor,old,pork,crying,his,eyes,out,too,[END]
why,his,share's,almost,white,i,never,think,of,him,as,old,[END]
dilcey,sure,doesn't,look,her,age,whatever,that,might,be,she,hasn't,changed,a,bit,since,she,first,came,to,tara,[END]
scarlett's,exhausted,rambling,mind,suddenly,sharpened,[END]
what,were,pork,and,dilcey,doing,here,at,all,[END]
they,hadn't,worked,at,tara,for,years,[END]
not,since,pork,became,rhett's,valet,and,dilcey,pork's,wife,went,to,melanie's,house,as,beau's,mammy,[END]
how,did,they,come,to,be,here,at,tara,[END]
there,was,no,way,they,could,have,learned,about,mammy's,death,[END]
unless,rhett,told,them,[END]
scarlett,looked,over,her,shoulder,[END]
had,rhett,come,back,[END]
there,was,no,sign,of,him,[END]
as,soon,as,the,service,was,over,she,made,a,beeline,for,pork,[END]
let,will,and,suellen,deal,with,the,long-winded,preacher,[END]
it's,a,sad,day,miss,scarlett,pork's,eyes,were,still,welling,with,tears,[END]
yes,it,is,pork,she,said,[END]
mustn't,rush,him,she,knew,or,she'd,never,find,out,what,she,wanted,to,know,[END]
scarlett,walked,slowly,beside,the,old,black,servant,listening,to,his,reminiscences,of,mist',gerald,and,mammy,and,the,early,days,at,tara,[END]
she'd,forgotten,pork,had,been,with,her,father,come,to,tara,with,gerald,when,there,was,nothing,there,except,a,burned-out,old,building,and,fields,gone,to,brush,[END]
why,pork,must,be,seventy,or,more,[END]
little,by,little,she,extracted,the,information,she,wanted,[END]
rhett,had,gone,back,to,charleston,to,stay,[END]
pork,had,packed,all,of,rhett's,clothes,and,sent,them,to,the,depot,for,shipping,[END]
it,was,his,final,duty,as,rhett's,valet,he,was,retired,now,with,a,parting,bonus,that,was,big,enough,for,him,to,have,a,place,of,his,own,anywhere,he,liked,[END]
i,can,do,for,my,family,too,pork,said,proudly,[END]
dilcey,would,never,need,to,work,again,and,prissy,would,have,something,to,offer,any,man,who,wanted,to,marry,her,[END]
prissy,ain't,no,beauty,miss,scarlett,and,she's,going,on,twenty-five,years,old,but,with,a,'heritance,behind,her,she,can,catch,herself,a,husband,easy,as,a,young,pretty,girl,what,got,no,money,[END]
scarlett,smiled,and,smiled,and,agreed,with,pork,that,mist',rhett,was,a,fine,gentleman,[END]
inside,she,was,raging,[END]
that,fine,gentleman's,generosity,was,making,a,real,hash,of,things,for,her,[END]
who,was,going,to,take,care,of,wade,and,ella,with,prissy,gone,[END]
and,how,the,devil,was,she,going,to,manage,to,find,a,good,nursemaid,for,beau,[END]
he'd,just,lost,his,mother,and,his,father,was,half,crazy,with,grief,and,now,the,only,one,in,that,house,with,any,sense,was,leaving,too,[END]
she,wished,she,could,pick,up,and,leave,too,just,leave,everything,and,everybody,behind,[END]
mother,of,god,[END]
i,came,to,tara,to,get,some,rest,to,straighten,out,my,life,and,all,i,found,was,more,problems,to,take,care,of,[END]
can't,i,ever,get,any,peace,[END]
will,quietly,and,firmly,provided,scarlett,with,that,respite,[END]
he,sent,her,to,bed,and,gave,orders,that,she,wasn't,to,be,disturbed,[END]
she,slept,for,almost,eighteen,hours,and,she,woke,with,a,clear,plan,of,where,to,begin,[END]
i,hope,you,slept,well,said,suellen,when,scarlett,came,down,for,breakfast,[END]
her,voice,was,sickeningly,honeyed,[END]
you,must,have,been,awfully,tired,after,all,you've,been,through,[END]
the,truce,was,over,now,that,mammy,was,dead,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,glittered,dangerously,[END]
she,knew,suellen,was,thinking,of,the,disgraceful,scene,she'd,made,begging,rhett,not,to,leave,her,[END]
but,when,she,answered,her,words,were,equally,sweet,[END]
i,hardly,felt,my,head,touch,the,pillow,and,i,was,gone,[END]
the,country,air,is,so,soothing,and,refreshing,[END]
you,nasty,thing,she,added,in,her,head,[END]
the,bedroom,that,she,still,thought,of,as,hers,now,belonged,to,susie,suellen's,oldest,child,and,scarlett,had,felt,like,a,stranger,[END]
suellen,knew,it,too,scarlett,was,sure,[END]
but,it,didn't,matter,[END]
she,needed,to,stay,on,good,terms,with,suellen,if,she,was,going,to,carry,out,her,plan,[END]
she,smiled,at,her,sister,[END]
what's,so,funny,scarlett,[END]
do,i,have,a,spot,on,my,nose,or,something,[END]
suellen's,voice,set,scarlett's,teeth,on,edge,but,she,held,on,to,her,smile,[END]
i'm,sorry,sue,[END]
i,was,just,remembering,a,silly,dream,i,had,last,night,[END]
i,dreamt,we,were,all,children,again,and,that,mammy,was,switching,my,legs,with,a,switch,from,the,peach,tree,[END]
do,you,remember,how,much,those,switches,stung,[END]
suellen,laughed,[END]
i,sure,do,[END]
lutie,uses,them,on,the,girls,[END]
i,can,almost,feel,the,sting,on,my,own,legs,when,she,does,[END]
scarlett,watched,her,sister's,face,[END]
i'm,surprised,i,don't,have,a,million,scars,to,this,day,she,said,[END]
i,was,such,a,horrid,little,girl,[END]
i,don't,know,how,you,and,carreen,could,put,up,with,me,[END]
she,buttered,a,biscuit,as,if,it,were,her,only,concern,[END]
suellen,looked,suspicious,[END]
you,did,torment,us,scarlett,[END]
and,somehow,you,managed,to,make,the,fights,come,out,looking,like,our,fault,[END]
i,know,[END]
i,was,horrid,[END]
even,when,we,got,older,[END]
i,drove,you,and,carreen,like,mules,when,we,had,to,pick,the,cotton,after,the,yankees,stole,everything,[END]
you,nearly,killed,us,[END]
there,we,were,half,dead,from,the,typhoid,and,you,dragged,us,out,of,bed,and,sent,us,out,in,the,hot,sun,[END]
suellen,became,more,animated,and,more,vehement,as,she,repeated,grievances,that,she,had,nursed,for,years,[END]
scarlett,nodded,encouragement,making,little,noises,of,contrition,[END]
how,suellen,does,love,to,complain,she,thought,[END]
it's,meat,and,drink,to,her,[END]
she,waited,until,suellen,began,to,run,down,before,she,spoke,[END]
i,feel,so,mean,and,there's,just,nothing,i,can,do,to,make,up,for,all,the,bad,times,i,put,you,through,[END]
i,do,think,will,is,wicked,not,to,let,me,give,you,all,any,money,[END]
after,all,it,is,for,tara,[END]
i've,told,him,the,same,thing,a,hundred,times,suellen,said,[END]
i'll,just,bet,you,have,thought,scarlett,[END]
men,are,so,bullheaded,she,said,[END]
then,oh,suellen,i,just,thought,of,something,[END]
do,say,yes,it,would,be,such,a,blessing,to,me,if,you,did,[END]
and,will,couldn't,possibly,fuss,about,it,[END]
what,if,i,left,ella,and,wade,here,and,sent,money,to,you,for,their,keep,[END]
they're,so,peaked,from,living,in,the,city,and,the,country,air,would,do,them,a,world,of,good,[END]
i,don't,know,scarlett,[END]
we're,going,to,be,awfully,crowded,when,the,baby,comes,[END]
suellen's,expression,was,greedy,but,still,wary,[END]
i,know,scarlett,crooned,sympathetically,[END]
wade,hampton,eats,like,a,horse,too,[END]
but,it,would,be,so,good,for,them,poor,city,creatures,[END]
i,guess,it,would,run,about,a,hundred,dollars,a,month,just,to,feed,them,and,buy,them,shoes,[END]
she,doubted,that,will,had,a,hundred,dollars,a,year,in,cash,money,from,his,hard,work,at,tara,[END]
suellen,was,speechless,she,noted,with,satisfaction,[END]
she,was,sure,her,sister's,voice,would,return,in,time,to,accept,[END]
i'll,write,a,nice,fat,bank,draft,after,breakfast,she,thought,[END]
these,are,the,best,biscuits,i,ever,tasted,scarlett,said,[END]
could,i,have,another,[END]
she,was,beginning,to,feel,much,better,with,a,good,sleep,behind,her,a,good,meal,in,her,stomach,and,the,children,taken,care,of,[END]
she,knew,she,should,go,back,to,atlanta,she,still,had,to,do,something,about,beau,[END]
ashley,too,she'd,promised,melanie,[END]
but,she'd,think,about,that,later,[END]
she'd,come,to,tara,for,country,peace,and,quiet,she,was,determined,to,have,some,before,she,left,[END]
after,breakfast,suellen,went,out,to,the,kitchen,[END]
probably,to,complain,about,something,scarlett,thought,uncharitably,[END]
no,matter,[END]
it,gave,her,a,chance,to,be,alone,and,peaceful,[END]
the,house,is,so,quiet,[END]
the,children,must,be,having,their,breakfast,in,the,kitchen,and,of,course,will's,long,gone,to,the,fields,with,wade,dogging,his,footsteps,just,the,way,he,used,to,when,will,first,came,to,tara,[END]
wade'll,be,much,happier,here,than,in,atlanta,especially,with,rhett,gone,no,i,won't,think,about,that,now,i'll,go,crazy,if,i,do,[END]
i'll,just,enjoy,the,peace,and,quiet,it's,what,i,came,for,[END]
she,poured,herself,another,cup,of,coffee,not,caring,that,it,was,only,lukewarm,[END]
sunlight,through,the,window,behind,her,illuminated,the,painting,on,the,wall,opposite,above,the,scarred,sideboard,[END]
will,had,done,a,grand,job,repairing,the,furniture,that,the,yankee,soldiers,had,broken,up,but,even,he,couldn't,remove,the,deep,gouges,they'd,made,with,their,swords,[END]
or,the,bayonet,wound,in,grandma,robillard's,portrait,[END]
whatever,soldier,had,stabbed,her,must,have,been,drunk,scarlett,figured,because,he'd,missed,both,the,arrogant,almost-sneer,on,grandma's,thin-nosed,face,and,the,bosoms,that,rounded,up,over,her,low,cut,gown,[END]
all,he'd,done,was,jab,through,her,left,earring,and,now,she,looked,even,more,interesting,wearing,just,one,[END]
her,mother's,mother,was,the,only,ancestor,who,really,interested,scarlett,and,it,frustrated,her,that,nobody,would,ever,tell,her,enough,about,her,grandmother,[END]
married,three,times,she,had,learned,that,much,from,her,mother,but,no,details,[END]
and,mammy,always,cut,off,tales,of,life,in,savannah,just,when,they,started,getting,interesting,[END]
there,had,been,duels,fought,over,grandma,and,the,fashions,of,her,day,had,been,scandalous,with,ladies,deliberately,wetting,their,thin,muslin,gowns,so,that,they'd,cling,to,their,legs,[END]
and,the,rest,of,them,too,from,the,look,of,things,in,the,portrait,[END]
i,should,blush,just,from,thinking,the,kind,of,things,i'm,thinking,scarlett,told,herself,[END]
but,she,looked,back,over,her,shoulder,at,the,portrait,as,she,left,the,dining,room,[END]
i,wonder,what,she,was,really,like,[END]
the,sitting,room,showed,the,signs,of,poverty,and,constant,use,by,a,young,family,scarlett,could,hardly,recognize,the,velvet-covered,settee,where,she,had,posed,herself,prettily,when,beaux,proposed,[END]
and,everything,had,been,rearranged,too,[END]
she,had,to,admit,that,suellen,had,the,right,to,fix,the,house,to,suit,herself,but,it,rankled,all,the,same,[END]
it,wasn't,really,tara,this,way,[END]
she,grew,more,and,more,despondent,as,she,went,from,room,to,room,[END]
nothing,was,the,same,[END]
every,time,she,came,home,there,were,more,changes,and,more,shabbiness,[END]
oh,why,did,will,have,to,be,so,stubborn,[END]
all,the,furniture,needed,recovering,the,curtains,were,practically,rags,and,you,could,see,the,floor,right,through,the,carpets,[END]
she,could,get,new,things,for,tara,if,will,would,let,her,[END]
then,she,wouldn't,have,the,heartsickness,of,seeing,the,things,she,remembered,looking,so,pitifully,worn,[END]
it,should,be,mine,[END]
i'd,take,better,care,of,it,[END]
pa,always,said,he'd,leave,tara,to,me,[END]
but,he,never,made,a,will,[END]
that's,just,like,pa,he,never,thought,of,tomorrow,[END]
scarlett,frowned,but,she,couldn't,really,be,angry,at,her,father,[END]
no,one,had,ever,stayed,angry,at,gerald,o'hara,he,was,like,a,lovable,naughty,child,even,when,he,was,in,his,sixties,[END]
the,one,i'm,mad,at,still,is,carreen,[END]
baby,sister,or,not,she,was,wrong,to,do,what,she,did,and,i'll,never,forgive,her,never,[END]
she,was,stubborn,as,a,mule,when,she,made,up,her,mind,to,go,into,the,convent,and,i,accepted,it,finally,[END]
but,she,never,told,me,she,was,going,to,use,her,one-third,share,of,tara,as,her,dowry,for,the,convent,[END]
she,should,have,told,me,[END]
i,would,have,found,the,money,somehow,[END]
then,i'd,have,two-thirds,ownership,[END]
not,the,whole,thing,like,it,should,be,but,at,least,clear,control,[END]
then,i'd,have,some,say,so,[END]
instead,i,have,to,bite,my,tongue,and,watch,while,everything,goes,downhill,and,let,suellen,queen,it,over,me,[END]
it's,not,fair,[END]
i'm,the,one,who,saved,tara,from,the,yankees,and,the,carpetbaggers,[END]
it,is,mine,no,matter,what,the,law,says,and,it'll,be,wade's,some,day,i'll,see,to,that,no,matter,what,it,takes,[END]
scarlett,rested,her,head,against,the,split,leather,covering,on,the,old,sofa,in,the,small,room,from,which,ellen,o'hara,had,quietly,ruled,the,plantation,[END]
there,seemed,to,be,a,lingering,trace,of,her,mother's,lemon,verbena,toilet,water,even,after,all,these,years,[END]
this,was,the,peacefulness,she,had,come,to,find,[END]
never,mind,the,changes,the,shabbiness,[END]
tara,was,still,tara,still,home,[END]
and,the,heart,of,it,was,here,in,ellen's,room,[END]
a,slamming,door,shattered,the,quiet,[END]
scarlett,heard,ella,and,susie,coming,through,the,hall,quarrelling,about,something,[END]
she,had,to,get,away,she,couldn't,face,noise,and,conflict,[END]
she,hurried,outside,[END]
she,wanted,to,see,the,fields,anyhow,[END]
they,were,all,healed,rich,and,red,the,way,they'd,always,been,[END]
she,walked,quickly,across,the,weedy,lawn,and,past,the,cow,shed,[END]
she'd,never,get,over,her,aversion,to,cows,not,if,she,lived,to,be,a,hundred,[END]
nasty,sharp-horned,things,[END]
at,the,edge,of,the,first,field,she,leaned,on,the,fence,and,breathed,in,the,rich,ammonia,odor,of,newly,turned,earth,and,manure,[END]
funny,how,in,the,city,manure,was,so,smelly,and,messy,while,in,the,country,it,was,a,farmer's,perfume,[END]
will,sure,is,a,good,farmer,[END]
he's,the,best,thing,that,ever,happened,to,tara,[END]
no,matter,what,i,might,have,done,we'd,never,have,made,it,if,he,hadn't,stopped,on,his,way,home,to,florida,and,decided,to,stay,[END]
he,fell,in,love,with,this,land,the,way,other,men,fall,in,love,with,a,woman,[END]
and,he's,not,even,irish,[END]
until,will,came,along,i,always,thought,only,a,brogue-talking,irishman,like,pa,could,get,so,worked,up,about,the,land,[END]
on,the,far,side,of,the,field,scarlett,saw,wade,helping,will,and,big,sam,mend,a,downed,piece,of,fence,[END]
good,for,him,to,be,learning,she,thought,[END]
it's,his,heritage,[END]
she,watched,the,boy,and,the,men,working,together,for,several,minutes,[END]
i'd,better,scoot,back,to,the,house,she,thought,[END]
i,forgot,to,write,that,bank,draft,for,suellen,[END]
her,signature,on,the,check,was,characteristic,of,scarlett,[END]
clear,and,unembellished,with,no,blots,or,wavering,lines,like,tentative,writers,[END]
it,was,businesslike,and,straightforward,[END]
she,looked,at,it,for,a,moment,before,she,blotted,it,dry,then,she,looked,at,it,again,[END]
scarlett,o'hara,butler,[END]
when,she,wrote,personal,notes,or,invitations,scarlett,followed,the,fashion,of,the,day,adding,complicated,loops,to,every,capital,letter,and,finishing,off,with,a,parabola,of,swirls,beneath,her,name,[END]
she,did,it,now,on,a,scrap,of,brown,wrapping,paper,[END]
then,she,looked,back,at,the,check,she'd,just,written,[END]
it,was,dated,she'd,had,to,ask,suellen,what,day,it,was,and,she,was,shocked,by,the,answer,october,11,1873,more,than,three,weeks,since,melly's,death,[END]
she'd,been,at,tara,for,twenty-two,days,taking,care,of,mammy,[END]
the,date,had,other,meanings,too,[END]
it,was,more,than,six,months,ago,now,that,bonnie,died,[END]
scarlett,could,leave,off,the,unrelieved,dull,black,of,deep,mourning,[END]
she,could,accept,social,invitations,invite,people,to,her,house,[END]
she,could,reenter,the,world,[END]
i,want,to,go,back,to,atlanta,she,thought,[END]
i,want,some,gaiety,[END]
there's,been,too,much,grieving,too,much,death,[END]
i,need,life,[END]
she,folded,the,check,for,suellen,[END]
i,miss,the,store,too,[END]
the,account,books,are,most,likely,in,a,fearful,mess,[END]
and,rhett,will,be,coming,to,atlanta,to,keep,gossip,down,[END]
i've,got,to,be,there,[END]
the,only,sound,she,could,hear,was,the,slow,ticking,of,the,clock,in,the,hall,beyond,the,closed,door,[END]
the,quiet,that,she'd,longed,for,so,much,was,now,suddenly,driving,her,crazy,[END]
she,stood,up,abruptly,[END]
i'll,give,suellen,her,check,after,dinner,soon,as,will,goes,back,to,the,fields,[END]
then,i'll,take,the,buggy,and,make,a,quick,visit,to,the,folks,at,fairhill,and,mimosa,[END]
they'd,never,forgive,me,if,i,didn't,come,by,to,say,hello,[END]
then,tonight,i'll,pack,my,things,and,tomorrow,i'll,take,the,morning,train,[END]
home,to,atlanta,[END]
tara's,not,home,for,me,any,more,no,matter,how,much,i,love,it,[END]
it's,time,for,me,to,go,[END]
the,road,to,fairhill,was,rutted,and,weed,grown,[END]
scarlett,remembered,when,it,was,scraped,every,week,and,sprinkled,with,water,to,keep,the,dust,down,[END]
time,was,she,thought,sadly,there,were,at,least,ten,plantations,in,visiting,distance,and,people,coming,and,going,all,the,time,[END]
now,there's,only,tara,left,and,the,tarletons,and,the,fontaines,[END]
all,the,rest,are,just,burnt,chimneys,or,fallen-in,walls,[END]
i,really,have,to,get,back,to,the,city,[END]
everything,in,the,county,makes,me,sad,[END]
the,slow,old,horse,and,the,buggy's,springs,were,almost,as,bad,as,the,roads,[END]
she,thought,of,her,upholstered,carriage,and,matched,team,with,elias,to,drive,them,[END]
she,needed,to,go,home,to,atlanta,[END]
the,noisy,cheerfulness,at,fairhill,snapped,her,out,of,her,mood,[END]
as,usual,beatrice,tarleton,was,full,of,talk,about,her,horses,and,interested,in,nothing,else,[END]
the,stables,scarlett,noticed,had,a,new,roof,[END]
the,house,roof,had,fresh,patches,[END]
jim,tarleton,looked,old,his,share,was,white,but,he'd,brought,in,a,good,cotton,crop,with,the,help,of,his,one-armed,son-in-law,hetty's,husband,[END]
the,other,three,girls,were,frankly,old,maids,[END]
of,course,we're,miserably,depressed,about,it,day,and,night,said,miranda,and,they,all,laughed,[END]
scarlett,didn't,understand,them,at,all,[END]
the,tarletons,could,laugh,about,anything,[END]
maybe,it,was,connected,in,some,way,with,having,red,hair,[END]
the,twinge,of,envy,she,felt,was,nothing,new,[END]
she'd,always,wished,that,she,could,be,part,of,a,family,that,was,as,affectionate,and,teasing,as,the,tarletons,but,she,stifled,the,envy,[END]
it,was,disloyal,to,her,mother,[END]
she,stayed,too,long,being,with,them,was,so,much,fun,she'd,have,to,visit,the,fontaines,tomorrow,[END]
it,was,nearly,dark,when,she,got,back,to,tara,[END]
she,could,hear,suellen's,youngest,wailing,for,something,even,before,she,got,the,door,open,[END]
it,was,definitely,time,to,go,back,to,atlanta,[END]
but,there,was,news,that,changed,her,mind,at,once,[END]
suellen,scooped,up,the,squalling,child,and,shushed,it,just,as,scarlett,walked,through,the,door,[END]
in,spite,of,her,bedraggled,hair,and,misshapen,body,suellen,looked,prettier,than,she,ever,had,as,a,girl,[END]
oh,scarlett,she,exclaimed,[END]
there's,such,excitement,you'll,never,guess,[END]
hush,now,honey,you'll,have,a,nice,piece,of,bone,with,your,supper,and,you,can,chew,that,mean,old,tooth,right,through,so,it,won't,hurt,any,more,[END]
if,a,new,tooth,is,the,exciting,news,i,don't,want,to,even,try,and,guess,scarlett,felt,like,saying,[END]
but,suellen,didn't,give,her,a,chance,[END]
tony's,home,[END]
suellen,said,[END]
sally,fontaine,rode,over,to,tell,us,you,just,missed,her,[END]
tony's,back,[END]
safe,and,sound,[END]
we're,going,over,to,the,fontaine,place,for,supper,tomorrow,night,just,as,soon,as,will,finishes,with,the,cows,[END]
oh,isn't,it,wonderful,scarlett,[END]
suellen's,smile,was,radiant,[END]
the,county's,filling,back,up,again,[END]
scarlett,felt,like,hugging,her,sister,an,impulse,she'd,never,had,before,[END]
suellen,was,right,[END]
it,was,wonderful,to,have,tony,back,[END]
she'd,been,afraid,that,no,one,would,ever,see,him,again,[END]
now,that,awful,memory,of,the,last,sight,of,him,could,be,forgotten,forever,[END]
he'd,been,so,worn,and,worried,soaked,to,the,skin,too,and,shivering,[END]
who,wouldn't,be,cold,and,scared,[END]
the,yankees,were,right,behind,him,and,he,was,running,for,his,life,after,he,killed,the,black,man,who,was,mauling,sally,and,then,the,scallywag,who'd,egged,the,black,fool,on,to,go,after,a,white,woman,[END]
tony,back,home,[END]
she,could,hardly,wait,for,the,next,afternoon,[END]
the,county,was,returning,to,life,[END]
4,[END]
the,fontaine,plantation,was,named,mimosa,for,the,grove,of,trees,that,surrounded,the,faded,yellow,stucco,house,[END]
the,trees',feathery,pink,flowers,had,fallen,at,summer's,end,but,the,fern-like,leaves,were,still,vivid,green,on,the,boughs,[END]
they,swayed,like,dancers,in,the,light,wind,making,shifting,patterns,of,shadow,on,the,mottled,walls,of,the,butter-colored,house,[END]
it,looked,warm,and,welcoming,in,the,low,slanting,sunlight,[END]
oh,i,hope,tony,hasn't,changed,too,much,scarlett,thought,nervously,[END]
seven,years,is,such,a,long,time,[END]
her,feet,dragged,when,will,lifted,her,down,from,the,buggy,[END]
suppose,tony,looked,old,and,tired,and,well,defeated,like,ashley,[END]
it,would,be,more,than,she,could,bear,[END]
she,lagged,behind,will,and,suellen,on,the,path,to,the,door,[END]
then,the,door,swung,open,with,a,bang,and,all,her,apprehension,vanished,[END]
who's,that,strolling,up,like,they,were,going,to,church,[END]
don't,you,know,enough,to,rush,in,and,welcome,a,hero,when,he,comes,home,[END]
tony's,voice,was,full,of,laughter,just,the,way,it,had,always,been,his,share,and,eyes,as,black,as,ever,his,wide,grin,as,bright,and,mischievous,[END]
tony,[END]
scarlett,cried,[END]
you,look,just,the,same,[END]
is,that,you,scarlett,[END]
come,and,give,me,a,kiss,[END]
you,too,suellen,[END]
you,weren't,generous,with,kisses,like,scarlett,in,the,old,days,but,will,must,have,taught,you,a,few,things,after,you,married,[END]
i,intend,to,kiss,every,female,over,six,years,old,in,the,whole,state,of,georgia,now,that,i'm,back,[END]
suellen,giggled,nervously,and,looked,at,will,[END]
a,slight,smile,on,his,placid,thin,face,granted,her,permission,but,tony,hadn't,bothered,to,wait,for,it,[END]
he,grabbed,her,around,her,thickened,waist,and,planted,a,smacking,kiss,on,her,lips,[END]
she,was,pink,with,confusion,and,pleasure,when,he,released,her,[END]
the,dashing,fontaine,brothers,had,paid,suellen,little,attention,in,the,pre-war,years,of,beaux,and,belles,[END]
will,put,a,warm,steadying,arm,around,her,shoulders,[END]
scarlett,honey,tony,shouted,his,arms,held,wide,[END]
scarlett,stepped,into,his,embrace,hugged,him,tight,around,the,neck,[END]
you,got,a,lot,taller,in,texas,she,exclaimed,[END]
tony,was,laughing,as,he,kissed,her,offered,lips,[END]
then,he,lifted,his,trouser,leg,to,show,them,all,the,high-heeled,boots,he,was,wearing,[END]
everyone,got,taller,in,texas,he,said,he,wouldn't,be,surprised,if,it,was,a,law,there,[END]
alex,fontaine,smiled,over,tony's,shoulder,[END]
you'll,hear,more,about,texas,than,anybody,rightly,needs,to,know,he,drawled,that,is,if,tony,lets,you,come,in,the,house,[END]
he's,forgotten,about,things,like,that,[END]
in,texas,they,all,live,around,campfires,under,the,stars,instead,of,having,walls,and,a,roof,[END]
alex,was,glowing,with,happiness,[END]
he,looks,like,he'd,like,to,hug,and,kiss,tony,himself,thought,scarlett,and,why,not,[END]
they,were,close,as,two,fingers,on,a,hand,the,whole,time,they,were,growing,up,[END]
alex,must,have,missed,him,something,awful,[END]
sudden,tears,pricked,her,eyes,[END]
tony's,exuberant,return,home,was,the,first,joyful,event,in,the,county,since,sherman's,troops,had,devastated,the,land,and,the,lives,of,its,people,[END]
she,hardly,knew,how,to,respond,to,such,a,rush,of,happiness,[END]
alex's,wife,sally,took,her,by,the,hand,when,she,entered,the,shabby,living,room,[END]
i,know,just,how,you,feel,scarlett,she,whispered,[END]
we'd,nearly,forgot,how,to,have,fun,[END]
there's,been,more,laughing,in,this,house,today,than,in,the,past,ten,years,put,together,[END]
we'll,make,the,rafters,ring,tonight,[END]
sally's,eyes,were,full,of,tears,too,[END]
then,the,rafters,began,to,ring,[END]
the,tarletons,had,arrived,[END]
thank,heaven,you're,back,in,one,piece,boy,beatrice,tarleton,greeted,tony,[END]
you,can,have,the,pick,of,any,one,of,my,three,girls,[END]
i've,only,got,one,grandchild,and,i'm,not,getting,any,younger,[END]
oh,ma,[END]
moaned,hetty,and,camilla,and,miranda,tarleton,in,chorus,[END]
then,they,laughed,[END]
their,mother's,preoccupation,with,breeding,horses,and,people,was,too,well-known,in,the,county,for,them,to,pretend,embarrassment,[END]
but,tony,was,blushing,crimson,[END]
scarlett,and,sally,hooted,[END]
before,the,light,ebbed,beatrice,tarleton,insisted,on,seeing,the,horses,tony,had,brought,with,him,from,texas,and,the,argument,about,the,merits,of,eastern,thoroughbreds,versus,western,mustangs,raged,until,everyone,else,begged,for,a,truce,[END]
and,a,drink,said,alex,[END]
i've,even,found,some,real,whiskey,for,the,celebration,instead,of,'shine,[END]
scarlett,wished,not,for,the,first,time,that,taking,a,drink,was,not,a,pleasure,from,which,ladies,were,automatically,excluded,[END]
she,would,have,enjoyed,one,[END]
even,more,she,would,have,enjoyed,talking,with,the,men,instead,of,being,exiled,to,the,other,side,of,the,room,for,women's,talk,of,babies,and,household,management,[END]
she,had,never,understood,or,accepted,the,traditional,segregation,of,the,sexes,[END]
but,it,was,the,way,things,were,done,always,had,been,done,and,she,resigned,herself,to,it,[END]
at,least,she,could,amuse,herself,by,watching,the,tarleton,girls,pretend,that,they,weren't,thinking,along,exactly,the,same,lines,as,their,mother,if,only,tony,would,look,their,way,instead,of,being,so,wrapped,up,in,whatever,the,men,were,talking,about,[END]
little,joe,must,be,thrilled,half,to,death,to,have,his,uncle,home,hetty,tarleton,was,saying,to,sally,[END]
hetty,could,afford,to,ignore,the,men,[END]
her,fat,one-armed,husband,was,one,of,them,[END]
sally,replied,with,details,about,her,little,boy,that,bored,scarlett,silly,[END]
she,wondered,how,soon,they'd,have,supper,[END]
it,couldn't,be,too,very,long,all,the,men,were,farmers,and,would,have,to,be,up,the,next,morning,at,dawn,[END]
that,meant,an,early,end,to,the,evening's,festivities,[END]
she,was,right,about,an,early,supper,the,men,announced,that,they,were,ready,for,it,after,only,one,drink,[END]
but,she,was,wrong,about,the,early,close,to,the,party,[END]
everyone,was,enjoying,it,too,much,to,let,it,end,[END]
tony,fascinated,them,with,stories,of,his,adventures,[END]
it,was,hardly,a,week,before,i,hooked,up,with,the,texas,rangers,he,said,with,a,roar,of,laughter,[END]
the,state,was,under,yankee,military,rule,like,every,place,else,in,the,south,but,hell,apologies,ladies,those,bluecoats,didn't,have,the,first,idea,what,to,do,about,the,indians,[END]
the,rangers,had,been,fighting,'em,all,along,and,the,only,hope,the,ranchers,had,was,that,the,rangers,would,keep,on,protecting,them,[END]
so,that's,what,they,did,[END]
i,knew,right,off,that,i'd,found,my,kind,of,people,and,i,joined,up,[END]
it,was,glorious,[END]
no,uniforms,no,marching,on,an,empty,stomach,to,where,some,fool,general,wants,you,to,go,no,drilling,no,sir,[END]
you,jump,on,your,horse,and,head,out,with,a,bunch,of,your,fellows,and,go,find,the,fighting,[END]
tony's,black,eyes,sparkled,with,excitement,[END]
alex's,matched,them,[END]

do,they,really,torture,people,[END]
you,don't,want,to,hear,about,that,said,tony,his,laughing,eyes,suddenly,dull,[END]
then,he,smiled,[END]
they're,smart,as,paint,when,it,comes,to,fighting,[END]
the,rangers,learned,early,on,that,if,they,were,going,to,beat,the,red,devils,they'd,have,to,learn,their,way,of,doing,things,[END]

it's,got,so,much,silver,on,it,you'll,half,go,blind,from,the,shine,of,it,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
she,might,have,known,[END]
tony,and,alex,had,always,been,the,most,dandified,men,in,all,north,georgia,[END]
tony,obviously,hadn't,changed,a,bit,[END]
high,heels,on,fancy,boots,and,silver,on,his,saddle,[END]
she'd,be,willing,to,bet,he,came,home,with,his,pockets,as,empty,as,when,he,left,on,the,run,from,the,hangman,[END]
it,was,major,foolishness,to,have,silver,saddles,when,the,house,at,mimosa,really,needed,a,new,roof,[END]
but,for,tony,it,was,right,[END]
it,meant,that,he,was,still,tony,[END]
and,alex,was,as,proud,of,him,as,if,he'd,come,with,a,wagon-load,of,gold,[END]
how,she,loved,them,both,of,them,[END]
they,might,be,left,with,nothing,but,a,farm,that,they,had,to,work,themselves,but,the,yankees,hadn't,beaten,the,fontaines,they,hadn't,even,been,able,to,put,a,dent,in,them,[END]
lord,wouldn't,the,boys,have,loved,to,prance,around,tall,as,a,tree,and,polish,silver,with,their,bottoms,said,beatrice,tarleton,[END]
i,can,see,the,twins,now,they'd,just,eat,it,up,[END]
scarlett,caught,her,breath,[END]
why,did,mrs,tarleton,have,to,ruin,everything,that,way,[END]
why,ruin,such,a,happy,time,by,reminding,everybody,that,almost,all,of,their,old,friends,were,dead,[END]
but,nothing,was,ruined,[END]
they,wouldn't,be,able,to,keep,their,saddles,for,a,week,miss,beatrice,you,know,that,alex,said,[END]
they'd,either,lose,them,in,a,poker,game,or,sell,them,to,buy,champagne,for,a,party,that,was,running,out,of,steam,[END]
remember,when,brent,sold,all,the,furniture,in,his,room,at,the,university,and,bought,dollar,cigars,for,all,the,boys,who'd,never,tried,smoking,[END]
and,when,stuart,lost,his,dress,suit,cutting,cards,and,had,to,skulk,away,from,that,cotillion,wrapped,in,a,rug,[END]
tony,added,[END]
remember,when,they,pawned,boyd's,law,books,[END]
said,jim,tarleton,[END]
i,thought,you'd,skin,them,alive,beatrice,[END]
they,always,grew,back,the,skin,mrs,tarleton,said,smiling,[END]
i,tried,to,break,their,legs,when,they,set,the,ice,house,on,fire,but,they,ran,too,fast,for,me,to,catch,them,[END]
that,was,the,time,they,came,over,to,lovejoy,and,hid,in,our,barn,said,sally,[END]
the,cows,went,dry,for,a,week,when,the,twins,tried,to,get,themselves,a,pail,of,milk,to,drink,[END]
everyone,had,a,story,about,the,tarleton,twins,and,those,stories,led,to,others,about,their,friends,and,older,brothers,lafe,munroe,cade,and,raiford,calvert,tom,and,boyd,tarleton,joe,fontaine,all,the,boys,who'd,never,come,home,[END]
the,stories,were,the,shared,wealth,of,memory,and,of,love,and,as,they,were,told,the,shadows,in,the,corners,of,the,room,became,populated,with,the,smiling,shining,youth,of,those,who,were,dead,but,now,at,last,no,longer,lost,because,they,could,be,remembered,with,fond,laughter,instead,of,desperate,bitterness,[END]
the,older,generation,wasn't,forgotten,either,[END]
all,those,around,the,table,had,rich,memories,of,old,miss,fontaine,alex,and,tony's,sharp-tongued,soft-hearted,grandmother,[END]
and,of,their,mother,called,young,miss,until,the,day,she,died,on,her,sixtieth,birthday,[END]
scarlett,discovered,that,she,could,even,share,the,affectionate,chuckling,about,her,father's,tell-tale,habit,of,singing,irish,songs,of,rebellion,when,he,had,as,he,put,it,taken,a,drop,or,two,and,even,hear,her,mother's,kindness,spoken,of,without,the,heartbreak,that,had,always,before,been,her,immediate,response,to,the,mention,of,ellen,o'hara's,name,[END]
hour,after,hour,long,after,plates,were,empty,and,the,fire,only,embers,on,the,hearth,still,the,talk,went,on,and,the,dozen,survivors,brought,back,to,life,all,those,loved,ones,who,could,not,be,there,to,welcome,tony,home,[END]
it,was,a,happy,time,a,healing,time,[END]
the,dim,flickering,light,of,the,oil,lamp,in,the,center,of,the,table,showed,none,of,the,scars,of,sherman's,men,in,the,smoke-stained,room,and,its,mended,furniture,[END]
the,faces,around,the,table,were,without,lines,the,clothes,without,patches,[END]
for,these,sweet,moments,of,illusion,it,was,as,if,mimosa,was,transported,to,a,timeless,place,and,hour,where,there,was,no,pain,and,there,had,never,been,a,war,[END]
many,years,before,scarlett,had,vowed,to,herself,that,she,would,never,look,back,[END]
remembering,the,halcyon,pre-war,days,mourning,them,yearning,for,them,would,only,hurt,and,weaken,her,and,she,needed,all,her,strength,and,determination,to,survive,and,to,protect,her,family,[END]
but,the,shared,memories,in,the,dining,room,at,mimosa,were,not,at,all,a,source,of,weakness,[END]
they,gave,her,courage,they,were,proof,that,good,people,could,suffer,every,kind,of,loss,and,still,retain,the,capacity,for,love,and,laughter,[END]
she,was,proud,to,be,included,in,their,number,proud,to,call,them,her,friends,proud,that,they,were,what,they,were,[END]
will,walked,in,front,of,the,buggy,on,the,way,home,carrying,a,pitch,pine,torch,and,leading,the,horse,[END]
it,was,a,dark,night,and,it,was,very,late,[END]
overhead,the,stars,were,bright,in,a,cloudless,sky,so,bright,that,the,quarter-moon,looked,almost,transparently,pale,[END]
the,only,sound,was,the,slow,clop-clop,of,the,horse's,hooves,[END]
suellen,dozed,olf,but,scarlett,fought,her,sleepiness,[END]
she,didn't,want,the,evening,to,end,she,wanted,the,warm,comfort,and,happiness,of,it,to,last,forever,[END]
how,strong,tony,looked,[END]
and,so,full,of,life,so,pleased,with,his,funny,boots,with,himself,with,everything,[END]
the,tarleton,girls,acted,like,a,bunch,of,red-haired,tabby,kittens,looking,at,a,bowl,of,cream,[END]
i,wonder,which,one,will,catch,him,[END]
beatrice,tarleton's,sure,going,to,see,to,it,that,one,of,them,does,[END]
an,owl,in,the,woods,beside,the,road,said,whoo,whoo,[END]
and,scarlett,giggled,to,herself,[END]
they,were,more,than,halfway,to,tara,before,she,realized,that,she,hadn't,thought,about,rhett,for,hours,[END]
then,melancholy,and,worry,clamped,down,on,her,like,lead,weights,and,she,noticed,for,the,first,time,that,the,night,air,was,cold,and,her,body,was,chilled,[END]
she,pulled,her,shawl,close,around,her,and,silently,urged,will,to,hurry,[END]
i,don't,want,to,think,about,anything,not,tonight,[END]
i,don't,want,to,spoil,the,good,time,i,had,[END]
hurry,will,it's,cold,and,it's,dark,[END]
the,next,morning,scarlett,and,suellen,drove,the,children,over,in,the,wagon,to,mimosa,[END]
wade,was,shiny-eyed,with,hero,worship,when,tony,showed,off,his,six-guns,[END]
even,scarlett's,jaw,dropped,in,astounded,delight,when,tony,twirled,them,around,his,fingers,in,unison,sent,them,circling,in,the,air,then,caught,them,and,dropped,them,in,the,holsters,that,hung,low,on,his,hips,from,a,fancy,silvertrimmed,leather,belt,[END]
do,they,shoot,too,[END]
wade,asked,[END]
yes,sir,they,do,[END]
and,when,you,get,a,little,older,i'll,teach,you,how,to,use,them,[END]
spin,them,like,you,do,[END]
well,sure,[END]
no,sense,having,a,six-shooter,if,you're,not,going,to,put,it,through,all,its,tricks,[END]
tony,ruffled,wade's,hair,with,a,man-to-man,rough,hand,[END]
i'll,let,you,learn,to,ride,western,too,wade,hampton,[END]
i,reckon,you'll,be,the,only,boy,in,these,parts,that'll,know,what,a,real,saddle,ought,to,be,[END]
but,we,can't,start,today,[END]
my,brother's,going,to,be,giving,me,lessons,in,farming,[END]
see,how,it,is,everybody's,got,to,learn,new,things,all,the,time,[END]
tony,planted,quick,kisses,on,suellen's,and,scarlett's,cheeks,the,little,girls,got,theirs,on,the,top,of,their,head,and,then,he,said,goodbye,[END]
alex,is,waiting,for,me,down,by,the,creek,[END]
why,don't,you,go,find,sally,[END]
i,think,she's,hanging,up,the,wash,out,behind,the,house,[END]
sally,acted,glad,to,see,them,but,suellen,refused,her,invitation,to,stop,in,for,a,cup,of,coffee,[END]
i've,got,to,get,home,and,do,just,what,you're,doing,sally,we,can't,stay,[END]
we,just,didn't,want,to,leave,without,saying,hello,[END]
and,she,hurried,scarlett,back,to,the,wagon,[END]
i,don't,see,why,you,were,so,rude,to,sally,suellen,[END]
your,wash,could,have,waited,while,we,had,a,cup,of,coffee,and,talked,about,the,party,[END]
scarlett,you,don't,know,anything,about,keeping,a,farm,going,[END]
if,sally,got,behind,on,her,wash,she'd,be,behind,on,everything,else,all,day,[END]
we,can't,get,a,bunch,of,servants,way,out,here,in,the,country,the,way,you,can,in,atlanta,[END]
we've,got,to,do,plenty,of,the,work,ourselves,[END]
scarlett,bridled,at,the,tone,of,her,sister's,voice,[END]
i,might,just,as,well,go,back,to,atlanta,on,this,afternoon's,train,she,said,crossly,[END]
it,would,make,things,a,lot,easier,for,all,of,us,if,you,did,suellen,retorted,[END]
you,just,make,more,work,and,i,need,that,bedroom,for,susie,and,ella,[END]
scarlett,opened,her,mouth,to,argue,[END]
then,she,closed,it,[END]
she'd,rather,be,in,atlanta,anyhow,[END]
if,tony,hadn't,come,home,she'd,be,there,by,now,[END]
people,would,be,glad,to,see,her,too,[END]
she,had,plenty,of,friends,in,atlanta,who,had,time,for,coffee,or,a,game,of,whist,or,a,party,[END]
she,forced,a,smile,for,her,children,turning,her,back,on,suellen,[END]
wade,hampton,ella,mother's,got,to,go,to,atlanta,after,dinner,today,[END]
i,want,you,to,promise,you'll,be,good,and,not,give,your,aunt,suellen,any,trouble,now,[END]
scarlett,waited,for,the,protests,and,the,tears,[END]
but,the,children,were,too,busy,talking,about,tony's,flashing,six-shooters,to,pay,any,attention,to,her,[END]
as,soon,as,they,reached,tara,scarlett,told,pansy,to,get,her,valise,packed,[END]
that,was,when,ella,began,to,cry,[END]
prissy's,gone,and,i,don't,know,anybody,here,to,braid,my,hair,she,sobbed,[END]
scarlett,resisted,the,impulse,to,slap,her,little,girl,[END]
she,couldn't,stay,at,tara,now,that,she'd,made,up,her,mind,to,leave,she'd,go,crazy,with,nothing,to,do,and,no,one,to,talk,to,[END]
but,she,couldn't,go,without,pansy,it,was,unheard,of,for,a,lady,to,travel,alone,[END]
what,was,she,going,to,do,[END]
ella,wanted,pansy,to,stay,with,her,[END]
it,might,take,days,and,days,for,ella,to,get,used,to,lutie,little,susie's,mammy,[END]
and,if,ella,carried,on,day,and,night,suellen,might,change,her,mind,about,keeping,the,children,at,tara,[END]
all,right,then,scarlett,said,sharply,[END]
stop,that,awful,noise,ella,[END]
i'll,leave,pansy,here,for,the,rest,of,the,week,[END]
she,can,teach,lutie,about,fixing,your,hair,[END]
i'll,just,have,to,hook,up,with,some,woman,at,the,jonesboro,depot,[END]
there's,bound,to,be,somebody,respectable,going,to,atlanta,that,i,can,share,a,seat,with,[END]
i'm,going,home,on,the,afternoon,train,and,that's,all,there,is,to,it,[END]
will,can,drive,me,over,and,be,back,in,plenty,of,time,to,milk,his,nasty,old,cows,[END]
halfway,to,jonesboro,scarlett,stopped,chattering,brightly,about,tony,fontaine's,return,[END]
she,was,silent,for,a,moment,then,she,blurted,out,what,was,preying,on,her,mind,[END]
will,about,rhett,the,way,he,left,so,fast,i,mean,i,hope,suellen's,not,going,to,go,blabbing,all,over,the,county,[END]
will,looked,at,her,with,his,pale,blue,eyes,[END]
now,scarlett,you,know,better,than,that,[END]
family,don't,bad,mouth,family,[END]
i,always,figured,it,was,a,pity,you,couldn't,seem,to,see,the,good,in,suellen,[END]
it's,there,but,somehow,it,don't,show,itself,when,you,come,'round,[END]
you'll,just,have,to,take,my,word,on,it,[END]
never,mind,how,she,looks,to,you,suellen'll,never,tell,your,private,troubles,to,anybody,[END]
she,don't,want,folks,talking,loose,about,the,o'haras,any,more,than,you,do,[END]
scarlet,relaxed,a,little,[END]
she,trusted,will,completely,[END]
his,word,was,more,certain,than,money,in,the,bank,[END]
and,he,was,wise,too,[END]
she'd,never,known,will,to,be,wrong,about,anything-except,maybe,suellen,[END]
you,do,believe,he'll,be,back,don't,you,will,[END]
will,didn't,have,to,ask,who,she,meant,[END]
he,heard,the,anxiety,beneath,her,words,and,he,chewed,quietly,on,the,straw,in,the,corner,of,his,mouth,while,he,decided,how,to,reply,[END]
at,last,he,said,slowly,i,can't,say,i,do,scarlett,but,i,ain't,the,one,to,know,[END]
i,never,seen,him,above,four,or,five,times,in,my,life,[END]
she,felt,as,if,he,had,struck,her,[END]
then,quick,anger,erased,the,pain,[END]
you,just,don't,understand,anything,at,all,will,benteen,[END]
rhett's,upset,right,now,but,he'll,get,over,it,[END]
he'd,never,do,anything,as,low,as,go,off,and,leave,his,wife,stranded,[END]
will,nodded,[END]
scarlett,could,take,it,for,agreement,if,she,wanted,to,[END]
but,he,hadn't,forgotten,rhett's,sardonic,description,of,himself,[END]
he,was,a,scoundrel,[END]
according,to,everything,folks,said,he,always,had,been,and,likely,always,would,be,[END]
scarlett,stared,at,the,familiar,red,clay,road,in,front,of,her,[END]
her,jaw,was,set,her,mind,working,furiously,[END]
rhett,would,come,back,[END]
he,had,to,because,she,wanted,him,to,and,she,always,got,what,she,wanted,[END]
all,she,had,to,do,was,set,her,mind,to,it,[END]
5,[END]
the,noise,and,push,at,five,points,was,a,tonic,to,scarlett's,spirit,[END]
so,was,the,disorder,on,her,desk,at,the,house,[END]
she,needed,life,and,action,around,her,after,the,numbing,succession,of,deaths,and,she,needed,work,to,do,[END]
there,were,stacks,of,newspapers,to,be,read,piles,of,daily,business,accounts,from,the,general,store,she,owned,in,the,very,center,of,five,points,mounds,of,bills,to,be,paid,and,circulars,to,tear,up,and,throw,away,[END]
scarlett,sighed,with,pleasure,and,pulled,her,chair,up,close,to,the,desk,[END]
she,checked,the,freshness,of,the,ink,in,its,stand,and,the,supply,of,nibs,for,her,pen,[END]
then,she,lit,the,lamp,[END]
it,would,be,dark,long,before,she,finished,all,this,maybe,she'd,even,have,her,supper,on,a,tray,tonight,while,she,worked,[END]
she,reached,eagerly,for,the,store,accounts,then,her,hands,stopped,in,midair,when,a,large,square,envelope,on,top,of,the,newspapers,caught,her,eye,[END]
it,was,addressed,simply,scarlett,and,the,handwriting,was,rhett's,[END]
i,won't,read,it,now,she,thought,at,once,it'll,just,get,in,the,way,of,all,the,things,i've,got,to,do,[END]
i'm,not,worried,about,what's,in,it,not,a,bit,i,just,don't,want,to,look,at,it,now,[END]
i'll,save,it,she,told,herself,like,for,dessert,[END]
and,she,picked,up,a,handful,of,ledger,sheets,[END]
but,she,kept,losing,track,of,the,arithmetic,she,was,doing,in,her,and,finally,she,threw,the,accounts,down,[END]
her,fingers,tore,the,sealed,envelope,open,[END]
believe,me,rhett's,letter,began,when,i,say,that,you,have,my,deepest,sympathy,in,your,bereavement,[END]
mammy's,death,is,a,great,loss,[END]
i,am,grateful,that,you,notified,me,in,time,for,me,to,see,her,before,she,went,[END]
scarlett,looked,up,in,a,rage,from,the,thick,black,pen,strokes,and,spoke,aloud,[END]
grateful,',my,foot,[END]
so,you,could,lie,to,her,and,to,me,you,varmint,[END]
she,wished,she,could,burn,the,letter,and,throw,the,ashes,in,rhett's,face,shouting,the,words,at,him,[END]
oh,she'd,get,even,with,him,for,shaming,her,in,front,of,suellen,and,will,[END]
no,matter,how,long,she,had,to,wait,and,plan,she'd,find,a,way,somehow,[END]
he,had,no,right,to,treat,her,that,way,to,treat,mammy,that,way,to,make,a,sham,out,of,her,last,wishes,like,that,[END]
i'll,burn,it,now,i,won't,even,read,the,rest,i,don't,have,to,put,my,eyes,to,any,more,of,his,lies,[END]
her,hand,fumbled,for,the,box,of,matches,but,when,she,held,it,she,dropped,it,at,once,[END]
i'll,die,of,wondering,what,was,in,it,she,admitted,to,herself,and,she,lowered,her,head,to,read,on,[END]
she,would,find,her,life,unaltered,rhett,stated,[END]
the,household,bills,would,be,paid,by,his,lawyers,an,arrangement,he,had,made,years,before,and,all,moneys,drawn,from,scarlett's,bank,account,by,check,would,be,replaced,automatically,[END]
she,might,want,to,instruct,any,new,shops,where,she,opened,accounts,about,the,procedure,all,her,current,shopping,places,used,they,sent,their,bills,directly,to,rhett's,lawyers,[END]
alternatively,she,could,pay,her,bills,by,check,the,amount,being,replaced,in,her,bank,[END]
scarlett,read,all,this,with,fascination,[END]
anything,that,had,to,do,with,money,always,interested,her,always,had,since,the,day,when,she,was,forced,by,the,union,army,to,discover,what,poverty,was,[END]
money,was,safety,she,believed,[END]
she,hoarded,the,money,she,earned,herself,and,now,viewing,rhett's,open-handed,generosity,she,was,shocked,[END]
what,a,fool,he,is,i,could,rob,him,blind,if,i,wanted,to,[END]
probably,his,lawyers,have,been,cooking,those,account,books,for,ages,too,[END]
then,rhett,must,be,powerfully,rich,if,he,can,spend,without,caring,where,it,goes,[END]
i,always,knew,he,was,rich,[END]
but,not,this,rich,[END]
i,wonder,how,much,money,he's,got,[END]
then,he,does,still,love,me,this,proves,it,[END]
no,man,would,ever,spoil,a,woman,the,way,rhett,spoiled,me,all,these,years,unless,he,loved,her,to,distraction,and,he's,going,to,keep,on,giving,me,every,thing,and,anything,i,want,[END]
he,must,still,feel,the,same,or,he'd,rein,in,[END]
oh,i,knew,it,[END]
i,knew,it,[END]
he,didn't,mean,all,those,things,he,said,[END]
he,just,didn't,believe,me,when,i,told,him,i,know,now,that,i,love,him,[END]
scarlett,held,rhett's,letter,to,her,cheek,as,if,she,were,holding,the,hand,that,had,written,it,[END]
she'd,prove,it,to,him,prove,she,loved,him,with,all,her,heart,and,then,they'd,be,so,happy,the,happiest,people,in,the,whole,world,[END]
she,covered,the,letter,with,kisses,before,she,put,it,carefully,away,in,a,drawer,[END]
then,she,set,to,work,on,the,store,accounts,with,enthusiasm,[END]
doing,business,invigorated,her,[END]
when,a,maid,tapped,on,the,door,and,timidly,asked,about,supper,scarlett,barely,glanced,up,[END]
bring,me,something,on,a,tray,she,said,and,light,the,fire,in,the,grate,[END]
it,was,chilly,with,darkness,falling,and,she,was,hungry,as,a,wolf,[END]
she,slept,extremely,well,that,night,[END]
the,store,had,done,well,in,her,absence,and,the,supper,was,satisfying,in,her,stomach,[END]
it,was,good,to,be,home,especially,with,rhett's,letter,resting,safely,under,her,pillow,[END]
she,woke,and,stretched,luxuriously,[END]
the,crackle,of,paper,beneath,her,pillow,made,her,smile,[END]
after,she,rang,for,her,breakfast,tray,she,began,to,plan,her,day,[END]
first,to,the,store,[END]
it,must,be,low,on,stock,of,a,lot,of,things,kershaw,kept,the,books,well,enough,but,he,didn't,have,the,sense,of,a,pea,hen,[END]
he'd,run,right,out,of,flour,and,sugar,before,he,thought,about,refilling,the,kegs,and,he,probably,hadn't,ordered,a,speck,of,kerosene,or,so,much,as,a,stick,of,kindling,even,though,it,was,getting,colder,every,day,[END]
she,hadn't,gotten,around,to,the,newspapers,last,night,either,and,going,to,the,store,would,save,her,all,that,boring,reading,[END]
anything,worth,knowing,about,in,atlanta,she'd,pick,up,from,kershaw,and,the,clerks,[END]
there,was,nothing,like,a,general,store,for,collecting,all,the,stories,that,were,going,around,[END]
people,loved,to,talk,while,they,were,waiting,for,their,goods,to,be,wrapped,[END]
why,half,the,time,she,already,knew,what,was,on,the,front,page,before,the,paper,ever,got,printed,she,could,probably,throw,away,the,whole,batch,on,her,desk,and,not,miss,a,thing,[END]
scarlett's,smile,disappeared,[END]
no,she,couldn't,[END]
there'd,be,a,piece,about,melanie's,burial,and,she,wanted,to,see,it,[END]
melanie,[END]
ashley,[END]
the,store,would,have,to,wait,[END]
she,had,other,obligations,to,see,to,first,[END]
whatever,possessed,me,to,promise,melly,that,i'd,take,care,of,ashley,and,beau,[END]
but,i,promised,[END]
i'd,best,go,there,first,[END]
and,i'd,better,take,pansy,to,make,everything,proper,[END]
tongues,must,be,wagging,all,over,town,after,that,scene,at,the,graveyard,[END]
no,sense,adding,to,the,gossip,by,seeing,ashley,alone,[END]
scarlett,hurried,across,the,thick,carpet,to,the,embroidered,bell,pull,and,jerked,it,savagely,[END]
where,was,her,breakfast,[END]
oh,no,pansy,was,still,at,tara,[END]
she'd,have,to,take,one,of,the,other,servants,that,new,girl,rebecca,would,do,[END]
she,hoped,rebecca,could,help,her,dress,without,making,too,big,a,mess,of,it,[END]
she,wanted,to,hurry,now,to,get,going,and,get,her,duty,over,with,[END]
when,her,carriage,pulled,up,in,front,of,ashley,and,melanie's,tiny,house,on,ivy,street,scarlett,saw,that,the,mourning,wreath,was,gone,from,the,door,and,the,windows,were,all,shuttered,[END]
india,she,thought,at,once,[END]
of,course,[END]
she's,taken,ashley,and,beau,to,live,at,aunt,pittypat's,[END]
she,must,be,mighty,pleased,with,herself,[END]
ashley's,sister,india,was,and,always,had,been,scarlett's,implacable,enemy,[END]
scarlett,bit,her,lip,and,considered,her,dilemma,[END]
she,was,sure,that,ashley,must,have,moved,to,aunt,pitty's,with,beau,it,was,the,most,sensible,thing,for,him,to,do,[END]
without,melanie,and,now,with,dilcey,gone,there,was,no,one,to,run,ashley's,house,or,mother,his,son,[END]
at,pittypat's,there,was,comfort,an,orderly,household,and,constant,affection,for,the,little,boy,from,women,who,had,loved,him,all,his,life,[END]
two,old,maids,thought,scarlett,with,disdain,[END]
they're,ready,to,worship,anything,in,pants,even,short,pants,[END]
if,only,india,didn't,live,with,aunt,pitty,[END]
scarlett,could,manage,aunt,pitty,[END]
the,timid,old,lady,wouldn't,dare,talk,back,to,a,kitten,let,alone,scarlett,[END]
but,ashley's,sister,was,another,matter,[END]
india,would,just,love,to,have,a,confrontation,to,say,nasty,things,in,her,cold,spitting,voice,to,show,scarlett,the,door,[END]
if,only,she,hadn't,promised,melanie,but,she,had,[END]
drive,me,to,miss,pittypat,hamilton's,she,ordered,elias,[END]
rebecca,you,go,on,home,[END]
you,can,walk,[END]
there,would,be,chaperones,enough,at,pitty's,[END]
india,answered,her,knock,[END]
she,looked,at,scarlett's,fashionable,fur-trimmed,mourning,costume,and,a,tight,satisfied,smile,moved,her,lips,[END]
smile,all,you,like,you,old,crow,thought,scarlett,[END]
india's,mourning,gown,was,unrelieved,dull,black,crape,without,so,much,as,a,button,to,decorate,it,[END]
i've,come,to,see,how,ashley,is,she,said,[END]
you're,not,welcome,here,india,said,[END]
she,began,to,close,the,door,[END]
scarlett,pushed,against,it,[END]
india,wilkes,don't,you,dare,slam,that,door,in,my,face,[END]
i,made,a,promise,to,melly,and,i'll,keep,it,if,i,have,to,kill,you,to,do,it,[END]
india,answered,by,putting,her,shoulder,to,the,door,and,resisting,the,pressure,of,scarlett's,two,hands,[END]
the,undignified,struggle,lasted,for,only,a,few,seconds,[END]
then,scarlett,heard,ashley's,voice,[END]
is,that,scarlett,india,[END]
i'd,like,to,talk,with,her,[END]
the,door,swung,open,and,scarlett,marched,in,noting,with,pleasure,that,india's,face,was,mottled,with,red,splotches,of,anger,[END]
ashley,came,forward,into,the,hallway,to,greet,her,and,scarlett's,brisk,steps,faltered,[END]
he,looked,desperately,ill,dark,circles,ringed,his,pale,eyes,and,deep,lines,ran,from,his,nostrils,to,his,chin,[END]
his,clothes,looked,too,big,for,him,his,coat,hung,from,his,sagging,frame,like,broken,wings,on,a,black,bird,[END]
scarlett's,heart,turned,over,[END]
she,no,longer,loved,ashley,the,way,she,had,for,all,those,years,but,he,was,still,part,of,her,life,[END]
there,were,so,many,shared,memories,over,so,much,time,[END]
she,couldn't,bear,to,see,him,in,such,pain,[END]
dear,ashley,she,said,gently,come,and,sit,down,[END]
you,look,tired,[END]
they,sat,on,a,settee,in,aunt,pitty's,small,fussy,cluttered,parlor,for,more,than,an,hour,[END]
scarlett,spoke,seldom,[END]
she,listened,while,ashley,talked,repeating,and,interrupting,himself,in,a,confused,zigzag,of,memories,[END]
he,recounted,stories,of,his,dead,wife's,kindness,unselfishness,nobility,her,love,for,scarlett,for,beau,and,for,him,[END]
his,voice,was,low,and,without,expression,bleached,by,grief,and,hopelessness,[END]
his,hand,groped,blindly,for,scarlett's,and,he,grasped,it,with,such,despairing,strength,that,her,bones,rubbed,together,painfully,[END]
she,compressed,her,lips,and,let,him,hold,on,to,her,[END]
india,stood,in,the,arched,doorway,a,dark,still,spectator,[END]
finally,ashley,interrupted,himself,and,turned,his,head,from,side,side,like,a,man,blinded,and,lost,[END]
scarlett,i,can't,go,on,without,her,he,groaned,[END]
i,can't,[END]
scarlett,pulled,her,hand,away,[END]
she,had,to,break,through,the,shell,of,despair,that,bound,him,or,it,would,kill,him,she,was,sure,[END]
she,stood,and,leaned,down,over,him,[END]
listen,to,me,ashley,wilkes,she,said,[END]
i've,been,listening,to,you,pick,over,your,sorrows,all,this,time,and,now,you,listen,to,mine,[END]
do,you,think,you're,the,only,person,who,loved,melly,and,depended,on,her,[END]
i,did,more,than,i,knew,more,than,anybody,knew,[END]
i,expect,a,lot,of,other,people,did,too,[END]
but,we're,not,going,to,curl,up,and,die,for,it,[END]
that's,what,you're,doing,[END]
and,i'm,ashamed,of,you,[END]
melly,is,too,if,she's,looking,down,from,heaven,[END]
do,you,have,any,idea,what,she,went,through,to,have,beau,[END]
well,i,know,what,she,suffered,and,i'm,telling,you,it,would,have,killed,the,strongest,man,god,ever,made,[END]
now,you're,all,he's,got,[END]
is,that,what,you,want,melly,to,see,[END]
that,her,boy,is,all,alone,practically,an,orphan,because,his,pa,feels,too,sorry,for,himself,to,care,about,him,[END]
do,you,want,to,break,her,heart,ashley,wilkes,[END]
because,that's,what,you're,doing,[END]
she,caught,his,chin,in,her,hand,and,forced,him,to,look,at,her,[END]
you,pull,yourself,together,do,you,hear,me,ashley,[END]
you,march,yourself,out,to,the,kitchen,and,tell,the,cook,to,fix,you,a,hot,meal,[END]
and,you,eat,it,[END]
if,it,makes,you,throw,up,eat,another,one,[END]
and,you,find,your,boy,and,take,him,in,your,arms,and,tell,him,not,to,be,scared,that,he,has,a,father,to,take,care,of,him,[END]
then,do,it,[END]
think,about,somebody,besides,yourself,[END]
scarlett,wiped,her,hand,on,her,skirt,as,if,it,were,soiled,by,ashley's,grip,[END]
then,she,walked,from,the,room,pushing,india,out,of,the,way,[END]
as,she,opened,the,door,to,the,porch,she,could,hear,india,my,poor,darling,ashley,[END]
don't,pay,any,attention,to,the,horrible,things,scarlett,said,[END]
she's,a,monster,[END]
scarlett,stopped,turned,[END]
she,withdrew,a,calling,card,from,her,purse,and,dropped,it,on,a,table,[END]
i'm,leaving,my,card,for,you,aunt,pitty,she,shouted,since,you're,afraid,to,see,me,in,person,[END]
she,slammed,the,door,behind,her,[END]
just,drive,elias,she,told,her,coachman,[END]
anywhere,at,all,[END]
she,couldn't,stand,to,stay,in,that,house,one,single,minute,more,[END]
what,was,she,going,to,do,[END]
had,she,gotten,through,to,ashley,[END]
she'd,been,so,mean,well,she,had,to,be,he,was,being,drowned,in,sympathy,and,pity,but,had,it,done,any,good,[END]
ashley,adored,his,son,maybe,he'd,pull,himself,together,for,beau's,sake,[END]
maybe,wasn't,good,enough,[END]
he,had,to,[END]
she,had,to,make,him,do,it,[END]
take,me,to,mr,henry,hamilton's,law,office,she,told,elias,[END]
uncle,henry,was,terrifying,to,most,women,but,not,to,scarlett,[END]
she,could,understand,that,growing,up,in,the,same,house,with,aunt,pittypat,had,made,him,a,misogynist,[END]
and,she,knew,he,rather,liked,her,[END]
he,said,she,wasn't,as,silly,as,most,women,[END]
he,was,her,lawyer,and,knew,how,shrewd,she,was,in,her,business,dealings,[END]
when,she,walked,into,his,office,without,waiting,to,be,announced,he,put,down,the,letter,he,was,reading,and,chuckled,[END]
do,come,in,scarlett,he,said,rising,to,his,feet,[END]
are,you,in,a,hurry,to,sue,somebody,[END]
she,paced,forward,and,back,ignoring,the,chair,beside,his,desk,[END]
i'd,like,to,shoot,somebody,she,said,but,i,don't,know,that,it,would,help,[END]
isn't,it,true,that,when,charles,died,he,left,me,all,his,property,[END]
you,know,it,is,[END]
stop,that,fidgeting,and,sit,down,[END]
he,left,the,warehouses,near,the,depot,that,the,yankees,burned,[END]
and,he,left,some,farmland,outside,of,town,that,will,be,in,town,before,too,long,the,way,atlanta,has,been,growing,[END]
scarlett,perched,on,the,edge,of,the,chair,her,eyes,fixed,on,his,[END]
and,half,of,aunt,pitty's,house,on,peachtree,street,she,said,distinctly,[END]
didn't,he,leave,me,that,too,[END]
my,god,scarlett,don't,tell,me,you,want,to,move,in,there,[END]
of,course,not,[END]
but,i,want,ashley,out,of,there,[END]
india,and,aunt,pitty,are,going,to,sympathize,him,into,his,grave,[END]
he,can,go,back,to,his,own,house,[END]
i'll,find,him,a,housekeeper,[END]
henry,hamilton,looked,at,her,with,expressionless,probing,eyes,[END]
are,you,sure,that's,why,you,want,him,back,in,his,own,house,because,he's,suffering,from,too,much,sympathy,[END]
scarlett,bridled,[END]
god's,nightgown,uncle,henry,[END]
she,said,[END]
are,you,turning,into,a,scandal,monger,in,your,old,age,[END]
don't,show,your,claws,to,me,young,lady,[END]
settle,back,in,that,chair,and,listen,to,some,hard,truths,[END]
you've,got,maybe,the,best,business,head,i,ever,met,but,otherwise,you're,about,as,dimwitted,as,the,village,idiot,[END]
scarlett,scowled,but,she,did,as,she,was,told,[END]
now,about,ashley's,house,said,the,old,lawyer,slowly,it's,already,been,sold,[END]
i,drew,up,the,papers,yesterday,[END]
he,held,up,his,hand,to,stop,scarlett,before,she,could,speak,[END]
i,advised,him,to,move,into,pitty's,and,sell,it,[END]
not,because,of,the,pain,of,associations,and,memories,in,the,house,and,not,because,i,was,concerned,about,who,was,going,to,take,care,of,him,and,the,boy,although,both,are,valid,considerations,[END]
i,advised,him,to,move,because,he,needed,the,money,from,the,sale,to,keep,his,lumber,business,from,going,under,[END]
what,do,you,mean,[END]
ashley,doesn't,know,tootle,about,making,money,but,he,can't,possibly,go,under,[END]
builders,always,need,lumber,[END]
if,they're,building,[END]
just,you,get,down,off,your,high,horse,for,a,minute,and,listen,scarlett,[END]
i,know,you're,not,interested,in,anything,that,happens,in,the,world,unless,it,concerns,you,but,there,was,a,big,financial,scandal,in,new,york,a,couple,or,three,weeks,ago,[END]
a,speculator,named,jay,cooke,miscalculated,and,he,crashed,[END]
he,took,his,railroad,down,with,him,an,outfit,called,the,northern,pacific,[END]
he,took,a,bunch,of,other,speculators,with,him,too,fellows,who,were,in,on,his,railroad,deal,and,some,of,his,other,deals,[END]
when,they,went,with,him,they,took,down,a,lot,of,other,deals,they,were,in,on,outside,of,cooke's,[END]
then,the,fellows,who,were,in,on,their,deals,went,down,tumbling,still,more,deals,and,more,fellows,[END]
just,like,a,house,of,cards,[END]
in,new,york,they're,calling,it,the,panic,',[END]
it's,already,spreading,[END]
i,expect,it'll,run,through,the,whole,country,before,it's,done,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,stab,of,terror,[END]
what,about,my,store,[END]
she,cried,[END]
and,my,money,[END]
are,the,banks,safe,[END]
the,one,you,bank,in,is,[END]
i've,got,my,money,there,too,so,i,made,sure,[END]
fact,is,atlanta's,not,likely,to,get,hurt,much,[END]
we're,not,big,enough,yet,for,any,big,deals,and,it's,the,big,ones,that,are,crumbling,[END]
but,business,is,at,a,standstill,everywhere,[END]
people,are,afraid,to,invest,in,anything,[END]
that,means,building,too,[END]
and,if,nobody's,building,nobody,needs,lumber,[END]
scarlett,frowned,[END]
so,ashley,won't,be,making,any,money,from,the,sawmills,[END]
i,can,see,that,[END]
but,if,nobody's,investing,why,did,his,house,sell,so,fast,[END]
seems,to,me,if,there's,a,panic,real,estate,prices,should,be,the,first,thing,to,fall,[END]
uncle,henry,grinned,[END]
like,a,stone,[END]
you're,a,smart,one,scarlett,[END]
that's,why,i,told,ashley,to,sell,while,he,could,[END]
atlanta,hasn't,felt,the,panic,yet,but,it'll,get,here,soon,[END]
we've,been,booming,for,the,past,eight,years,hell,there,are,more,than,twenty,thousand,people,living,here,now,but,you,can't,boom,without,bucks,[END]
he,laughed,mightily,at,his,own,wit,[END]
scarlett,laughed,with,him,although,she,didn't,think,there,was,anything,funny,about,economic,collapse,[END]
she,knew,men,like,to,be,appreciated,[END]
uncle,henry's,laughter,stopped,abruptly,like,water,turned,off,at,a,faucet,[END]
so,[END]
now,ashley's,with,his,sister,and,his,aunt,for,good,and,proper,reasons,and,according,to,my,advice,[END]
and,that,doesn't,suit,you,[END]
no,sir,it,doesn't,suit,at,all,[END]
he,looks,awful,and,they're,making,him,worse,[END]
he's,like,a,dead,man,walking,[END]
i,gave,him,a,good,talking-to,tried,to,snap,him,out,of,the,state,he's,in,by,hollering,at,him,[END]
but,i,don't,know,if,it,did,any,good,[END]
i,know,it,won't,stick,even,if,it,did,[END]
not,as,long,as,he's,in,that,house,[END]
she,looked,at,uncle,henry's,skeptical,expression,[END]
anger,reddened,her,face,[END]
i,don't,care,what,you,heard,or,what,you,think,uncle,henry,[END]
i'm,not,after,ashley,[END]
i,made,a,deathbed,promise,to,melanie,that,i'd,take,care,of,him,and,beau,[END]
i,wish,to,god,i,hadn't,but,i,did,[END]
her,outburst,made,henry,uncomfortable,[END]
he,didn't,like,emotion,especially,in,women,[END]
if,you,start,crying,scarlett,i'll,have,you,put,out,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,cry,[END]
i'm,mad,[END]
i've,got,to,do,something,and,you're,no,help,[END]
henry,hamilton,leaned,back,in,his,chair,[END]
he,touched,his,fingertips,together,resting,his,arms,on,his,ample,stomach,[END]
it,was,his,lawyerly,look,almost,judicial,[END]
you're,the,last,person,who,can,help,ashley,right,now,scarlett,[END]
i,told,you,i,was,going,to,deliver,some,hard,truths,and,that's,one,of,them,[END]
right,or,wrong,and,i,don't,care,to,know,which,there,was,a,lot,of,speculation,about,you,and,ashley,at,one,time,[END]
miss,melly,stood,up,for,you,and,most,people,followed,her,lead,for,love,of,her,mind,you,not,because,they,were,especially,fond,of,you,[END]
india,thought,the,worst,and,said,it,[END]
she,put,together,her,own,little,band,of,believers,[END]
it,wasn't,a,pretty,situation,but,folks,accommodated,themselves,like,they,always,do,[END]
things,could,have,rocked,on,like,that,forever,even,after,melanie's,death,[END]
nobody,really,likes,disruption,and,changes,[END]
but,you,couldn't,leave,well,enough,alone,[END]
oh,no,[END]
you,had,to,go,make,a,spectacle,of,yourself,at,melanie's,very,graveside,[END]
throwing,your,arms,around,her,husband,hauling,him,away,from,his,dead,wife,who,a,lot,of,people,thought,close,to,a,saint,[END]
he,held,up,one,hand,[END]
i,know,what,you're,about,to,say,so,don't,bother,to,say,it,scarlett,[END]
his,fingertips,touched,again,[END]
ashley,was,about,to,throw,himself,in,the,grave,maybe,break,his,neck,[END]
i,was,there,[END]
i,saw,it,[END]
that's,not,the,point,[END]
for,such,a,smart,girl,you,don't,understand,the,world,at,all,[END]
if,ashley,had,pitched,himself,onto,the,coffin,everybody,would,have,called,it,touching,',[END]
if,he,killed,himself,doing,it,they,would,have,been,real,sorry,but,there,are,rules,for,handling,sorrow,[END]
society,needs,rules,scarlett,to,hold,itself,together,[END]
what,you,did,broke,all,the,rules,[END]
you,made,a,scene,in,public,[END]
you,laid,hands,on,a,man,who,wasn't,your,husband,[END]
in,public,[END]
you,raised,a,ruckus,that,interrupted,a,burial,a,ceremony,that,everybody,knows,the,rules,to,[END]
you,broke,up,the,last,rites,of,a,saint,[END]
there's,not,a,lady,in,this,town,that,isn't,lined,up,on,india's,side,right,now,[END]
that,means,against,you,[END]
you,don't,have,a,friend,to,your,name,scarlett,[END]
and,if,you,have,anything,at,all,to,do,with,ashley,you'll,fix,it,so,that,he's,just,as,outcast,as,you,[END]
the,ladies,are,against,you,[END]
god,help,you,scarlett,because,i,can't,[END]
when,christian,ladies,turn,on,you,you'd,better,not,hope,for,christian,charity,or,forgiveness,[END]
it's,not,in,them,[END]
they,won't,allow,it,in,anybody,else,either,especially,not,their,menfolk,[END]
they,own,their,men,body,and,soul,[END]
that's,why,i've,always,kept,my,distance,from,the,misnamed,gentle,sex,',[END]
i,wish,you,well,scarlett,[END]
you,know,i've,always,liked,you,[END]
that's,about,all,i,can,offer,good,wishes,[END]
you've,made,a,mess,of,things,and,i,don't,know,how,you,can,ever,put,it,right,[END]
the,old,lawyer,stood,up,[END]
leave,ashley,where,he,is,[END]
some,sweet-talking,little,lady,will,come,along,one,of,these,days,and,snap,him,up,[END]
then,she'll,take,care,of,him,[END]
you,leave,pittypat's,house,the,way,it,is,including,your,half,[END]
and,don't,stop,sending,money,through,me,to,pay,the,bills,for,its,upkeep,the,way,you've,always,done,[END]
that'll,satisfy,your,promise,to,melanie,[END]
come,on,[END]
i'll,escort,you,to,your,carriage,[END]
scarlett,took,his,arm,and,walked,meekly,beside,him,[END]
but,inside,she,was,seething,[END]
she,might,have,known,that,she'd,get,no,help,from,uncle,henry,[END]
she,had,to,find,out,for,herself,if,what,uncle,henry,said,was,true,if,there,was,a,financial,panic,most,of,all,if,her,money,was,safe,[END]
6,[END]
panic,henry,hamilton,called,it,[END]
the,financial,crisis,that,had,begun,on,wall,street,in,new,york,was,spreading,throughout,america,[END]
scarlett,was,terrified,that,she'd,lose,the,money,she,had,earned,and,hoarded,[END]
when,she,left,the,old,lawyer's,office,she,went,immediately,to,her,bank,[END]
she,was,shaking,internally,when,she,reached,the,bank,manager's,office,[END]
i,appreciate,your,concern,mrs,butler,he,said,but,scarlett,could,see,that,he,didn't,at,all,[END]
he,resented,her,questioning,the,security,of,the,bank,and,in,particular,the,security,of,the,bank,under,his,management,[END]
the,longer,he,talked,and,the,more,reassuring,he,sounded,the,less,scarlett,believed,him,[END]
then,inadvertently,he,set,all,her,fears,at,rest,[END]
why,we'll,not,only,be,paying,our,usual,dividend,to,stockholders,he,said,it's,actually,going,to,be,a,bit,higher,than,usual,[END]
he,looked,at,her,from,the,corners,of,his,eyes,[END]
i,didn't,get,that,information,until,this,morning,myself,he,said,angrily,[END]
i'd,certainly,like,to,know,how,your,husband,reached,his,decision,to,add,to,his,stock,holdings,a,month,ago,[END]
scarlett,felt,that,she,might,float,right,out,of,her,chair,with,relief,[END]
if,rhett,was,buying,bank,shares,this,must,be,the,safest,bank,in,america,[END]
he,always,made,money,when,the,rest,of,the,world,was,falling,to,pieces,[END]
she,didn't,know,how,he'd,found,out,about,the,bank's,position,and,she,didn't,care,[END]
it,was,enough,for,her,that,rhett,had,confidence,in,it,[END]
he,has,this,darling,little,crystal,ball,she,said,with,a,giddy,laugh,that,infuriated,the,manager,[END]
she,felt,a,little,drunk,[END]
but,not,too,light-headed,to,remember,to,convert,all,the,cash,in,her,lock,box,to,gold,[END]
she,could,still,see,the,elegantly,engraved,worthless,confederate,bonds,her,father,had,depended,on,[END]
she,had,no,faith,at,all,in,paper,[END]
as,she,left,the,bank,she,paused,on,the,steps,to,enjoy,the,warm,autumn,sun,and,the,thronged,busyness,of,the,streets,in,the,business,district,[END]
look,at,all,those,folks,rushing,around,they're,in,a,hurry,because,there's,money,to,be,made,not,because,they're,afraid,of,anything,[END]
uncle,henry's,crazy,as,an,old,coot,[END]
there's,no,panic,at,all,[END]
her,next,stop,was,her,store,[END]
kennedy's,emporium,said,the,big,gilt-lettered,sign,across,the,front,of,the,building,[END]
it,was,her,inheritance,from,her,brief,marriage,to,frank,kennedy,[END]
that,and,ella,[END]
her,pleasure,in,the,store,more,than,offset,her,disappointment,in,the,child,[END]
the,window,was,sparkling,clean,with,a,satisfyingly,crowded,display,of,merchandise,[END]
everything,from,shiny,new,axes,down,to,shiny,new,dressmaker,pins,[END]
she'd,have,to,get,those,lengths,of,calico,out,of,there,though,[END]
they'd,be,sun-streaked,in,no,time,at,all,and,then,she'd,have,to,reduce,the,price,[END]
scarlett,burst,through,the,door,ready,to,take,the,hide,off,willie,kershaw,the,head,clerk,[END]
but,in,the,end,there,was,little,reason,to,find,fault,[END]
the,calico,on,display,had,arrived,water-damaged,in,shipment,and,was,already,marked,down,[END]
the,mill,that,made,it,had,agreed,to,knock,two-thirds,off,the,cost,because,of,the,damage,[END]
kershaw,had,placed,the,orders,for,new,stock,too,without,being,told,and,the,square,heavy,iron,safe,in,the,back,room,held,neatly,banded,and,precisely,tallied,stacks,of,bagged,coins,and,greenbacks,the,daily,receipts,[END]
i,paid,the,underclerks,mrs,butler,kershaw,said,nervously,[END]
i,hope,that's,all,right,[END]
the,notation,is,on,the,saturday,tallies,[END]
the,boys,said,they,couldn't,manage,without,their,week's,packets,[END]
i,didn't,take,mine,out,not,knowing,how,you,wanted,me,to,do,but,i'd,be,mighty,grateful,if,you,could,see,your,way,clear,to,[END]
of,course,willie,said,scarlett,graciously,as,soon,as,i,match,the,money,to,the,account,books,[END]
kershaw,had,done,a,lot,better,than,she,expected,but,that,didn't,mean,she'd,allow,him,to,take,her,for,a,fool,[END]
when,the,cash,balanced,to,the,penny,she,counted,out,his,twelve,dollars,and,seventy-five,cents,pay,for,the,three,weeks,[END]
she'd,add,an,extra,dollar,when,she,paid,him,tomorrow,for,this,week,she,decided,[END]
he,deserved,a,bonus,for,managing,so,well,when,she,was,away,[END]
also,she,was,planning,to,add,to,his,duties,[END]
willie,she,told,him,privately,i,want,you,to,open,a,credit,[END]
kershaw's,protuberant,eyes,bulged,[END]
there,had,never,been,credit,extended,in,the,store,after,scarlett,took,over,its,management,[END]
he,listened,carefully,to,her,instructions,[END]
when,she,made,him,swear,he,wouldn't,tell,a,living,soul,about,it,he,placed,his,hand,over,his,heart,and,swore,[END]
he'd,better,stick,to,his,oath,too,he,thought,or,mrs,butler,would,find,out,somehow,[END]
he,was,convinced,scarlett,had,eyes,in,the,back,of,her,head,and,could,read,people's,minds,[END]
scarlett,went,home,for,dinner,when,she,left,the,store,[END]
after,she,washed,her,face,and,hands,she,started,on,the,pile,of,newspapers,[END]
the,account,of,melanie's,funeral,was,just,what,she,should,have,expected,a,minimum,number,of,words,giving,melanie's,name,birthplace,and,date,of,death,[END]
a,lady's,name,could,be,in,the,news,three,times,only,at,her,birth,her,marriage,and,her,death,[END]
and,there,must,never,be,any,details,[END]
scarlett,had,written,out,the,notice,herself,and,she'd,added,what,she,thought,was,a,suitably,dignified,line,about,how,tragic,it,was,for,melanie,to,have,died,so,young,and,how,much,she,would,be,missed,by,her,grieving,family,and,all,her,friends,in,atlanta,[END]
india,must,have,taken,it,out,scarlett,thought,irritably,[END]
if,only,ashley's,household,was,in,anybody's,hands,except,india's,life,would,be,a,lot,easier,[END]
the,very,next,issue,of,the,newspaper,made,scarlett's,palms,wet,with,fear-sweat,[END]
the,next,and,the,next,and,the,next,she,turned,through,the,pages,rapidly,with,mounting,alarm,[END]
leave,it,on,the,table,she,said,when,the,maid,announced,dinner,[END]
the,chicken,breast,was,stuck,in,congealed,gravy,by,the,time,she,got,to,the,table,but,it,didn't,matter,[END]
she,was,too,upset,to,eat,[END]
uncle,henry,had,been,right,[END]
there,was,a,panic,and,rightly,so,[END]
the,world,of,business,was,in,desperate,turmoil,even,collapse,[END]
the,stock,market,in,new,york,had,been,closed,for,ten,days,after,the,day,the,reporters,were,calling,black,friday,when,stock,prices,plunged,downward,because,everyone,was,selling,and,no,one,was,buying,[END]
in,major,american,cities,banks,were,closing,because,their,customers,wanted,their,money,and,their,money,was,gone-invested,by,the,banks,in,safe,stocks,that,had,become,nearly,worthless,[END]
factories,in,industrial,areas,were,closing,at,the,rate,of,almost,one,every,day,leaving,thousands,of,workers,without,work,and,without,money,[END]
uncle,henry,said,it,couldn't,happen,in,atlanta,scarlett,told,herself,again,and,again,[END]
but,she,had,to,restrain,her,impulse,to,go,to,the,bank,and,bring,home,her,lock,box,of,gold,[END]
if,rhett,hadn't,bought,bank,shares,she,would,have,done,it,[END]
she,thought,about,the,errand,she'd,planned,for,the,afternoon,wished,fervently,that,the,idea,had,never,crossed,her,mind,decided,that,it,had,to,be,done,[END]
even,though,the,country,was,in,a,panic,[END]
even,more,so,in,fact,[END]
maybe,she,should,have,a,tiny,glass,of,brandy,to,settle,her,churning,stomach,[END]
the,decanter,was,right,there,on,the,sideboard,[END]
it,would,keep,her,nerves,from,jumping,half,out,of,her,skin,too,[END]
no,it,could,be,smelt,on,her,breath,even,if,she,ate,parsley,or,mint,leaves,afterwards,[END]
she,took,a,deep,breath,and,got,up,from,the,table,[END]
run,out,to,the,carriage,house,and,tell,elias,i'm,going,out,she,told,the,maid,who,came,in,response,to,the,bell,[END]
there,was,no,answer,to,her,ring,at,aunt,pittypat's,front,door,[END]
scarlett,was,sure,she,saw,one,of,the,lace,curtains,twitch,at,a,parlor,window,[END]
she,twisted,the,bell,again,[END]
there,was,the,sound,of,the,bell,in,the,hall,beyond,the,door,and,a,muffled,sound,of,movement,[END]
scarlett,rang,again,[END]
all,was,silence,when,the,ringing,faded,[END]
she,waited,for,a,count,of,twenty,[END]
a,horse,and,buggy,passed,along,the,street,behind,her,[END]
if,anybody,saw,me,standing,here,locked,out,i'd,never,be,able,to,look,them,in,the,face,without,perishing,of,shame,she,thought,[END]
she,could,feel,her,cheeks,flaming,[END]
uncle,henry,was,right,the,whole,way,[END]
she,wasn't,being,received,[END]
all,her,life,she,had,heard,of,people,who,were,so,scandalous,that,no,decent,person,would,open,the,door,to,them,but,in,her,wildest,imagination,she'd,never,thought,it,could,happen,to,her,[END]
she,was,scarlett,o'hara,daughter,of,ellen,robillard,of,the,savannah,robillards,[END]
this,couldn't,be,happening,to,her,[END]
i'm,here,to,do,good,too,she,thought,with,hurt,bewilderment,[END]
her,eyes,felt,hot,a,warning,of,tears,[END]
then,as,so,often,happened,she,was,swept,by,a,tide,of,anger,and,outrage,[END]
damn,it,all,half,this,house,belonged,to,her,[END]
how,dare,anybody,lock,the,door,against,her,[END]
she,banged,on,the,door,with,her,fist,and,rattled,the,doorknob,but,the,door,was,securely,bolted,[END]
i,know,you're,in,there,india,wilkes,scarlett,shouted,through,the,keyhole,[END]
there,[END]
i,hope,she,had,her,ear,to,it,and,goes,deaf,[END]
i,came,to,talk,to,you,india,and,i'm,not,leaving,until,i,do,[END]
i'm,going,to,sit,on,the,porch,steps,until,you,open,that,door,or,until,ashley,comes,home,with,his,key,take,your,pick,[END]
scarlett,turned,and,gathered,up,the,train,of,her,skirts,[END]
she,heard,the,rattle,of,bolts,behind,her,as,she,took,a,step,then,the,squeak,of,the,hinges,[END]
for,the,love,of,heaven,come,in,india,whispered,hoarsely,[END]
you'll,make,us,the,talk,of,the,neighborhood,[END]
scarlett,surveyed,india,coolly,over,her,shoulder,[END]
maybe,you,should,come,out,and,sit,on,the,steps,with,me,india,[END]
a,blind,tramp,might,stumble,by,and,marry,you,in,exchange,for,room,and,board,[END]
as,soon,as,it,was,said,she,wished,she'd,bit,her,tongue,instead,[END]
she,hadn't,come,to,fight,with,india,[END]
but,ashley's,sister,had,always,been,like,a,burr,under,a,saddle,to,her,and,her,humiliation,at,the,locked,door,rankled,[END]
india,pushed,the,door,to,[END]
scarlett,spun,and,raced,to,stop,it,closing,[END]
i,apologize,she,said,through,clenched,teeth,[END]
her,angry,gaze,locked,with,india's,[END]
finally,india,stepped,back,[END]
how,rhett,would,love,this,[END]
scarlett,thought,all,of,a,sudden,[END]
in,the,good,days,of,their,marriage,she,had,always,told,him,about,her,triumphs,in,business,and,in,the,small,social,world,of,atlanta,[END]
it,made,him,laugh,long,and,loud,and,call,her,his,neverending,source,of,delight,[END]
maybe,he'd,laugh,again,when,she,told,him,how,india,was,puffing,like,a,dragon,that,had,to,back,down,[END]
what,do,you,want,[END]
india's,voice,was,icy,although,she,was,trembling,with,rage,[END]
it's,mighty,gracious,of,you,to,invite,me,to,sit,and,take,a,cup,of,tea,scarlett,said,in,her,best,airy,manner,[END]
but,i've,just,barely,finished,dinner,[END]
in,fact,she,was,hungry,now,[END]
the,zest,for,battle,had,pushed,panic,away,[END]
she,hoped,her,stomach,wouldn't,make,a,noise,it,felt,as,empty,as,a,dry,well,[END]
india,stationed,herself,against,the,door,to,the,parlor,[END]
aunt,pitty,is,resting,she,said,[END]
having,the,vapors,is,more,like,it,scarlett,said,to,herself,but,this,time,she,held,her,tongue,[END]
she,wasn't,mad,at,pittypat,[END]
besides,she'd,better,get,on,with,what,she'd,come,for,[END]
she,wanted,to,be,gone,before,ashley,came,home,[END]
i,don't,know,if,you're,aware,of,it,india,but,melly,asked,me,on,her,deathbed,to,promise,that,i'd,watch,out,for,beau,and,ashley,[END]
india's,body,jerked,as,if,she'd,been,shot,[END]
don't,say,a,word,scarlett,warned,her,because,there's,nothing,you,can,say,that,means,anything,next,to,melly's,practically,last,words,[END]
you'll,ruin,ashley's,name,just,like,you've,ruined,your,own,[END]
i,won't,have,you,hanging,around,here,after,him,bringing,disgrace,down,on,all,of,us,[END]
the,last,thing,on,god's,green,earth,i,want,to,do,india,wilkes,is,spend,one,more,minute,in,this,house,than,i,have,to,[END]
i,came,to,tell,you,that,i've,made,arrangements,at,my,store,for,you,to,get,anything,you,need,[END]
the,wilkeses,don't,take,charity,scarlett,[END]
you,simpleton,i'm,not,talking,charity,i'm,talking,my,promise,to,melanie,[END]
you,don't,have,any,idea,how,quick,a,boy,beau's,age,goes,through,breeches,and,outgrows,shoes,[END]
or,how,much,they,cost,[END]
do,you,want,ashley,to,be,burdened,with,little,worries,like,that,when,he's,broken-hearted,about,bigger,things,[END]
or,do,you,want,beau,to,be,a,laughingstock,at,school,[END]
i,know,just,how,much,income,aunt,pitty,gets,[END]
i,used,to,live,here,remember,[END]
it's,just,enough,to,keep,uncle,peter,and,the,carriage,put,a,little,food,on,the,table,and,pay,for,her,smelling,salts,[END]
there's,a,little,thing,called,the,panic,',too,[END]
half,the,businesses,in,the,country,are,folding,[END]
ashley's,likely,going,to,have,less,money,coming,in,than,ever,[END]
if,i,can,swallow,my,pride,and,beat,on,the,front,door,like,a,crazy,woman,you,can,swallow,yours,and,take,what,i'm,giving,[END]
it's,not,your,place,to,turn,it,down,because,if,it,was,only,you,i'd,let,you,starve,without,blinking,an,eye,[END]
i'm,talking,about,beau,[END]
and,ashley,[END]
and,melly,because,i,promised,her,what,she,asked,[END]
take,care,of,ashley,but,don't,let,him,know,it,',she,said,[END]
i,can't,not,let,him,know,it,if,you,won't,help,india,[END]
how,do,i,know,that's,what,melanie,said,[END]
because,i,say,so,and,my,word's,as,good,as,gold,[END]
no,matter,what,you,may,think,of,me,india,you'll,never,find,anybody,to,say,that,i,ever,backed,down,on,a,promise,or,broke,my,word,[END]
india,hesitated,and,scarlett,knew,she,was,winning,[END]
you,don't,have,to,go,to,the,store,yourself,she,said,[END]
you,can,send,a,list,by,somebody,else,[END]
india,took,a,deep,breath,[END]
only,for,beau's,school,clothes,she,said,grudgingly,[END]
scarlett,kept,herself,from,smiling,[END]
once,india,saw,how,pleasant,it,was,to,get,things,for,free,she'd,do,a,lot,more,shopping,than,that,[END]
scarlett,was,sure,of,it,[END]
i'll,say,good,day,then,india,[END]
mr,kershaw,the,head,clerk,is,the,only,one,knows,about,this,and,he,won't,run,off,at,the,mouth,to,anybody,[END]
put,his,name,on,the,outside,of,your,list,and,he'll,take,care,of,everything,[END]
when,she,settled,back,in,her,carriage,scarlett's,stomach,gave,out,an,audible,rumble,[END]
she,smiled,from,ear,to,ear,[END]
thank,heaven,it,had,waited,[END]
back,home,she,ordered,the,cook,to,heat,up,her,dinner,and,serve,it,again,[END]
while,she,waited,to,be,called,to,the,table,she,looked,through,the,other,pages,of,the,newspapers,avoiding,the,stories,about,the,panic,[END]
there,was,a,column,she'd,never,bothered,with,before,that,was,fascinating,to,her,now,[END]
it,contained,news,and,gossip,from,charleston,and,rhett,or,his,mother,or,sister,or,brother,might,be,mentioned,[END]
they,weren't,but,she,hadn't,really,expected,anything,[END]
if,there,was,anything,really,exciting,going,on,in,charleston,she'd,learn,about,it,from,rhett,next,time,he,came,home,[END]
being,interested,in,his,folks,and,the,place,he'd,grown,up,would,be,a,proof,to,him,that,she,loved,him,no,matter,what,he,might,believe,[END]
how,often,she,wondered,was,often,enough,to,keep,down,gossip,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,get,to,sleep,that,night,[END]
every,time,she,closed,her,eyes,she,saw,the,wide,front,door,of,aunt,pitty's,house,closed,and,bolted,against,her,[END]
it,was,india's,doing,she,told,herself,[END]
uncle,henry,couldn't,possibly,be,right,that,every,door,in,atlanta,was,going,to,be,closed,[END]
but,she,hadn't,thought,he,was,right,about,the,panic,either,[END]
not,until,she,read,the,newspapers,and,then,she,discovered,it,was,even,worse,than,he'd,told,her,[END]
insomnia,was,no,stranger,to,her,she'd,learned,years,before,that,two,or,three,brandies,would,calm,her,down,and,help,her,sleep,[END]
she,padded,silently,downstairs,and,to,the,dining,room,sideboard,[END]
the,cut-glass,decanter,flashed,rainbows,from,the,light,of,the,lamp,she,held,in,her,hand,[END]
the,next,morning,she,slept,later,than,usual,[END]
not,because,of,the,brandy,but,because,even,with,its,aid,she'd,been,unable,to,sleep,until,just,before,dawn,[END]
she,couldn't,stop,worrying,about,what,uncle,henry,had,said,[END]
on,her,way,down,to,the,store,she,stopped,in,at,mrs,merriwether's,bakery,[END]
the,clerk,behind,the,counter,looked,through,her,and,turned,a,deaf,ear,when,she,spoke,[END]
she,treated,me,like,i,didn't,even,exist,she,realized,with,horror,[END]
as,she,crossed,the,sidewalk,from,the,shop,to,her,carriage,she,saw,mrs,elsing,and,her,daughter,approaching,on,foot,[END]
scarlett,paused,ready,to,smile,and,say,hello,[END]
the,two,elsing,ladies,stopped,dead,when,they,saw,her,then,without,a,word,or,a,second,look,turned,and,walked,away,[END]
scarlett,was,paralyzed,for,a,moment,[END]
then,she,scurried,into,her,carriage,and,hid,her,face,in,the,shadowy,corner,of,the,deep,enclosure,[END]
for,one,horrible,instant,she,was,afraid,she,was,going,to,be,sick,all,over,the,floor,[END]
when,elias,stopped,the,carriage,in,front,of,the,store,scarlett,stayed,in,the,sanctuary,of,her,carriage,[END]
she,sent,elias,inside,with,the,clerks',pay,envelopes,[END]
if,she,got,out,she,might,see,someone,she,knew,someone,who,would,cut,her,dead,[END]
it,was,unbearable,even,to,think,of,it,[END]
india,wilkes,must,be,behind,this,[END]
and,after,i,was,so,generous,with,her,too,[END]
i,won't,let,her,get,away,with,it,i,won't,[END]
nobody,can,treat,me,this,way,and,get,away,with,it,[END]
go,to,the,lumberyard,she,ordered,elias,when,he,returned,[END]
she'd,tell,ashley,[END]
he'd,have,to,do,something,to,stop,india's,poison,[END]
ashley,wouldn't,stand,for,it,he'd,make,india,behave,and,all,india's,friends,too,[END]
her,already,heavy,heart,sank,even,lower,when,she,saw,the,lumberyard,[END]
it,was,too,full,[END]
stacks,and,stacks,of,pine,boards,were,golden,and,sweetly,resinous,in,the,autumn,sun,[END]
there,wasn't,a,wagon,to,be,seen,or,a,loader,[END]
nobody,was,buying,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,cry,[END]
uncle,henry,said,this,would,happen,but,i,never,thought,it,could,be,this,bad,[END]
how,could,people,not,want,that,beautiful,clean,lumber,[END]
she,inhaled,deeply,[END]
fresh-cut,pine,was,the,sweetest,perfume,in,the,world,to,her,[END]
oh,how,she,missed,the,lumber,business,she,would,never,understand,how,she'd,let,rhett,trick,her,into,selling,it,to,ashley,[END]
if,she,was,still,running,it,this,would,never,have,happened,[END]
she,would,have,sold,the,lumber,somehow,to,someone,[END]
panic,touched,the,edge,of,her,mind,and,she,pushed,it,away,[END]
things,were,awful,all,around,but,she,mustn't,fuss,at,ashley,[END]
she,wanted,him,to,help,her,[END]
the,yard,looks,wonderful,[END]
she,said,brightly,[END]
you,must,have,the,sawmill,running,day,and,night,to,keep,such,a,good,stock,up,ashley,[END]
he,looked,up,from,the,account,books,on,his,desk,and,scarlett,knew,that,all,the,cheerfulness,in,the,world,would,be,wasted,on,him,[END]
he,looked,no,better,than,when,she'd,given,him,the,talking-to,[END]
he,stood,tried,to,smile,[END]
his,ingrained,courtesy,was,stronger,than,his,exhaustion,but,his,despair,was,greater,than,both,[END]
i,can't,tell,him,anything,about,india,scarlett,thought,or,about,the,business,either,[END]
he's,got,all,he,can,bear,just,making,himself,draw,the,next,breath,[END]
it's,like,there's,nothing,holding,him,together,but,his,clothes,[END]
scarlett,dear,how,kind,of,you,to,stop,by,[END]
won't,you,sit,down,[END]
kind,is,it,[END]
god's,nightgown,[END]
ashley,sounds,like,a,wind-up,music,box,of,polite,things,to,say,[END]
no,he,doesn't,[END]
he,sounds,like,he,doesn't,know,what's,coming,out,of,his,mouth,and,i,reckon,that's,closer,to,the,truth,[END]
why,should,he,care,that,i'm,chancing,whatever's,left,of,my,reputation,by,coming,here,without,a,chaperone,[END]
he,doesn't,care,anything,about,himself,any,fool,could,see,that,why,should,he,care,anything,about,me,[END]
i,can't,sit,down,and,make,polite,conversation,i,can't,stand,it,[END]
but,i,have,to,[END]
thank,you,ashley,she,said,and,sat,on,the,chair,he,was,holding,[END]
she,would,force,herself,to,stay,for,fifteen,minutes,and,make,empty,lively,remarks,about,the,weather,tell,amusing,stories,about,what,a,good,time,she'd,had,at,tara,[END]
she,couldn't,tell,him,about,mammy,it,would,upset,him,too,much,[END]
tony,coming,home,though,that,was,different,[END]
it,was,good,news,[END]
scarlett,started,to,speak,[END]
i've,been,down,to,tara,[END]
why,did,you,stop,me,scarlett,[END]
said,ashley,[END]
his,voice,was,flat,lifeless,devoid,of,real,questioning,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,think,what,to,say,[END]
why,did,you,stop,me,[END]
he,asked,again,and,this,time,there,was,emotion,in,the,words,anger,betrayal,pain,[END]
i,wanted,to,be,in,the,grave,[END]
any,grave,not,just,melanie's,[END]
it's,the,only,thing,i'm,fit,for,[END]
no,don't,say,whatever,you,were,going,to,say,scarlett,[END]
i've,been,comforted,and,boosted,up,by,so,many,well-meaning,people,that,i've,heard,it,all,a,hundred,times,over,[END]
i,expect,better,of,you,than,the,usual,platitudes,[END]
i'll,be,grateful,if,you'll,say,what,you,must,be,thinking,that,i'm,letting,the,lumber,business,die,[END]
your,lumber,business,that,you,invested,all,your,heart,in,[END]
i'm,a,miserable,failure,scarlett,[END]
you,know,it,[END]
i,know,it,[END]
the,whole,world,knows,it,[END]
why,do,we,all,have,to,act,as,though,it,isn't,so,[END]
blame,me,why,don't,you,[END]
you,can't,possibly,find,any,words,harsher,than,those,i,say,to,myself,you,can't,hurt,my,feelings,',[END]
god,how,i,hate,that,phrase,[END]
as,if,i,had,any,feelings,left,to,hurt,[END]
as,if,i,could,feel,anything,at,all,[END]
ashley,shook,his,head,with,slow,heavy,swings,from,side,to,side,[END]
he,was,like,a,mortally,wounded,animal,brought,down,by,a,pack,of,predators,[END]
from,his,throat,burst,one,tearing,sob,and,he,turned,away,[END]
forgive,me,scarlett,i,beg,of,you,[END]
i,had,no,right,to,burden,you,with,my,troubles,[END]
now,i,have,the,shame,of,this,outburst,to,add,to,my,other,shames,[END]
be,merciful,my,dear,and,leave,me,[END]
i,will,be,grateful,if,you,will,go,now,[END]
scarlett,fled,without,a,word,[END]
later,she,sat,at,her,desk,with,all,her,legal,records,neatly,stacked,in,front,of,her,[END]
it,was,going,to,be,even,harder,to,keep,her,promise,to,melly,than,she'd,expected,[END]
clothing,and,household,goods,weren't,nearly,enough,[END]
ashley,wouldn't,lift,a,finger,to,help,himself,[END]
she,was,going,to,have,to,make,him,successful,whether,he,cooperated,or,not,[END]
she'd,promised,melanie,[END]
and,she,couldn't,bear,to,see,the,business,she,had,built,go,under,[END]
scarlett,made,a,list,of,her,assets,[END]
the,store,building,and,trade,[END]
it,produced,nearly,a,hundred,a,month,in,profits,but,that,would,almost,certainly,go,down,some,when,the,panic,got,to,atlanta,and,people,had,no,money,to,spend,[END]
she,made,a,note,to,order,more,cheap,goods,and,stop,replacing,luxury,items,like,wide,velvet,ribbon,[END]
the,saloon,on,her,lot,near,the,depot,[END]
she,didn't,actually,own,it,she,leased,the,land,and,building,to,the,man,who,did,for,thirty,dollars,a,month,[END]
people,would,likely,be,drinking,more,than,ever,when,times,got,hard,maybe,she,should,raise,the,rent,[END]
but,a,few,more,dollars,a,month,wouldn't,be,enough,to,bail,out,ashley,[END]
she,needed,real,money,[END]
the,gold,in,her,safe,box,[END]
she,had,real,money,more,than,twenty-five,thousand,dollars,of,real,money,[END]
she,was,a,wealthy,woman,in,her,own,right,by,most,people's,reckoning,[END]
but,not,by,hers,[END]
she,still,didn't,feel,safe,[END]
i,could,buy,the,business,back,from,ashley,she,thought,and,for,a,moment,her,mind,hummed,with,excitement,with,possibilities,[END]
then,she,sighed,[END]
that,wouldn't,solve,anything,[END]
ashley,was,such,a,fool,he'd,insist,on,taking,only,what,he,could,get,on,the,open,market,and,that,was,hardly,anything,[END]
then,when,she,made,a,success,of,the,business,he'd,feel,like,more,of,a,failure,than,ever,[END]
no,no,matter,how,much,she,would,love,to,get,her,hands,on,that,lumberyard,and,the,sawmills,she,had,to,make,ashley,successful,at,it,[END]
i,just,don't,believe,that,there's,no,market,for,lumber,[END]
panic,or,no,panic,people,have,got,to,be,building,something,if,it's,only,a,shed,for,a,cow,or,a,horse,[END]
scarlett,riffled,through,the,stack,of,books,and,papers,[END]
she'd,had,an,idea,[END]
there,it,was,the,plot,of,the,farmland,charles,hamilton,left,her,[END]
the,farms,produced,almost,no,income,at,all,[END]
what,good,did,a,couple,of,baskets,of,corn,and,a,single,bale,of,seedy,cotton,do,her,[END]
sharecropping,was,a,waste,of,good,land,unless,you,had,about,a,thousand,acres,and,a,dozen,good,farmers,[END]
but,her,hundred,acres,were,right,on,the,edge,of,atlanta,now,the,way,things,were,growing,[END]
if,she,could,find,a,good,builder,and,they,must,all,be,feeling,mighty,hungry,for,work,she,could,put,up,a,hundred,gim-crack,houses,maybe,two,hundred,[END]
everybody,who,was,losing,money,was,going,to,have,to,draw,in,their,horns,and,live,closer,to,the,bone,[END]
their,big,houses,would,be,the,first,thing,to,go,and,they'd,have,to,find,someplace,they,could,afford,to,live,[END]
i,won't,make,any,money,but,at,least,i,won't,be,losing,much,[END]
and,i'll,see,to,it,that,the,builder,uses,only,lumber,from,ashley,and,the,best,he's,got,too,[END]
he'll,be,making,money,not,a,fortune,but,good,steady,income,and,he'll,never,know,it,came,from,me,[END]
i,can,manage,that,somehow,[END]
all,i,need,is,a,builder,who,can,keep,his,mouth,shut,[END]
and,not,steal,too,much,[END]
the,following,day,scarlett,drove,out,to,give,the,sharecropping,farmers,notice,to,vacate,[END]
7,[END]
yes,ma'am,mrs,butler,i'm,hungry,for,work,all,right,said,joe,colleton,[END]
the,builder,was,a,short,lean,man,in,his,forties,he,looked,much,older,because,his,big,hair,was,snow,white,and,his,face,was,leathered,by,long,exposure,to,the,sun,and,the,weather,[END]
he,was,frowning,and,the,deep,creases,in,his,brow,shadowed,his,dark,eyes,[END]
i,need,work,but,not,bad,enough,to,work,for,you,[END]
scarlett,almost,turned,on,her,heel,to,leave,she,didn't,have,to,swallow,insults,from,some,jumped-up,poor,white,[END]
but,she,needed,colleton,[END]
he,was,the,only,honest-to-the-bone,builder,in,atlanta,she'd,learned,that,when,she,was,selling,lumber,to,them,all,in,the,boom,years,of,rebuilding,after,the,war,[END]
she,felt,like,stamping,her,foot,[END]
it,was,all,melly's,fault,[END]
if,it,hadn't,been,for,that,silly,condition,that,ashley,mustn't,know,she,was,helping,him,she,could,have,used,any,builder,at,all,because,she,would,watch,him,like,a,hawk,and,oversee,every,part,of,the,work,herself,[END]
how,she'd,love,to,do,it,too,[END]
but,she,couldn't,be,seen,to,be,involved,[END]
and,she,couldn't,trust,anyone,except,colleton,[END]
he,had,to,agree,to,take,the,job,she,had,to,make,him,agree,[END]
she,put,her,small,hand,on,his,arm,[END]
it,looked,very,delicate,in,its,tight,kid,glove,[END]
mr,colleton,it'll,break,my,heart,if,you,say,no,to,me,[END]
i,need,somebody,very,special,to,help,me,[END]
she,looked,at,him,with,appealing,helplessness,in,her,eyes,[END]
too,bad,he,wasn't,taller,[END]
it,was,hard,to,be,a,frail,little,lady,with,somebody,your,own,size,[END]
still,it,was,often,these,banty,rooster,little,men,who,were,most,protective,of,women,[END]
i,don't,know,what,i'll,do,if,you,turn,me,down,[END]
colleton's,arm,stiffened,[END]
mrs,butler,you,sold,me,green,lumber,once,after,you,told,me,it,was,cured,[END]
i,don't,do,business,twice,with,somebody,that,cheats,me,once,[END]
that,must,have,been,a,mistake,mr,colleton,[END]
i,was,green,myself,just,learning,the,lumber,business,[END]
you,remember,how,it,was,those,days,[END]
the,yankees,were,breathing,down,our,necks,every,waking,minute,[END]
i,was,scared,to,death,all,the,time,[END]
her,eyes,swam,in,unshed,tears,and,her,very,lightly,rouged,lips,trembled,[END]
she,was,a,small,forlorn,figure,[END]
my,husband,mr,kennedy,was,killed,when,the,yankees,broke,up,a,klan,meeting,[END]
colleton's,direct,knowing,gaze,was,disconcerting,[END]
his,eyes,were,on,a,level,with,hers,and,they,were,as,hard,as,marble,[END]
scarlett,took,her,hand,off,his,sleeve,[END]
what,was,she,going,to,do,[END]
she,couldn't,fail,not,in,this,[END]
he,had,to,take,the,job,[END]
i,made,a,deathbed,promise,to,my,dearest,friend,mr,[END]
colleton,[END]
her,tears,were,unplanned,now,[END]
mrs,wilkes,asked,me,to,help,and,now,i'm,asking,you,[END]
the,whole,story,tumbled,out,how,melanie,had,always,sheltered,ashley,[END]
ashley's,ineptness,as,a,businessman,[END]
his,attempt,to,bury,himself,with,his,wife,[END]
the,stacks,of,unsold,lumber,[END]
the,need,for,secrecy,[END]
colleton,held,up,his,hand,to,stop,her,[END]
all,right,mrs,butler,[END]
if,it's,for,mrs,wilkes,i'll,take,the,job,[END]
his,hand,dropped,extended,[END]
i'll,shake,on,it,you'll,get,the,best-built,houses,with,the,best,materials,in,them,[END]
scarlett,put,her,hand,in,his,[END]
thank,you,she,said,[END]
she,felt,as,if,she'd,scored,the,triumph,of,her,life,[END]
it,was,only,some,hours,later,that,she,remembered,that,she,hadn't,intended,to,use,the,best,of,everything,only,the,best,lumber,[END]
the,miserable,houses,were,going,to,cost,her,a,fortune,and,out,of,her,own,hard-earned,money,too,[END]
she,wouldn't,get,any,credit,for,helping,ashley,either,[END]
everybody,would,still,slam,their,doors,in,her,face,[END]
not,really,everybody,[END]
i've,got,plenty,of,my,own,friends,and,they're,a,lot,more,fun,than,those,frumpy,old,atlanta,people,[END]
scarlett,put,aside,the,sketch,joe,colleton,had,made,on,a,paper,sack,for,her,to,study,and,approve,[END]
she'd,be,a,lot,more,interested,when,he,gave,her,the,numbers,for,his,estimate,what,difference,did,it,make,what,the,houses,looked,like,or,where,he,put,the,stairs,[END]
she,took,her,velvet-covered,visiting,book,from,a,drawer,and,again,to,make,a,list,[END]
she,was,going,to,give,a,party,[END]
a,big,one,with,musicians,and,rivers,of,champagne,and,huge,amounts,of,the,best,most,expensive,food,[END]
now,that,she,was,done,with,deep,mourning,it,was,time,to,let,her,friends,know,that,she,could,be,invited,to,their,parties,and,the,best,way,to,do,it,was,to,invite,them,to,a,party,of,her,own,[END]
her,eye,skimmed,quickly,past,the,names,of,atlanta's,old,families,[END]
they,all,think,i,should,be,in,deep,mourning,for,melly,no,sense,asking,them,[END]
and,there's,no,need,to,wrap,myself,in,crape,either,[END]
she,wasn't,my,sister,only,my,sister-in-law,and,i'm,not,even,sure,that,counts,since,charles,hamilton,was,my,first,husband,and,there've,been,two,since,him,[END]
scarlett's,shoulders,slumped,[END]
charles,hamilton,had,nothing,to,do,with,anything,nor,did,wearing,crape,[END]
she,was,in,the,truest,kind,of,mourning,for,melanie,it,was,a,perpetual,weight,and,worry,in,her,heart,[END]
she,missed,the,gentle,loving,friend,who,had,been,so,much,more,important,to,her,than,she,had,ever,realized,the,world,was,colder,and,darker,without,melanie,[END]
and,so,lonely,[END]
scarlett,had,been,back,from,the,country,for,only,two,days,but,she,had,known,enough,loneliness,in,the,two,nights,to,strike,fear,deep,into,her,heart,[END]
she,could,have,told,melanie,about,rhett,leaving,melanie,was,the,only,person,she,could,ever,confide,in,about,such,a,disgraceful,thing,[END]
melly,would,have,told,her,what,she,needed,to,hear,too,[END]
of,course,he'll,be,back,she,would,have,said,he,loves,you,so,[END]
those,were,her,very,words,right,before,she,died,[END]
be,kind,to,captain,butler,he,loves,you,so,[END]
just,the,thought,of,melanie's,words,made,scarlett,feel,better,[END]
if,melly,said,that,rhett,loved,her,then,he,did,it,wasn't,only,her,own,wishful,thinking,[END]
scarlett,shook,off,her,gloominess,straightened,her,spine,[END]
she,didn't,have,to,be,lonely,at,all,[END]
and,it,didn't,matter,if,atlanta's,old,guard,never,spoke,to,her,again,ever,[END]
she,had,plenty,of,friends,[END]
why,the,party,list,was,already,two,pages,long,and,she,was,only,up,to,letter,l,in,her,book,[END]
the,friends,scarlett,was,planning,to,entertain,were,the,most,flamboyant,and,most,successful,of,the,horde,of,scavengers,that,had,descended,on,georgia,in,the,days,of,the,reconstruction,government,[END]
many,of,the,original,group,had,left,when,the,government,was,ousted,in,1871,but,a,large,number,stayed,to,enjoy,their,big,houses,and,the,tremendous,fortunes,they,had,made,picking,the,bones,of,the,dead,confederacy,[END]
they,had,no,temptation,to,go,home,[END]
their,origins,were,better,forgotten,[END]
rhett,had,always,despised,them,[END]
he,dubbed,them,the,dregs,and,left,the,house,when,scarlett,gave,her,lavish,parties,[END]
scarlett,thought,he,was,silly,and,told,him,so,[END]
rich,people,are,ever,so,much,more,fun,than,poor,people,[END]
their,clothes,and,carriages,and,jewels,are,better,and,they,give,you,better,things,to,eat,and,drink,when,you,go,to,their,houses,[END]
but,nothing,at,the,houses,of,any,of,her,friends,was,nearly,as,elegant,as,the,refreshments,at,scarlett's,parties,[END]
this,one,she,was,determined,would,be,the,best,reception,of,all,[END]
she,started,a,second,list,headed,things,to,remember,with,a,note,to,order,ice,swans,for,the,cold,foods,and,ten,new,cases,of,champagne,[END]
a,new,gown,too,[END]
she'd,have,to,go,to,her,dressmaker's,place,immediately,after,she,left,the,order,for,the,invitations,at,the,engraver's,[END]
scarlett,tilted,her,head,to,admire,the,crisp,white,ruffles,of,the,mary,stuart,style,cap,[END]
the,point,on,the,forehead,was,really,very,becoming,[END]
it,emphasized,the,black,arch,of,her,eyebrows,and,the,shining,green,of,her,eyes,[END]
her,hair,looked,like,black,silk,where,it,tumbled,in,curls,on,each,side,of,the,ruffles,[END]
who,would,ever,have,thought,that,mourning,garb,could,be,so,flattering,[END]
she,turned,from,side,to,side,looking,over,her,shoulders,at,her,reflection,in,the,pier,glass,[END]
the,jet,bead,trim,and,tassels,on,her,black,gown,glittered,in,a,very,satisfactory,way,[END]
ordinary,mourning,wasn't,awful,like,deep,mourning,there,was,plenty,of,leeway,in,it,if,you,had,magnolia-white,skin,to,show,in,a,low-cut,black,gown,[END]
she,walked,quickly,to,her,dressing,table,and,touched,her,shoulders,and,throat,with,perfume,[END]
she'd,better,hurry,her,guests,would,be,arriving,any,minute,[END]
she,could,hear,the,musicians,tuning,up,downstairs,[END]
her,eyes,feasted,on,the,disorderly,pile,of,thick,white,cards,among,her,silver-backed,brushes,and,hand,mirrors,[END]
invitations,had,started,pouring,in,as,soon,as,her,friends,knew,that,she,was,reentering,the,social,whirl,she,was,going,to,be,busy,for,weeks,and,weeks,to,come,[END]
and,then,there'd,be,more,invitations,and,then,she'd,give,another,reception,[END]
or,maybe,a,dance,during,the,christmas,season,[END]
yes,things,were,going,to,be,just,fine,[END]
she,was,as,excited,as,a,girl,who'd,never,been,to,a,party,before,[END]
well,it,was,no,wonder,[END]
it,had,been,more,than,seven,months,since,she'd,been,to,one,[END]
except,for,tony,fontaine's,coming-home,[END]
she,smiled,remembering,[END]
darling,tony,with,his,shy-heeled,boots,and,silver,saddle,[END]
she,wished,he,could,be,at,her,party,tonight,[END]
wouldn't,people's,eyes,pop,right,out,of,their,heads,if,he,did,his,trick,of,twirling,his,six-shooters,[END]
she,had,to,go,the,musicians,were,playing,in,tune,it,must,be,late,[END]
scarlett,hurried,down,the,red-carpeted,stairs,sniffing,appreciatively,when,she,reached,the,scent,of,the,hot-house,flowers,that,filled,huge,vases,in,every,room,[END]
her,eyes,glowed,with,pleasure,when,she,moved,from,room,to,room,to,check,that,everything,was,ready,[END]
all,was,perfection,[END]
thank,heaven,pansy,was,back,from,tara,[END]
she,was,very,good,at,making,the,other,servants,do,their,jobs,much,better,than,the,new,butler,hired,to,replace,pork,[END]
scarlett,took,a,glass,of,champagne,from,the,tray,the,new,man,held,out,to,her,[END]
at,least,he,was,good,at,serving,quite,stylish,in,fact,and,scarlett,did,so,like,for,things,to,be,stylish,[END]
just,then,the,doorbell,sounded,[END]
she,startled,the,manservant,by,smiling,happily,then,she,moved,towards,the,entrance,hall,to,greet,her,friends,[END]
they,arrived,in,a,steady,stream,for,almost,an,hour,and,the,house,filled,with,the,sound,of,loud,voices,the,overpowering,smell,of,perfume,and,powder,the,brilliant,colors,of,silks,and,satins,rubies,and,sapphires,[END]
scarlett,moved,through,the,melée,smiling,and,laughing,flirting,idly,with,the,men,accepting,the,fulsome,compliments,of,the,women,[END]
they,were,so,happy,to,see,her,again,they'd,missed,her,so,much,no,one's,parties,were,as,exciting,as,hers,no,one's,home,as,beautiful,no,one's,gown,as,fashionable,no,one's,hair,as,glossy,no,one's,figure,as,youthful,no,one's,complexion,so,perfect,and,creamy,[END]
i'm,having,a,good,time,[END]
it's,a,wonderful,party,[END]
she,glanced,over,the,silver,dishes,and,trays,on,the,long,polished,table,to,see,that,the,servants,were,keeping,them,all,replenished,[END]
quantities,of,food,excesses,of,food,were,important,to,her,for,she,would,never,forget,completely,what,it,had,been,like,to,come,so,near,to,starvation,at,the,end,of,the,war,[END]
her,friend,mamie,bart,caught,her,eye,and,smiled,[END]

scarlett,turned,away,in,disgust,[END]

you,must,have,found,some,elixir,harry,you,look,ten,years,younger,than,you,did,last,time,i,saw,you,[END]

his,face,turned,red,then,faintly,purple,before,he,abandoned,the,effort,to,hold,it,in,[END]
scarlett,laughed,aloud,then,moved,away,[END]
a,burst,of,laughter,caught,her,attention,and,she,drifted,towards,the,trio,of,men,who,were,its,source,[END]
she'd,like,very,much,to,hear,something,funny,even,if,it,was,one,of,those,jokes,that,ladies,had,to,pretend,not,to,understand,[END]
so,i,says,to,myself,bill,one,man's,panic,is,another,man's,profit,and,i,know,which,one,of,those,men,old,bill's,going,to,be,',[END]
scarlett,started,to,turn,away,[END]
she,wanted,to,have,a,good,time,tonight,and,talking,about,the,panic,wasn't,her,idea,of,fun,[END]
still,maybe,she'd,learn,something,[END]
she,was,smarter,when,she,was,sound,asleep,than,bill,weller,was,on,his,best,day,she,was,sure,of,that,[END]
if,he,was,making,money,out,of,the,panic,she,wanted,to,know,how,he,was,doing,it,[END]
quietly,she,stepped,closer,[END]
these,dumb,southerners,they,been,a,problem,for,me,ever,since,i,come,down,here,bill,was,confessing,[END]
you,just,can't,do,nothing,with,a,man,who,don't,have,natural,human,greed,so,all,the,triple-your-money,bond,deals,and,certificates,for,gold,mines,that,i,turned,loose,on,them,laid,a,big,egg,[END]
they,was,working,harder,than,any,nigger,ever,did,and,putting,by,every,nickel,they,earned,for,the,next,rainy,day,[END]

from,the,confederate,government,[END]
bill's,booming,laugh,led,the,laughter,of,the,other,men,[END]
scarlett,was,fuming,[END]
dumb,southerners,indeed,[END]
her,own,darling,pa,had,a,boxful,of,confederate,bonds,[END]
so,did,all,the,good,people,in,clayton,county,[END]
she,tried,to,walk,away,but,she,was,hemmed,in,by,people,behind,her,who'd,also,been,attracted,by,the,laughter,in,the,group,around,bill,weller,[END]
i,got,the,picture,after,a,while,weller,went,on,[END]
they,just,didn't,put,much,trust,in,paper,[END]
nor,nothing,else,that,i,tried,neither,[END]
i,sent,out,medicine,shows,and,lightning,rods,and,all,the,sure-fire,money-makers,but,none,of,them,so,much,as,struck,a,spark,[END]
i,tell,you,boys,it,hurt,my,pride,[END]
he,made,a,lugubrious,face,then,grinned,widely,showing,three,large,gold,molars,[END]
i,don't,have,to,tell,you,that,me,and,lula,wasn't,exactly,going,to,go,wanting,if,i,didn't,come,up,with,something,[END]
in,the,good,fat,days,when,the,republicans,had,georgia,in,hand,i,piled,up,enough,from,those,railroad,contracts,the,boys,voted,me,so,that,we,could,have,lived,high,on,the,hog,even,if,i'd,been,fool,enough,to,actually,go,out,and,build,the,railroads,[END]
but,i,like,to,keep,my,hand,in,and,lula,was,starting,to,fret,because,i,was,around,the,house,too,much,not,having,any,business,to,tend,to,[END]
then,glory,be,along,come,the,panic,and,all,the,rebs,grabbed,their,savings,out,of,the,banks,and,put,the,money,in,their,mattresses,[END]
every,house,even,the,shacks,was,a,golden,opportunity,i,just,couldn't,let,pass,me,by,[END]

amos,bart,punctuated,his,impatience,with,a,practiced,spit,that,fell,short,of,its,targeted,spittoon,[END]
scarlett,was,feeling,impatient,too,[END]
impatient,to,get,away,[END]
keep,your,shirt,on,amos,i'm,coming,to,it,[END]
what,was,the,way,to,get,in,those,mattresses,[END]
i,ain't,the,revival-preacher,kind,i,like,to,sit,behind,my,desk,and,let,my,employees,do,the,hustling,[END]
that's,just,what,i,was,doing,sitting,in,my,leather,swivel,chair,when,i,looked,out,my,window,and,saw,a,funeral,going,by,[END]
it,was,like,lightning,striking,[END]
there,ain't,a,roof,in,georgia,that,don't,have,some,dearly,departed,once,lived,under,it,[END]
scarlett,stared,with,horror,at,bill,weller,as,he,described,the,fraud,that,was,adding,to,his,riches,[END]
the,mothers,and,widows,are,the,easiest,and,there's,more,of,them,than,anything,else,[END]
they,don't,blink,an,eye,when,my,boys,tell,them,that,the,confederate,veterans,are,putting,up,monuments,on,all,the,battlefields,and,they,empty,out,those,mattresses,quicker,than,you,can,say,abe,lincoln',to,pay,for,their,boy's,name,to,be,carved,in,the,marble,[END]
it,was,worse,than,scarlett,could,have,imagined,[END]
you,sly,old,fox,bill,that's,pure,genius,[END]
amos,exclaimed,and,the,men,in,the,group,laughed,more,loudly,than,before,[END]
scarlett,felt,as,if,she,were,going,to,be,sick,[END]
nonexistent,railroads,and,gold,mines,had,never,concerned,her,but,the,mothers,and,widows,bill,weller,was,cheating,were,her,own,people,[END]
he,might,be,sending,his,men,right,now,to,beatrice,tarleton,or,cathleen,calvert,or,dimity,munroe,or,any,other,woman,in,clayton,county,who,had,lost,a,son,or,a,brother,or,a,husband,[END]
her,voice,cut,through,the,laughter,like,a,knife,[END]
that's,the,most,low-down,filthy,story,i,ever,heard,in,my,life,[END]
you,disgust,me,bill,weller,[END]
all,of,you,disgust,me,[END]
what,do,you,know,about,southerners,about,decent,people,anywhere,[END]
you've,never,had,a,decent,thought,or,done,a,decent,thing,in,all,your,lives,[END]
she,pushed,with,hands,outstretched,through,the,thunderstruck,men,and,women,who,had,gathered,around,weller,then,ran,rubbing,her,hands,on,her,skirts,to,wipe,off,the,stain,of,having,touched,them,[END]
the,dining,room,and,the,glittering,silver,dishes,of,elaborate,food,were,in,front,of,her,her,gorge,rose,at,the,mixed,smells,of,rich,greasy,sauces,and,spattered,spittoons,[END]
she,saw,in,her,mind,the,lamplit,table,at,the,fontaines',the,simple,meal,of,home-cured,ham,and,home-made,corn,bread,and,home-grown,greens,[END]
she,belonged,with,them,they,were,her,people,not,these,vulgar,trashy,flashy,women,and,men,[END]
scarlett,turned,to,face,weller,and,his,group,[END]
dregs,[END]
she,yelled,[END]
that's,what,you,are,[END]
dregs,[END]
get,out,of,my,house,get,out,of,my,sight,you,make,me,sick,[END]
mamie,bart,made,the,mistake,of,trying,to,soothe,her,[END]
come,on,honey,she,said,holding,out,her,jewelled,hand,[END]
scarlett,recoiled,before,she,could,be,touched,[END]
especially,you,you,greasy,sow,[END]
well,i,never,mamie,bart's,voice,quavered,[END]
i'm,damn,well,not,going,to,put,up,with,being,talked,to,like,this,[END]
i,wouldn't,stay,if,you,begged,me,on,your,knees,scarlett,butler,[END]
a,shoving,angry,stampede,began,and,in,less,than,ten,minutes,the,rooms,were,empty,of,everything,except,the,debris,left,behind,[END]
scarlett,made,her,way,through,spilled,food,and,champagne,broken,plates,and,glasses,without,looking,down,[END]
she,must,keep,her,head,high,the,way,her,mother,had,taught,her,[END]
she,imagined,that,she,was,back,at,tara,with,a,heavy,volume,of,the,waverley,novels,balanced,on,her,head,and,she,climbed,the,stairs,with,her,back,as,straight,as,a,tree,her,chin,perfectly,perpendicular,to,her,shoulders,[END]
like,a,lady,[END]
the,way,her,mother,had,taught,her,[END]
her,head,was,swimming,and,her,legs,trembled,but,she,climbed,without,pausing,[END]
a,lady,never,let,it,show,when,she,was,tired,or,upset,[END]
high,time,she,did,that,and,then,some,said,the,cornetist,[END]
the,octet,had,played,waltzes,from,behind,the,palms,for,many,of,scarlett's,receptions,[END]
one,of,the,violinists,spat,accurately,into,a,potted,palm,[END]
too,late,i,say,[END]
lie,down,with,dogs,get,up,with,fleas,[END]
above,their,heads,scarlett,was,lying,face,down,on,her,silkcovered,bed,sobbing,as,if,her,heart,was,broken,[END]
she,had,thought,she,was,going,to,have,such,a,good,time,[END]
later,that,night,when,the,house,was,quiet,and,dark,scarlett,went,downstairs,for,a,drink,to,help,her,sleep,[END]
all,evidence,of,the,party,was,gone,except,for,the,elaborate,flower,arrangements,and,the,half-burned,candles,in,the,six-armed,candelabra,on,the,bare,dining,room,table,[END]
scarlett,lit,the,candles,and,blew,out,her,lamp,[END]
why,should,she,skulk,around,in,near-darkness,like,some,kind,of,thief,[END]
it,was,her,house,her,brandy,and,she,could,do,as,she,pleased,[END]
she,selected,a,glass,took,it,and,the,decanter,to,the,table,sat,in,the,armchair,at,the,head,[END]
it,was,her,table,too,[END]
the,brandy,sent,a,relaxing,warmth,through,her,body,[END]
scarlett,sighed,[END]
thank,god,[END]
another,drink,and,my,nerves,should,stop,jumping,around,like,they're,doing,[END]
she,filled,the,elegant,little,cordial,glass,again,tossed,the,brandy,down,her,throat,with,a,deft,twist,of,the,wrist,[END]
mustn't,hurry,she,thought,pouring,[END]
it's,not,ladylike,[END]
she,sipped,her,third,drink,[END]
how,pretty,the,candlelight,was,lovely,golden,flames,reflected,in,the,polished,tabletop,[END]
the,empty,glass,was,pretty,too,[END]
its,cut,facets,made,rainbows,when,she,turned,it,in,her,fingers,[END]
it,was,as,quiet,as,the,grave,[END]
the,clink,of,glass,against,glass,made,her,jump,when,she,poured,the,brandy,[END]
that,proved,she,needed,the,drink,didn't,it,[END]
she,was,still,too,jumpy,to,sleep,[END]
the,candles,burned,low,and,the,decanter,slowly,emptied,and,scarlett's,usual,control,over,her,mind,and,memory,was,loosened,[END]
this,was,the,room,where,it,had,all,begun,[END]
the,table,had,been,bare,like,this,with,only,candles,on,it,and,the,silver,tray,that,held,brandy,decanter,and,glasses,[END]
rhett,was,drunk,[END]
she'd,never,seen,him,really,drunk,like,that,he,could,always,hold,his,liquor,[END]
he,was,drunk,that,night,though,and,cruel,[END]
he,said,such,horrible,hurting,things,to,her,and,he,twisted,her,arm,so,that,she,cried,out,in,pain,[END]
but,then,[END]
then,he,carried,her,up,to,her,room,and,forced,himself,on,her,[END]
except,that,he,didn't,have,to,force,her,to,accept,him,[END]
she,came,alive,when,he,handled,her,when,he,kissed,her,lips,and,throat,and,body,[END]
she,burned,at,his,touch,and,she,cried,out,for,more,and,her,body,arched,and,strained,to,meet,his,again,and,again,[END]
it,couldn't,be,true,[END]
she,must,have,dreamed,it,but,how,could,she,have,dreamed,such,things,when,she'd,never,dreamed,they,existed,[END]
no,lady,would,ever,feel,the,wild,wanting,she,had,felt,no,lady,would,do,the,things,she,had,done,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,push,her,thoughts,back,into,the,crowded,dark,corner,of,her,mind,where,she,kept,the,unbearable,and,unthinkable,[END]
but,she'd,had,too,much,to,drink,[END]
it,did,happen,her,heart,cried,it,did,[END]
i,didn't,make,it,up,[END]
and,her,mind,so,carefully,taught,by,her,mother,that,ladies,did,not,have,animal,impulses,could,not,control,the,passionate,demands,of,her,body,to,feel,rapture,and,surrender,again,[END]
scarlett's,hands,held,her,aching,breasts,but,hers,were,not,the,hands,her,body,longed,for,[END]
she,dropped,her,arms,onto,the,table,in,front,of,her,her,head,onto,her,arms,[END]
and,she,abandoned,herself,to,the,waves,of,desire,and,pain,that,made,her,writhe,made,her,call,out,brokenly,into,the,empty,silent,candlelit,room,[END]
rhett,oh,rhett,i,need,you,[END]
8,[END]
winter,was,approaching,and,scarlett,grew,more,frantic,with,every,passing,day,[END]
joe,colleton,had,dug,the,hole,for,the,cellar,of,the,first,house,but,repeated,rains,made,it,impossible,to,pour,the,concrete,foundations,[END]
mr,wilkes,would,smell,a,rat,if,i,bought,lumber,before,i'm,ready,to,frame,he,said,reasonably,and,scarlett,knew,he,was,right,[END]
but,it,made,the,delay,no,less,frustrating,[END]
maybe,the,whole,building,idea,was,a,mistake,[END]
day,after,day,the,newspaper,reported,more,disasters,in,the,business,world,[END]
there,were,soup,kitchens,and,bread,lines,now,in,america's,big,cities,because,thousands,more,people,lost,their,jobs,every,week,when,companies,went,bankrupt,[END]
why,was,she,risking,her,money,now,at,the,worst,possible,time,[END]
why,had,she,made,that,fool,promise,to,melly,[END]
if,only,the,cold,rain,would,stop,[END]
and,the,days,would,stop,getting,shorter,[END]
she,could,keep,busy,in,the,daytime,but,darkness,closed,her,in,the,empty,house,with,only,her,thoughts,for,companions,[END]
and,she,didn't,want,to,think,because,she,could,find,no,answers,to,anything,[END]
how,had,she,gotten,into,this,mess,[END]
she'd,never,deliberately,done,anything,to,turn,people,against,her,why,were,they,all,being,so,hateful,[END]
why,was,it,taking,rhett,so,long,to,come,home,[END]
what,could,she,do,to,make,things,better,[END]
there,had,to,be,something,she,couldn't,go,on,forever,walking,from,room,to,room,in,the,big,house,like,a,pea,rattling,around,in,an,empty,washtub,[END]
she'd,be,glad,to,have,wade,and,ella,come,home,to,keep,her,company,but,suellen,had,written,that,they,were,all,under,quarantine,while,one,child,after,another,went,through,the,long,itchy,torture,of,chicken,pox,[END]
she,could,take,up,with,the,barts,and,all,their,friends,again,[END]
it,didn't,matter,that,she'd,called,mamie,a,sow,her,skin,was,as,thick,as,a,brick,wall,[END]
one,reason,scarlett,had,enjoyed,having,the,dregs,for,friends,was,that,she,could,use,the,rough,side,of,her,tongue,on,them,any,time,she,liked,and,they'd,always,come,crawling,back,for,more,[END]
i,haven't,sunk,to,that,level,thank,god,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,go,crawling,back,to,them,now,that,i,know,what,low,things,they,are,[END]
it's,just,that,it,gets,dark,so,early,and,the,nights,are,so,long,and,i,can't,sleep,like,i,ought,[END]
things,will,get,better,when,the,rain,stops,[END]
when,winter's,over,[END]
when,rhett,comes,home,[END]
at,last,the,weather,turned,to,bright,cold,sunny,days,with,high,wisps,of,cloud,in,brilliant,blue,skies,[END]
colleton,pumped,the,standing,water,out,of,the,hole,he'd,dug,and,the,sharp,wind,dried,the,red,georgia,clay,to,the,hardness,of,brick,[END]
he,ordered,concrete,then,and,lumber,to,make,the,forms,for,casting,the,footings,[END]
scarlett,plunged,into,a,celebration,of,shopping,for,gifts,[END]
it,was,nearly,christmas,[END]
she,bought,dolls,for,ella,and,each,of,suellen's,girls,[END]
baby,dolls,for,the,younger,ones,with,soft,sawdust-stuffed,bodies,and,chubby,porcelain,faces,and,hands,and,feet,[END]
susie,and,ella,had,nearly,identical,lady,dolls,with,cunning,leather,trunks,full,of,beautiful,clothes,[END]
wade,was,a,problem,scarlett,never,knew,what,to,do,about,him,[END]
then,she,remembered,tony,fontaine's,promise,to,teach,him,how,to,twirl,his,six-shooters,and,she,bought,wade,his,own,pair,with,his,initials,carved,in,their,ivory-inlaid,handles,[END]
suellen,was,easy,a,beaded,silk,reticule,that,was,too,fancy,to,use,in,the,country,with,a,twenty,dollar,gold,piece,inside,it,good,anywhere,[END]
will,was,impossible,[END]
scarlett,searched,high,and,low,before,she,gave,up,and,bought,him,another,sheepskin,jacket,like,the,one,she'd,given,him,the,year,before,and,the,year,before,that,[END]
it's,the,thought,that,counts,she,told,herself,firmly,[END]
she,debated,for,a,long,time,before,she,decided,not,to,get,a,present,for,beau,[END]
she,wouldn't,put,it,past,india,to,send,it,back,unopened,[END]
besides,beau,wasn't,lacking,for,anything,she,thought,bitterly,[END]
the,wilkes,account,at,her,store,was,mounting,up,every,week,[END]
she,bought,a,gold,cigar-cutter,for,rhett,but,she,lacked,the,nerve,to,send,it,[END]
instead,she,made,her,gifts,to,her,two,aunts,in,much,nicer,than,usual,[END]
they,might,tell,rhett's,mother,how,thoughtful,she,was,and,mrs,butler,might,tell,rhett,[END]
i,wonder,if,he'll,send,me,anything,[END]
or,bring,me,something,[END]
maybe,he'll,come,home,for,christmas,to,keep,gossip,down,[END]
the,possibility,was,real,enough,to,send,scarlett,into,a,happy,frenzy,of,decorating,the,house,[END]
when,it,was,a,bower,of,pine,branches,holly,and,ivy,she,took,the,leftovers,down,to,the,store,[END]
we've,always,had,the,tinsel,garland,in,the,window,mrs,butler,[END]
no,need,for,more,than,that,said,willie,kershaw,[END]
don't,tell,me,what's,needed,and,what's,not,[END]
i,say,wrap,this,pine,roping,around,all,the,counters,and,put,the,holly,wreath,on,the,door,[END]
it'll,make,people,feel,christmassy,and,they'll,spend,more,money,on,presents,[END]
we,don't,have,enough,little,pretties,for,gifts,[END]
where's,that,big,box,of,oiled,paper,fans,[END]
you,told,me,to,get,it,out,of,the,way,[END]
said,we,shouldn't,use,good,shelf,space,for,fripperies,when,what,people,wanted,was,nails,and,washboards,[END]
you,fool,that,was,then,and,this,is,now,[END]
get,it,out,[END]
well,i,ain't,exactly,sure,where,i,put,it,[END]
that,was,a,long,time,ago,[END]
mother,of,god,[END]
go,see,what,that,man,over,there,wants,[END]
i'll,find,it,myself,[END]
scarlett,stormed,into,the,stockroom,behind,the,selling,area,[END]
she,was,up,on,a,ladder,looking,through,the,dusty,piles,on,a,top,shelf,when,she,heard,the,familiar,voices,of,mrs,merriwether,and,her,daughter,maybelle,[END]
i,thought,you,said,you'd,never,set,foot,across,the,threshold,of,scarlett's,store,mother,[END]
hush,the,clerk,might,hear,you,[END]
we've,looked,every,place,in,town,and,there's,not,a,length,of,black,velvet,to,be,found,[END]
i,can't,finish,my,costume,without,it,[END]
who,ever,heard,of,queen,victoria,wearing,a,colored,cape,[END]
scarlett,frowned,[END]
what,on,earth,were,they,talking,about,[END]
she,quietly,descended,the,ladder,and,walked,on,tiptoe,to,press,her,ear,against,the,wall,[END]
no,ma'am,she,heard,the,clerk,say,[END]
we,don't,get,much,call,for,velvet,[END]
just,what,i,should,have,expected,[END]
come,on,maybelle,[END]
as,long,as,we're,here,maybe,i,can,find,the,feathers,i,need,for,my,pocahontas,maybelle,was,saying,[END]
nonsense,[END]
come,on,[END]
we,should,never,have,come,here,[END]
suppose,someone,saw,us,[END]
mrs,merriwether's,tread,was,heavy,but,rapid,[END]
she,slammed,the,door,behind,her,[END]
scarlett,climbed,up,the,ladder,again,[END]
all,her,christmas,spirit,was,gone,[END]
someone,was,having,a,costume,party,and,she,wasn't,invited,[END]
she,wished,she'd,let,ashley,break,his,neck,in,melanie's,grave,[END]
she,found,the,box,she,was,looking,for,and,threw,it,down,to,the,floor,where,it,burst,scattering,the,brightly,colored,fans,in,a,wide,arc,[END]
now,you,pick,them,up,and,dust,off,every,single,one,of,them,she,ordered,[END]
i'm,going,home,[END]
she'd,rather,die,than,start,boohooing,in,front,of,her,own,clerks,[END]
the,day's,newspaper,was,on,the,seat,of,her,carriage,[END]
she'd,been,too,busy,with,the,decorations,to,read,it,as,yet,[END]
and,she,didn't,much,care,about,reading,it,now,but,it,would,hide,her,face,from,any,nosybody,looking,in,at,her,[END]
scarlett,straightened,out,the,bend,in,it,and,opened,it,to,the,center,page,for,our,charleston,letter,[END]
it,was,all,about,the,washington,race,course,newly,reopened,and,the,upcoming,race,day,in,january,[END]
scarlett,skimmed,over,the,rapturous,descriptions,of,race,weeks,before,the,war,the,customary,charleston,claims,to,have,had,the,finest,most,elaborate,everything,and,the,predictions,that,the,races,to,come,would,equal,their,predecessors,if,not,surpass,them,[END]
according,to,the,correspondent,there,would,be,parties,all,day,every,day,and,a,ball,every,night,for,weeks,[END]
and,rhett,butler,at,every,one,of,them,i'll,bet,scarlett,muttered,[END]
she,threw,the,newspaper,on,the,floor,[END]
a,front-page,headline,caught,her,eye,[END]
carnival,to,conclude,with,masquerade,ball,[END]
that,must,be,what,the,old,dragon,and,maybelle,were,talking,about,she,thought,[END]
everyone,in,the,world,except,me,is,going,to,wonderful,parties,[END]
she,snatched,the,paper,up,again,to,read,the,article,[END]
it,can,now,be,announced,planning,and,preparations,being,complete,that,atlanta,will,be,graced,on,january,6th,next,with,a,carnival,sure,to,rival,the,magnificence,of,new,orleans',famous,mardi,gras,[END]
the,twelfth,night,revelers,is,a,body,lately,formed,by,our,city's,leading,figures,from,the,worlds,of,society,and,business,and,the,instigators,of,this,fabulous,event,[END]
the,king,of,carnival,will,reign,over,atlanta,attended,by,a,court,of,noblemen,[END]
he,will,enter,the,city,and,transverse,it,on,a,royal,float,in,a,parade,that,is,expected,to,exceed,a,mile,in,length,[END]
all,the,city's,citizens,his,subjects,for,the,day,are,invited,to,view,the,parade,and,marvel,at,its,wonders,[END]
schedule,and,parade,route,will,be,announced,in,a,later,edition,of,this,newspaper,[END]
the,day-long,revels,will,conclude,at,a,masked,ball,for,which,degives,opera,house,will,be,transformed,into,a,veritable,wonderland,[END]
the,revelers,have,distributed,almost,three,hundred,invitations,to,atlanta's,finest,knights,and,fairest,ladies,[END]
damn,[END]
said,scarlett,[END]
then,desolation,took,hold,of,her,and,she,began,to,cry,like,a,child,[END]
it,wasn't,fair,for,rhett,to,be,dancing,and,laughing,in,charleston,and,all,her,enemies,in,atlanta,to,be,having,a,good,time,while,she,was,stuck,by,herself,in,her,huge,silent,house,[END]
she'd,never,done,anything,bad,enough,to,deserve,such,punishment,[END]
you've,never,been,so,lily-livered,that,you,let,them,make,you,cry,either,she,told,herself,angrily,[END]
scarlett,rubbed,the,tears,away,with,the,backs,of,her,wrists,[END]
she,wasn't,going,to,wallow,in,misery,[END]
she,was,going,to,go,after,what,she,wanted,[END]
she'd,go,to,the,ball,somehow,she'd,find,a,way,[END]
it,was,not,impossible,to,get,an,invitation,to,the,ball,it,wasn't,even,difficult,[END]
scarlett,learned,that,the,vaunted,parade,would,be,made,up,largely,of,decorated,wagons,advertising,products,and,stores,[END]
there,was,a,fee,for,participants,of,course,as,well,as,the,cost,of,decorating,the,float,but,all,those,businesses,in,the,parade,received,two,invitations,to,the,ball,[END]
she,sent,willie,kershaw,with,the,money,to,enter,kennedy's,emporium,in,the,parade,[END]
it,reinforced,her,belief,that,just,about,anything,could,be,bought,[END]
money,could,do,anything,[END]
how,will,you,decorate,the,wagon,mrs,[END]
butler,[END]
asked,kershaw,[END]
the,question,opened,up,a,hundred,possibilities,[END]
i'll,think,about,it,willie,[END]
why,she,could,spend,hours,and,hours,fill,up,lots,of,evenings,thinking,about,how,to,make,all,the,other,floats,look,pitiful,next,to,hers,[END]
she,had,to,think,about,her,costume,for,the,ball,too,[END]
what,a,lot,of,time,it,was,going,to,take,[END]
she'd,have,to,go,through,all,her,fashion,magazines,again,have,to,find,out,what,people,were,wearing,have,to,select,fabric,schedule,fittings,choose,a,hairstyle,[END]
oh,no,[END]
she,was,still,in,ordinary,mourning,[END]
surely,that,didn't,mean,she,had,to,wear,black,for,a,masquerade,ball,[END]
she'd,never,been,to,one,she,didn't,know,what,the,rules,were,[END]
but,the,whole,idea,was,to,fool,people,wasn't,it,[END]
not,to,look,like,you,usually,did,to,be,disguised,[END]
then,she,definitely,should,not,wear,black,[END]
the,ball,was,sounding,better,every,minute,[END]
scarlett,hastened,through,her,routines,at,the,store,and,hurried,to,her,dressmaker,mrs,marie,[END]
the,corpulent,wheezing,mrs,marie,took,a,sheaf,of,pins,out,of,her,mouth,so,that,she,could,report,that,ladies,had,ordered,costumes,to,represent,rosebud,pink,ballgown,trimmed,with,silk,roses,snowflake,white,ballgown,trimmed,with,stiffened,and,sequined,white,lace,night,deep,blue,velvet,with,embroidered,silver,stars,dawn,pink,over,darker,pink,skirted,silk,shepherdess,striped,gown,with,lace-edged,white,apron,[END]
all,right,all,right,said,scarlett,impatiently,[END]
i,see,what,they're,doing,[END]
i'll,let,you,know,tomorrow,what,i,will,be,[END]
mrs,marie,threw,up,her,hands,[END]
but,i,won't,have,time,to,make,your,gown,mrs,butler,[END]
i've,had,to,find,two,extra,seamstresses,as,it,is,and,i,still,don't,see,how,i'm,going,to,finish,in,time,[END]
there's,just,no,way,on,earth,i,can,add,another,costume,to,the,ones,i've,already,promised,[END]
scarlett,dismissed,the,woman's,refusal,with,a,wave,of,her,hand,[END]
she,knew,she,could,bully,her,into,doing,what,she,wanted,[END]
the,hard,part,was,deciding,what,that,was,[END]
the,answer,came,to,her,when,she,was,playing,patience,while,she,waited,for,dinnertime,[END]
she,peeked,ahead,into,the,deck,of,cards,to,see,if,she,was,going,to,get,the,king,she,needed,for,an,empty,place,[END]
no,there,were,two,queens,before,the,next,king,[END]
the,game,was,not,going,to,come,out,right,[END]
a,queen,[END]
of,course,[END]
she'd,be,able,to,wear,a,wonderful,costume,with,a,long,train,trimmed,with,white,fur,[END]
and,all,the,jewelry,she,wanted,[END]
she,spilled,the,remaining,cards,on,the,table,and,ran,upstairs,to,look,in,her,jewel,case,[END]
why,oh,why,had,rhett,been,so,stingy,about,buying,her,jewelry,[END]
he,bought,her,anything,else,she,wanted,but,the,only,jewelry,he,approved,was,pearls,[END]
she,pulled,out,rope,after,rope,piled,them,on,the,bureau,[END]
there,[END]
her,diamond,earbobs,[END]
she'd,definitely,wear,them,[END]
and,she,could,wear,pearls,in,her,hair,as,well,as,around,her,throat,and,wrists,[END]
what,a,pity,that,she,couldn't,risk,wearing,her,emerald,and,diamond,engagement,ring,[END]
too,many,people,would,recognize,it,and,if,they,knew,who,she,was,they,might,cut,her,[END]
she,was,counting,on,her,costume,and,mask,to,protect,her,from,mrs,merriwether,and,india,wilkes,and,the,other,women,[END]
she,intended,to,have,a,wonderful,time,to,dance,every,dance,to,be,part,of,things,again,[END]
by,january,fifth,the,day,before,carnival,all,atlanta,was,gala,with,preparation,[END]
the,mayor's,office,had,ordered,that,all,businesses,be,closed,on,the,sixth,and,that,all,buildings,on,the,parade,route,be,decorated,with,red,and,white,the,colors,of,rex,the,king,of,carnival,[END]
scarlett,thought,it,a,terrible,waste,to,close,the,store,on,a,day,when,the,city,would,be,jammed,with,people,from,the,country,in,for,the,celebrations,[END]
but,she,hung,big,rosettes,of,ribbon,in,the,store,window,and,on,the,iron,fence,in,front,of,her,house,and,just,like,everyone,else,she,goggled,at,the,transformation,of,whitehall,and,marietta,streets,[END]
banners,and,flags,bedecked,every,lamp,standard,and,building,front,making,a,virtual,tunnel,of,bright,fluttering,red,and,white,for,the,final,leg,of,rex's,parade,to,his,throne,[END]
i,should,have,brought,wade,and,ella,in,from,tara,for,the,parade,she,thought,[END]
but,they're,probably,still,puny,from,the,chicken,pox,her,mind,quickly,added,[END]
and,i,don't,have,ball,tickets,for,suellen,and,will,[END]
besides,i,sent,great,piles,of,christmas,presents,to,them,[END]
the,incessant,rain,on,the,day,of,carnival,soothed,any,vestige,of,compunction,about,the,children,[END]
they,couldn't,have,stood,out,in,the,wet,and,cold,to,see,the,parade,anyway,[END]
but,she,could,[END]
she,wrapped,herself,in,a,warm,shawl,and,stood,on,the,stone,bench,near,the,gate,under,a,big,umbrella,with,a,clear,view,over,the,heads,and,umbrellas,of,the,spectators,on,the,sidewalk,outside,[END]
as,promised,the,parade,was,more,than,a,mile,long,[END]
it,was,a,brave,and,sorry,spectacle,[END]
the,rain,had,all,but,destroyed,the,medieval-court-type,costumes,[END]
red,dye,had,run,ostrich,plumes,dropped,once-dashing,velvet,hats,sagged,over,faces,like,dead,lettuce,[END]
the,marching,heralds,and,pages,looked,cold,and,wet,but,determined,the,mounted,knights,struggled,grim-faced,with,their,bespattered,horses,to,keep,moving,through,the,sucking,slick,mud,[END]
scarlett,joined,in,the,crowd's,applause,for,the,earl,marshal,[END]
it,was,uncle,henry,hamilton,who,seemed,to,be,the,only,one,having,a,good,time,[END]
he,squelched,along,in,bare,feet,carrying,his,shoes,in,one,hand,and,his,bedraggled,hat,in,the,other,waving,first,one,hand,then,the,other,at,the,crowd,and,grinning,from,ear,to,ear,[END]
she,grinned,herself,when,the,ladies,of,the,court,rolled,slowly,past,in,open,carriages,[END]
the,leaders,of,atlanta,society,wore,masks,but,stoic,misery,showed,clearly,on,their,faces,[END]
maybelle,merriwether's,pocahontas,was,sporting,dejected,feathers,in,her,hair,that,dribbled,water,down,her,cheeks,and,neck,[END]
mrs,elsing,and,mrs,whiting,were,easily,recognized,as,sodden,shivering,betsy,ross,and,florence,nightingale,[END]
mrs,meade,was,a,sneezing,representation,of,the,good,old,days,in,a,billow,of,hoop-skirted,wet,taffeta,[END]
only,mrs,merriwether,was,unaffected,by,the,rain,[END]
queen,victoria,held,a,wide,black,umbrella,over,her,dry,regal,head,[END]
her,velvet,cape,was,unspotted,[END]
when,the,ladies,were,past,there,was,a,long,hiatus,and,the,spectators,began,to,leave,[END]
but,then,there,was,the,distant,sound,of,dixie,[END]
within,a,minute,the,crowd,was,cheering,itself,hoarse,and,it,kept,cheering,until,the,band,came,before,them,when,silence,fell,[END]
it,was,a,small,band,only,two,drummers,and,two,men,playing,pennywhistles,and,one,man,playing,a,sweet,high-pitched,cornet,[END]
but,they,were,dressed,in,gray,with,gold,sashes,and,bright,brass,buttons,[END]
and,in,front,of,them,a,man,with,one,arm,was,holding,the,staff,of,the,confederate,flag,in,his,remaining,hand,[END]
the,stars,and,bars,was,honorably,tattered,and,it,was,being,paraded,again,through,peachtree,street,[END]
throats,were,too,choked,with,emotion,to,utter,cheers,[END]
scarlett,felt,tears,on,her,cheeks,but,they,were,not,tears,of,defeat,they,were,tears,of,pride,[END]
sherman's,men,had,burned,atlanta,the,yankees,had,pillaged,georgia,but,they,hadn't,been,able,to,destroy,the,south,[END]
she,saw,tears,like,hers,on,the,faces,of,the,women,and,the,men,in,front,of,her,[END]
everyone,had,lowered,umbrellas,to,stand,bare-headed,to,honor,the,flag,[END]
they,stood,tall,and,proud,exposed,to,the,cold,rain,for,a,long,time,[END]
the,band,was,followed,by,a,column,of,confederate,veterans,in,the,ragged,butternut,homespun,uniforms,they'd,come,home,in,[END]
they,marched,to,dixie,as,if,they,were,young,men,again,and,the,rain-soaked,southerners,watching,them,found,their,voices,to,cheer,and,whistle,and,let,out,the,chilling,rousing,cry,that,was,the,rebel,yell,[END]
the,cheering,lasted,until,the,veterans,were,out,of,sight,[END]
then,umbrellas,swung,upward,and,people,began,to,leave,[END]
they'd,forgot,ten,rex,and,twelfth,night,[END]
the,high,point,of,the,parade,had,come,and,gone,leaving,them,wet,and,chilled,but,exalted,[END]
wonderful,[END]
scarlett,heard,it,from,dozens,of,smiling,mouths,as,people,passed,her,gate,[END]
there's,more,parade,to,come,she,said,to,some,of,them,[END]
can't,top,dixie,',can,it,[END]
they,replied,[END]
she,shook,her,head,[END]
even,she,didn't,feel,interested,in,seeing,the,floats,and,she'd,worked,very,hard,on,hers,[END]
spent,a,lot,of,money,too,on,crepe,paper,and,tinsel,that,the,rain,must,have,ruined,[END]
at,least,she,could,sit,down,to,watch,now,that,was,something,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,tire,herself,out,when,tonight,was,the,masquerade,ball,[END]
ten,endless,minutes,dragged,by,before,the,first,float,appeared,[END]
scarlett,could,see,why,when,it,got,near,[END]
the,wagon's,wheels,kept,getting,stuck,in,the,churned,red,clay,mud,of,the,street,[END]
she,sighed,and,pulled,her,shawl,more,closely,around,her,[END]
looks,like,i'm,in,for,a,long,wait,[END]
it,took,over,an,hour,for,the,decorated,wagons,to,make,their,way,past,her,her,teeth,were,chattering,before,it,was,over,[END]
but,at,least,hers,was,the,best,[END]
the,bright,crepe,paper,flowers,around,the,wagon's,sides,were,soggy,but,still,bright,[END]
and,kennedy's,emporium,in,silver,gilt,tinsel,shone,clearly,through,the,rain,drops,caught,in,it,[END]
the,big,barrels,labelled,flour,sugar,cornmeal,molasses,coffee,salt,were,empty,she,knew,so,no,damage,was,done,there,[END]
and,the,tin,washtubs,and,washboards,wouldn't,rust,[END]
the,iron,kettles,were,damaged,anyhow,she'd,glued,paper,flowers,over,the,dents,[END]
the,only,dead,loss,was,the,wooden-handled,tools,[END]
even,the,lengths,of,fabric,that,she'd,draped,so,artistically,over,a,stretch,of,chicken,wire,could,be,salvaged,for,the,penny,bargain,bin,[END]
if,only,anybody,had,waited,around,to,see,her,float,she,was,sure,they'd,have,been,impressed,[END]
she,hunched,her,shoulders,and,made,a,face,at,the,last,wagon,[END]
it,was,surrounded,by,dozens,of,shouting,capering,children,[END]
a,man,in,a,parti-colored,elf,costume,was,throwing,candy,right,and,left,[END]
scarlett,peered,at,the,name,on,the,sign,above,his,head,[END]
rich's,[END]
willie,kept,talking,about,this,new,store,at,five,points,[END]
he,was,worried,because,prices,were,lower,there,and,kennedy's,was,losing,some,customers,[END]
fiddle-dee-dee,scarlett,thought,with,contempt,[END]
rich's,won't,stay,in,business,long,enough,to,do,me,any,harm,[END]
cutting,prices,and,throwing,away,merchandise,is,not,any,way,to,be,successful,in,business,[END]
i'm,mighty,glad,i,saw,this,[END]
now,i,can,tell,willie,kershaw,not,to,be,such,a,fool,[END]
she,was,even,gladder,to,see,the,grand,finale,float,behind,rich's,[END]
it,was,rex's,throne,[END]
there,was,a,leak,in,the,red-and-white,striped,canopy,above,it,and,water,was,pouring,steadily,on,the,giltcrowned,head,and,cotton-batting-ermined,shoulders,of,dr,meade,[END]
he,looked,thoroughly,miserable,[END]
and,i,hope,you,catch,double,pneumonia,and,die,scarlett,said,under,her,breath,[END]
then,she,ran,to,the,house,for,a,hot,bath,[END]
scarlett,was,costumed,as,the,queen,of,hearts,[END]
she,would,have,preferred,to,be,the,queen,of,diamonds,with,a,glittering,paste,crown,and,dog,collar,and,brooches,[END]
however,then,she,wouldn't,have,been,able,to,wear,her,pearls,which,the,jeweller,had,told,her,were,fine,enough,for,the,queen,herself,[END]
and,besides,she,had,found,nice,big,imitation,rubies,to,sew,all,around,the,low,neck,of,her,red,velvet,gown,[END]
it,was,so,good,to,be,wearing,color,[END]
the,train,of,her,dress,was,bordered,with,white,fox,[END]
it,would,be,ruined,before,the,ball,was,over,but,no,matter,it,looked,elegant,draped,over,her,arm,to,dance,[END]
she,had,a,mysterious,red,satin,eye,mask,that,covered,her,face,down,to,the,tip,of,her,nose,and,her,lips,were,reddened,to,match,it,[END]
she,felt,very,daring,and,quite,safe,[END]
tonight,she,could,dance,to,her,heart's,content,without,anyone,knowing,who,she,was,so,they,could,insult,her,[END]
what,a,wonderful,idea,it,was,to,have,a,masquerade,[END]
even,with,her,mask,in,place,scarlett,was,nervous,about,entering,the,ballroom,without,an,escort,but,she,needn't,have,been,[END]
a,large,group,of,masked,revellers,was,entering,the,lobby,when,she,stepped,out,of,her,carriage,and,she,joined,them,without,comment,from,anyone,[END]
once,inside,she,looked,around,her,with,astonishment,[END]
degives,opera,house,had,been,transformed,almost,beyond,recognition,[END]
the,handsome,theater,was,now,truly,a,convincing,king's,palace,[END]
a,dance,floor,had,been,built,over,the,lower,half,of,the,auditorium,extending,the,large,stage,into,a,mammoth,ballroom,[END]
at,the,far,end,dr,meade,as,rex,was,seated,on,his,throne,with,uniformed,attendants,on,each,side,including,a,royal,cup,bearer,[END]
in,the,center,of,the,dress,circle,was,the,biggest,orchestra,scarlett,had,ever,seen,and,on,the,floor,were,masses,of,dancers,watchers,wanderers,[END]
there,was,a,tangible,feeling,of,heightened,gaiety,a,recklessness,that,arose,from,the,anonymity,of,being,masked,and,disguised,[END]
as,soon,as,she,entered,the,room,a,man,in,chinese,robes,and,a,long,pigtail,put,his,silken,arm,around,her,waist,and,whirled,her,onto,the,dance,floor,[END]
he,might,be,a,perfect,stranger,[END]
it,was,dangerous,and,exciting,[END]
the,tune,was,a,waltz,her,partner,a,dizzying,dancer,[END]
as,they,spun,scarlett,caught,glimpses,of,masked,hindus,clowns,harlequins,pierrettes,nuns,bears,pirates,nymphs,and,cardinals,all,dancing,as,madly,as,she,[END]
when,the,music,stopped,she,was,breathless,[END]
wonderful,she,gasped,it's,wonderful,[END]
so,many,people,[END]
all,georgia,must,be,here,dancing,[END]
not,quite,said,her,partner,[END]
some,had,no,invitations,[END]
he,gestured,upward,with,his,thumb,[END]
scarlett,saw,that,the,galleries,were,full,of,spectators,in,ordinary,dress,[END]
some,were,not,so,ordinary,[END]
mamie,bart,was,there,wearing,all,her,diamonds,surrounded,by,other,dregs,[END]
what,a,good,thing,i,didn't,take,up,with,that,bunch,again,[END]
they're,too,trashy,to,be,invited,anywhere,[END]
scarlett,had,managed,to,forget,the,origin,of,her,invitation,[END]
the,presence,of,an,audience,made,the,ball,seem,even,more,desirable,[END]
she,tossed,her,head,and,laughed,[END]
her,diamond,earrings,flashed,she,could,see,them,reflected,in,the,mandarin's,eyes,through,the,holes,in,his,mask,[END]
then,he,was,gone,[END]
elbowed,aside,by,a,monk,with,his,cowl,pulled,forward,to,shadow,his,masked,face,[END]
without,a,word,he,took,scarlett's,hand,then,circled,her,waist,with,his,arm,when,the,orchestra,struck,up,a,lively,polka,[END]
she,danced,as,she,hadn't,danced,in,years,[END]
she,was,giddy,infected,by,the,thrilling,madness,of,masquerade,intoxicated,by,the,strangeness,of,it,all,by,the,champagne,offered,on,silver,trays,held,by,satin-clad,pages,by,the,delight,of,being,at,a,party,again,by,her,unquestionable,success,[END]
she,was,a,success,and,she,believed,she,was,unknown,invulnerable,[END]
she,recognized,the,old,guard,dowagers,[END]
they,had,on,the,same,costumes,they'd,worn,in,the,parade,[END]
ashley,was,masked,but,she,knew,him,as,soon,as,she,saw,him,[END]
he,wore,a,mourning,band,around,the,sleeve,of,his,black-and-white,harlequin,outfit,[END]
india,must,have,dragged,him,here,so,she'd,have,an,escort,scarlett,thought,how,mean,of,her,[END]
of,course,she,doesn't,care,if,it's,mean,or,not,as,long,as,it's,proper,and,a,man,in,mourning,doesn't,have,to,give,up,going,out,the,way,a,woman,does,[END]
he,can,put,an,armband,on,his,best,suit,and,start,courting,his,next,love,before,his,wife's,hardly,cold,in,her,grave,[END]
but,anybody,could,tell,poor,ashley,hates,being,here,[END]
look,at,the,way,he's,all,droopy,in,his,fancy,dress,[END]
well,never,you,mind,dear,[END]
there'll,be,plenty,more,houses,like,the,one,joe,colleton's,building,now,[END]
come,spring,you'll,be,so,busy,delivering,lumber,that,you,won't,have,time,to,be,sad,[END]
as,the,evening,wore,on,the,masquerade,mood,became,even,more,pronounced,[END]
some,of,scarlett's,admirers,asked,her,name,one,even,tried,to,lift,her,mask,[END]
she,deflected,them,with,no,trouble,[END]
i,haven't,forgotten,how,to,handle,rambunctious,boys,she,thought,smiling,[END]
and,boys,is,what,they,are,no,matter,what,age,they,might,be,[END]
they're,even,sneaking,over,to,the,corner,for,a,little,something,stronger,than,champagne,[END]
next,thing,you,know,they'll,start,giving,the,rebel,yell,[END]
what,are,you,smiling,at,my,queen,of,mystery,[END]
asked,the,portly,cavalier,who,was,it,seemed,doing,his,best,to,step,on,her,feet,while,they,danced,[END]
why,at,you,of,course,scarlett,replied,smiling,[END]
no,she,hadn't,forgotten,a,thing,[END]
when,the,cavalier,released,her,hand,to,the,eager,mandarin,who,was,back,for,the,third,time,scarlett,begged,prettily,for,a,chair,and,a,glass,of,champagne,[END]
the,cavalier,had,badly,bruised,one,of,her,toes,[END]
but,when,her,escort,led,her,towards,the,sitting-out,side,of,the,room,she,suddenly,declared,that,the,orchestra,was,playing,her,favorite,song,and,she,couldn't,bear,not,to,dance,[END]
she,had,seen,aunt,pittypat,and,mrs,elsing,in,her,path,[END]
could,they,have,recognized,her,[END]
a,mix,of,anger,and,fear,dimmed,the,happy,excitement,she,was,feeling,[END]
she,was,painfully,aware,of,her,injured,foot,and,the,whiskey,breath,of,the,mandarin,[END]
i,won't,think,about,it,now,not,about,mrs,elsing,and,not,about,my,sore,toe,[END]
i,won't,let,anything,spoil,my,fun,[END]
she,tried,to,push,the,thoughts,aside,and,gave,herself,over,to,enjoyment,[END]
but,against,her,will,her,eyes,looked,often,at,the,sides,of,the,ballroom,and,the,men,and,women,sitting,or,standing,there,[END]
her,eyes,brushed,a,tall,bearded,pirate,who,was,leaning,against,a,doorjamb,and,he,bowed,to,her,[END]
scarlett's,breath,caught,in,her,throat,[END]
she,turned,her,head,to,look,again,[END]
there,was,something,[END]
the,air,of,insolence,[END]
the,pirate,was,wearing,a,white,dress,shirt,and,dark,evening,trousers,[END]
not,a,costume,at,all,except,for,the,wide,red,silk,sash,tied,around,his,waist,with,two,pistols,tucked,into,it,[END]
and,blue,bows,tied,to,the,ends,of,his,big,beard,[END]
his,mask,was,a,simple,black,one,over,his,eyes,[END]
he,wasn't,anyone,she,knew,was,he,[END]
so,few,men,wore,thick,beards,these,days,[END]
still,the,way,he,was,standing,[END]
and,the,way,he,seemed,to,be,staring,at,her,right,through,the,mask,[END]
when,scarlett,looked,at,him,for,the,third,time,he,smiled,his,teeth,very,white,against,his,dark,beard,and,swarthy,skin,[END]
scarlett,felt,faint,[END]
it,was,rhett,[END]
it,couldn't,be,[END]
she,must,be,imagining,things,[END]
no,she,wasn't,she,wouldn't,feel,this,way,if,it,was,anyone,else,[END]
wasn't,that,just,like,him,[END]
showing,up,at,a,ball,that,most,people,couldn't,get,invited,to,[END]
rhett,could,do,anything,[END]
excuse,me,i,must,go,[END]
no,really,i,mean,it,[END]
she,pushed,away,from,the,mandarin,and,ran,to,her,husband,[END]
rhett,bowed,again,[END]
edward,teach,at,your,service,ma'am,[END]
who,[END]
did,he,think,she,hadn't,recognized,him,[END]
edward,teach,commonly,known,as,blackbeard,the,greatest,villain,that,ever,plowed,the,waters,of,the,atlantic,[END]
rhett,twirled,a,ribboned,lock,of,the,beard,[END]
scarlett's,heart,leapt,[END]
he's,having,fun,she,thought,making,those,jokes,of,his,that,he,knows,i,hardly,ever,understand,[END]
just,the,way,he,used,to,before,[END]
before,things,went,bad,[END]
i,mustn't,put,my,foot,wrong,now,[END]
i,mustn't,[END]
what,would,i,have,said,before,i,loved,him,so,much,[END]
i'm,surprised,that,you'd,come,to,a,ball,in,atlanta,when,there,are,such,big,doings,in,your,precious,charleston,she,said,[END]
there,[END]
that,was,just,right,[END]
not,exactly,mean,but,not,too,loving,either,[END]
rhett's,eyebrows,rose,in,black,crescents,above,his,mask,scarlett,held,her,breath,[END]
he'd,always,done,that,when,he,was,amused,[END]
she,was,acting,just,right,[END]
how,do,you,come,to,be,so,informed,about,charleston's,social,life,scarlett,[END]
i,read,the,paper,[END]
some,silly,woman,keeps,going,on,and,on,about,some,horserace,[END]
damn,that,beard,[END]
she,thought,he,was,smiling,but,she,couldn't,really,see,his,lips,[END]
i,read,the,newspaper,too,said,rhett,[END]
even,in,charleston,it's,news,when,an,upstart,country,town,like,atlanta,decides,to,pretend,that,it's,new,orleans,[END]
new,orleans,[END]
he,had,taken,her,there,for,their,honeymoon,[END]
take,me,there,again,she,wanted,to,say,we'll,start,over,and,everything,will,be,different,[END]
but,she,mustn't,say,that,[END]
not,yet,[END]
her,mind,leapt,quickly,from,one,memory,to,another,[END]
narrow,cobbled,streets,tall,shadowy,rooms,with,great,mirrors,framed,in,dull,gold,strange,and,marvelous,foods,[END]
i'll,admit,the,refreshments,aren't,as,fancy,she,said,grudgingly,[END]
rhett,chuckled,[END]
a,powerful,understatement,[END]
i'm,making,him,laugh,[END]
i,haven't,heard,him,laugh,for,ages,[END]
too,long,[END]
he,must,have,seen,the,men,flocking,to,dance,with,me,[END]
how,did,you,know,it,was,me,[END]
she,said,[END]
i,have,a,mask,on,[END]
i,only,had,to,look,for,the,most,ostentatiously,dressed,woman,scarlett,[END]
it,was,bound,to,be,you,[END]
oh,you,[END]
you,skunk,[END]
she,forgot,that,she,was,trying,to,amuse,him,[END]
you,don't,look,exactly,handsome,rhett,butler,with,that,foolish,beard,[END]
might,as,well,stick,a,bearskin,over,your,face,[END]
it,was,the,fullest,disguise,i,could,think,of,[END]
there,are,a,number,of,people,in,atlanta,that,i'm,not,anxious,to,have,recognize,me,too,easily,[END]
then,why,did,you,come,[END]
not,just,to,insult,me,i,don't,suppose,[END]
i,promised,you,i'd,make,myself,visible,often,enough,to,keep,down,gossip,scarlett,[END]
this,was,a,perfect,occasion,[END]
what,good,does,a,masked,ball,do,[END]
nobody,knows,who,anybody,is,[END]
at,midnight,the,masks,come,off,[END]
that's,about,four,minutes,from,now,[END]
we'll,waltz,to,visibility,then,leave,[END]
rhett,took,her,in,his,arms,and,scarlett,forgot,her,anger,forgot,the,peril,of,unmasking,before,her,enemies,forgot,the,world,[END]
nothing,was,important,but,that,he,was,here,and,holding,her,[END]
scarlett,lay,awake,most,of,the,night,struggling,to,understand,what,had,happened,[END]
everything,was,fine,at,the,ball,[END]
when,twelve,o'clock,came,dr,meade,said,that,everyone,should,take,off,their,masks,and,rhett,was,laughing,when,he,yanked,off,his,beard,too,[END]
i'd,take,an,oath,he,was,enjoying,himself,[END]
he,kind,of,saluted,the,doctor,and,bowed,to,mrs,meade,and,then,he,whisked,me,out,of,there,as,easy,as,a,greased,pig,[END]
he,didn't,even,notice,the,way,people,turned,their,backs,on,me,at,least,he,didn't,let,on,if,he,did,[END]
he,was,grinning,from,ear,to,ear,[END]
and,in,the,carriage,coming,home,it,was,too,dark,to,see,his,face,but,his,voice,sounded,fine,[END]
i,didn't,know,what,to,say,but,i,hardly,even,had,to,think,about,it,[END]
he,asked,how,things,were,at,tara,and,if,his,lawyer,was,paying,my,bills,on,time,and,by,the,time,i,answered,we,were,home,[END]
that's,when,it,happened,[END]
he,was,here,right,downstairs,in,the,hallway,[END]
then,he,just,said,good,night,he,was,tired,and,went,up,to,his,dressing,room,[END]
he,wasn't,hateful,or,cold,he,just,said,good,night,and,went,upstairs,[END]
what,does,that,mean,[END]
why,did,he,bother,to,come,all,this,way,[END]
not,just,to,go,to,a,party,when,it's,party,time,in,charleston,[END]
not,because,it,was,a,masquerade,he,could,go,to,mardi,gras,if,he,wanted,to,[END]
after,all,he,has,lots,of,friends,in,new,orleans,[END]
he,said,to,keep,down,gossip,[END]
in,a,pig's,eye,[END]
he,started,it,if,anything,snatching,off,that,silly,beard,the,way,he,did,[END]
her,mind,circled,back,went,over,the,evening,again,and,again,until,her,head,ached,[END]
her,sleep,when,it,came,was,brief,and,restless,[END]
nevertheless,she,woke,in,good,time,to,go,down,to,breakfast,in,her,most,becoming,dressing,gown,[END]
she'd,have,no,tray,brought,to,her,room,today,[END]
rhett,always,had,his,breakfast,in,the,dining,room,[END]
up,so,early,my,dear,[END]
he,said,[END]
how,thoughtful,of,you,[END]
i,won't,have,to,write,a,note,of,farewell,[END]
he,tossed,his,napkin,onto,the,table,[END]
i've,packed,some,things,pork,overlooked,[END]
i'll,be,by,for,them,later,on,my,way,to,the,train,[END]
don't,leave,me,scarlett's,heart,begged,[END]
she,looked,away,lest,he,see,the,pleading,in,her,eyes,[END]
for,heaven's,sake,finish,your,coffee,rhett,she,said,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,make,a,scene,[END]
she,went,to,the,sideboard,and,poured,herself,some,coffee,watching,him,in,the,mirror,[END]
she,must,be,calm,[END]
maybe,then,he'd,stay,[END]
he,was,standing,his,watch,open,in,his,hand,[END]
no,time,he,said,[END]
there,are,some,people,i,have,to,see,while,i'm,here,[END]
i'm,going,to,be,very,busy,until,summer,so,i'll,drop,the,word,that,i'm,going,to,south,america,on,business,[END]
no,one,will,gossip,about,my,absence,for,so,long,[END]
most,people,in,atlanta,don't,even,know,where,south,america,is,[END]
you,see,my,dear,i'm,keeping,my,promise,to,preserve,the,purity,of,your,reputation,[END]
rhett,grinned,malevolently,closed,the,watch,and,tucked,it,in,its,pocket,[END]
goodbye,scarlett,[END]
why,don't,you,go,on,to,south,america,and,get,lost,there,forever,[END]
when,the,door,closed,behind,him,scarlett's,hand,reached,for,the,decanter,of,brandy,[END]
why,had,she,carried,on,like,that,[END]
that,wasn't,how,she,felt,at,all,[END]
he'd,always,done,that,to,her,goaded,her,into,saying,things,she,didn't,mean,[END]
she,should,have,known,better,than,to,fly,off,the,handle,that,way,[END]
but,he,shouldn't,have,taunted,me,about,my,reputation,[END]
how,could,he,have,found,out,that,i'm,outcast,[END]
she'd,never,been,so,unhappy,in,her,whole,life,[END]
9,[END]
later,scarlett,was,ashamed,of,herself,[END]
drinking,in,the,morning,[END]
only,low-life,drunks,did,such,a,thing,[END]
things,weren't,so,bad,really,she,told,herself,[END]
at,least,she,knew,now,when,rhett,would,be,coming,back,[END]
it,was,much,too,far,in,the,future,but,it,was,definite,[END]
now,she,wouldn't,waste,time,wondering,if,today,might,be,the,day,[END]
or,tomorrow,[END]
or,the,day,after,that,[END]
february,opened,with,a,surprising,warm,spell,that,called,forth,premature,leaves,on,trees,and,filled,the,air,with,the,scent,of,waking,earth,[END]
open,all,the,windows,scarlett,told,the,servants,and,let,the,mustiness,out,[END]
the,breeze,lifting,the,loose,tendrils,of,hair,at,her,temples,was,delicious,[END]
suddenly,she,was,gripped,by,a,terrible,longing,for,tara,[END]
she'd,be,able,to,sleep,there,with,the,spring-laden,wind,bringing,the,smell,of,the,warming,earth,into,her,bedroom,[END]
but,i,can't,go,[END]
colleton,will,be,able,to,start,at,least,three,more,houses,once,this,weather,gets,the,frost,out,of,the,ground,but,he'll,never,do,it,unless,i,nag,him,into,it,[END]
i've,never,known,such,a,picky,man,in,all,my,life,[END]
everything,has,to,be,just,so,[END]
he'll,wait,till,the,ground's,warm,enough,to,dig,to,china,and,find,no,frost,[END]
suppose,she,went,for,just,a,few,days,[END]
a,few,days,wouldn't,make,that,much,difference,would,it,[END]
scarlett,remembered,ashley's,pallor,and,dejected,slump,at,the,carnival,ball,and,she,made,a,small,sound,of,disappointment,[END]
she,wouldn't,be,able,to,relax,at,tara,if,she,did,go,[END]
she,sent,pansy,with,a,message,to,elias,to,bring,the,carriage,around,[END]
she,had,to,go,find,joe,colleton,[END]
that,evening,as,if,to,reward,her,for,doing,her,duty,the,doorbell,sounded,just,after,darkness,fell,[END]
scarlett,honey,tony,fontaine,called,out,when,the,butler,let,him,in,an,old,friend,needs,a,room,for,the,night,will,you,be,merciful,[END]
tony,[END]
scarlett,ran,from,the,sitting,room,to,embrace,him,[END]
he,dropped,his,luggage,caught,her,in,his,arms,for,a,hug,[END]
great,god,almighty,scarlett,you've,done,real,well,for,yourself,he,said,[END]
i,thought,some,fool,had,given,me,directions,to,a,hotel,when,i,saw,this,big,place,[END]
he,looked,at,the,ornate,chandelier,flocked,velvet,wallpaper,and,massive,gilt,mirrors,in,the,entrance,hall,then,grinned,at,her,[END]
no,wonder,you,married,that,charlestonian,instead,of,waiting,for,me,[END]
where,is,rhett,[END]
i'd,like,to,meet,the,man,who,got,my,girl,[END]
cold,fingers,of,fear,traced,scarlett's,spine,[END]
had,suellen,told,the,fontaines,anything,[END]
rhett's,in,south,america,she,said,brightly,can,you,imagine,such,a,thing,[END]
gracious,peace,i,thought,missionaries,were,the,only,people,who,ever,went,to,such,an,outlandish,place,[END]
tony,laughed,[END]
me,too,[END]
i'm,sorry,to,miss,seeing,him,but,it's,good,luck,for,me,[END]
i'll,have,you,all,to,myself,[END]
how,about,a,drink,for,a,thirsty,man,[END]
he,didn't,know,rhett,had,left,she,was,sure,of,it,[END]
i,think,a,visit,from,you,calls,for,champagne,[END]
tony,said,he'd,welcome,champagne,later,but,for,now,he,wanted,a,good,old,bourbon,whiskey,and,a,bath,[END]
he,could,still,smell,cow,manure,on,himself,he,was,sure,[END]
scarlett,fixed,his,drink,herself,then,sent,him,upstairs,with,the,butler,as,his,guide,to,one,of,the,extra,bedrooms,for,guests,[END]
thank,heaven,the,servants,lived,in,the,house,there'd,be,no,scandal,about,tony,staying,as,long,as,he,liked,[END]
and,she'd,have,a,friend,to,talk,to,[END]
they,had,champagne,with,their,supper,and,scarlett,wore,her,pearls,[END]
tony,ate,four,big,pieces,of,the,chocolate,cake,that,the,cook,had,hurriedly,made,for,dessert,[END]
tell,them,to,wrap,up,whatever's,left,for,me,to,take,with,me,he,begged,[END]
the,only,thing,i,get,hankerings,for,is,cake,with,thick,icing,like,that,[END]
i,always,did,have,a,sweet,tooth,[END]
scarlett,laughed,and,sent,the,message,to,the,kitchen,[END]
are,you,telling,tales,on,sally,tony,[END]
can't,she,do,fancy,cooking,[END]
sally,[END]
whatever,gave,you,that,idea,[END]
she,fixed,a,bang-up,dessert,every,night,just,for,me,[END]
alex,don't,have,my,weakness,so,she,can,stop,now,[END]
scarlett,looked,puzzled,[END]
you,mean,you,didn't,know,[END]
said,tony,[END]
i,figured,suellen,would,have,put,it,in,a,letter,[END]
i'm,going,back,to,texas,scarlett,[END]
i,made,up,my,mind,'round,about,christmas,[END]
they,talked,for,hours,[END]
at,first,she,begged,him,to,stay,until,tony's,awkward,embarrassment,changed,into,the,famous,fontaine,temper,[END]
dammit,scarlett,be,quiet,[END]
i,tried,god,knows,i,tried,but,i,can't,stick,it,[END]
so,you'd,better,quit,nagging,me,[END]
his,loud,voice,made,the,prisms,on,the,chandelier,sway,and,tinkle,[END]
you,could,think,about,alex,she,persisted,[END]
the,expression,on,tony's,face,made,her,stop,[END]
his,voice,was,quiet,when,he,spoke,[END]
i,really,did,try,he,said,[END]
i'm,sorry,tony,[END]
me,too,honey,[END]
why,don't,you,get,your,fancy,butler,to,open,up,another,bottle,and,we'll,talk,about,something,else,[END]
tell,me,about,texas,[END]
tony's,black,eyes,lit,up,[END]
there's,not,a,fence,in,a,hundred,miles,[END]
he,laughed,and,added,that's,because,there's,not,much,worth,fencing,in,unless,you,like,dust,and,dried-up,scrub,[END]
but,you,know,who,you,are,when,you're,on,your,own,out,there,in,all,that,emptiness,[END]
there's,no,past,no,holding,on,to,the,scraps,that,are,all,you've,got,left,[END]
everything,is,this,minute,or,maybe,tomorrow,not,yesterday,[END]
he,lifted,his,glass,to,her,[END]
you're,looking,as,pretty,as,a,picture,scarlett,[END]
rhett,can't,be,too,smart,or,he,wouldn't,leave,you,behind,[END]
i,would,make,advances,if,i,thought,i,could,get,away,with,it,[END]
scarlett,tossed,her,head,like,a,coquette,[END]
it,was,fun,to,play,the,old,games,[END]
you'd,make,advances,at,my,grandmother,if,she,was,the,only,female,around,tony,fontaine,[END]
no,lady's,safe,in,the,same,room,with,you,when,you,flash,those,black,eyes,and,that,white,smile,[END]
now,honey,you,know,that's,not,so,[END]
i'm,the,most,gentlemanly,fellow,in,the,world,[END]
as,long,as,the,lady's,not,so,beautiful,that,she,makes,me,forget,how,to,behave,[END]
they,bantered,with,skill,and,delight,in,their,skills,until,the,butler,brought,in,the,bottle,of,champagne,then,they,toasted,each,other,[END]
scarlett,was,giddy,enough,from,pleasure,she,was,content,for,tony,to,finish,the,bottle,[END]
while,he,did,he,told,tall,tales,of,texas,that,made,her,laugh,until,her,sides,hurt,[END]
tony,i,do,wish,you'd,stay,over,a,while,she,said,when,he,announced,he,was,about,to,fall,asleep,on,her,table,[END]
i,haven't,had,so,much,fun,in,ages,[END]
i,wish,i,could,[END]
i,like,drinking,and,eating,high,on,the,hog,with,a,pretty,girl,laughing,beside,me,[END]
but,i've,got,to,use,this,break,in,the,weather,[END]
i'm,taking,the,train,west,tomorrow,before,things,ice,up,[END]
it,leaves,pretty,early,[END]
will,you,have,coffee,with,me,before,i,go,[END]
you,couldn't,stop,me,if,you,tried,[END]
elias,drove,them,to,the,station,in,the,gray,light,before,dawn,and,scarlett,waved,goodbye,with,her,handkerchief,while,tony,boarded,the,train,[END]
he,was,carrying,a,small,leather,satchel,and,a,huge,canvas,bag,with,his,saddle,in,it,[END]
when,he'd,thrown,them,up,onto,the,platform,of,the,coach,he,turned,and,flourished,his,big,texas,hat,with,the,rattlesnakeskin,band,[END]
the,gesture,pulled,his,coat,open,and,she,could,see,his,gunbelt,and,six-shooters,[END]
at,least,he,stuck,around,long,enough,to,teach,wade,how,to,twirl,his,she,thought,[END]
i,hope,he,doesn't,shoot,his,foot,off,[END]
she,blew,a,kiss,to,tony,[END]
he,held,his,hat,like,a,bowl,to,catch,it,reached,in,took,it,out,put,it,in,the,watch,pocket,of,his,vest,[END]
scarlett,was,still,laughing,when,the,train,pulled,out,[END]
drive,out,to,that,land,of,mine,where,mr,colleton,is,working,she,said,to,elias,[END]
the,sun,would,be,up,before,they,got,there,and,the,work,gang,better,be,digging,or,she'd,have,something,to,say,about,it,[END]
tony,was,right,[END]
you,had,to,use,the,break,in,the,weather,[END]
joe,colleton,was,unshakeable,[END]
i,come,out,like,i,said,i,would,mrs,butler,but,it's,just,like,i,expected,[END]
the,thaw,don't,go,near,deep,enough,to,dig,a,cellar,[END]
it'll,be,another,month,before,i,can,get,started,[END]
scarlett,cajoled,then,she,raged,but,it,did,no,good,[END]
she,was,still,fuming,with,frustration,a,month,later,when,colleton's,message,brought,her,back,out,to,the,site,[END]
she,didn't,see,ashley,until,it,was,too,late,to,turn,back,[END]
what,am,i,going,to,tell,him,[END]
i've,got,no,call,to,be,here,and,ashley's,so,smart,he'd,see,right,through,any,lie,i,might,try,[END]
she,was,sure,the,hasty,smile,on,her,face,looked,as,ghastly,as,she,felt,[END]
if,it,did,ashley,didn't,seem,to,notice,[END]
he,handed,her,down,from,her,carriage,with,his,usual,ingrained,courtesy,[END]
i'm,happy,i,didn't,miss,you,scarlett,it's,so,good,to,see,you,[END]
mr,colleton,told,me,you,might,be,coming,so,i,dallied,as,long,as,i,could,[END]
he,smiled,ruefully,[END]
we,both,know,i'm,not,much,of,a,businessman,my,dear,so,my,advice,isn't,worth,much,but,i,do,want,to,say,that,if,you,do,in,fact,build,another,store,out,here,you,can't,possibly,go,wrong,[END]
what,is,he,going,on,about,[END]
oh,[END]
of,course,i,see,[END]
how,clever,joe,colleton,is,he's,made,my,excuse,for,being,here,already,[END]
she,turned,her,attention,back,to,ashley,[END]
and,i've,heard,that,the,city's,very,likely,to,run,a,trolley,line,out,here,to,the,edge,of,town,[END]
it's,amazing,isn't,it,the,way,atlanta,is,growing,[END]
ashley,looked,stronger,[END]
very,tired,by,the,effort,of,living,but,more,capable,of,it,[END]
scarlett,wished,urgently,that,it,meant,the,lumber,business,was,better,[END]
she,wouldn't,be,able,to,bear,it,if,the,mills,and,yard,died,too,[END]
and,she'd,never,be,able,to,forgive,ashley,[END]
he,took,her,hand,in,his,and,looked,down,at,her,with,a,worried,expression,on,his,drawn,face,[END]
you,look,tired,my,dear,[END]
is,everything,quite,all,right,[END]
she,wanted,to,lay,her,head,against,his,chest,and,wail,that,everything,was,awful,[END]
but,she,smiled,[END]
oh,fiddle-dee-dee,ashley,don't,be,a,silly,[END]
i,was,up,too,late,last,night,at,a,party,that's,all,[END]
you,should,know,better,than,to,hint,to,a,lady,that,she's,not,looking,her,best,[END]
and,let,that,get,back,to,india,and,all,her,mean,old,friends,scarlett,added,silently,[END]
ashley,accepted,her,explanation,without,question,[END]
he,began,to,tell,her,about,joe,colleton's,houses,[END]
as,if,she,didn't,know,all,that,right,down,to,the,number,of,nails,needed,for,each,one,[END]
they,are,quality,construction,said,ashley,[END]
for,once,the,less,fortunate,will,be,treated,as,well,as,the,rich,[END]
it's,something,i,never,thought,i'd,see,in,these,days,of,blatant,opportunism,[END]
it,seems,that,all,the,old,values,weren't,lost,after,all,[END]
i'm,honored,to,have,a,part,in,this,[END]
you,see,scarlett,mr,colleton,wants,me,to,supply,the,lumber,[END]
she,made,an,astonished,face,[END]
why,ashley,that's,wonderful,[END]
and,it,was,[END]
she,was,truly,happy,that,her,scheme,to,help,ashley,was,working,so,well,[END]
but,scarlett,thought,after,she,talked,privately,with,colleton,it,wasn't,supposed,to,turn,into,some,kind,of,fixation,[END]
ashley,intended,to,spend,time,at,the,site,every,day,joe,told,her,[END]
she'd,meant,to,provide,ashley,with,some,income,not,a,hobby,for,heaven's,sake,[END]
now,she,wouldn't,be,able,to,go,out,there,at,all,[END]
except,on,sundays,when,there,was,no,work,going,on,[END]
the,weekly,trip,became,almost,an,obsession,for,her,[END]
she,no,longer,thought,about,ashley,when,she,saw,the,clean,strong,lumber,in,the,frame,and,rafters,then,the,walls,and,floors,as,the,house,went,up,[END]
she,walked,through,the,neat,piles,of,materials,and,debris,with,a,longing,heart,[END]
how,she'd,love,to,be,a,part,of,it,all,to,hear,the,hammering,watch,the,shavings,curl,away,from,the,planes,see,the,daily,progress,[END]
be,busy,[END]
i,only,have,to,hold,out,until,summer,the,words,were,her,litany,and,her,lifeline,then,rhett,will,come,[END]
i,can,tell,him,rhett's,the,only,one,i,can,tell,he's,the,only,one,who,cares,about,me,[END]
he,won't,make,me,live,like,this,outcast,and,unhappy,once,he,knows,how,awful,everything,is,[END]
what,went,wrong,[END]
i,was,so,sure,that,if,i,could,just,have,enough,money,i'd,be,safe,[END]
now,i'm,rich,and,i,feel,more,afraid,than,ever,before,in,my,whole,life,[END]
but,when,summer,came,there,was,no,visit,by,rhett,no,word,from,him,[END]
scarlett,hurried,home,from,the,store,every,morning,so,she'd,be,there,if,he,was,on,the,midday,train,[END]
in,the,evening,she,wore,her,most,becoming,gown,and,her,pearls,for,supper,in,case,he,was,coming,some,other,way,[END]
the,long,table,stretched,before,her,gleaming,with,silver,and,heavy,damask,starched,to,a,shine,[END]
it,was,then,that,she,began,to,drink,steadily,to,shut,out,the,silence,while,she,listened,for,his,footsteps,[END]
she,didn't,think,anything,of,it,when,she,began,having,sherry,in,the,afternoon,after,all,taking,a,glass,or,two,of,sherry,was,a,ladylike,thing,to,do,[END]
and,she,hardly,noticed,when,she,changed,from,sherry,to,whiskey,[END]
or,when,she,first,needed,a,drink,to,do,the,store,accounts,because,it,depressed,her,that,business,was,falling,off,so,[END]
or,when,she,began,leaving,the,food,on,her,plate,because,alcohol,satisfied,her,hunger,better,[END]
or,when,she,began,to,take,a,glass,of,brandy,as,soon,as,she,got,up,in,the,morning,[END]
she,hardly,even,noticed,when,summer,became,fall,[END]
pansy,brought,the,afternoon,mail,to,the,bedroom,on,a,tray,[END]
lately,scarlett,had,tried,sleeping,for,a,while,after,dinner,[END]
it,filled,up,part,of,the,empty,afternoon,and,it,gave,her,some,rest,a,relief,denied,to,her,at,night,[END]
you,want,i,should,bring,you,a,pot,of,coffee,or,something,miss,scarlett,[END]
no,[END]
you,go,on,pansy,[END]
scarlett,took,the,topmost,letter,and,opened,it,[END]
she,stole,quick,glances,on,pansy,who,was,picking,up,the,clothes,she,had,thrown,on,the,floor,[END]
why,didn't,the,stupid,girl,get,out,of,her,room,[END]
the,letter,was,from,suellen,[END]
scarlett,didn't,bother,to,take,the,folded,pages,from,the,envelope,[END]
she,knew,what,it,would,say,[END]
more,complaints,about,ella's,naughtiness,as,if,suellen's,own,little,girls,were,some,kind,of,saints,[END]
most,of,all,nasty,little,hints,about,the,cost,of,everything,and,how,little,money,tara,was,making,and,how,rich,scarlett,was,[END]
scarlett,threw,the,letter,to,the,floor,[END]
she,couldn't,stand,to,read,it,now,[END]
she'll,do,it,tomorrow,[END]
oh,thank,god,[END]
pansy,was,gone,[END]
i,need,a,drink,[END]
it's,almost,dark,there's,nothing,wrong,with,a,drink,in,the,evening,[END]
i'll,just,sip,a,small,brandy,very,slowly,while,i,finish,reading,the,mail,[END]
the,bottle,hidden,behind,the,hatboxes,was,almost,empty,[END]
scarlett,fumed,[END]
damn,that,pansy,[END]
if,she,wasn't,so,clever,with,my,hair,i'd,fire,her,tomorrow,[END]
it,must,have,been,pansy,who,drank,it,[END]
or,one,of,the,other,maids,[END]
i,couldn't,be,drinking,that,much,[END]
i,just,hid,the,bottle,there,a,few,days,ago,[END]
no,matter,[END]
i'll,take,the,letters,down,to,the,dining,room,[END]
after,all,what,does,it,matter,if,the,servants,watch,the,level,in,the,decanter,[END]
it's,my,house,and,my,decanter,and,my,brandy,and,i,can,do,what,i,choose,[END]
where,is,my,wrapper,[END]
there,it,is,[END]
why,are,the,buttons,so,stiff,[END]
it's,taking,forever,to,get,it,on,[END]
scarlett,hurried,downstairs,and,to,the,dining,room,where,she,tossed,her,mail,onto,the,table,in,a,heap,[END]
she,poured,brandy,into,a,glass,and,drank,a,reviving,swallow,at,the,sideboard,before,carrying,the,glass,to,the,table,and,sitting,in,her,chair,[END]
now,she'd,just,sip,her,drink,while,she,calmly,read,her,letters,[END]
a,circular,for,a,newly,arrived,dentist,[END]
pooh,[END]
her,teeth,were,just,fine,thank,you,very,much,[END]
another,one,for,milk,delivery,[END]
an,announcement,of,a,new,play,at,degives,[END]
scarlett,sorted,irritably,through,the,envelopes,[END]
wasn't,there,any,real,mail,[END]
her,hand,stopped,when,it,touched,a,thin,crackling,onionskin,envelope,addressed,in,a,spidery,script,[END]
aunt,eulalie,[END]
she,downed,the,remainder,of,her,brandy,and,ripped,open,the,letter,[END]
she,always,hated,the,preachy,prissy,missives,from,her,dead,mother's,sister,[END]
but,aunt,eulalie,lived,in,charleston,[END]
she,might,mention,rhett,[END]
his,mother,was,her,closest,friend,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,moved,rapidly,squinting,to,make,out,the,words,[END]
aunt,eulalie,always,wrote,on,both,sides,of,the,thin,paper,and,often,she,crossed,the,letter,writing,on,the,page,then,turning,it,to,a,right,angle,and,writing,across,the,previous,lines,[END]
all,to,say,a,great,deal,about,precious,little,[END]
the,unseasonably,warm,autumn,[END]
she,said,that,every,year,[END]
aunt,pauline,having,trouble,with,her,knee,[END]
she'd,had,trouble,with,her,knee,as,long,as,scarlett,could,remember,[END]
a,visit,to,sister,mary,joseph,[END]
scarlett,made,a,face,[END]
she,couldn't,think,of,her,baby,sister,carreen,by,her,religious,name,even,though,she'd,been,in,the,convent,in,charleston,for,eight,years,[END]
the,bake,sale,for,the,cathedral,building,fund,was,far,behind,schedule,because,contributions,were,not,coming,in,and,couldn't,scarlett,great,balls,of,fire,[END]
she,kept,the,roof,over,her,aunts',heads,did,she,have,to,roof,a,cathedral,too,[END]
she,turned,the,page,over,frowning,[END]
rhett's,name,leapt,from,the,tangle,of,criss-crossed,words,[END]
it,does,one's,heart,good,to,see,a,cherished,friend,like,eleanor,butler,find,happiness,after,so,many,sorrows,[END]
rhett,is,quite,his,mother's,gallant,and,her,devotion,has,done,much,to,redeem,him,in,the,eyes,of,all,those,who,deplored,the,wild,ways,of,his,younger,days,[END]
it,is,beyond,my,comprehension,and,also,that,of,aunt,pauline,why,you,insist,on,maintaining,your,unaccountable,preoccupation,with,trade,when,you,have,no,need,to,remain,associated,with,the,store,[END]
i,have,deplored,your,actions,in,this,regard,on,many,past,occasions,and,you,have,never,heeded,my,pleas,that,you,abandon,a,course,of,action,so,unsuitable,to,a,lady,[END]
i,therefore,ceased,to,refer,to,it,some,years,ago,[END]
but,now,when,it,keeps,you,from,your,proper,place,by,the,side,of,your,husband,i,feel,it,my,duty,to,once,again,allude,to,the,distasteful,matter,[END]
scarlett,threw,the,letter,onto,the,table,[END]
so,that,was,the,story,that,rhett,was,handing,out,[END]
that,she,wouldn't,leave,the,store,and,go,to,charleston,with,him,[END]
what,a,blackhearted,liar,he,was,[END]
she'd,begged,him,to,take,her,with,him,when,he,left,[END]
how,dare,he,spread,such,slander,[END]
she'd,have,some,choice,words,to,say,to,mister,rhett,butler,when,he,came,home,[END]
she,strode,to,the,sideboard,splashed,brandy,into,her,glass,[END]
some,fell,onto,the,gleaming,wooden,surface,[END]
a,swipe,with,her,sleeve,mopped,it,up,[END]
he'd,probably,deny,it,the,skunk,[END]
well,she'd,shake,aunt,eulalie's,letter,in,his,face,[END]
let's,see,him,call,his,mother's,best,friend,a,liar,[END]
suddenly,her,rage,left,her,and,she,felt,cold,[END]
she,knew,what,he'd,say,would,you,rather,i,told,the,truth,[END]
that,i,left,you,because,living,with,you,was,intolerable,[END]
the,shame,of,it,[END]
anything,was,better,than,that,[END]
even,the,loneliness,while,she,waited,for,him,to,come,home,[END]
her,hand,lifted,the,glass,to,her,lips,and,she,drank,deep,[END]
the,movement,caught,her,eye,reflected,in,the,mirror,above,the,sideboard,[END]
slowly,scarlett,lowered,her,hand,and,set,the,glass,down,[END]
she,looked,into,her,own,eyes,[END]
they,widened,in,shock,at,what,they,saw,[END]
she,hadn't,really,looked,at,herself,for,months,and,she,couldn,believe,that,pale,thin,sunken-eyed,woman,had,anything,to,do,with,her,[END]
why,her,hair,looked,as,if,it,hadn't,been,washed,for,weeks,[END]
what,had,happened,to,her,[END]
her,hand,reached,automatically,for,the,decanter,providing,the,answer,[END]
scarlett,pulled,her,hand,away,and,she,saw,that,it,was,shaking,[END]
oh,my,god,she,whispered,[END]
she,clutched,the,edge,of,the,sideboard,for,support,and,stared,at,her,reflection,[END]
fool,[END]
she,said,[END]
her,eyes,closed,and,tears,slid,slowly,down,her,cheeks,but,she,brushed,them,away,with,quivering,fingers,[END]
she,wanted,a,drink,more,than,she'd,ever,wanted,anything,in,her,life,[END]
her,tongue,darted,across,her,lips,[END]
her,right,hand,moved,on,its,own,volition,closed,around,the,neck,of,the,glittering,diamondcut,glass,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,her,hand,as,if,it,belonged,to,a,stranger,at,the,beautiful,heavy,crystal,decanter,and,the,promise,of,escape,that,lay,within,it,[END]
slowly,watching,her,movements,in,the,mirror,she,lifted,the,decanter,and,backed,away,from,her,frightening,reflection,[END]
then,she,drew,in,a,long,breath,and,swung,her,arm,with,all,the,strength,she,could,find,[END]
the,decanter,sparkled,blue,and,red,and,violet,in,the,sunlight,as,it,crashed,into,the,huge,mirror,[END]
for,an,instant,scarlett,saw,her,face,cracking,into,pieces,saw,her,twisted,smile,of,victory,[END]
then,the,silvered,glass,fragmented,and,tiny,shards,spattered,onto,the,sideboard,[END]
the,top,of,the,mirror,seemed,to,lean,forward,from,its,frame,and,huge,jagged,pieces,fell,crashing,with,a,sound,like,cannon,fire,onto,the,sideboard,the,floor,the,pieces,that,had,fallen,first,[END]
scarlett,was,crying,and,laughing,and,shouting,at,the,destruction,of,her,own,image,[END]
coward,[END]
coward,[END]
coward,[END]
she,didn't,feel,the,tiny,cuts,that,flying,bits,of,glass,made,on,her,arms,and,neck,and,face,[END]
her,tongue,tasted,salt,she,touched,the,trickle,of,blood,on,her,cheek,and,looked,in,surprise,at,her,reddened,fingers,[END]
she,stared,at,the,place,where,her,reflection,had,been,but,it,was,gone,[END]
she,laughed,unevenly,[END]
good,riddance,[END]
the,servants,had,rushed,to,the,door,when,they,heard,the,noise,[END]
they,stood,very,close,to,one,another,afraid,to,enter,the,room,looking,fearfully,at,scarlett's,rigid,figure,[END]
she,turned,her,head,suddenly,towards,them,and,pansy,let,out,a,little,cry,of,terror,at,the,sight,of,her,blood-smeared,face,[END]
go,away,scarlett,said,calmly,[END]
i,am,perfectly,all,right,[END]
go,away,[END]
i,want,to,be,by,myself,[END]
they,obeyed,without,a,word,[END]
she,was,by,herself,whether,she,wanted,to,be,or,not,and,no,amount,of,brandy,would,make,it,any,different,[END]
rhett,wasn't,coming,home,this,house,wasn't,home,to,him,any,more,[END]
she'd,known,that,for,a,long,time,but,she'd,refused,to,face,it,[END]
she'd,been,a,coward,and,a,fool,[END]
no,wonder,she,hadn't,known,that,woman,in,the,mirror,[END]
that,cowardly,fool,wasn't,scarlett,o'hara,[END]
scarlett,o'hara,didn't,what,did,they,call,it,drown,her,sorrows,[END]
scarlett,o'hara,didn't,hide,and,hope,[END]
she,faced,the,worst,the,world,could,hand,her,[END]
and,she,went,out,into,the,danger,to,take,what,she,wanted,[END]
scarlett,shuddered,[END]
she,had,come,so,close,to,defeating,herself,[END]
no,more,[END]
it,was,time,long,past,time,to,take,her,life,in,her,own,hands,[END]
no,more,brandy,[END]
she,had,flung,away,that,crutch,[END]
her,whole,body,was,crying,out,for,a,drink,but,she,refused,to,listen,[END]
she'd,done,harder,things,in,her,life,she,could,do,this,[END]
she,had,to,[END]
she,shook,her,fist,at,the,broken,mirror,[END]
bring,on,your,seven,years,bad,luck,damn,you,[END]
her,defiant,laugh,was,ragged,[END]
she,leaned,against,the,table,for,a,moment,while,she,gathered,her,strength,[END]
she,had,so,much,to,do,[END]
then,she,walked,over,the,destruction,around,her,her,heels,breaking,the,mirror,into,bits,[END]
pansy,[END]
she,called,from,the,doorway,[END]
i,want,you,to,wash,my,hair,[END]
scarlett,was,trembling,from,head,to,toe,but,she,made,her,legs,carry,her,to,the,staircase,and,climb,the,long,flight,of,stairs,[END]
my,skin,must,be,like,corduroy,she,said,aloud,concentrating,her,mind,away,from,the,cravings,of,her,body,[END]
i'll,need,to,use,quarts,of,rosewater,and,glycerine,[END]
and,i,have,to,get,all,new,clothes,[END]
mrs,marie,can,hire,extra,sewing,help,[END]
it,shouldn't,take,more,than,a,few,weeks,to,get,over,her,weakness,and,get,back,to,looking,her,best,[END]
she,wouldn't,let,it,[END]
she,had,to,be,strong,and,beautiful,and,she,had,no,time,to,waste,[END]
she'd,lost,too,much,of,it,already,[END]
rhett,hadn't,come,back,to,her,so,she'd,have,to,go,to,him,[END]
to,charleston,[END]
high,stakes,[END]
10,[END]
once,her,mind,was,made,up,scarlett's,life,changed,radically,[END]
she,had,a,goal,now,and,all,her,energy,poured,into,achieving,it,[END]
she'd,think,later,about,exactly,how,she,was,going,to,get,rhett,back,after,she,arrived,in,charleston,[END]
for,now,she,had,to,get,ready,to,go,[END]
mrs,marie,threw,up,her,hands,and,declared,it,impossible,to,make,a,complete,new,wardrobe,in,only,a,few,weeks,uncle,henry,hamilton,put,his,fingertips,together,and,expressed,his,disapproval,when,scarlett,told,him,what,she,needed,him,to,do,[END]
their,opposition,made,scarlett's,eyes,gleam,with,the,joy,of,battle,and,in,the,end,she,won,[END]
by,the,beginning,of,november,uncle,henry,had,taken,over,the,financial,management,of,the,store,and,saloon,with,a,guarantee,that,the,money,would,go,to,joe,colleton,[END]
and,scarlett's,bedroom,was,a,chaos,of,color,and,laces,her,new,clothes,laid,out,to,be,packed,for,the,trip,[END]
she,was,still,thin,and,there,were,faint,bruise-like,shadows,under,her,eyes,because,the,nights,had,been,torments,of,sleeplessness,and,fierce,efforts,of,will,to,resist,the,rest,promised,by,the,decanter,of,brandy,[END]
but,she,had,won,that,battle,too,and,her,normal,appetite,for,food,had,returned,[END]
her,face,was,already,filled,out,enough,so,that,a,dimple,flickered,when,she,smiled,and,her,bosom,was,enticingly,plump,[END]
with,a,skillful,application,of,rouge,on,her,lips,and,cheeks,she,looked,almost,like,a,girl,again,she,was,sure,[END]
it,was,time,to,go,[END]
goodbye,atlanta,scarlett,said,silently,when,the,train,pulled,out,of,the,station,[END]
you,tried,to,beat,me,down,but,i,wouldn't,let,you,[END]
i,don't,care,if,you,approve,of,me,or,not,[END]
she,told,herself,that,the,chill,she,felt,must,be,from,a,draft,[END]
she,wasn't,afraid,not,a,bit,[END]
she,was,going,to,have,a,wonderful,time,in,charleston,[END]
didn't,people,always,say,that,it,was,the,partyingest,town,in,the,whole,south,[END]
and,there,was,no,question,at,all,about,being,invited,everywhere,aunt,pauline,and,aunt,eulalie,knew,everybody,[END]
they'd,know,all,about,rhett,where,he,was,living,what,he,was,doing,[END]
all,she'd,have,to,do,was,[END]
no,sense,thinking,about,that,now,[END]
she'd,decide,when,she,got,there,[END]
if,she,thought,about,it,now,she,might,feel,nervous,about,going,and,she,had,made,up,her,mind,to,go,[END]
gracious,[END]
it,was,silly,even,to,imagine,being,nervous,[END]
it,wasn't,as,if,charleston,was,the,end,of,the,world,[END]
why,tony,fontaine,went,off,to,texas,a,million,miles,away,just,as,easy,as,if,it,was,no,more,than,a,ride,over,to,decatur,[END]
she'd,been,to,charleston,before,too,[END]
she,knew,where,she,was,going,[END]
it,didn't,mean,a,thing,that,she,had,hated,it,[END]
after,all,she'd,been,so,young,then,only,seventeen,and,a,new,widow,with,a,baby,besides,[END]
wade,hampton,hadn't,even,cut,his,teeth,yet,[END]
that,was,over,twelve,years,ago,[END]
everything,would,be,completely,different,now,[END]
it,was,all,going,to,work,out,just,fine,just,the,way,she,wanted,[END]
pansy,go,tell,the,conductor,to,move,our,things,i,want,to,sit,closer,to,the,stove,[END]
there's,a,draft,from,this,window,[END]
scarlett,sent,a,telegram,to,her,aunts,from,the,station,in,augusta,where,she,changed,to,the,south,carolina,railroad,line,[END]
arriving,four,pm,train,for,visit,stop,only,one,servant,stop,love,scarlett,[END]
she,had,thought,it,all,out,[END]
exactly,ten,words,and,there,was,no,risk,that,her,aunts,would,wire,back,some,excuse,to,keep,her,from,coming,because,she,was,already,on,her,way,[END]
not,that,they'd,be,likely,to,[END]
eulalie,was,forever,begging,her,to,come,see,them,and,hospitality,was,still,the,unwritten,law,of,the,land,in,the,south,[END]
but,no,sense,gambling,when,you,could,have,a,sure,thing,and,she,had,to,have,her,aunts',house,and,protection,to,begin,with,[END]
charleston,was,a,mighty,stuck-up,proud,place,and,rhett,was,obviously,trying,to,turn,people,against,her,[END]
no,she,wouldn't,think,about,that,[END]
she,was,going,to,love,charleston,this,time,[END]
she,was,determined,[END]
everything,was,going,to,be,different,[END]
her,whole,life,was,going,to,be,different,[END]
don't,look,back,she'd,always,told,herself,[END]
now,she,truly,meant,it,[END]
her,whole,life,was,behind,her,further,behind,with,each,turn,of,the,wheels,[END]
all,the,demands,of,her,businesses,were,in,uncle,henry's,hands,her,responsibilities,to,melanie,were,taken,care,of,her,children,were,settled,at,tara,[END]
for,the,first,time,in,her,adult,life,she,was,free,to,do,anything,she,wanted,to,do,and,she,knew,what,that,was,[END]
she'd,prove,to,rhett,that,he,was,wrong,when,he,refused,to,believe,that,she,loved,him,[END]
she'd,show,him,that,she,did,[END]
he'd,see,[END]
and,then,he'd,be,sorry,he'd,left,her,[END]
he'd,put,his,arms,around,her,and,kiss,her,and,they'd,be,happy,forever,after,[END]
even,in,charleston,if,he,insisted,on,staying,there,[END]
lost,in,her,daydream,scarlett,didn't,notice,the,man,who,got,onto,the,train,at,ridgeville,until,he,lurched,against,the,arm,of,her,seat,[END]
then,she,recoiled,as,if,he,had,struck,her,[END]
he,was,in,the,blue,uniform,of,the,union,army,[END]
a,yankee,[END]
what,was,he,doing,here,[END]
those,days,were,done,and,she,wanted,to,forget,them,forever,but,the,sight,of,the,uniform,brought,them,all,back,[END]
the,fear,when,atlanta,was,under,siege,the,brutality,of,the,soldiers,when,they,stripped,tara,of,its,pitiful,store,of,food,and,set,fire,to,the,house,the,explosion,of,blood,when,she,shot,the,straggler,before,he,could,rape,her,[END]
scarlett,felt,her,heart,pounding,with,terror,all,over,again,and,she,almost,cried,out,[END]
damn,them,damn,them,all,for,destroying,the,south,[END]
damn,them,most,of,all,for,making,her,feel,helpless,and,afraid,[END]
she,hated,the,feeling,and,she,hated,them,[END]
i,won't,let,it,upset,me,i,won't,[END]
i,can't,let,anything,bother,me,now,not,when,i,need,to,be,at,my,best,ready,for,charleston,and,rhett,[END]
i,won't,look,at,the,yankee,and,i,won't,think,about,the,past,[END]
only,the,future,counts,now,[END]
scarlett,stared,resolutely,out,the,window,at,the,hilly,countryside,so,similar,to,the,land,around,atlanta,[END]
red,clay,roads,through,stands,of,dark,pine,woods,and,fields,of,frostdarkened,crop,stubble,[END]
she'd,been,travelling,for,more,than,a,day,and,she,might,as,well,have,never,left,home,[END]
hurry,she,urged,the,engine,do,hurry,[END]
what's,charleston,like,miss,scarlett,[END]
pansy,asked,for,the,hundredth,time,just,as,the,light,was,beginning,to,fade,outside,the,window,[END]
very,pretty,you'll,like,it,fine,scarlett,answered,for,the,hundredth,time,[END]
there,[END]
she,pointed,at,the,landscape,[END]
see,that,tree,with,the,stuff,hanging,off,it,[END]
that's,the,spanish,moss,i,told,you,about,[END]
pansy,pressed,her,nose,to,the,sooty,pane,[END]
oooh,she,whimpered,[END]
it,looks,like,ghosts,moving,[END]
i'm,scared,of,ghosts,miss,scarlett,[END]
don't,be,a,ninny,[END]
but,scarlett,shivered,[END]
the,long,swaying,gray,wisps,of,moss,were,eerie,in,the,gray,light,and,she,didn't,like,the,way,it,looked,either,[END]
it,meant,that,they,were,moving,into,the,low-country,though,close,to,the,sea,and,to,charleston,[END]
scarlett,peered,at,her,lapel,watch,[END]
five-thirty,[END]
the,train,was,over,two,hours,late,[END]
her,aunts,would,have,waited,she,was,sure,[END]
but,even,so,she,wished,she,wouldn't,be,arriving,after,dark,[END]
there,was,something,so,unfriendly,about,the,dark,[END]
the,cavernous,station,in,charleston,was,poorly,lit,[END]
scarlett,craned,her,neck,searching,for,her,aunts,or,for,a,coachman,who,might,be,their,servant,looking,for,her,[END]
what,she,saw,instead,were,a,half,dozen,more,soldiers,in,blue,uniform,carrying,guns,slung,over,their,shoulders,[END]
miss,scarlett,pansy,tugged,on,her,sleeve,[END]
there's,soldiers,everywhere,[END]
the,young,maid's,voice,was,quavering,[END]
her,fear,forced,scarlett,to,appear,brave,[END]
just,act,like,they're,not,here,at,all,pansy,[END]
they,can't,hurt,you,the,war's,been,over,for,practically,ten,years,[END]
come,on,[END]
she,gestured,to,the,porter,who,was,pushing,the,cart,with,her,luggage,[END]
where,would,i,find,the,carriage,that's,meeting,me,[END]
she,asked,haughtily,[END]
he,led,the,way,outside,but,the,only,vehicle,there,was,a,ramshackle,buggy,with,a,swaybacked,horse,and,a,dishevelled,black,driver,[END]
scarlett's,heart,sank,[END]
suppose,her,aunts,were,out,of,town,[END]
they,went,to,savannah,to,visit,their,father,she,knew,[END]
suppose,her,telegram,was,just,sitting,on,the,front,stoop,of,a,dark,empty,house,[END]
she,drew,in,a,long,breath,[END]
she,didn't,care,what,the,story,was,she,had,to,get,away,from,the,station,and,the,yankee,soldiers,[END]
i'll,break,a,window,to,get,into,the,house,if,i,have,to,[END]
why,shouldn't,i,[END]
i'll,just,pay,to,get,it,fixed,the,same,way,i,paid,to,fix,the,roof,for,them,and,everything,else,[END]
she'd,been,sending,her,aunts,money,to,live,on,ever,since,they,lost,all,of,theirs,during,the,war,[END]
put,my,things,in,that,hack,she,ordered,the,porter,and,tell,the,driver,to,get,down,and,help,you,[END]
i'm,going,to,the,battery,[END]
the,magic,word,battery,had,exactly,the,effect,she,hoped,for,[END]
both,driver,and,porter,became,respectful,and,eager,to,be,of,service,[END]
so,it's,still,the,most,fashionable,address,in,charleston,scarlett,thought,with,relief,[END]
thank,goodness,[END]
it,would,be,too,awful,if,rhett,heard,i,was,living,in,a,slum,[END]
pauline,and,eulalie,threw,open,the,door,of,their,house,the,moment,the,buggy,stopped,[END]
golden,light,streamed,out,onto,the,path,from,the,sidewalk,and,scarlett,ran,through,it,to,the,sanctuary,it,promised,[END]
but,they,looked,so,old,[END]
she,thought,when,she,was,close,to,her,aunts,[END]
i,don't,remember,aunt,pauline,being,skinny,as,a,stick,and,all,wrinkled,like,that,[END]
and,when,did,aunt,eulalie,get,so,fat,[END]
she,looks,like,a,balloon,with,gray,hair,on,top,[END]
look,at,you,[END]
eulalie,exclaimed,[END]
you've,changed,so,scarlett,why,i'd,hardly,know,you,[END]
scarlett,quailed,[END]
surely,she,hadn't,got,old,too,had,she,[END]
she,accepted,her,aunts',embraces,and,forced,a,smile,[END]
look,at,scarlett,sister,eulalie,burbled,[END]
she's,grown,up,to,be,the,image,of,ellen,[END]
pauline,sniffed,[END]
ellen,was,never,this,thin,sister,you,know,that,[END]
she,took,scarlett's,arm,and,pulled,her,away,from,eulalie,[END]
there,is,a,clear,resemblance,though,i,will,say,that,[END]
scarlett,smiled,this,time,happily,[END]
there,was,no,greater,compliment,in,the,world,that,anyone,could,pay,her,[END]
the,aunts,fluttered,and,argued,about,the,business,of,settling,pansy,in,the,servants',quarters,and,getting,the,trunks,and,valises,carried,upstairs,to,scarlett's,bedroom,[END]
don't,you,lift,a,finger,honey,eulalie,said,to,scarlett,[END]
you,must,be,worn,out,after,that,long,trip,[END]
scarlett,settled,herself,gratefully,on,a,settee,in,the,drawing,room,away,from,the,fuss,[END]
now,that,she,was,finally,here,the,feverish,energy,that,had,gotten,her,through,the,preparations,seemed,to,have,evaporated,and,she,realized,that,her,aunt,was,right,[END]
she,was,worn,out,[END]
she,all,but,dozed,off,during,supper,[END]
both,her,aunts,had,soft,voices,with,the,characteristic,low-country,accent,that,elongated,vowels,and,blurred,consonants,[END]
even,though,their,conversation,consisted,largely,of,politely,expressed,disagreement,on,everything,the,sound,of,it,was,lulling,[END]
also,they,weren't,saying,anything,that,interested,her,at,all,[END]
she'd,learned,what,she,wanted,to,know,almost,as,soon,as,she,stepped,across,the,threshold,[END]
rhett,was,living,at,his,mother's,house,but,he,was,out,of,town,[END]
gone,north,pauline,said,with,a,sour,expression,[END]
but,for,good,reason,sister,eulalie,reminded,her,[END]
he's,in,philadelphia,buying,back,some,of,the,family,silver,that,the,yankees,stole,[END]
pauline,relented,[END]
it's,a,joy,to,see,how,devoted,he,is,to,his,mother's,happiness,finding,all,the,things,that,she,lost,[END]
this,time,eulalie,was,the,critic,[END]
he,could,have,shown,some,of,that,devotion,a,lot,sooner,if,you,ask,me,[END]
scarlett,didn't,ask,[END]
she,was,busy,with,her,own,thoughts,which,were,concentrated,on,wondering,how,soon,she,could,go,up,to,bed,[END]
no,sleeplessness,would,plague,her,tonight,she,was,sure,of,it,[END]
and,she,was,right,[END]
now,that,she'd,taken,her,life,in,her,own,hands,and,was,on,her,way,to,getting,what,she,wanted,she,could,sleep,like,a,baby,[END]
she,woke,in,the,morning,with,a,sense,of,wellbeing,that,she,hadn't,felt,for,years,[END]
she,was,welcome,at,her,aunts',not,shunned,and,lonely,like,in,atlanta,and,she,didn't,even,have,to,think,yet,about,what,she'd,say,to,rhett,when,she,saw,him,[END]
she,could,relax,and,be,spoiled,a,little,while,she,waited,for,him,to,get,back,from,philadelphia,[END]
her,aunt,eulalie,punctured,scarlett's,bubble,before,she'd,finished,her,first,cup,of,breakfast,coffee,[END]
i,know,how,anxious,you,must,be,to,see,carreen,honey,but,she,only,has,visitors,on,tuesdays,and,saturdays,so,we've,planned,something,else,for,today,[END]
carreen,[END]
scarlett's,lips,tightened,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,see,her,at,all,the,traitor,[END]
giving,her,share,of,tara,away,as,if,it,meant,nothing,at,all,[END]
but,what,was,she,going,to,say,to,the,aunts,[END]
they'd,never,understand,that,a,sister,wouldn't,be,just,dying,to,see,another,sister,[END]
why,they,even,live,together,they're,so,close,[END]
i'll,have,to,pretend,i,want,to,see,carreen,more,than,anything,in,the,world,and,get,a,headache,when,it's,time,to,go,[END]
suddenly,she,realized,what,pauline,was,saying,and,her,head,did,begin,to,throb,painfully,at,the,temples,[END]
so,we,sent,our,maid,susie,with,a,note,to,eleanor,butler,[END]
we'll,call,on,her,this,morning,[END]
she,reached,for,the,bowl,of,butter,[END]
would,you,please,pass,the,syrup,scarlett,[END]
scarlett's,hand,reached,out,automatically,but,she,knocked,over,the,pitcher,spilling,the,syrup,[END]
rhett's,mother,[END]
she,wasn't,ready,to,see,rhett's,mother,yet,[END]
she'd,only,met,eleanor,butler,once,at,bonnie's,funeral,and,she,had,almost,no,memory,of,her,except,that,mrs,butler,was,very,tall,and,dignified,and,imposingly,silent,[END]
i,know,i'll,have,to,see,her,scarlett,thought,but,not,now,not,yet,[END]
i'm,not,ready,[END]
her,heart,pounded,and,she,dabbed,clumsily,with,her,napkin,at,the,spreading,stickiness,on,the,tablecloth,[END]
scarlett,dear,don't,rub,the,stain,into,the,cloth,like,that,[END]
pauline,put,her,hand,on,scarlett's,wrist,[END]
scarlett,jerked,her,hand,away,[END]
how,could,anyone,worry,about,some,silly,old,tablecloth,at,a,time,like,this,[END]
i'm,sorry,auntie,she,managed,to,say,[END]
that's,all,right,dear,[END]
it's,just,that,you're,practically,putting,a,hole,through,it,and,we,have,so,few,of,our,nice,things,left,[END]
eulalie's,voice,faded,mournfully,[END]
scarlett,clenched,her,teeth,[END]
she,wanted,to,scream,[END]
what,did,a,tablecloth,matter,when,she,had,to,face,the,mother,rhett,practically,worshipped,[END]
suppose,he'd,told,her,the,truth,about,why,he'd,left,atlanta,that,he,had,walked,out,on,the,marriage,[END]
i'd,better,go,look,at,my,clothes,scarlett,said,through,the,constriction,in,her,throat,[END]
pansy'll,have,to,press,the,wrinkles,out,of,whatever,i'm,going,to,wear,[END]
she,had,to,get,away,from,pauline,and,eulalie,she,had,to,pull,herself,together,[END]
i'll,tell,susie,to,start,heating,the,irons,eulalie,offered,[END]
she,rang,the,silver,bell,near,her,plate,[END]
she'd,better,wash,out,this,cloth,before,she,starts,on,anything,else,pauline,said,[END]
once,a,stain,sets,[END]
you,might,observe,sister,that,i,have,not,yet,finished,my,breakfast,[END]
surely,you,don't,expect,me,to,let,it,get,cold,while,susie,clears,everything,off,the,table,[END]
scarlett,fled,to,her,room,[END]
you,won't,need,that,heavy,fur,cape,scarlett,said,pauline,[END]
indeed,not,said,eulalie,[END]
we,have,a,typical,charleston,winter,day,today,[END]
why,i,wouldn't,even,wear,this,shawl,if,i,didn't,have,a,cold,[END]
scarlett,unhooked,the,cape,and,handed,it,to,pansy,[END]
if,eulalie,wanted,everyone,else,to,have,a,cold,too,she'd,be,glad,to,oblige,her,[END]
her,aunts,must,take,her,for,a,fool,[END]
she,knew,why,they,didn't,want,her,to,wear,her,cape,[END]
they,were,just,like,the,old,guard,in,atlanta,[END]
a,person,had,to,be,shabby,like,them,to,be,respectable,[END]
she,noticed,eulalie,eyeing,the,fashionable,feather-trimmed,hat,she,was,wearing,and,her,jaw,hardened,belligerently,[END]
if,she,had,to,face,rhett's,mother,at,least,she,would,do,it,in,style,[END]
let's,be,off,then,said,eulalie,capitulating,[END]
susie,pulled,the,big,door,open,and,scarlett,followed,her,aunts,out,into,the,bright,day,[END]
she,gasped,when,she,stepped,down,from,the,entrance,[END]
it,was,like,may,not,november,[END]
sun,reflected,warmth,from,the,white,crushed,shell,of,the,path,and,settled,on,her,shoulders,like,a,weightless,blanket,[END]
she,tilted,her,chin,up,to,feel,it,on,her,face,and,her,eyes,closed,in,sensuous,pleasure,[END]
oh,aunties,this,feels,wonderful,she,said,[END]
i,hope,your,carriage,has,a,fold-down,top,[END]
the,aunts,laughed,[END]
dear,child,eulalie,said,there's,not,a,living,soul,in,charleston,with,a,carriage,any,more,except,for,sally,brewton,[END]
we'll,walk,[END]
everyone,does,[END]
there,are,carriages,sister,pauline,corrected,[END]
the,carpetbaggers,have,them,[END]
you,could,hardly,call,the,carpetbaggers,living,souls,',sister,[END]
soulless,is,what,they,are,else,they,couldn't,be,carpetbaggers,[END]
vultures,pauline,agreed,with,a,sniff,[END]
buzzards,said,eulalie,[END]
the,sisters,laughed,again,[END]
scarlett,laughed,with,them,[END]
the,beautiful,day,was,making,her,feel,almost,giddy,with,delight,[END]
nothing,could,possibly,go,wrong,on,a,day,like,this,[END]
suddenly,she,felt,a,great,fondness,for,her,aunts,even,for,their,harmless,quarreling,[END]
she,followed,them,across,the,wide,empty,street,in,front,of,the,house,and,up,the,short,stairway,on,the,other,side,of,it,[END]
as,she,reached,the,top,of,it,a,breeze,fluttered,the,feathers,on,her,hat,and,touched,her,lips,with,a,taste,of,salt,[END]
oh,my,goodness,she,said,[END]
on,the,far,side,of,the,elevated,promenade,the,green-brown,waters,of,charleston's,harbor,stretched,before,her,to,the,horizon,[END]
to,her,left,flags,fluttered,on,the,tall,masts,of,ships,along,the,wharves,[END]
to,her,right,the,trees,of,a,long,low,island,glowed,a,bright,green,[END]
the,sunlight,glittered,on,the,tips,of,tiny,pointed,wavelets,like,diamonds,scattered,across,the,water,[END]
a,trio,of,brilliantly,white,birds,soared,in,the,cloudless,blue,sky,then,swooped,down,to,skim,the,tops,of,the,waves,[END]
they,looked,as,if,they,were,playing,a,game,a,weightless,carefree,kind,of,follow-the-leader,[END]
the,salt-sweet,light,breeze,caressed,her,neck,[END]
she'd,been,right,to,come,she,was,sure,of,it,now,[END]
she,turned,to,her,aunts,[END]
it's,a,wonderful,day,scarlett,said,[END]
the,promenade,was,so,wide,they,walked,three,abreast,along,it,[END]
twice,they,met,other,people,first,an,elderly,gentleman,in,an,oldfashioned,frock,coat,and,beaver,hat,then,a,lady,accompanied,by,a,thin,boy,who,blushed,when,he,was,spoken,to,[END]
each,time,they,stopped,and,the,aunts,introduced,scarlett,[END]
our,niece,from,atlanta,[END]
her,mother,was,our,sister,ellen,and,she's,married,to,eleanor,butler's,boy,rhett,[END]
the,old,gentleman,bowed,and,kissed,scarlett's,hand,the,lady,introduced,her,grandson,who,gazed,at,scarlett,as,if,he,had,been,struck,by,lightning,[END]
for,scarlett,the,day,was,getting,better,with,every,passing,minute,[END]
then,she,saw,that,the,next,walkers,approaching,them,were,men,in,blue,uniforms,[END]
her,step,faltered,she,grabbed,pauline's,arm,[END]
auntie,she,whispered,there,are,yankee,soldiers,coming,at,us,[END]
keep,walking,said,pauline,clearly,[END]
they'll,have,to,get,out,of,our,way,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,pauline,with,shock,[END]
who,would,have,thought,that,her,skinny,old,aunt,could,be,so,brave,[END]
her,own,heart,was,thumping,so,loud,that,she,was,sure,the,yankee,soldiers,would,hear,it,but,she,willed,her,feet,to,move,[END]
when,only,three,paces,separated,them,the,soldiers,drew,aside,pressing,their,bodies,against,the,railings,of,metal,pipe,that,lined,the,edge,of,the,walkway,along,the,water,[END]
pauline,and,eulalie,sailed,past,them,as,if,they,were,not,there,[END]
scarlett,lifted,her,chin,to,equal,the,tilt,of,her,aunts',and,kept,pace,[END]
somewhere,ahead,of,them,a,band,began,to,play,oh,[END]
susanna,[END]
the,rollicking,merry,tune,was,as,bright,and,sunny,as,the,day,[END]
eulalie,and,pauline,walked,more,quickly,keeping,time,with,the,music,but,scarlett's,feet,felt,like,lead,[END]
coward,[END]
she,berated,herself,[END]
but,inside,she,couldn't,stop,trembling,[END]
why,are,there,so,many,damned,yankees,in,charleston,[END]
she,asked,angrily,[END]
i,saw,some,at,the,depot,too,[END]
my,goodness,scarlett,said,eulalie,didn't,you,know,[END]
charleston,is,still,under,military,occupation,[END]
they'll,likely,never,leave,us,alone,[END]
they,hate,us,because,we,threw,them,out,of,fort,sumter,and,then,held,it,against,their,whole,fleet,[END]
and,heaven,only,knows,how,many,regiments,pauline,added,[END]
the,sisters',faces,were,glowing,with,pride,[END]
mother,of,god,scarlett,whispered,[END]
what,had,she,done,[END]
walked,right,into,the,arms,of,the,enemy,[END]
she,knew,what,military,government,meant,the,helplessness,and,the,rage,the,constant,fear,that,they'd,confiscate,your,house,or,put,you,in,jail,or,shoot,you,if,you,broke,one,of,their,laws,[END]
military,government,was,all-powerful,[END]
she,had,lived,under,its,capricious,rule,for,five,harsh,years,[END]
how,could,she,have,been,such,a,fool,as,to,stumble,back,into,it,again,[END]
they,do,have,a,pleasant,band,said,pauline,[END]

she,couldn't,go,in,she,couldn't,[END]
she'd,never,seen,any,place,as,grand,as,impressive,[END]

who,could,destroy,all,her,hopes,with,one,word,to,rhett,[END]

scarlett,allowed,herself,to,be,led,like,a,sleepwalker,[END]

scarlett,closed,her,eyes,[END]
the,faint,scent,of,lemon,verbena,surrounded,her,floating,gently,from,eleanor,butler's,silk,gown,and,silken,hair,[END]
it,was,the,fragrance,that,had,always,been,part,of,ellen,o'hara,the,scent,for,scarlett,of,comfort,of,safety,of,love,of,life,before,the,war,[END]

11,[END]
eleanor,butler,was,a,southern,lady,[END]
her,slow,soft,voice,and,indolent,graceful,movements,disguised,a,formidable,energy,and,efficiency,[END]
ladies,were,trained,from,birth,to,be,decorative,to,be,sympathetic,and,fascinated,listeners,to,be,appealingly,helpless,and,empty-headed,and,admiring,[END]
they,were,also,trained,to,manage,the,intricate,and,demanding,responsibilities,of,huge,houses,and,large,often,warring,staffs,of,servants,while,always,making,it,seem,that,the,house,the,garden,the,kitchen,the,servants,ran,themselves,flawlessly,while,the,lady,of,the,house,concentrated,on,matching,colors,of,silk,for,her,delicate,embroidery,[END]
when,the,deprivations,of,war,reduced,the,staffs,of,thirty,or,forty,to,one,or,two,the,demands,on,women,increased,exponentially,but,the,expectations,remained,the,same,[END]
the,battered,houses,must,continue,to,welcome,guests,shelter,families,sparkle,with,clean,windows,and,shining,brass,and,have,a,well-groomed,imperturbable,accomplished,mistress,at,leisure,in,the,drawing,room,[END]
somehow,the,ladies,of,the,south,did,it,[END]
eleanor,soothed,scarlett,with,gentle,words,and,fragrant,tea,flattered,pauline,by,asking,her,opinion,of,the,desk,recently,installed,in,the,drawing,room,diverted,eulalie,with,a,plea,to,taste,the,pound,cake,and,judge,if,the,extract,of,vanilla,bean,was,strong,enough,[END]
she,also,murmured,to,manigo,her,manservant,that,her,maid,celie,would,help,him,and,scarlett's,maid,transfer,scarlett's,things,from,her,aunts',house,to,the,big,bedroom,overlooking,the,garden,where,mr,rhett,slept,[END]
in,under,ten,minutes,everything,had,been,accomplished,to,move,scarlett,without,opposition,or,injured,feelings,or,interruption,to,the,even,rhythm,of,the,tranquil,life,under,eleanor,butler's,roof,[END]
scarlett,felt,like,a,girl,again,safe,from,all,harm,sheltered,by,a,mother's,all-powerful,love,[END]
she,gazed,at,eleanor,through,misted,admiring,eyes,[END]
this,was,what,she,wanted,to,be,had,always,meant,to,be,a,lady,like,her,mother,like,eleanor,butler,[END]
ellen,o'hara,had,instructed,her,to,be,a,lady,had,planned,for,it,and,wanted,it,[END]
i,can,do,it,now,scarlett,told,herself,[END]
i,can,make,up,for,all,the,mistakes,i,made,[END]
i,can,make,mother,proud,of,me,[END]
when,she,was,a,child,mammy,had,described,heaven,to,her,as,a,land,of,clouds,like,big,feather,mattresses,where,angels,rested,amusing,themselves,by,looking,down,at,the,goings-on,below,through,cracks,in,the,sky,[END]
ever,since,her,mother,died,scarlett,had,had,an,uncomfortable,childish,conviction,that,ellen,was,watching,her,with,unhappy,concern,[END]
i'll,make,it,all,better,now,she,promised,her,mother,[END]
eleanor's,affectionate,welcome,had,for,the,moment,erased,all,the,fears,and,memories,that,filled,her,heart,and,mind,when,she,saw,the,yankee,soldiers,[END]
it,had,even,wiped,out,scarlett's,unacknowledged,anxiety,about,her,decision,to,follow,rhett,to,charleston,[END]
she,felt,safe,and,loved,and,invincible,[END]
she,could,do,anything,everything,[END]
and,she,would,[END]
she,would,win,rhett's,love,again,[END]
she,would,be,the,lady,ellen,always,meant,for,her,to,be,[END]
she,would,be,admired,and,respected,and,adored,by,everyone,[END]
and,she,would,never,ever,be,lonely,again,[END]
when,pauline,closed,the,last,tiny,ivory-inlaid,drawer,of,the,rosewood,desk,and,eulalie,hurriedly,swallowed,the,last,slice,of,cake,eleanor,butler,stood,pulling,scarlett,up,with,her,[END]
i,have,to,pick,up,my,boots,from,the,cobbler,this,morning,she,said,so,i'll,take,scarlett,along,and,introduce,her,to,king,street,[END]
no,woman,can,possibly,feel,at,home,until,she,knows,where,the,shops,are,[END]
will,you,all,join,us,[END]
to,scarlett's,immense,relief,her,aunts,declined,[END]
she,wanted,mrs,butler,all,to,herself,[END]
the,walk,to,charleston's,shops,was,pure,pleasure,in,the,warm,bright,winter,sunlight,[END]
king,street,was,a,revelation,and,a,delight,[END]
stores,lined,it,for,block,after,block,dry,goods,hardware,boots,tobacco,and,cigars,hats,jewelry,china,seeds,medicines,wines,books,gloves,candies,it,seemed,that,everything,and,anything,could,be,bought,on,king,street,[END]
there,were,crowds,of,shoppers,too,and,dozens,of,smart,buggies,and,open,carriages,with,liveried,drivers,and,fashionably,dressed,occupants,[END]
charleston,was,nowhere,near,as,dreary,as,she,had,remembered,it,and,feared,it,to,be,[END]
it,was,much,bigger,and,busier,than,atlanta,[END]
and,no,sign,of,the,panic,at,all,[END]
unfortunately,rhett's,mother,behaved,as,if,none,of,the,color,and,excitement,and,busyness,existed,[END]
she,walked,past,windows,full,of,ostrich,plumes,and,painted,fans,without,looking,at,them,crossed,the,street,without,so,much,as,a,thank,you,to,the,women,in,the,buggy,that,had,stopped,to,avoid,hitting,her,[END]
scarlett,remembered,what,her,aunts,had,told,her,there,wasn't,a,carriage,to,he,had,in,charleston,except,those,owned,by,yankees,carpetbaggers,and,scallywags,[END]
she,felt,a,rush,of,white-hot,rage,at,the,vultures,that,were,fattening,on,the,defeated,south,[END]
when,she,followed,mrs,butler,into,one,of,the,boot,shops,it,did,her,heart,good,to,see,the,proprietor,turn,over,his,richly,dressed,customer,to,a,young,assistant,so,that,he,could,hurry,forward,to,rhett's,mother,[END]
it,was,a,pleasure,to,be,with,a,member,of,the,old,guard,in,charleston,[END]
she,wished,fervently,that,mrs,merriwether,or,mrs,elsing,were,there,to,see,her,[END]
i,left,some,boots,to,be,resoled,mr,braxton,eleanor,said,and,i,also,want,my,daughter-in-law,to,know,where,to,come,for,the,finest,footwear,and,the,most,agreeable,service,[END]
scarlett,dear,mr,braxton,will,take,the,same,good,care,of,you,that,he,has,of,me,for,all,these,years,[END]
it,will,be,my,privilege,ma'am,[END]
mr,braxton,bowed,elegantly,[END]
how,do,you,do,mr,braxton,and,i,thank,you,scarlett,replied,with,great,refinement,[END]
i,believe,i'll,get,a,pair,of,boots,today,myself,[END]
she,raised,her,skirt,a,few,inches,to,display,her,fragile,thin,leather,shoes,[END]
something,more,suitable,for,city,walking,she,said,proudly,[END]
no,one,was,going,to,take,her,for,a,carriage-riding,scallywag,[END]
mr,braxton,took,an,immaculate,white,handkerchief,from,his,pocket,and,brushed,off,the,spotless,upholstery,on,two,chairs,[END]
if,you,ladies,please,[END]
when,he,disappeared,behind,a,curtain,in,the,rear,of,the,shop,eleanor,leaned,close,to,scarlett,and,whispered,in,her,ear,[END]
look,closely,at,his,hair,when,he,kneels,to,fit,your,boots,[END]
he,colors,it,with,boot,polish,[END]
it,took,all,of,scarlett's,self-control,not,to,laugh,when,she,saw,that,mrs,butler,was,right,especially,when,eleanor,was,looking,at,her,with,such,a,conspiratorial,twinkle,in,her,dark,eyes,[END]
when,they,left,the,shop,she,began,to,giggle,[END]
you,shouldn't,have,told,me,that,miss,eleanor,[END]
i,nearly,made,a,spectacle,of,myself,in,there,[END]
mrs,butler,smiled,serenely,[END]
you'll,recognize,him,easily,in,the,future,she,said,[END]
now,let's,go,to,onslow's,for,a,dish,of,ice,cream,[END]
one,of,the,waiters,there,makes,the,best,moonshine,in,all,of,south,carolina,and,i,want,to,order,a,few,quarts,for,soaking,the,fruitcakes,[END]
the,ice,cream,is,excellent,too,[END]
miss,eleanor,[END]
my,dear,brandy's,not,available,for,love,nor,money,[END]
we,all,have,to,make,do,the,best,we,can,do,we,not,[END]
and,there's,something,quite,exciting,about,black-market,dealings,don't,you,think,[END]
what,scarlett,thought,was,that,she,didn't,blame,rhett,one,bit,for,adoring,his,mother,[END]
eleanor,butler,continued,to,initiate,scarlett,into,the,inner,life,of,charleston,by,going,to,the,fancy,goods,draper,for,a,spool,of,white,cotton,the,woman,behind,the,counter,had,killed,her,husband,with,a,sharpened,knitting,needle,through,the,heart,but,the,judge,ruled,that,he,had,fallen,on,it,when,he,was,drunk,because,everyone,had,seen,the,bruises,on,her,arms,and,face,for,years,and,to,the,pharmacist,for,some,witch,hazel,poor,man,he,was,so,nearsighted,he,once,paid,a,small,fortune,for,a,peculiar,tropical,fish,preserved,in,alcohol,that,he,was,convinced,was,a,small,mermaid,for,real,medicine,always,go,to,the,shop,on,broad,street,that,i'll,show,you,[END]
scarlett,was,sorely,disappointed,when,eleanor,said,it,was,time,to,go,home,[END]
she,couldn't,remember,ever,having,had,such,fun,and,she,almost,begged,for,visits,to,a,few,more,shops,[END]
but,i,think,perhaps,we'll,take,the,horsecar,back,downtown,mrs,butler,said,[END]
i'm,feeling,a,little,tired,[END]
and,scarlett,immediately,began,to,worry,[END]
was,eleanor's,pallor,a,sign,of,illness,instead,of,the,pale,skin,so,prized,by,ladies,[END]
she,held,her,mother-in-law's,elbow,when,they,stepped,up,into,the,brightly,painted,green,and,yellow,tram,and,hovered,over,her,until,eleanor,settled,into,the,wicker-covered,seat,[END]
rhett,would,never,forgive,her,if,she,let,something,awful,happen,to,his,mother,[END]
she'd,never,forgive,hersell,either,[END]
she,looked,from,the,corner,of,her,eye,at,mrs,butler,as,the,horsecar,moved,slowly,along,its,tracks,but,she,couldn't,see,any,outward,sign,of,trouble,[END]
eleanor,was,talking,cheerfully,about,more,shopping,they,would,do,together,[END]
we'll,go,to,the,market,tomorrow,you'll,meet,everyone,you,should,know,there,[END]
it's,the,traditional,place,to,learn,all,the,news,too,[END]
the,paper,never,prints,the,really,interesting,things,[END]
the,car,jolted,and,turned,to,the,left,then,moved,a,block,and,stopped,at,an,intersection,[END]
scarlett,gasped,[END]
immediately,outside,the,open,window,next,to,eleanor,she,saw,a,soldier,in,blue,rifle,on,his,shoulder,marching,in,the,shadows,of,a,tall,colonnade,[END]
yankees,she,whispered,[END]
mrs,butler's,gaze,followed,scarlett's,eyes,[END]
that's,right,georgia's,been,rid,of,them,for,some,time,hasn't,it,[END]
we've,been,occupied,so,long,that,we,hardly,even,notice,them,any,more,[END]
ten,years,next,february,[END]
one,gets,accustomed,to,almost,anything,in,ten,years,[END]
i'll,never,get,used,to,them,scarlett,whispered,[END]
never,[END]
a,sudden,noise,made,her,jump,[END]
then,she,realized,that,it,was,the,chime,of,a,great,clock,somewhere,above,them,[END]
the,horsecar,moved,into,the,intersection,turning,to,the,right,[END]
one,o'clock,said,mrs,butler,[END]
no,wonder,i'm,tired,it,was,a,long,morning,[END]
behind,them,the,chimes,ended,their,quartet,of,notes,[END]
a,single,bell,rang,once,[END]
that's,every,charlestonian's,timekeeper,eleanor,butler,said,the,bells,in,saint,michael's,steeple,[END]
they,record,our,births,and,our,passings,[END]
scarlett,was,looking,at,the,tall,houses,and,walled,gardens,they,were,passing,[END]
without,exception,they,bore,the,scars,of,war,[END]
pockholes,of,shelling,marred,every,surface,and,poverty,was,visible,on,all,sides,peeling,paint,boards,nailed,over,shattered,windows,that,could,not,be,replaced,gaps,and,rust,disfiguring,elaborate,lace-like,wrought,iron,balconies,and,gates,[END]
the,trees,lining,the,street,had,thin,trunks,they,were,youthful,replacements,for,the,giants,broken,by,shelling,[END]
damn,the,yankees,[END]
and,yet,the,sun,gleamed,on,brightly,polished,brass,door,knobs,and,there,was,the,scent,of,flowers,blooming,behind,the,garden,walls,[END]
they've,got,gumption,these,charleston,folks,she,thought,[END]
they,don't,give,in,[END]
she,helped,mrs,butler,down,at,the,last,stop,the,end,of,meeting,street,[END]
in,front,of,them,was,a,park,with,neatly,clipped,grass,and,gleaming,white,paths,that,converged,on,and,circled,a,freshly,painted,round,bandstand,with,a,shiny,pagoda-like,roof,[END]
beyond,it,was,the,harbor,[END]
she,could,smell,the,water,and,the,salt,[END]
a,breeze,rattled,the,sword-shaped,fronds,of,palm,trees,in,the,park,and,swayed,the,long,airy,clumps,of,spanish,moss,on,the,scarred,limbs,of,liveoaks,[END]
small,children,were,running,rolling,hoops,tossing,balls,on,the,grass,under,the,watchful,eyes,of,turbanned,black,nursemaids,sitting,on,benches,[END]
scarlett,i,hope,you'll,forgive,me,i,know,i,shouldn't,but,i,have,to,ask,[END]
mrs,butler's,cheeks,had,splotches,of,bright,color,[END]

no,no,i'm,perfectly,well,[END]
i,just,can't,stand,not,knowing,[END]
have,you,and,rhett,ever,thought,of,another,child,[END]
i,understand,that,you'd,be,afraid,to,repeat,the,heartbreak,you,felt,when,bonnie,died,[END]
a,baby,[END]
scarlett's,voice,trailed,off,[END]
had,mrs,butler,read,her,mind,[END]
she,was,counting,on,getting,pregnant,as,soon,as,possible,[END]
rhett,would,never,send,her,away,then,[END]
he,was,crazy,about,children,and,he'd,love,her,forever,if,she,gave,him,one,[END]
her,voice,rang,with,sincerity,when,she,spoke,[END]
miss,eleanor,i,want,a,baby,more,than,anything,else,in,the,whole,world,[END]
thank,god,said,mrs,butler,[END]
i,do,so,long,to,be,a,grandmother,again,[END]
when,rhett,brought,bonnie,to,visit,me,i,could,hardly,keep,from,smothering,her,with,hugging,[END]
you,see,margaret,that's,my,other,son's,wife,you'll,meet,her,today,poor,margaret,is,barren,[END]
and,rosemary,[END]
rhett's,sister,[END]
i'm,very,much,afraid,that,there'll,never,be,anyone,for,rosemary,to,marry,[END]
scarlett's,mind,worked,furiously,fitting,together,the,pieces,of,rhett's,family,and,what,they,meant,to,her,[END]
rosemary,could,be,a,problem,[END]
old,maids,were,so,nasty,[END]
but,the,brother,what,was,his,name,anyhow,[END]
oh,yes,ross,that,was,it,[END]
ross,was,a,man,and,she'd,never,had,any,trouble,charming,men,[END]
babyless,margaret,wasn't,worth,bothering,about,[END]
it,wasn't,likely,she'd,have,any,influence,on,rhett,[END]
fiddle-dee-dee,what,did,any,of,them,matter,[END]
it,was,his,mother,that,rhett,loved,so,much,and,his,mother,wanted,them,together,with,a,baby,two,babies,a,dozen,[END]
rhett,had,to,take,her,back,[END]
she,kissed,mrs,butler,quickly,on,her,cheek,[END]
i'm,just,longing,for,a,baby,miss,eleanor,[END]
we'll,convince,rhett,the,two,of,us,[END]
you've,made,me,very,happy,scarlett,[END]
let's,go,home,now,it's,only,around,the,corner,there,[END]
then,i,think,i'll,have,a,little,rest,before,dinner,[END]
my,committee,is,meeting,at,the,house,this,afternoon,and,i,need,to,have,my,wits,about,me,[END]
i,hope,you'll,join,us,if,only,for,tea,[END]
margaret,will,be,there,[END]
i,don't,want,to,pressure,you,to,work,but,of,course,if,you,were,interested,i'd,be,pleased,[END]
we,raise,money,with,cake,sales,and,bazaars,of,handcrafts,and,such,for,the,confederate,home,for,widows,and,orphans,[END]
god's,nightgown,were,they,all,the,same,these,southern,ladies,[END]
it,was,just,like,atlanta,[END]
always,confederate,this,and,confederate,that,[END]
couldn't,they,admit,the,war,was,over,and,get,on,with,their,lives,[END]
she'd,have,a,headache,[END]
scarlett's,step,faltered,then,resumed,its,steady,pace,matching,mrs,butler's,[END]
no,she'd,go,to,the,committee,meeting,she'd,even,work,on,the,committee,if,they,asked,her,[END]
she,was,never,going,to,make,the,mistakes,here,she'd,made,in,atlanta,[END]
she,was,never,going,to,be,shut,out,and,lonely,again,not,even,if,she,had,to,wear,the,stars,and,bars,embroidered,on,her,corsets,[END]
that,sounds,mighty,nice,she,said,[END]
i,was,always,a,little,sad,that,i,never,had,time,for,extra,work,in,atlanta,[END]
my,former,husband,frank,kennedy,left,a,fine,business,as,an,inheritance,for,our,little,girl,[END]
i,felt,it,was,my,duty,to,watch,over,it,for,her,[END]
that,should,take,care,of,that,story,rhett,was,telling,[END]
eleanor,butler,nodded,comprehension,[END]
scarlett,lowered,her,lashes,to,hide,the,delight,in,her,eyes,[END]
while,mrs,butler,was,resting,scarlett,wandered,through,the,house,[END]
she,hurried,down,the,stairs,to,see,what,rhett,was,so,busy,buying,back,from,the,yankees,for,his,mother,[END]
the,place,looked,mighty,bare,to,her,[END]
scarlett's,eye,wasn't,educated,to,appreciate,the,perfection,of,what,he,had,done,[END]
on,the,second,floor,the,magnificent,double,drawing,rooms,held,exquisite,sofas,tables,and,chairs,placed,so,that,each,could,be,appreciated,as,well,as,used,[END]
scarlett,admired,the,obvious,quality,of,the,silk,upholstery,and,the,well-polished,gleam,of,the,wood,but,the,beauty,of,the,space,surrounding,the,furniture,escaped,her,completely,[END]
she,liked,the,small,card,room,much,better,[END]
the,table,and,chairs,filled,it,more,and,besides,she,loved,to,play,cards,[END]
the,ground,floor,dining,room,was,only,a,dining,room,to,her,she'd,never,heard,of,hepplewhite,[END]
and,the,library,was,just,a,place,full,of,books,therefore,boring,[END]
what,pleased,her,most,were,the,deep,porches,because,the,day,was,so,warm,and,the,view,over,the,harbor,included,wheeling,gulls,and,small,sailboats,that,looked,as,if,they,might,themselves,soar,into,the,air,at,any,moment,[END]
landlocked,all,her,life,scarlett,found,the,broad,expanse,of,water,incredibly,exotic,[END]
and,the,air,smelled,so,good,[END]
it,gave,her,an,appetite,too,[END]
she'd,be,glad,when,miss,eleanor,finished,her,rest,and,they,could,eat,dinner,[END]
would,you,like,to,take,coffee,on,the,piazza,scarlett,[END]
asked,eleanor,butler,when,she,and,scarlett,were,finishing,their,dessert,[END]
it,might,be,our,last,chance,for,a,while,[END]
it,looks,as,if,weather,is,coming,in,[END]
oh,yes,i'd,like,that,very,much,[END]
the,dinner,had,been,very,good,but,she,still,felt,restless,almost,confined,[END]
outside,would,be,nice,[END]
she,followed,mrs,butler,to,the,second,floor,porch,[END]
my,grief,it's,turned,chilly,since,i,was,here,before,dinner,was,her,first,thought,[END]
hot,coffee's,going,to,taste,good,[END]
she,drank,the,first,cup,quickly,and,was,about,to,ask,for,another,when,eleanor,butler,laughed,and,gestured,toward,the,street,[END]
here,comes,my,committee,she,said,[END]
i'd,recognize,that,sound,anywhere,[END]
scarlett,heard,it,too,a,tinkling,of,tiny,bells,[END]
she,ran,to,the,railing,above,the,street,to,look,[END]
a,pair,of,horses,was,racing,toward,her,pulling,a,handsome,dark,green,brougham,with,yellow-spoked,wheels,[END]
the,wheels,gave,off,silver,flashes,of,light,and,also,the,merry,jingling,sound,[END]
the,carriage,slowed,then,stopped,in,front,of,the,house,[END]
scarlett,could,see,the,bells,then,sleigh,bells,attached,to,a,leather,strap,that,was,woven,around,and,through,the,yellow,spokes,[END]
she'd,never,seen,such,a,thing,[END]
nor,had,she,ever,seen,anyone,like,the,driver,on,the,high,seat,on,the,front,of,the,carriage,[END]
it,was,a,woman,wearing,a,dark,brown,riding,habit,and,yellow,gloves,[END]
she,was,half,standing,pulling,on,the,traces,with,all,her,might,her,ugly,face,screwed,up,with,determination,she,looked,for,all,the,world,like,a,dressed-up,monkey,[END]
the,brougham's,door,opened,and,a,laughing,young,man,stepped,out,onto,the,mounting,block,before,the,house,[END]
he,held,out,his,hand,[END]
a,stout,lady,took,it,and,stepped,from,the,carriage,[END]
she,too,was,laughing,[END]
the,young,man,helped,her,down,from,the,carriage,block,then,handed,down,a,younger,woman,with,a,broad,smile,on,her,face,[END]
come,inside,dear,mrs,butler,said,and,help,me,with,the,tea,things,[END]
scarlett,followed,her,eagerly,seething,with,curiosity,[END]
what,a,peculiar,turnout,of,people,[END]
miss,eleanor's,committee,sure,is,different,from,the,bunches,of,old,cats,who,run,everything,in,atlanta,[END]
where,did,they,find,that,monkey-woman,driver,[END]
and,who,could,the,man,be,[END]
men,didn't,bake,cakes,for,charity,[END]
he,looked,rather,handsome,too,[END]
scarlett,paused,to,smooth,her,windblown,hair,at,a,mirror,[END]
you,look,a,bit,shaken,emma,mrs,butler,was,saying,[END]
she,and,the,stout,woman,touched,cheeks,one,side,then,the,other,[END]
have,a,restful,cup,of,tea,but,first,let,me,present,rhett's,wife,scarlett,[END]
it'll,take,more,than,a,cup,of,tea,to,repair,my,nerves,after,that,little,ride,eleanor,said,the,woman,[END]
she,held,out,her,hand,[END]
how,do,you,do,scarlett,[END]
i'm,emma,anson,or,rather,what,remains,of,emma,anson,[END]
eleanor,embraced,the,younger,woman,and,led,her,to,scarlett,[END]
this,is,margaret,dear,ross's,wife,[END]
margaret,meet,scarlett,[END]
margaret,butler,was,a,pale,fair-haired,young,woman,with,beautiful,sapphire-blue,eyes,that,dominated,her,thin,colorless,face,[END]
when,she,smiled,a,network,of,deep,premature,lines,bracketed,them,[END]
i'm,delighted,to,know,you,at,last,she,said,[END]
she,took,scarlett's,hands,in,hers,and,kissed,her,cheek,[END]
i,always,wanted,a,sister,and,a,sister-in-law,is,practically,the,same,thing,[END]
i,hope,you,and,rhett,will,come,to,us,for,supper,sometime,soon,[END]
ross,will,be,longing,to,meet,you,too,[END]
i'd,love,to,margaret,and,i'm,sure,rhett,would,too,said,scarlett,[END]
she,smiled,hoping,she,was,telling,the,truth,[END]
who,could,say,whether,rhett,would,escort,her,to,his,brother's,house,or,anyplace,else,[END]
but,it,was,going,to,be,mighty,hard,for,him,to,say,no,to,his,own,family,[END]
miss,eleanor,and,now,margaret,were,on,her,side,[END]
scarlett,returned,margaret's,kiss,[END]
scarlett,said,mrs,butler,do,come,meet,sally,brewton,[END]
and,edward,cooper,added,a,male,voice,[END]
don't,deprive,me,of,the,chance,to,kiss,mrs,butler's,hand,eleanor,[END]
i'm,already,smitten,[END]
wait,your,turn,edward,mrs,butler,said,[END]
you,young,people,have,no,manners,at,all,[END]
scarlett,hardly,looked,at,edward,cooper,and,his,flattery,escaped,her,altogether,[END]
she,was,trying,not,to,stare,but,staring,nonetheless,at,sally,brewton,the,monkey-faced,driver,of,the,carriage,[END]
sally,brewton,was,a,tiny,woman,in,her,forties,[END]
she,was,shaped,like,a,thin,active,young,boy,and,her,face,did,in,fact,greatly,resemble,a,monkey's,[END]
she,wasn't,in,the,least,upset,by,scarlett's,rude,stare,[END]
sally,was,accustomed,to,the,reaction,her,remarkable,ugliness,to,which,she,had,adapted,long,long,ago,and,her,unconventional,behavior,often,astonished,people,who,were,strangers,to,her,[END]
she,walked,over,to,scarlett,now,her,skirts,trailing,behind,her,like,a,brown,river,[END]
my,dear,mrs,butler,you,must,think,us,as,mad,as,march,hares,[END]
the,truth,is,boring,though,it,may,be,that,there's,a,perfectly,rational,explanation,for,our,shall,we,say,dramatic,arrival,[END]
i,am,the,only,surviving,carriage,possessor,in,town,and,i,find,it,impossible,to,keep,a,coachman,[END]
they,object,to,ferrying,my,dispossessed,friends,and,i,insist,on,it,[END]
so,i've,given,up,hiring,men,who,are,going,to,quit,almost,at,once,[END]
and,if,my,husband,is,otherwise,occupied,i,do,the,driving,myself,[END]
she,put,her,small,hand,on,scarlett's,arm,and,looked,up,into,her,face,[END]
now,i,ask,you,doesn't,that,make,perfectly,good,sense,[END]
scarlett,found,her,voice,and,said,yes,[END]
sally,you,mustn't,trap,poor,scarlett,like,that,said,eleanor,butler,[END]
what,else,could,she,say,[END]
tell,her,the,rest,[END]
sally,shrugged,then,grinned,[END]
i,suppose,your,mother-in-law,is,referring,to,my,bells,[END]
cruel,creature,[END]
the,fact,is,that,i,am,an,appallingly,bad,driver,[END]
so,whenever,i,take,the,carriage,out,i'm,required,by,my,humanitarian,husband,to,bedeck,it,in,bells,as,advance,warning,to,people,to,get,out,of,my,way,[END]
rather,like,a,leper,offered,mrs,anson,[END]
i,shall,ignore,that,sally,said,with,an,air,of,injured,dignity,[END]
she,smiled,at,scarlett,a,smile,of,such,genuine,good,will,that,scarlett,felt,warmed,by,it,[END]
i,do,hope,she,said,that,you'll,call,on,me,whenever,you,need,the,brougham,despite,what,you've,seen,[END]
thank,you,mrs,brewton,you're,very,kind,[END]
not,at,all,[END]
the,fact,is,i,adore,careening,through,the,streets,scattering,scallywags,and,carpetbaggers,to,the,four,winds,[END]
but,i'm,monopolizing,you,[END]
let,me,present,edward,cooper,before,he,expires,[END]
scarlett,responded,automatically,to,the,gallantries,of,edward,cooper,smiling,to,create,the,beguiling,dimple,at,the,corner,of,her,mouth,and,shamming,embarrassment,at,his,compliments,while,inviting,more,of,them,with,her,eyes,[END]
why,mr,cooper,she,said,how,you,do,run,on,[END]
i,declare,you're,liable,to,turn,my,head,[END]
i'm,just,a,country,girl,from,clayton,county,georgia,and,i,don't,know,what,to,make,of,a,sophisticated,charleston,gentleman,like,you,[END]
miss,eleanor,please,forgive,me,she,heard,a,new,voice,say,[END]
scarlett,turned,and,drew,in,a,sharp,breath,[END]
there,was,a,girl,in,the,doorway,a,young,girl,with,shining,brown,hair,that,grew,in,a,widow's,peak,above,her,soft,brown,eyes,[END]
i'm,so,sorry,to,be,late,the,girl,continued,[END]
her,voice,was,soft,a,little,breathless,[END]
she,was,wearing,a,brown,dress,with,white,linen,collar,and,cuffs,and,an,old-fashioned,bonnet,covered,in,brown,silk,[END]
she,looks,for,all,the,world,like,melanie,when,i,first,knew,her,scarlett,thought,[END]
like,a,soft,little,brown,bird,[END]
could,she,be,a,cousin,[END]
i,never,heard,the,hamiltons,had,any,kin,in,charleston,[END]
you're,not,late,at,all,anne,said,eleanor,butler,[END]

eleanor,butler,hurried,to,the,girl's,side,[END]

she's,melly,to,the,life,[END]
just,as,frail,just,as,mousy,just,as,sweet,i,can,tell,that,already,[END]
she,must,be,an,orphan,if,she's,at,that,home,place,[END]
melanie,was,an,orphan,too,[END]
oh,melly,how,i,miss,you,[END]
the,sky,was,darkening,outside,the,windows,[END]
eleanor,butler,asked,scarlett,to,draw,the,curtains,when,she,finished,her,tea,[END]
as,she,drew,the,curtains,on,the,last,window,she,heard,a,rumbling,of,thunder,in,the,distance,and,a,spattering,of,rain,on,the,glass,[END]
let's,come,to,order,said,miss,eleanor,[END]
we've,got,a,lot,of,business,to,do,[END]

we,used,to,see,her,and,her,husband,almost,every,year,at,saratoga,in,the,old,days,[END]
wasn't,there,a,general,bedford,in,the,union,army,[END]
there,was,not,[END]
there,was,a,general,nathan,bedford,forrest,in,our,army,[END]
the,finest,cavalryman,we,had,said,edward,[END]
i,don't,think,ross,would,agree,with,that,edward,[END]
margaret,butler,put,a,plate,of,bread,and,butter,down,with,a,clatter,[END]
after,all,he,was,in,the,cavalry,with,general,lee,[END]
scarlett,yanked,the,bell,rope,a,second,time,[END]
great,balls,of,fire,[END]
did,all,southerners,have,to,refight,the,war,every,time,they,met,[END]
what,difference,did,it,make,if,the,money,came,from,ulysses,grant,himself,[END]
money,was,money,and,you,took,it,anywhere,you,found,it,[END]
truce,[END]
sally,brewton,waved,a,white,napkin,in,the,air,[END]
if,you,would,give,anne,an,opening,she's,trying,to,say,something,[END]
anne's,eyes,were,glowing,with,emotion,[END]
i've,got,nine,little,girls,that,i'm,teaching,to,read,and,only,one,book,to,teach,from,[END]
if,the,ghost,of,abe,lincoln,came,and,offered,to,buy,us,some,books,i'd,i'd,kiss,him,[END]
good,for,you,cheered,scarlett,silently,[END]
she,looked,at,the,astonishment,on,the,faces,of,the,other,women,[END]
edward,cooper's,expression,was,something,quite,different,[END]
why,he's,in,love,with,her,she,thought,[END]
just,see,the,way,he's,looking,at,her,[END]
and,she,doesn't,notice,him,at,all,she,doesn't,even,know,he's,yearning,over,her,like,a,moon,calf,[END]
maybe,i,should,tell,her,[END]
he's,really,quite,attractive,if,you,like,the,type,sort,of,slender,and,dreamy-looking,[END]
not,all,that,different,from,ashley,come,to,think,of,it,[END]
sally,brewton,was,watching,edward,too,scarlett,noticed,[END]
sally's,eyes,met,hers,and,they,exchanged,discreet,smiles,[END]
we're,agreed,then,are,we,[END]
said,eleanor,[END]
emma,[END]
we're,agreed,[END]
books,are,more,important,than,rancor,[END]
i'm,being,over-emotional,[END]
it,must,be,dehydration,[END]
is,anyone,ever,going,to,bring,that,hot,water,[END]
scarlett,rang,again,[END]
maybe,the,bell,was,broken,should,she,go,down,to,the,kitchen,and,tell,the,servants,[END]
she,started,from,the,corner,then,saw,the,door,opening,[END]
did,you,ring,for,tea,mrs,[END]
butler,[END]
rhett,pushed,the,door,wider,with,his,foot,[END]
his,hands,were,holding,a,huge,silver,tray,laden,with,gleaming,tea,pot,urn,bowl,sugar,bowl,milk,pitcher,strainer,and,three,tea,caddies,[END]
india,china,or,chamomile,[END]
he,was,smiling,with,delight,at,his,surprise,[END]
rhett,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,breathe,[END]
how,handsome,he,was,[END]
he'd,been,in,the,sun,somewhere,he,was,brown,as,an,indian,[END]
oh,god,how,she,loved,him,her,heart,was,beating,so,hard,that,everyone,must,be,able,to,hear,it,[END]
rhett,[END]
oh,darling,i'm,afraid,i'm,going,to,make,a,spectacle,of,myself,[END]
mrs,butler,grabbed,a,napkin,and,wiped,her,eyes,[END]
you,said,some,silver',in,philadelphia,[END]
i,had,no,idea,it,was,the,tea,service,[END]
and,intact,[END]
it's,a,miracle,[END]
it's,also,very,heavy,[END]
miss,emma,will,you,please,push,that,makeshift,china,to,one,side,[END]
i,heard,you,mention,something,about,thirst,i,believe,[END]
i'd,be,honored,if,you'd,brew,your,heart's,desire,[END]
sally,my,beloved,when,are,you,going,to,agree,to,let,me,duel,your,husband,to,the,death,and,abduct,you,[END]
rhett,placed,the,tray,on,the,table,leaned,across,it,and,kissed,the,three,women,sitting,on,the,settee,behind,it,[END]
then,he,looked,around,[END]
look,at,me,scarlett,begged,silently,from,the,shadowy,corner,[END]
kiss,me,[END]
but,he,didn't,see,her,[END]
margaret,how,lovely,you,look,in,that,gown,[END]
ross,doesn't,deserve,you,[END]
hello,anne,it's,a,pleasure,to,see,you,[END]
edward,i,can't,say,the,same,for,you,[END]
i,don't,approve,of,your,organizing,yourself,a,harem,in,my,house,when,i'm,out,in,the,rain,in,the,sorriest,hansom,cab,in,north,america,clutching,the,family,silver,to,my,bosom,to,protect,it,from,the,carpetbaggers,[END]
rhett,smiled,at,his,mother,[END]
stop,that,crying,now,mama,dear,he,said,or,i'll,think,you,don't,like,your,surprise,[END]
eleanor,looked,up,at,him,her,face,shining,with,love,[END]
bless,you,my,son,[END]
you,make,me,very,happy,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,stand,another,minute,of,it,[END]
she,ran,forward,[END]
rhett,darling,[END]
his,head,turned,toward,her,and,she,stopped,[END]
his,face,was,rigid,blank,all,emotion,withheld,by,an,iron,control,[END]
but,his,eyes,were,bright,they,faced,one,another,for,a,breathless,moment,[END]
then,his,lips,turned,downward,at,one,corner,in,the,sardonic,smile,she,knew,so,well,and,feared,so,much,[END]
it's,a,fortunate,man,he,said,slowly,and,clearly,who,receives,a,greater,surprise,than,he,gives,[END]
he,held,his,hands,out,for,hers,[END]
scarlett,put,her,trembling,fingers,into,his,palms,conscious,of,the,distance,his,outstretched,arms,kept,between,them,[END]
his,mustache,brushed,her,right,cheek,then,her,left,[END]
he'd,like,to,kill,me,she,thought,and,the,danger,of,it,gave,her,a,strange,thrill,[END]
rhett,put,his,arm,around,her,shoulders,his,hand,clamped,like,a,vise,around,her,upper,arm,[END]
i'm,sure,you,ladies,and,edward,will,excuse,us,if,we,leave,you,he,said,[END]
there,was,an,appealing,mixture,of,boyishness,and,roguishness,in,his,voice,[END]
it's,been,much,too,long,since,i've,had,a,chance,to,talk,to,my,wife,[END]
we'll,go,upstairs,and,leave,you,to,solve,the,problems,of,the,confederate,home,[END]
he,propelled,scarlett,out,the,door,without,giving,her,an,opportunity,to,make,her,goodbyes,[END]
12,[END]
rhett,didn't,speak,while,he,rushed,her,up,the,stairs,and,into,his,bedroom,[END]
he,closed,the,door,and,stood,with,his,back,against,it,[END]
what,the,hell,are,you,doing,here,scarlett,[END]
she,wanted,to,hold,out,her,arms,to,him,but,the,hot,rage,in,his,eyes,warned,her,not,to,[END]
scarlett,made,her,eyes,widen,in,innocent,misunderstanding,[END]
her,voice,was,rushed,and,charmingly,breathless,when,she,spoke,[END]
aunt,eulalie,wrote,and,told,me,what,you,were,saying,rhett,about,how,you,longed,for,me,to,be,here,with,you,but,i,wouldn't,leave,the,store,[END]
oh,darling,why,didn't,you,tell,me,[END]
i,don't,care,two,pins,for,the,store,not,compared,to,you,[END]
she,watched,his,eyes,warily,[END]
it,won't,work,scarlett,[END]
what,do,you,mean,[END]
none,of,it,[END]
not,the,fervid,explanation,and,not,the,innocent,lack,of,understanding,[END]
you,know,you,could,never,lie,to,me,and,get,away,with,it,[END]
it,was,true,and,she,did,know,it,[END]
she,had,to,be,honest,[END]
i,came,because,i,wanted,to,be,with,you,[END]
her,quiet,statement,had,a,simple,dignity,[END]
rhett,looked,at,her,straight,back,and,proudly,lifted,head,and,his,voice,softened,[END]
my,dear,scarlett,he,said,we,might,have,been,friends,in,time,when,the,memories,had,softened,to,bittersweet,nostalgia,[END]
perhaps,we,might,arrive,at,that,yet,if,we,are,both,charitable,and,patient,[END]
but,nothing,more,[END]
he,strode,impatiently,across,the,room,[END]
what,do,i,have,to,do,to,get,through,to,you,[END]
i,don't,want,to,hurt,you,but,you,force,me,[END]
i,don't,want,you,here,[END]
go,back,to,atlanta,scarlett,leave,me,be,[END]
i,no,longer,love,you,[END]
i,can,speak,no,more,clearly,than,that,[END]
the,blood,had,drained,from,scarlett's,face,[END]
her,green,eyes,glittered,against,her,ghostly,white,skin,[END]
i,can,speak,clearly,too,rhett,[END]
i,am,your,wife,and,you,are,my,husband,[END]
an,unfortunate,circumstance,that,i,offered,to,correct,[END]
his,words,were,like,a,whiplash,[END]
scarlett,forgot,that,she,had,to,control,herself,[END]
divorce,you,[END]
never,never,never,[END]
and,i'll,never,give,you,cause,to,divorce,me,[END]
i'm,your,wife,and,like,a,good,dutiful,wife,should,i've,come,to,your,side,abandoning,all,i,hold,dear,[END]
a,smile,of,triumph,lifted,the,corners,of,her,mouth,and,she,played,her,trump,card,[END]
your,mother,is,overjoyed,that,i'm,here,[END]
what,are,you,going,to,tell,her,if,you,throw,me,out,[END]
because,i'll,tell,her,the,truth,and,it'll,break,her,heart,[END]
rhett,paced,heavily,from,end,to,end,of,the,big,room,[END]
under,his,breath,he,muttered,curses,profanity,and,vulgarity,such,as,scarlett,had,never,heard,[END]
this,was,the,rhett,that,was,only,hearsay,to,her,the,rhett,who,had,followed,the,gold,rush,to,california,and,defended,his,claim,with,a,knife,and,heavy,boots,[END]
this,was,rhett,the,rumrunner,habitue,of,the,lowest,taverns,in,havana,rhett,the,lawless,adventurer,friend,and,companion,of,renegades,like,himself,[END]
she,watched,shocked,and,fascinated,and,excited,despite,the,menace,in,him,[END]
suddenly,his,animal-like,pacing,stopped,and,he,turned,to,face,her,[END]
his,black,eyes,glittered,but,no,longer,with,rage,[END]
they,held,humor,dark,and,bitter,and,wary,[END]
he,was,rhett,butler,charleston,gentleman,[END]
check,he,said,with,a,wry,twisted,smile,[END]
i,overlooked,the,unpredictable,mobility,of,the,queen,[END]
but,not,mate,scarlett,[END]
he,held,out,his,opened,palms,in,momentary,surrender,[END]
she,didn't,understand,what,he,was,saying,but,the,gesture,and,his,tone,of,voice,told,her,that,she'd,won,[END]
something,[END]
so,i'll,stay,[END]
you'll,stay,until,you,want,to,go,[END]
i,don't,expect,it,to,be,very,long,[END]
but,you're,wrong,rhett,[END]
i,love,it,here,[END]
an,old,familiar,expression,crossed,his,face,[END]
he,was,amused,and,skeptical,and,all-knowing,[END]
how,long,have,you,been,in,charleston,scarlett,[END]
since,last,night,[END]
and,you've,learned,to,love,it,[END]
quick,work,i,congratulate,you,on,your,sensitivity,[END]
you,were,driven,out,of,atlanta,miraculously,minus,tar,and,feathers,and,you've,been,treated,decently,by,ladies,who,know,no,other,way,to,treat,people,and,so,you,think,you've,found,a,refuge,[END]
he,laughed,at,the,look,on,her,face,[END]
oh,yes,i,still,have,associates,in,atlanta,[END]
i,know,all,about,your,ostracism,there,[END]
not,even,the,scum,you,used,to,consort,with,will,have,anything,to,do,with,you,any,more,[END]
that's,not,true,[END]
she,cried,[END]
i,threw,them,out,[END]
rhett,shrugged,[END]
we,needn't,discuss,that,further,[END]
what,matters,is,that,now,you,are,here,in,my,mother's,house,and,under,her,wing,[END]
because,i,care,greatly,for,her,happiness,i,cannot,for,the,moment,do,anything,about,it,[END]
however,i,don't,really,have,to,[END]
you'll,do,what's,necessary,without,any,action,on,my,part,[END]
you'll,reveal,yourself,for,what,you,are,then,everyone,will,feel,pity,for,me,and,compassion,for,my,mother,[END]
and,i'll,pack,you,up,and,ship,you,back,to,atlanta,to,the,genteelly,silent,cheers,of,the,entire,community,[END]
you,think,you,can,pass,yourself,off,as,a,lady,don't,you,[END]
you,couldn't,fool,a,blind,deaf-mute,[END]
i,am,a,lady,damn,you,[END]
you,just,don't,know,what,it's,like,to,be,a,decent,person,[END]
i'll,thank,you,to,remember,that,my,mother,was,a,robillard,from,savannah,and,that,the,o'haras,descend,from,the,kings,of,ireland,[END]
rhett's,grin,in,response,was,maddeningly,tolerant,[END]
leave,it,alone,scarlett,[END]
show,me,the,clothes,you,brought,with,you,[END]
he,sat,in,the,chair,nearest,him,and,stretched,out,his,long,legs,[END]
scarlett,stared,at,him,too,frustrated,by,his,abrupt,calm,to,speak,without,sputtering,[END]
rhett,took,a,cigar,from,his,pocket,and,rolled,it,between,his,fingers,[END]
you,don't,object,if,i,smoke,in,my,room,i,hope,he,said,[END]
of,course,not,[END]
thank,you,[END]
now,show,me,your,clothes,[END]
they're,certain,to,be,new,you'd,never,embark,on,an,attempt,to,win,back,my,favors,without,an,arsenal,of,petticoats,and,silk,frocks,all,in,the,execrable,taste,that,is,your,hallmark,[END]
i,won't,have,you,making,my,mother,a,laughingstock,[END]
so,show,them,to,me,scarlett,and,i'll,see,what,can,be,salvaged,[END]
he,took,a,cutter,from,his,pocket,[END]
scarlett,scowled,but,nevertheless,she,stalked,into,the,dressing,room,to,collect,her,things,[END]
maybe,this,was,a,good,thing,[END]
rhett,had,always,supervised,her,wardrobe,[END]
he'd,liked,to,see,her,in,clothes,that,he,had,chosen,he'd,been,proud,of,how,stylish,and,beautiful,she,looked,[END]
if,he,wanted,to,get,involved,with,her,appearance,again,be,proud,of,her,again,she'd,be,willing,to,cooperate,[END]
she'd,try,them,all,on,for,him,[END]
that,way,he'd,see,her,in,her,shimmy,[END]
scarlett's,fingers,moved,quickly,to,unhook,the,dress,she,was,wearing,and,the,cage,with,padding,that,supported,the,bustle,[END]
she,stepped,out,of,the,pile,of,rich,fabric,then,gathered,her,new,dresses,in,her,arms,and,walked,slowly,into,the,bedroom,her,arms,bare,her,bosom,half-revealed,and,her,legs,silk-stockinged,[END]
dump,them,on,the,bed,said,rhett,and,put,on,a,wrapper,before,you,freeze,[END]
it's,gotten,colder,with,the,rain,or,haven't,you,noticed,[END]
he,blew,a,stream,of,smoke,to,his,left,turning,his,head,away,from,her,[END]
don't,catch,cold,trying,to,be,alluring,scarlett,[END]
you're,wasting,your,time,[END]
scarlett's,face,became,livid,with,anger,her,eyes,like,green,fire,[END]
but,rhett,was,not,looking,at,her,[END]
he,was,examining,the,finery,on,the,bed,[END]
rip,off,all,this,lace,he,said,about,the,first,gown,and,keep,only,one,of,the,avalanche,of,bows,down,the,side,[END]
then,it,won't,be,too,bad,[END]
give,this,one,to,your,maid,it's,hopeless,[END]
this,will,do,if,you,take,off,the,trim,replace,the,gold,buttons,with,plain,black,ones,and,shorten,the,train,[END]
it,took,only,a,few,minutes,for,him,to,go,through,them,all,[END]
you'll,need,some,sturdy,boots,plain,black,he,said,when,he,finished,with,the,clothes,[END]
i,bought,some,this,morning,scarlett,said,with,ice,in,her,voice,[END]
when,your,mother,and,i,went,shopping,she,added,emphasizing,each,word,[END]
i,don't,see,why,you,don't,buy,her,a,carriage,since,you,love,her,so,much,[END]
she,got,very,tired,with,all,the,walking,[END]
you,don't,understand,charleston,[END]
that's,why,you'll,be,miserable,here,in,no,time,at,all,[END]
i,could,buy,her,this,house,because,ours,was,destroyed,by,the,yankees,and,everyone,she,knows,still,has,a,house,just,as,grand,[END]
i,can,even,furnish,it,more,comfortably,than,her,friends',are,furnished,because,every,piece,in,it,is,something,that,the,yankees,looted,or,is,a,duplicate,of,what,she,once,had,and,her,friends,still,have,many,of,their,things,[END]
but,i,cannot,set,her,apart,from,her,friends,by,buying,her,luxuries,that,they,cannot,afford,[END]
sally,brewton,has,a,carriage,[END]
sally,brewton,is,unlike,anyone,else,[END]
she,always,has,been,[END]
sally,is,an,original,[END]
charleston,has,respect,even,fondness,for,eccentricity,[END]
but,no,tolerance,for,ostentation,[END]
and,you,my,dear,scarlett,have,never,been,able,to,resist,ostentation,[END]
i,hope,you're,enjoying,insulting,me,rhett,butler,[END]
rhett,laughed,[END]
as,a,matter,of,fact,i,am,[END]
now,you,can,start,making,one,of,those,dresses,decent,to,wear,for,this,evening,[END]
i'm,going,to,go,drive,the,committee,home,[END]
sally,shouldn't,do,it,in,this,storm,[END]
after,he,was,gone,scarlett,put,on,rhett's,dressing,gown,[END]
it,was,warmer,than,hers,and,he,was,right,it,had,gotten,much,colder,and,she,was,shivering,[END]
she,pulled,the,collar,of,the,robe,up,around,her,ears,and,went,to,sit,in,the,chair,where,he,had,sat,[END]
his,presence,was,still,in,the,room,for,her,and,she,wrapped,herself,in,it,[END]
her,fingers,stroked,the,soft,foulard,that,enveloped,her,strange,to,think,of,rhett,choosing,such,a,light,almost,fragile-feeling,wrapper,when,he,was,so,solid,and,strong,himself,[END]
but,then,so,many,things,about,him,mystified,her,[END]
she,didn't,know,him,at,all,never,had,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,moment,of,dreadful,hopelessness,[END]
she,shook,it,off,stood,up,hurriedly,[END]
she,had,to,get,dressed,before,rhett,got,back,[END]
gracious,heavens,how,long,had,she,been,sitting,in,that,chair,daydreaming,[END]
it,was,already,near,dark,[END]
she,rang,sharply,for,pansy,[END]
the,bows,and,lace,had,to,be,picked,off,the,pink,gown,so,she,could,wear,it,tonight,and,the,curling,tongs,should,be,put,to,heat,at,once,[END]
she,wanted,to,look,especially,pretty,and,feminine,for,rhett,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,wide,expanse,of,counterpane,on,the,big,bed,and,her,thoughts,made,her,blush,[END]
the,lamplighter,had,not,yet,reached,the,upper,part,of,the,city,where,emma,anson,lived,and,rhett,had,to,drive,slowly,hunched,forward,to,peer,through,the,heavy,rain,at,the,dark,street,[END]
behind,him,only,mrs,anson,and,sally,brewton,remained,in,the,closed,carriage,[END]
margaret,butler,had,been,taken,home,first,to,the,tiny,house,on,water,street,where,she,and,ross,lived,then,rhett,drove,to,broad,street,where,edward,cooper,had,escorted,anne,hampton,to,the,door,of,the,confederate,home,under,his,large,umbrella,[END]
i'll,walk,the,rest,of,the,way,edward,called,up,to,rhett,from,the,sidewalk,no,sense,taking,this,dripping,umbrella,in,with,the,ladies,[END]
he,lived,on,church,street,only,a,block,away,[END]
rhett,touched,the,wide,brim,of,his,hat,in,salute,and,drove,on,[END]
do,you,think,rhett,can,hear,us,[END]
murmured,emma,anson,[END]
i,can,hardly,hear,you,emma,and,i'm,only,a,foot,from,you,sally,answered,tartly,[END]
for,goodness',sake,speak,up,[END]
this,downpour,is,deafening,[END]
she,was,irritated,by,the,rain,[END]
it,kept,her,from,driving,the,brougham,herself,[END]
what,do,you,think,of,the,wife,[END]
emma,said,[END]
she's,not,at,all,what,i,would,have,expected,[END]
have,you,ever,seen,anything,as,grotesquely,over-decorated,as,the,walking-out,costume,she,was,wearing,[END]
oh,clothes,are,easily,remedied,and,lots,of,women,have,dreadful,taste,[END]
no,what's,interesting,is,that,she's,got,possibilities,said,sally,[END]
the,only,question,is,will,she,grow,into,them,[END]
it,can,be,a,great,handicap,being,beautiful,and,having,been,a,belle,[END]
lots,of,women,never,recover,from,it,[END]
it,was,ridiculous,the,way,she,flirted,with,edward,[END]
automatic,i,think,not,really,ridiculous,[END]
there,are,plenty,of,men,who,expect,just,that,kind,of,thing,too,[END]
maybe,they,need,it,now,more,than,ever,before,[END]
they've,lost,everything,else,that,once,made,them,feel,like,men,all,their,wealth,their,lands,and,their,power,[END]
the,two,women,were,silent,for,a,while,thinking,of,things,better,left,unadmitted,by,a,proud,people,under,the,heel,of,a,military,occupying,force,[END]
sally,cleared,her,throat,breaking,the,somber,mood,[END]
one,good,thing,she,said,in,a,positive,way,rhett's,wife,is,desperately,in,love,with,him,[END]
her,face,lit,up,like,a,sunrise,when,he,appeared,in,that,doorway,did,you,see,[END]
no,i,didn't,said,emma,[END]
i,wish,to,god,i,had,[END]
what,i,saw,was,the,same,look,but,it,was,on,anne's,face,[END]
13,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,kept,returning,to,the,door,[END]
what,was,keeping,rhett,so,long,[END]
eleanor,butler,pretended,not,to,notice,but,a,tiny,smile,nestled,in,the,corners,of,her,mouth,[END]
her,fingers,moved,a,gleaming,ivory,shuttle,rapidly,back,and,forth,tatting,an,intricate,web,of,loops,[END]
it,should,have,been,a,cozy,moment,[END]
the,drawing,room,curtains,were,closed,against,the,storm,and,the,dark,lamps,were,lit,on,tables,throughout,the,two,beautiful,adjoining,rooms,and,a,golden,crackling,fire,banished,chill,and,damp,[END]
but,scarlett's,nerves,were,too,drawn,to,be,comforted,by,the,domestic,scene,[END]
where,was,rhett,[END]
would,he,still,be,angry,when,he,returned,[END]
she,tried,to,keep,her,mind,on,what,rhett's,mother,was,saying,but,she,couldn't,[END]
she,didn't,care,about,the,confederate,home,for,widows,and,orphans,[END]
her,fingers,touched,the,bodice,of,her,dress,but,there,were,no,cascades,of,lace,to,fiddle,with,[END]
surely,he,wouldn't,care,about,her,clothes,if,he,really,didn't,care,about,her,would,he,[END]
so,the,school,just,sort,of,grew,by,itself,because,there,was,no,place,else,really,for,the,orphans,to,go,mrs,butler,was,saying,[END]
it's,been,more,successful,than,we,would,have,dared,to,hope,[END]
last,june,there,were,six,graduated,all,of,them,teachers,now,themselves,[END]
two,of,the,girls,have,gone,to,walterboro,to,teach,and,one,actually,had,a,choice,of,places,either,yemassee,or,camden,[END]
another,one,such,a,sweet,girl,wrote,to,us,i'll,show,you,the,letter,[END]
oh,where,is,he,[END]
what,could,be,taking,him,so,long,[END]
if,i,have,to,sit,still,much,longer,i'll,scream,[END]
the,bronze,clock,on,the,mantel,chimed,and,scarlett,jumped,[END]
two,[END]
three,[END]
i,wonder,what's,keeping,rhett,[END]
said,his,mother,[END]
five,[END]
six,[END]
he,knows,we,have,supper,at,seven,and,he,always,enjoys,a,toddy,first,[END]
he'll,be,soaked,to,the,skin,too,he'll,have,to,change,his,clothes,[END]
mrs,butler,put,her,tatting,down,on,the,table,at,her,side,[END]
i'll,just,go,see,if,the,rain's,stopped,she,said,[END]
scarlett,leapt,to,her,feet,[END]
i'll,go,[END]
she,walked,quickly,released,and,pulled,back,an,edge,of,the,heavy,silk,curtain,[END]
outside,a,heavy,mist,was,billowing,over,the,sea-wall,promenade,[END]
it,swirled,in,the,street,and,coiled,upward,like,a,live,thing,[END]
the,street,lamp,was,a,glowing,undefined,brightness,in,the,moving,whiteness,surrounding,it,[END]
she,drew,back,from,the,eerie,formlessness,and,dropped,the,silk,over,the,sight,of,it,[END]
it's,all,foggy,she,said,but,it's,not,raining,[END]
do,you,think,rhett's,all,right,[END]
eleanor,butler,smiled,[END]
he's,been,through,worse,than,a,little,wet,and,fog,scarlett,you,know,that,[END]
of,course,he's,all,right,[END]
you'll,hear,him,at,the,door,any,minute,now,[END]
as,if,the,words,had,caused,it,there,came,the,sound,of,the,great,front,door,opening,[END]
scarlett,heard,rhett's,laughter,and,the,deep,voice,of,manigo,the,butler,[END]
you,best,hand,me,them,wet,things,mist',rhett,boots,too,[END]
i,got,your,house,shoes,right,here,manigo,was,saying,[END]
thank,you,manigo,[END]
i'll,go,up,and,change,[END]
tell,mrs,butler,i'll,be,with,her,in,a,minute,[END]
is,she,in,the,drawing,room,[END]
yessir,her,and,missus,rhett,[END]
scarlett,listened,for,rhett's,reaction,but,she,heard,only,his,quick,firm,tread,on,the,steps,[END]
it,seemed,a,century,before,he,came,back,down,[END]
the,clock,on,the,mantel,had,to,be,wrong,[END]
each,minute,took,an,hour,to,pass,[END]
you,look,tired,dear,exclaimed,eleanor,butler,when,rhett,entered,the,drawing,room,[END]
rhett,lifted,his,mother's,hand,and,kissed,it,[END]
don't,cluck,over,me,mama,i'm,more,hungry,than,tired,[END]
supper,soon,[END]
mrs,butler,started,to,rise,[END]
i'll,tell,the,kitchen,to,serve,right,now,[END]
rhett,gently,touched,her,shoulder,to,halt,her,effort,[END]
i'll,have,a,drink,first,don't,rush,[END]
he,walked,to,the,table,holding,the,drinks,tray,[END]
as,he,poured,whiskey,into,a,glass,he,looked,at,scarlett,for,the,first,time,[END]
will,you,join,me,scarlett,[END]
his,raised,eyebrow,taunted,her,[END]
so,did,the,smell,of,the,whiskey,[END]
she,turned,away,as,if,insulted,[END]
so,rhett,was,going,to,play,cat,and,mouse,was,he,[END]
try,to,force,her,or,trick,her,into,doing,something,that,would,make,his,mother,turn,against,her,[END]
well,he'd,have,to,be,mighty,smart,to,catch,her,out,[END]
her,mouth,curved,and,her,eyes,began,to,sparkle,[END]
she'd,have,to,be,mighty,smart,herself,to,outwit,him,[END]
a,little,pulse,of,excitement,throbbed,in,her,throat,[END]
competition,always,thrilled,her,[END]
miss,eleanor,isn't,rhett,shocking,[END]
she,laughed,[END]
was,he,a,wicked,little,boy,too,[END]
behind,her,she,sensed,rhett's,abrupt,movement,[END]
ha,[END]
that,had,struck,home,[END]
he'd,felt,guilty,for,years,about,the,pain,he'd,caused,his,mother,when,his,escapades,made,his,father,disown,him,[END]
supper's,served,miz,butler,said,manigo,from,the,doorway,[END]
rhett,offered,his,mother,his,arm,and,scarlett,felt,a,stab,of,jealousy,[END]
then,she,reminded,herself,that,his,devotion,to,his,mother,was,the,very,thing,that,permitted,her,to,stay,and,she,swallowed,her,anger,[END]
i'm,so,hungry,i,could,eat,half,a,cow,she,said,her,voice,bright,and,rhett's,just,starving,aren't,you,darling,[END]
she,had,the,upper,hand,now,he,had,admitted,that,much,[END]
if,she,lost,it,she'd,lose,the,whole,game,she'd,never,get,him,back,[END]
as,it,turned,out,scarlett,needn't,have,worried,[END]
rhett,took,command,of,the,conversation,the,moment,they,were,seated,[END]
he,recounted,his,search,for,the,tea,service,in,philadelphia,transforming,it,into,an,adventure,painting,deft,word,portraits,of,the,succession,of,people,he,talked,to,mimicking,their,accents,and,idiosyncrasies,with,such,skill,that,his,mother,and,scarlett,found,themselves,laughing,until,their,sides,ached,[END]
and,after,following,that,long,trail,to,get,to,him,rhett,concluded,with,a,theatrical,gesture,of,dismay,just,imagine,my,horror,when,the,new,owner,seemed,to,be,too,honest,to,sell,the,tea,service,for,the,twenty,times,its,value,i,offered,[END]
for,a,minute,i,was,afraid,i'd,have,to,steal,it,back,but,fortunately,he,was,receptive,to,the,suggestion,that,we,amuse,ourselves,with,a,friendly,game,of,cards,[END]
eleanor,butler,tried,to,look,disapproving,[END]
i,do,hope,you,didn't,do,anything,dishonest,rhett,she,said,[END]
but,there,was,laughter,beneath,the,words,[END]
mama,[END]
you,shock,me,[END]
i,only,deal,from,the,bottom,when,i'm,playing,with,professionals,[END]
this,miserable,ex-colonel,in,sherman's,army,was,such,an,amateur,i,had,to,cheat,to,let,him,win,a,few,hundred,dollars,to,ease,his,pain,[END]
he,was,like,the,reverse,side,of,an,ellinton,[END]
mrs,butler,laughed,[END]
oh,the,poor,man,[END]
and,his,wife,my,heart,goes,out,to,her,[END]
rhett's,mother,leaned,toward,scarlett,[END]
some,of,the,skeletons,in,my,side,of,the,family,eleanor,butler,said,in,a,mock,whisper,[END]
she,laughed,again,and,began,to,reminisce,[END]
the,ellintons,scarlett,learned,were,famous,all,up,and,down,the,east,coast,for,the,family,weakness,they,would,gamble,on,anything,[END]
the,first,ellinton,to,settle,in,colonial,america,was,part,of,the,shipload,only,because,he,had,won,a,land,grant,in,a,wager,with,the,owner,as,to,who,could,drink,the,most,ale,and,remain,standing,[END]
by,the,time,he,won,mrs,butler,said,in,neat,conclusion,he,was,so,drunk,that,he,thought,it,made,sense,to,go,take,a,look,at,his,prize,[END]
they,say,he,didn't,even,know,where,he,was,going,until,he,got,there,because,he,won,most,of,the,sailors',rum,ration,playing,dice,[END]
what,did,he,do,when,he,sobered,up,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,know,[END]
oh,my,dear,he,never,did,[END]
he,died,only,ten,days,after,the,ship,made,landfall,[END]
but,in,the,meantime,he,had,wagered,some,other,gambler,at,dice,and,won,a,girl,one,of,the,indentured,servants,from,the,ship,and,since,later,she,turned,out,to,be,carrying,his,child,there,was,a,sort,of,ex,post,facto,wedding,at,his,grave,marker,and,her,son,became,one,of,my,great-great-grandfathers,[END]
he,was,rather,a,gamester,himself,wasn't,he,[END]
rhett,asked,[END]
oh,of,course,[END]
it,truly,ran,in,the,family,[END]
and,mrs,butler,continued,along,the,family,tree,[END]
scarlett,glanced,at,rhett,often,[END]
how,many,surprises,were,there,in,this,man,she,hardly,knew,[END]
she'd,never,seen,him,so,relaxed,and,happy,and,totally,at,home,[END]
i,never,made,a,home,for,him,she,realized,[END]
he,never,even,liked,the,house,[END]
it,was,mine,done,the,way,i,wanted,a,present,from,him,not,his,at,all,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,break,in,on,miss,eleanor's,stories,to,tell,rhett,that,she,was,sorry,for,the,past,that,she'd,make,up,for,all,her,mistakes,[END]
but,she,kept,silent,[END]
he,was,content,enjoying,himself,and,his,mother's,ramblings,[END]
she,mustn't,break,this,mood,[END]
the,candles,in,their,tall,silver,holders,were,reflected,in,the,polish,of,the,mahogany,table,and,in,the,pupils,of,rhett's,gleaming,black,eyes,[END]
they,bathed,the,table,and,the,three,of,them,in,a,warm,still,light,making,an,island,of,soft,brilliance,in,the,shadows,of,the,long,room,[END]
the,world,outside,was,closed,off,by,the,thick,folds,of,curtains,at,the,windows,and,by,the,intimacy,of,the,small,candlelit,island,[END]
eleanor,butler's,voice,was,gentle,rhett's,laughter,a,quiet,encouraging,chuckle,[END]
love,made,an,airy,yet,unbreakable,web,between,mother,and,son,[END]
scarlett,had,a,sudden,consuming,yearning,to,be,enclosed,in,that,web,[END]
then,rhett,said,tell,scarlett,about,cousin,townsend,mama,and,she,was,safe,in,the,warmth,of,the,candlelight,included,in,the,happiness,that,ringed,the,table,[END]
she,wished,that,it,could,last,forever,and,she,begged,miss,eleanor,to,tell,about,cousin,townsend,[END]
townsend's,not,really,a,cousin-cousin,you,know,only,a,third,cousin,twice,removed,but,he,is,the,direct,descendent,of,great-great-grandfather,ellinton,only,son,of,an,eldest,son,of,an,eldest,son,[END]
so,he,inherited,that,original,land,grant,and,the,ellinton,gambler's,fever,and,the,ellinton,luck,[END]
they,were,always,lucky,the,ellintons,[END]
except,for,one,thing,there's,another,ellinton,family,trait,the,boys,are,always,cross-eyed,[END]
townsend,married,an,extremely,beautiful,girl,from,a,fine,philadelphia,family,philadelphia,called,it,the,wedding,of,beauty,and,the,beast,[END]
but,the,girl's,father,was,a,lawyer,and,a,very,sensible,man,about,property,and,townsend,was,fabulously,rich,[END]
townsend,and,his,wife,settled,in,baltimore,[END]
then,of,course,the,war,came,[END]
townsend's,wife,went,running,home,to,her,family,the,minute,townsend,went,off,to,join,general,lee's,army,[END]
she,was,a,yankee,after,all,and,townsend,would,more,than,likely,get,killed,[END]
he,couldn't,shoot,a,barn,much,less,a,barn,door,because,of,his,cross,eyes,[END]
however,he,still,had,the,ellinton,luck,[END]
he,never,got,anything,worse,than,chilblains,although,he,served,all,the,way,through,to,appomattox,[END]
meanwhile,his,wife's,three,brothers,and,her,father,were,all,killed,fighting,in,the,union,army,[END]
so,she,inherited,everything,piled,up,by,her,careful,father,and,his,careful,ancestors,[END]
townsend's,living,like,a,king,in,philadelphia,and,doesn't,care,a,fig,that,all,his,property,in,savannah,was,confiscated,by,sherman,[END]
did,you,see,him,rhett,[END]
how,is,he,[END]
more,cross-eyed,than,ever,with,two,cross-eyed,sons,and,a,daughter,that,thank,god,takes,after,her,mother,[END]
scarlett,hardly,heard,rhett's,answer,[END]
did,you,say,the,ellintons,were,from,savannah,miss,eleanor,[END]
my,mother,was,from,savannah,she,said,eagerly,[END]
the,crisscross,of,relations,that,was,so,much,a,part,of,southern,life,had,long,been,a,frustrating,lack,in,her,own,[END]
everyone,she,knew,had,a,network,of,cousins,and,uncles,and,aunts,that,covered,generations,and,hundreds,of,miles,[END]
but,she,had,none,[END]
pauline,and,eulalie,had,no,children,[END]
gerald,o'hara's,brothers,in,savannah,were,childless,too,[END]
there,must,be,lots,of,o'haras,still,in,ireland,but,that,did,her,no,good,and,all,the,robillards,except,her,grandfather,were,gone,from,savannah,[END]
now,here,she,was,again,hearing,about,somebody,else's,family,[END]
rhett,had,kin,in,philadelphia,[END]
no,doubt,he,was,related,to,half,of,charleston,too,[END]
it,wasn't,fair,[END]
but,maybe,these,ellinton,people,were,tied,to,the,robillards,somehow,[END]
then,she'd,be,part,of,the,web,that,included,rhett,[END]
perhaps,she,could,find,a,connection,to,the,world,of,the,butlers,and,charleston,the,world,that,rhett,had,chosen,and,she,was,determined,to,enter,[END]
i,remember,ellen,robillard,very,well,said,mrs,butler,[END]
and,her,mother,[END]
your,grandmother,scarlett,was,probably,the,most,fascinating,woman,in,all,of,georgia,and,south,carolina,too,[END]
scarlett,leaned,forward,enthralled,[END]
she'd,heard,only,bits,and,pieces,of,stories,about,her,grandmother,[END]
was,she,really,scandalous,miss,eleanor,[END]
she,was,extraordinary,[END]
but,when,i,knew,her,best,she,wasn't,scandalous,at,all,[END]
she,was,too,busy,having,babies,[END]
first,your,aunt,pauline,then,eulalie,then,your,mother,[END]
as,a,matter,of,fact,i,was,in,savannah,when,your,mother,was,born,[END]
i,remember,the,fireworks,[END]
your,grandfather,hired,some,famous,italian,to,come,down,from,new,york,and,put,on,a,magnificent,fireworks,display,every,time,your,grandmother,gave,him,a,baby,[END]
you,wouldn't,remember,rhett,and,i,don't,suppose,you'll,thank,me,for,remembering,either,but,you,were,scared,witless,[END]
i,took,you,outside,especially,to,see,them,and,you,cried,so,loud,that,i,nearly,died,of,shame,[END]
all,the,other,children,there,were,clapping,their,hands,and,shrieking,with,joy,[END]
of,course,they,were,older,[END]
you,were,still,in,dresses,barely,over,a,year,old,[END]
scarlett,stared,at,mrs,butler,then,at,rhett,[END]
it,wasn't,possible,[END]
rhett,couldn't,be,older,than,her,mother,[END]
why,her,mother,was,her,mother,[END]
she'd,always,taken,it,for,granted,that,her,mother,was,old,past,the,age,of,strong,emotions,[END]
how,could,rhett,be,older,[END]
how,could,she,love,him,so,desperately,if,he,was,that,old,[END]
then,rhett,added,shock,upon,shock,[END]
he,dropped,his,napkin,on,the,table,stood,stepped,to,scarlett's,side,and,kissed,the,top,of,her,head,moved,on,to,take,his,mother's,hand,in,his,and,kiss,it,[END]
i'm,off,now,mama,he,said,[END]
oh,rhett,no,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,shout,[END]
but,she,was,too,stunned,to,say,anything,even,to,ask,where,he,was,going,[END]
i,wish,you,wouldn't,go,out,in,the,rainy,pitch,dark,rhett,his,mother,protested,[END]
and,scarlett's,here,[END]
you've,barely,had,a,chance,to,say,hello,to,her,[END]
it's,stopped,raining,and,the,full,moon's,out,rhett,said,[END]
i,can't,waste,the,chance,to,ride,the,tide,upriver,and,i've,just,enough,time,to,catch,it,before,it,turns,[END]
scarlett,understands,that,you've,got,to,check,up,on,your,workers,if,you,go,away,and,leave,them,she's,a,businesswoman,[END]
aren't,you,my,pet,[END]
his,eyes,glittered,from,the,candle,flame,reflected,in,them,when,he,looked,at,her,[END]
then,he,walked,into,the,hall,[END]
she,pushed,back,from,the,table,almost,upending,her,chair,in,her,haste,[END]
then,without,a,word,to,mrs,butler,she,ran,frantically,after,him,[END]
he,was,in,the,vestibule,buttoning,his,coat,hat,in,his,hand,[END]
rhett,rhett,wait,[END]
scarlett,cried,[END]
she,ignored,the,warning,in,his,look,when,he,turned,to,face,her,[END]
everything,was,so,nice,at,supper,she,said,[END]
why,do,you,want,to,go,[END]
rhett,stepped,past,her,and,pushed,the,door,from,the,vestibule,to,the,hallway,[END]
it,closed,with,a,heavy,dull,click,of,the,latch,shutting,off,the,rest,of,the,house,[END]
don't,make,a,scene,scarlett,[END]
they're,wasted,on,me,[END]
as,if,he,could,see,inside,her,skull,he,drawled,his,final,words,[END]
don't,count,on,sharing,my,bed,either,scarlett,[END]
he,opened,the,door,to,the,street,[END]
before,she,could,say,a,word,he,was,gone,[END]
the,door,swung,slowly,closed,behind,him,[END]
scarlett,stamped,her,foot,[END]
it,was,an,inadequate,outlet,for,her,anger,and,disappointment,[END]
why,did,he,have,to,be,so,mean,[END]
she,grimaced,half,anger,half,unwilling,laughter,in,grudging,acknowledgment,of,rhett's,cleverness,[END]
he'd,known,what,she,was,planning,easy,enough,[END]
well,then,she'd,have,to,be,cleverer,that's,all,[END]
she'd,have,to,give,up,the,idea,of,having,a,baby,right,away,think,of,something,else,[END]
her,brow,was,furrowed,when,she,went,back,to,join,rhett's,mother,[END]
there,now,dear,don't,be,upset,eleanor,butler,said,he'll,be,all,right,[END]
rhett,knows,the,river,like,the,back,of,his,hand,[END]
she,had,been,standing,near,the,mantel,unwilling,to,go,into,the,hall,and,risk,intruding,on,rhett's,farewell,to,his,wife,[END]
let's,go,into,the,library,it's,cozy,there,and,let,the,servants,clear,the,table,[END]
scarlett,settled,into,a,high-back,chair,protected,from,drafts,[END]
no,she,said,she,didn't,want,a,throw,over,her,knees,she,was,just,fine,thank,you,[END]
let,me,tuck,you,in,miss,eleanor,she,insisted,taking,the,cashmere,shawl,from,her,[END]
you,sit,down,now,and,ease,yourself,[END]
she,bullied,mrs,butler,into,comfort,[END]
what,a,dear,girl,you,are,scarlett,so,like,your,darling,mother,[END]
i,remember,how,thoughtful,she,always,was,such,beautiful,manners,[END]
all,the,robillard,girls,were,well,behaved,of,course,but,ellen,was,special,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,eyes,and,inhaled,the,faint,whisper,of,lemon,verbena,[END]
everything,was,going,to,be,all,right,[END]
miss,eleanor,loved,her,she'd,make,rhett,come,home,and,they'd,all,live,happily,together,forever,and,ever,[END]
scarlett,half-dozed,in,the,deep-cushioned,chair,lulled,by,the,soft,reminiscences,of,a,gentler,time,[END]
when,the,disturbance,erupted,in,the,hall,beyond,the,door,she,was,jerked,back,to,confused,consciousness,[END]
for,a,moment,she,didn't,know,where,she,was,or,how,she,had,gotten,there,and,she,blinked,bleary-eyed,at,the,man,in,the,doorway,[END]
rhett,[END]
no,it,couldn't,be,rhett,not,unless,he'd,shaved,off,his,mustache,[END]
the,big,man,who,wasn't,rhett,stepped,unevenly,across,the,doorsill,[END]
i,came,to,meet,my,sister,he,said,[END]
the,words,slurred,together,[END]
margaret,butler,ran,towards,eleanor,[END]
i,tried,to,stop,him,she,cried,but,he,was,in,one,of,those,moods,i,couldn't,get,him,to,listen,miss,eleanor,[END]
mrs,butler,stood,up,[END]
hush,margaret,she,said,with,quiet,urgency,[END]
ross,i'm,waiting,for,a,proper,greeting,[END]
her,voice,was,unusually,loud,the,words,very,distinct,[END]
scarlett's,mind,was,clear,now,[END]
so,this,was,rhett's,brother,[END]
and,drunk,too,by,the,look,of,him,[END]
well,she'd,seen,drunk,men,before,they,were,no,special,novelty,[END]
she,stood,smiled,at,ross,her,dimple,flickering,[END]
i,declare,miss,eleanor,how,could,one,lady,be,so,lucky,as,to,have,two,sons,each,one,handsomer,than,the,other,[END]
rhett,never,told,me,he,had,such,a,good-looking,brother,[END]
ross,staggered,towards,her,[END]
his,eyes,raked,her,body,then,fastened,on,her,tousled,curls,and,rouged,face,[END]
he,leered,rather,than,smiled,[END]
so,this,is,scarlett,he,said,thickly,[END]
i,might,have,known,rhett,would,end,up,with,a,fancy,piece,like,her,[END]
come,on,scarlett,give,your,new,brother,a,friendly,kiss,[END]
you,know,how,to,please,a,man,i'm,sure,[END]
his,big,hands,ran,up,her,arms,like,huge,spiders,and,fastened,themselves,on,her,bare,throat,[END]
then,his,open,mouth,was,over,hers,his,sour,breath,in,her,nose,his,tongue,forcing,itself,between,her,teeth,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,get,her,hands,up,to,shove,him,away,but,ross,was,too,strong,his,body,too,closely,pressed,against,hers,[END]
she,could,hear,eleanor,butler's,voice,and,margaret's,but,she,couldn't,make,out,what,they,were,saying,[END]
all,her,attention,was,focused,on,the,need,to,break,free,of,the,repulsive,embrace,and,on,the,shame,of,ross',insulting,words,[END]
he,had,called,her,a,whore,[END]
and,he,was,treating,her,like,one,[END]
all,of,a,sudden,ross,thrust,her,away,tumbled,her,back,into,her,chair,[END]
i'll,bet,you're,not,so,cold,to,my,dear,big,brother,he,growled,[END]
margaret,butler,was,sobbing,against,eleanor's,shoulder,[END]
ross,[END]
mrs,butler,hurled,the,name,like,a,knife,[END]
ross,turned,with,a,clumsy,lurch,sending,a,small,table,crashing,to,the,floor,[END]
ross,[END]
his,mother,said,again,[END]
i,have,rung,for,manigo,[END]
he,will,help,you,home,and,give,margaret,decent,escort,[END]
when,you,sober,up,you,will,write,letters,of,apology,to,rhett's,wife,and,to,me,[END]
you,have,disgraced,yourself,and,margaret,and,me,and,you,will,not,be,received,in,this,house,until,i,have,recovered,from,the,shame,you've,caused,me,[END]
i'm,so,sorry,miss,eleanor,margaret,wept,[END]
mrs,butler,put,her,hands,on,margaret's,shoulders,[END]
i,am,sorry,for,you,margaret,she,said,[END]
then,she,moved,margaret,away,from,her,[END]
go,home,now,[END]
you,will,of,course,always,be,welcome,here,[END]
manigo's,wise,old,eyes,took,in,the,situation,with,one,look,and,he,removed,ross,who,surprisingly,said,not,a,word,in,protest,[END]
margaret,scuttled,out,behind,them,[END]
i'm,so,sorry,she,repeated,again,and,again,until,the,sound,of,her,voice,was,cut,off,by,the,closing,of,the,big,front,door,[END]
my,darling,child,eleanor,said,to,scarlett,there,is,no,excuse,i,can,make,[END]
ross,was,drunk,he,didn't,know,what,he,was,saying,[END]
but,that,is,no,excuse,[END]
scarlett,was,shaking,all,over,[END]
from,disgust,from,humiliation,from,anger,[END]
why,had,she,let,it,happen,let,rhett's,brother,revile,her,and,put,his,hands,and,his,mouth,on,her,[END]
i,should,have,spit,in,his,face,clawed,him,blind,hit,his,nasty,foul,mouth,with,my,fists,[END]
but,i,didn't,i,just,took,it,as,if,i,deserved,it,as,if,it,was,true,[END]
scarlett,had,never,been,so,ashamed,[END]
shamed,by,ross',words,shamed,by,her,own,weakness,[END]
she,felt,defiled,dirty,and,eternally,humiliated,[END]
better,if,ross,had,hit,her,or,cut,her,with,a,knife,[END]
her,body,would,recover,from,a,bruise,or,a,wound,[END]
but,her,pride,would,never,be,healed,from,the,sickness,she,felt,[END]
eleanor,leaned,over,her,tried,to,put,her,arms,around,her,but,scarlett,shrank,from,her,touch,[END]
leave,me,alone,[END]
she,tried,to,shout,but,it,came,out,a,moan,[END]
i,won't,said,mrs,butler,not,until,you,listen,to,me,[END]
you've,got,to,understand,scarlett,you,have,to,hear,me,[END]
there's,so,much,you,don't,know,[END]
are,you,listening,[END]
she,drew,a,chair,close,to,scarlett's,sat,in,it,only,inches,away,[END]
no,[END]
go,away,[END]
scarlett,put,her,hands,over,her,ears,[END]
i,won't,leave,you,said,eleanor,[END]
and,i'll,tell,you,again,and,again,a,thousand,times,if,need,be,until,you,hear,me,[END]
her,voice,went,on,and,on,gentle,but,insistent,while,her,hand,stroked,scarlett's,bent,head,comforting,caring,insinuating,her,kindness,and,her,love,through,scarlett's,refusal,to,hear,her,[END]
what,ross,did,was,unpardonable,she,said,i,don't,ask,you,to,forgive,him,[END]
but,i,must,scarlett,[END]
he,is,my,son,and,i,know,the,pain,in,him,that,made,him,do,it,[END]
he,wasn't,trying,to,hurt,you,my,dear,[END]
it,was,rhett,he,was,attacking,through,you,he,knows,you,see,that,rhett,is,too,strong,for,him,that,he'll,never,be,able,to,match,rhett,in,anything,[END]
rhett,reaches,out,and,takes,what,he,wants,he,makes,things,happen,he,gets,things,done,[END]
and,poor,ross,is,a,failure,at,everything,[END]
margaret,told,me,privately,this,afternoon,that,when,ross,went,to,work,this,morning,they,told,him,he,was,fired,[END]
because,of,his,drinking,you,see,[END]
he,always,drank,men,always,do,but,not,the,way,he's,been,drinking,since,rhett,came,back,to,charleston,a,year,ago,[END]
ross,was,trying,to,make,the,plantation,go,he's,been,slaving,away,at,it,ever,since,he,came,back,from,the,war,but,something,always,went,wrong,and,he,never,did,get,a,decent,rice,crop,[END]
everything,was,about,to,be,sold,up,for,taxes,[END]
so,when,rhett,offered,to,buy,the,plantation,from,him,ross,had,to,let,it,go,[END]
it,would,have,been,rhett's,anyhow,except,that,he,and,his,father,but,that's,another,story,[END]
ross,got,a,position,as,teller,at,a,bank,but,i'm,afraid,he,thought,that,handling,money,was,vulgar,[END]
gentlemen,always,signed,bills,in,the,old,days,or,simply,gave,their,word,and,their,factors,took,care,of,everything,[END]
at,any,rate,ross,made,mistakes,at,his,cage,his,accounts,never,balanced,and,one,day,he,made,a,big,mistake,and,he,lost,his,job,[END]
worse,the,bank,said,they,were,going,to,law,to,get,the,money,from,him,that,he'd,paid,out,in,error,[END]
rhett,made,it,good,[END]
it,was,like,a,dagger,in,ross',heart,[END]
the,heavy,drinking,started,then,and,now,it's,cost,him,another,job,[END]
on,top,of,that,some,fool,or,villain,let,it,slip,that,rhett,had,arranged,the,job,for,him,in,the,first,place,[END]
he,went,right,home,and,got,so,drunk,he,could,hardly,walk,[END]
mean,drunk,[END]
i,love,rhett,best,may,god,forgive,me,i,always,have,[END]
he,was,my,first-born,and,i,laid,my,heart,in,his,tiny,hands,the,moment,he,was,put,in,my,arms,[END]
i,love,ross,and,rosemary,but,not,the,way,i,love,rhett,and,i'm,afraid,they,know,it,[END]
rosemary,thinks,it's,because,he,was,gone,for,so,long,then,came,back,like,a,genie,from,a,bottle,and,bought,me,everything,in,this,house,bought,her,the,pretty,frocks,she'd,been,longing,for,[END]
she,doesn't,remember,what,it,was,like,before,he,went,away,[END]
she,was,only,a,baby,she,doesn't,know,that,he,always,came,first,with,me,[END]
ross,knows,he,knew,all,the,time,but,he,was,first,with,his,father,so,he,didn't,care,overmuch,[END]
steven,cast,rhett,out,made,ross,his,heir,[END]
he,loved,ross,he,was,proud,of,him,[END]
but,now,steven,is,dead,seven,years,this,month,[END]
and,rhett,is,home,again,and,the,joy,of,it,fills,my,life,and,ross,cannot,fail,to,see,it,[END]
mrs,butler's,voice,was,hoarse,ragged,from,the,effort,of,speaking,the,heavy,secrets,of,her,heart,[END]
it,broke,and,she,wept,bitterly,[END]
my,poor,boy,my,poor,hurting,ross,[END]
i,should,say,something,scarlett,thought,to,make,her,feel,better,[END]
but,she,couldn't,[END]
she,was,hurting,too,much,herself,[END]
miss,eleanor,don't,cry,she,said,ineffectively,[END]
don't,feel,bad,[END]
please,i,need,to,ask,you,something,[END]
mrs,butler,breathed,deeply,she,wiped,her,eyes,and,composed,her,face,[END]
what,is,it,my,dear,[END]
i,have,to,know,scarlett,said,urgently,[END]
you've,got,to,tell,me,[END]
truly,do,i,what,he,said,do,i,look,like,that,[END]
she,needed,reassurance,had,to,have,the,approval,of,this,loving,lemon-scented,lady,[END]
precious,child,said,eleanor,it,doesn't,matter,a,tinker's,dam,what,you,look,like,[END]
rhett,loves,you,and,therefore,i,love,you,too,[END]
mother,of,god,[END]
she's,saying,that,i,look,like,a,whore,but,it,doesn't,matter,[END]
is,she,crazy,[END]
of,course,it,matters,it,matters,more,than,anything,else,in,the,world,[END]
i,want,to,be,a,lady,like,i,was,meant,to,be,[END]
she,grabbed,mrs,butler's,hands,in,a,desperate,grip,not,knowing,that,she,was,causing,her,agonizing,pain,[END]
oh,miss,eleanor,help,me,[END]
please,i,need,you,to,help,me,[END]
of,course,dear,[END]
tell,me,what,you,want,[END]
there,was,only,serenity,and,affection,on,mrs,butler's,face,[END]
she,had,learned,many,years,before,how,to,hide,any,pain,she,felt,[END]
i,need,to,know,what,i'm,doing,wrong,why,i,don't,look,like,a,lady,[END]
i,am,a,lady,miss,eleanor,i,am,[END]
you,knew,my,mother,you,must,know,it's,so,[END]
of,course,you,are,scarlett,and,of,course,i,know,[END]
appearances,are,so,deceiving,it's,really,not,fair,[END]
we,can,take,care,of,everything,with,practically,no,effort,at,all,[END]
mrs,butler,gently,disengaged,her,throbbing,swollen,fingers,from,scarlett's,grasp,[END]
you,have,so,much,vitality,dear,child,all,the,vigor,of,the,world,you,grew,up,in,[END]
it's,misleading,to,people,here,in,the,old,tired,low-country,[END]
but,you,mustn't,lose,it,it's,too,valuable,[END]
we'll,simply,find,ways,to,make,you,somewhat,less,visible,more,like,us,[END]
then,you'll,be,more,comfortable,[END]
and,so,will,i,eleanor,butler,thought,silently,[END]
she,would,defend,to,her,dying,breath,the,woman,she,believed,rhett,loved,but,it,would,be,much,easier,if,scarlett,stopped,wearing,paint,on,her,face,and,expensive,ill-considered,clothes,[END]
eleanor,welcomed,the,opportunity,to,remake,scarlett,in,the,charleston,mold,[END]
scarlett,gratefully,swallowed,mrs,butler's,diplomatic,assessment,of,her,problem,[END]
she,was,too,shrewd,to,believe,it,completely,she,had,seen,miss,eleanor,manage,eulalie,and,pauline,[END]
but,rhett's,mother,would,help,her,and,that,was,what,counted,at,least,for,now,[END]
14,[END]
the,charleston,that,had,molded,eleanor,butler,and,drawn,rhett,back,after,decades,of,adventuring,was,an,old,city,one,of,the,oldest,in,america,[END]
it,was,crowded,onto,a,narrow,triangular,peninsula,between,two,wide,tidal,rivers,that,met,in,a,broad,harbor,connected,to,the,atlantic,[END]
first,settled,in,1682,it,had,from,its,earliest,days,a,romantic,languor,and,sensuality,foreign,to,the,brisk,pace,and,puritan,self-denial,of,the,new,england,colonies,[END]
salt,breezes,stirred,palm,trees,and,wisteria,vines,and,flowers,bloomed,year-round,[END]
the,soil,was,black,rich,free,of,stones,to,blunt,a,man's,plow,the,waters,teemed,with,fish,crab,shrimp,terrapin,and,oysters,the,woods,with,game,[END]
it,was,a,rich,land,meant,to,be,enjoyed,[END]
ships,from,all,over,the,globe,anchored,in,the,harbor,for,cargoes,of,the,rice,grown,on,charlestonians',vast,plantations,along,the,rivers,they,delivered,the,world's,luxuries,for,the,pleasure,and,adornment,of,the,small,population,[END]
it,was,the,wealthiest,city,in,america,[END]
blessed,by,reaching,its,maturity,in,the,age,of,reason,charleston,used,its,wealth,in,the,pursuit,of,beauty,and,knowledge,[END]
responsive,to,its,climate,and,natural,bounties,it,used,its,riches,also,for,the,enjoyment,of,the,senses,[END]
each,house,had,its,chef,and,its,ballroom,every,lady,her,brocades,from,france,and,her,pearls,from,india,[END]
there,were,learned,societies,and,societies,for,music,and,dancing,schools,of,science,and,schools,of,fencing,[END]
it,was,civilized,and,hedonistic,in,a,balance,that,created,a,culture,of,exquisitely,refined,grace,in,which,incomparable,luxury,was,tempered,by,a,demanding,discipline,of,intellect,and,education,[END]
charlestonians,painted,their,houses,in,all,the,colors,of,the,rainbow,and,hung,them,with,shaded,porches,through,which,sea,breezes,carried,the,scent,of,roses,like,a,caress,[END]
inside,every,house,there,was,a,room,with,globe,telescope,and,walls,of,books,in,many,languages,[END]
in,the,middle,of,the,day,they,sat,at,dinner,for,six,courses,each,offering,a,choice,of,dishes,in,quietly,gleaming,generations-old,silver,pieces,[END]
conversation,was,the,sauce,of,the,meal,wit,its,preferred,seasoning,[END]
this,was,the,world,which,scarlett,o'hara,one-time,belle,of,a,rural,county,in,the,raw,red,frontier,earth,of,north,georgia,now,intended,to,conquer,armed,only,with,energy,stubbornness,and,a,dreadful,need,[END]
her,timing,was,terrible,[END]
for,more,than,a,century,charlestonians,had,been,renowned,for,their,hospitality,[END]
it,wasn't,unusual,to,entertain,a,hundred,guests,fully,half,of,whom,were,unknown,to,host,and,hostess,except,through,letters,of,introduction,[END]
during,race,week,the,climax,of,the,city's,social,season,owners,from,england,france,ireland,and,spain,often,brought,their,horses,months,in,advance,to,accustom,them,to,the,climate,and,water,[END]
the,owners,stayed,at,the,homes,of,their,charleston,competitors,their,horses,were,stabled,as,guests,next,to,the,horses,the,charleston,host,would,be,running,against,them,[END]
it,was,an,open-handed,open-hearted,city,[END]
until,the,war,came,[END]
fittingly,the,first,shots,of,the,civil,war,were,fired,at,fort,sumter,in,charleston,harbor,[END]
to,most,of,the,world,charleston,was,the,symbol,of,the,mysterious,and,magical,moss-hung,magnolia-scented,south,[END]
to,charlestonians,as,well,[END]
and,to,the,north,[END]
proud,and,arrogant,charleston,was,the,refrain,in,new,york,and,boston,newspapers,[END]
union,military,officials,were,determined,to,destroy,the,flower-filled,pastel-painted,old,city,[END]
the,harbor,entrance,was,blockaded,first,later,gun,emplacements,on,nearby,islands,fired,shells,into,narrow,streets,and,houses,in,a,siege,that,lasted,for,almost,six,hundred,days,finally,sherman's,army,came,with,its,torches,to,burn,the,plantation,houses,on,the,rivers,[END]
when,the,union,troops,marched,in,to,occupy,their,prize,they,faced,a,desolate,ruin,[END]
wild,grasses,grew,in,the,streets,and,choked,the,gardens,of,windowless,shell-scarred,broken-roofed,houses,[END]
they,also,faced,a,decimated,population,that,had,become,as,proud,and,arrogant,as,their,northern,reputation,[END]
outsiders,were,no,longer,welcome,in,charleston,[END]
people,repaired,their,roofs,and,windows,as,best,they,could,and,locked,their,doors,[END]
among,themselves,they,restored,the,cherished,habits,of,gaiety,[END]
they,met,for,dancing,in,looted,drawing,rooms,where,they,toasted,the,south,in,water,from,cracked,and,mended,cups,[END]
starvation,parties,they,called,their,gatherings,and,laughed,[END]
the,days,of,french,champagne,in,crystal,flutes,might,be,gone,but,they,were,still,charlestonians,[END]
they,had,lost,their,possessions,but,they,had,almost,two,centuries,of,shared,tradition,and,style,[END]
no,one,could,take,that,from,them,[END]
the,war,was,over,but,they,weren't,defeated,[END]
they,would,never,be,defeated,no,matter,what,the,damn,yankees,did,[END]
not,so,long,as,they,stuck,together,[END]
and,kept,everyone,else,out,of,their,closed,circle,[END]
the,military,occupation,and,the,outrages,of,reconstruction,tested,their,mettle,but,they,held,fast,[END]
one,by,one,the,other,states,of,the,confederacy,were,readmitted,to,the,union,their,state,governments,restored,to,the,state's,population,[END]
but,not,south,carolina,[END]
and,especially,not,charleston,[END]
more,than,nine,years,after,the,end,of,the,war,armed,soldiers,patrolled,the,old,streets,enforcing,curfew,[END]
constantly,changing,regulations,covered,everything,from,the,price,of,paper,to,the,licensing,of,marriages,and,funerals,[END]
charleston,became,more,and,more,derelict,outwardly,but,ever,stronger,in,its,determination,to,preserve,the,old,ways,of,life,[END]
the,bachelors',cotillion,was,reborn,with,a,new,generation,to,fill,the,gaps,caused,by,the,carnage,of,bull,run,antietam,and,chancellorsville,[END]
after,their,working,hours,as,clerks,or,laborers,former,plantation,owners,took,the,streetcars,or,walked,to,the,outskirts,of,the,city,to,rebuild,the,two-mile,oval,of,the,charleston,race,course,and,to,plant,the,blood-soaked,churned,mud,of,the,land,around,it,with,grass,seed,bought,with,combined,widow's,mites,[END]
little,by,little,by,symbols,and,by,inches,charlestonians,were,regaining,the,essence,of,their,beloved,lost,world,[END]
but,there,was,no,room,in,it,for,anyone,who,didn't,belong,there,[END]
15,[END]
pansy,couldn't,hide,her,amazement,at,the,orders,scarlett,gave,her,when,she,was,unlacing,for,bed,the,first,night,in,the,butler,house,[END]
take,the,green,walking-out,costume,i,wore,this,morning,and,give,it,a,good,brushing,[END]
then,take,off,every,speck,of,trimming,including,the,gold,buttons,and,sew,on,some,plain,black,buttons,instead,[END]
where,i,going,to,find,any,black,buttons,miss,scarlett,[END]
don't,bother,me,with,fool,questions,like,that,[END]
ask,mrs,butler's,maid,what's,her,name,[END]
celie,[END]
and,wake,me,up,tomorrow,at,five,o'clock,[END]
five,o'clock,[END]
are,you,deaf,[END]
you,heard,me,[END]
now,scoot,[END]
i,want,that,green,outfit,ready,to,put,on,when,i,get,up,[END]
scarlett,sank,gratefully,into,the,feather,mattress,and,down,pillows,on,the,big,bed,[END]
it,had,been,an,over-full,over-emotional,day,[END]
meeting,miss,eleanor,then,shopping,then,that,silly,confederate,home,meeting,then,rhett,appearing,from,nowhere,with,the,silver,tea,service,[END]
her,hand,stretched,over,to,the,empty,space,beside,her,[END]
she,wanted,him,there,but,perhaps,it,was,better,to,wait,a,few,days,until,she,was,really,accepted,in,charleston,[END]
that,miserable,ross,[END]
she,wouldn't,think,about,him,or,those,horrible,things,he'd,said,and,done,[END]
miss,eleanor,had,denied,him,the,house,and,she,wouldn't,have,to,see,him,she,hoped,not,ever,again,[END]
she'd,think,about,something,else,[END]
she'd,think,about,miss,eleanor,who,loved,her,and,who,was,going,to,help,her,get,rhett,back,even,if,she,didn't,know,that's,what,she,was,doing,[END]
the,market,miss,eleanor,had,said,was,the,place,to,meet,everybody,and,hear,all,the,news,[END]
so,to,the,market,she,would,go,tomorrow,[END]
scarlett,would,have,been,happier,if,it,wasn't,necessary,to,go,so,early,at,six,o'clock,[END]
but,needs,must,[END]
i,have,to,say,this,for,charleston,she,thought,sleepily,it's,plenty,busy,and,i,like,that,[END]
she,was,only,halfway,through,a,yawn,when,she,fell,asleep,[END]
the,market,was,the,perfect,place,for,scarlett,to,begin,the,life,of,a,charleston,lady,[END]
the,market,was,an,outward,visible,distillation,of,charleston's,essence,[END]
from,the,city's,earliest,days,it,had,been,the,place,where,charlestonians,bought,their,food,[END]
the,lady,of,the,house,or,in,rare,cases,the,man,selected,and,paid,for,it,a,maid,or,coachman,received,it,and,placed,it,in,a,basket,hung,over,the,arm,[END]
before,the,war,the,food,was,sold,by,slaves,who,had,transported,it,from,their,masters',plantations,[END]
many,of,the,vendors,were,in,the,places,they,had,been,before,only,now,they,were,free,and,the,baskets,were,carried,by,servants,who,were,paid,for,their,service,like,the,vendors,many,of,them,were,the,same,people,carrying,the,same,baskets,they,had,before,[END]
what,was,important,to,charleston,was,that,the,old,ways,hadn't,changed,[END]
tradition,was,the,bedrock,of,society,the,birthright,of,charleston's,people,the,priceless,inheritance,that,no,carpetbagger,or,soldier,could,steal,[END]
it,was,made,manifest,in,the,market,[END]
outsiders,could,shop,there,it,was,public,property,[END]
but,they,found,it,frustrating,[END]
somehow,they,could,never,quite,catch,the,eye,of,the,woman,who,was,selling,vegetables,the,man,selling,crabs,[END]
black,citizens,were,as,proudly,charlestonian,as,white,ones,[END]
when,the,foreigner,left,the,whole,market,rang,with,laughter,[END]
the,market,was,for,charleston's,people,only,[END]
scarlett,hunched,her,shoulders,to,lift,her,collar,higher,on,her,neck,[END]
a,cold,finger,of,wind,got,inside,it,despite,her,efforts,and,she,shivered,violently,[END]
her,eyes,felt,full,of,cinders,and,she,was,sure,her,boots,must,be,lined,with,lead,[END]
how,many,miles,could,there,be,in,five,city,blocks,[END]
she,couldn't,see,a,thing,[END]
the,street,lamps,were,only,a,bright,circle,of,mist,within,mist,in,the,ghostly,gray,pre-dawn,halflight,[END]
how,can,miss,eleanor,be,so,cursed,cheery,[END]
chattering,away,as,if,it,wasn't,freezing,cold,and,black,as,pitch,[END]
there,was,some,light,ahead,way,ahead,[END]
scarlett,stumbled,towards,it,[END]
she,wished,the,miserable,wind,would,die,down,[END]
what,was,that,[END]
in,the,wind,[END]
she,sniffed,the,air,[END]
it,was,[END]
it,was,coffee,[END]
maybe,she'd,live,after,all,[END]
her,steps,matched,mrs,butler's,in,an,eager,accelerated,pace,[END]
the,market,was,like,a,bazaar,an,oasis,of,light,and,warmth,color,and,life,in,the,formless,gray,mist,[END]
torches,blazed,on,brick,pillars,that,supported,tall,wide,arches,open,to,the,surrounding,streets,illuminating,the,bright,aprons,and,headscarves,of,smiling,black,women,and,highlighting,their,wares,displayed,in,baskets,of,every,size,and,shape,on,long,wooden,tables,painted,green,[END]
it,was,crowded,with,people,most,of,them,moving,from,table,to,table,talking,to,other,shoppers,or,to,the,vendors,in,a,challenging,laughing,ritual,of,haggling,obviously,enjoyed,by,all,[END]
coffee,first,scarlett,[END]
oh,yes,please,[END]
eleanor,butler,led,the,way,to,a,nearby,group,of,women,[END]
they,held,steaming,tin,mugs,in,their,gloved,hands,sipping,from,them,while,they,talked,and,laughed,with,one,another,oblivious,to,the,din,around,them,[END]
good,morning,eleanor,[END]
eleanor,how,are,you,[END]

and,another,cup,for,my,daughter-in-law,please,sukie,[END]
ladies,i,want,you,to,meet,rhett's,wife,scarlett,[END]
all,chattering,stopped,and,all,heads,turned,to,look,at,scarlett,[END]
she,smiled,and,inclined,her,head,in,a,little,bow,[END]
she,looked,apprehensively,at,the,group,of,ladies,imagining,that,it,must,be,all,over,town,what,ross,said,[END]
i,shouldn't,have,come,i,can't,stand,it,[END]
her,jaw,hardened,and,an,invisible,chip,settled,on,her,shoulder,[END]
she,expected,the,worst,and,all,her,old,hostility,to,charleston's,aristocratic,pretensions,returned,in,a,flash,[END]
but,she,smiled,and,bowed,to,each,of,the,ladies,as,eleanor,introduced,her,[END]
yes,i,just,love,charleston,[END]
yes,ma'am,i,am,pauline,smith's,niece,[END]

yes'm,i,do,enjoy,a,game,of,whist,[END]
oh,thank,you,so,much,i've,been,positively,aching,for,a,taste,of,coffee,[END]
she,buried,her,face,in,the,mug,her,job,done,[END]
miss,eleanor's,got,no,more,sense,than,a,pea,hen,she,thought,mutinously,[END]
how,could,she,just,pitch,me,in,to,the,middle,like,that,[END]
she,must,think,i've,got,a,memory,like,an,elephant,[END]
so,many,names,and,they,all,mix,up,together,[END]
they're,all,looking,at,me,as,if,i,was,an,elephant,too,or,something,else,in,a,zoo,[END]
they,know,what,ross,said,i,know,they,do,[END]
miss,eleanor,might,be,fooled,by,their,smiling,but,i'm,not,[END]
bunch,of,old,cats,[END]
her,teeth,ground,against,the,rim,of,the,mug,[END]
she,wouldn't,show,her,feelings,not,if,she,went,blind,to,keep,from,crying,[END]
but,her,cheeks,were,stained,with,high,color,[END]
when,she,finished,her,coffee,mrs,butler,took,her,mug,and,handed,it,with,her,own,to,the,busy,coffee-seller,[END]
i'll,have,to,ask,you,for,some,change,sukie,she,said,[END]
she,held,out,a,five,dollar,bill,[END]
with,no,waste,motion,sukie,dipped,and,swirled,the,mugs,in,a,big,pail,of,brownish,water,set,them,on,the,table,at,her,elbow,wiped,her,hands,on,her,apron,took,the,bill,and,deposited,it,in,a,cracked,leather,pouch,hanging,from,her,belt,withdrawing,a,dollar,bill,without,looking,[END]
here,you,is,miz,butler,hope,you,enjoyed,it,[END]
scarlett,was,aghast,[END]
two,dollars,for,a,cup,of,coffee,[END]
why,with,two,dollars,you,could,buy,the,best,pair,of,boots,on,king,street,[END]
i,always,enjoy,it,sukie,even,though,i,have,to,do,without,food,on,the,table,to,pay,for,it,[END]
don't,you,ever,feel,ashamed,of,yourself,for,being,such,a,robber,[END]
sukie's,white,teeth,flashed,against,her,brown,skin,[END]
no,ma'am,i,surely,don't,[END]
she,said,rumbling,with,amusement,[END]
i,can,swear,on,the,good,book,that,ain't,nothing,disturbing,my,sleep,[END]
the,other,coffee,drinkers,laughed,[END]
each,of,them,had,had,a,similar,exchange,with,sukie,many,times,[END]
eleanor,butler,looked,around,until,she,located,celie,and,her,basket,[END]
come,along,dear,she,said,to,scarlett,we,have,a,long,list,today,[END]
we'll,have,to,get,to,it,before,everything's,gone,[END]
scarlett,followed,mrs,butler,to,the,end,of,the,market,hall,where,the,rows,of,tables,were,crowded,with,dented,galvanized,washtubs,filled,with,seafood,that,emitted,a,strong,acrid,odor,[END]
scarlett's,nose,wrinkled,at,the,reek,and,she,looked,at,the,tubs,with,disdain,[END]
she,thought,she,knew,fish,well,enough,[END]
ugly,whiskered,bone-filled,catfish,were,plentiful,in,the,river,that,ran,alongside,tara,[END]
they'd,had,to,eat,them,when,there,was,nothing,else,[END]
why,anyone,would,actually,buy,one,of,the,nasty,little,things,was,beyond,her,but,there,were,lots,of,ladies,with,one,glove,off,poking,into,the,tubs,[END]
oh,bother,[END]
miss,eleanor,was,going,to,introduce,her,to,every,single,one,of,them,[END]
scarlett,readied,her,smile,[END]
a,tiny,white-haired,lady,raised,a,big,silvery,beast,of,a,fish,from,the,tub,in,front,of,her,[END]
i'd,love,to,meet,her,eleanor,[END]
what,do,you,think,of,this,flounder,[END]
i,was,planning,on,sheepshead,but,they're,not,in,yet,and,i,can't,wait,[END]
i,don't,know,why,the,fishing,boats,can't,be,more,punctual,and,don't,talk,to,me,about,no,wind,for,the,sails,[END]
my,bonnet,nearly,blew,right,off,my,head,this,morning,[END]
i,really,prefer,flounder,myself,minnie,it,takes,to,a,sauce,so,much,better,[END]
let,me,present,rhett's,wife,scarlett,[END]
this,is,mrs,wentworth,scarlett,[END]
how,do,scarlett,[END]
tell,me,does,this,flounder,look,good,to,you,[END]
it,looked,disgusting,to,her,but,scarlett,murmured,i've,always,been,partial,to,flounder,myself,[END]
she,hoped,that,all,miss,eleanor's,friends,wouldn't,ask,her,opinion,[END]
she,didn't,even,know,what,flounder,was,for,pity,sakes,much,less,if,it,was,any,good,or,not,[END]
in,the,next,hour,scarlett,was,introduced,to,more,than,twenty,ladies,and,a,dozen,varieties,of,fish,[END]
she,was,receiving,a,thorough,education,in,seafood,[END]
mrs,butler,bought,crabs,going,to,five,different,sellers,until,she,had,accumulated,eight,[END]
i,suppose,i,seem,awfully,picky,to,you,she,said,when,she,was,satisfied,but,the,soup's,just,not,the,same,if,it's,made,with,he-crabs,[END]
the,roe,gives,it,a,special,flavor,you,see,[END]
it's,a,lot,harder,to,find,she-crab,this,time,of,year,but,it's,worth,the,effort,i,think,[END]
scarlett,didn't,care,a,bit,what,gender,the,crabs,were,[END]
she,was,appalled,that,they,were,still,alive,scuttling,around,in,the,tubs,reaching,out,their,claws,making,nervous,rustling,noises,as,they,climbed,on,top,of,one,another,trying,to,reach,up,the,sides,to,get,out,[END]
and,now,she,could,hear,them,in,celie's,basket,pushing,at,the,paper,sack,that,held,them,[END]
the,shrimp,were,worse,even,though,they,were,dead,[END]
their,eyes,were,horrible,black,balls,on,stalks,and,they,had,long,trailing,whiskers,and,feelers,and,spiky,stomachs,[END]
she,couldn't,believe,that,she'd,ever,eaten,anything,that,looked,like,that,much,less,enjoyed,it,[END]
the,oysters,didn't,bother,her,they,just,looked,like,dirty,rocks,[END]
but,when,mrs,butler,picked,up,a,curved,knife,from,a,table,and,opened,one,scarlett,felt,her,stomach,heave,[END]
it,looks,like,a,hawk,of,spit,floating,in,old,dishwater,she,thought,[END]
after,the,seafood,the,meats,had,a,reassuring,familiarity,even,though,the,swarms,of,flies,around,the,blood-soaked,newspapers,under,them,made,her,queasy,[END]
she,managed,to,smile,at,a,small,black,boy,who,was,waving,them,off,with,a,big,heart-shaped,fan,made,of,some,woven,dried,straw-like,stuff,[END]
by,the,time,they,reached,the,rows,of,limp-necked,birds,she,was,sufficiently,herself,again,to,think,about,trimming,a,hat,with,some,of,the,feathers,[END]
which,feathers,dear,[END]
asked,mrs,butler,[END]
the,pheasant,[END]
of,course,you,may,have,some,[END]
she,bargained,briskly,with,the,inkblack,fat,woman,who,was,selling,the,birds,finally,buying,a,large,handful,that,she,plucked,herself,for,a,penny,[END]
what,in,blue,blazes,is,eleanor,doing,[END]
said,a,voice,at,scarlett's,elbow,[END]
she,looked,around,and,saw,sally,brewton's,monkey,face,[END]
good,morning,mrs,[END]
brewton,[END]
good,morning,scarlett,[END]
why,is,eleanor,buying,the,inedible,parts,of,that,bird,[END]
or,has,someone,discovered,a,way,to,cook,feathers,[END]
i,have,several,mattresses,that,i'm,not,using,right,now,[END]
scarlett,explained,why,she,wanted,them,[END]
she,could,feel,herself,getting,red,in,the,face,[END]
maybe,only,fancy,pieces,wore,trimmed,hats,in,charleston,[END]
what,a,good,idea,[END]
said,sally,with,genuine,enthusiasm,[END]
i,have,an,old,riding,top,hat,that,could,be,resurrected,with,a,cockade,of,ribbon,and,some,feathers,trailing,down,from,it,[END]
if,i,can,find,it,it's,been,so,long,since,i,used,it,last,[END]
do,you,ride,scarlett,[END]
not,for,years,[END]
not,since,[END]
she,tried,to,remember,[END]
not,since,before,the,war,[END]
i,know,[END]
me,too,[END]
i,miss,it,horribly,[END]
what,do,you,miss,sally,[END]
mrs,butler,joined,them,[END]
she,held,out,the,feathers,to,celie,[END]
tie,a,piece,of,string,'round,these,at,both,ends,and,be,careful,not,to,crush,them,[END]
then,she,gasped,[END]
excuse,me,she,said,with,a,laugh,i'll,miss,brewton's,sausage,[END]
thank,goodness,i,saw,you,sally,it,had,clean,slipped,my,mind,[END]
she,hurried,away,with,celie,in,pursuit,[END]
sally,smiled,at,scarlett's,puzzled,expression,[END]
don't,worry,she,hasn't,gone,mad,[END]
the,best,sausage,in,the,world,is,for,sale,on,saturdays,only,[END]
it,sells,out,early,[END]
the,man,who,makes,it,was,a,footman,of,ours,when,he,was,a,slave,[END]
lucullus,is,his,name,[END]
after,he,was,freed,he,added,brewton,for,a,last,name,[END]
most,of,the,slaves,did,that,you'll,find,all,of,charleston's,aristocracy,here,as,far,as,names,go,[END]
of,course,there's,a,good,number,of,lincolns,too,[END]
come,walk,with,me,scarlett,[END]
i've,got,to,get,my,vegetables,[END]
eleanor,will,find,us,[END]
sally,stopped,before,a,table,of,onions,[END]
where,the,devil,is,lila,oh,there,you,are,[END]
scarlett,this,tiny,young,creature,if,you,can,credit,it,runs,my,entire,household,as,if,she,were,ivan,the,terrible,[END]
this,is,mrs,butler,lila,mister,rhett's,wife,[END]
the,pretty,young,maid,bobbed,a,curtsey,[END]
we,needs,lots,of,onions,miss,sally,she,said,for,the,artichoke,pickles,i'm,putting,up,[END]
do,you,hear,that,scarlett,[END]
she,thinks,i'm,senile,[END]
i,know,we,need,lots,of,onions,sally,grabbed,one,of,the,brown,paper,bags,from,the,table,and,began,to,drop,onions,into,it,[END]
scarlett,watched,with,dismay,[END]
impulsively,she,put,her,hand,over,the,mouth,of,the,bag,[END]
excuse,me,mrs,brewton,but,those,onions,are,no,good,[END]
no,good,[END]
how,can,onions,be,no,good,[END]
they're,not,rotten,or,sprouting,[END]
these,onions,were,dug,up,too,soon,scarlett,explained,[END]
they,look,fine,enough,but,they,won't,have,any,flavor,[END]
i,know,because,it's,a,mistake,i,made,myself,[END]
when,i,had,to,run,our,place,i,planted,onions,[END]
since,i,didn't,know,anything,about,growing,things,i,dug,up,a,batch,as,soon,as,the,tops,started,to,brown,afraid,they,were,dying,and,would,rot,[END]
they,were,pretty,as,pictures,and,i,was,proud,as,a,peacock,because,most,of,my,planting,came,out,mighty,sorry,[END]
we,ate,them,boiled,and,stewed,and,in,fricassee,to,help,the,taste,of,the,squirrels,and,raccoons,[END]
but,they,didn't,have,any,bite,to,them,at,all,[END]
later,when,i,dug,up,the,row,to,plant,something,else,i,came,across,one,i'd,missed,[END]
that,one,was,what,an,onion's,supposed,to,be,[END]
the,fact,is,they,need,time,to,flavor,up,[END]
i'll,show,you,what,a,good,onion,should,be,like,[END]
scarlett,sorted,with,expert,eyes,hands,and,nose,through,the,baskets,on,the,table,[END]
these,are,the,ones,you,want,she,said,at,last,[END]
her,chin,was,belligerent,[END]
you,can,figure,me,for,a,country,bumpkin,if,you,want,to,she,was,thinking,but,i'm,not,ashamed,that,i,got,my,hands,dirty,when,i,had,to,[END]
you,high-toned,charlestonians,think,you're,the,be-all,and,end-all,but,you're,not,[END]
thank,you,said,sally,[END]
her,eyes,were,thoughtful,[END]
i'm,grateful,[END]
i,did,you,an,injustice,scarlett,[END]
i,didn't,think,anyone,as,pretty,as,you,could,have,any,sense,[END]
what,else,did,you,plant,[END]
i,wouldn't,mind,learning,about,celery,[END]
scarlett,studied,sally's,face,[END]
she,saw,the,honest,interest,and,responded,to,it,[END]
celery,was,too,fancy,for,me,[END]
i,had,a,dozen,mouths,to,feed,[END]
i,know,about,all,there,is,to,know,about,yams,though,and,carrots,and,white,potatoes,and,turnips,[END]
cotton,too,[END]
she,didn't,care,if,she,was,bragging,or,not,[END]
she'd,bet,anything,that,no,lady,in,charleston,had,ever,sweated,in,the,sun,picking,cotton,[END]
you,must,have,worked,yourself,to,a,shadow,[END]
respect,was,written,clear,in,sally,brewton's,eyes,[END]
we,had,to,eat,[END]
she,shrugged,off,the,past,[END]
thank,goodness,that's,way,behind,us,[END]
then,she,smiled,[END]
sally,brewton,made,her,feel,good,[END]
it,did,make,me,mighty,particular,about,root,crops,though,[END]
rhett,said,one,time,that,he'd,known,plenty,of,people,to,send,wine,back,but,i,was,the,only,one,who'd,do,it,with,carrots,[END]
we,were,at,the,fanciest,restaurant,in,new,orleans,and,did,it,ever,cause,a,rumpus,[END]
sally,laughed,explosively,[END]
i,think,i,know,that,restaurant,[END]
do,tell,me,[END]
did,the,waiter,rearrange,the,napkin,over,his,arm,and,look,down,his,nose,in,disapproval,[END]
scarlett,giggled,[END]
he,dropped,the,napkin,and,it,fell,onto,one,of,those,frying,pans,they,cook,dessert,in,[END]
and,caught,on,fire,[END]
sally,grinned,wickedly,[END]
scarlett,nodded,[END]
oh,lord,[END]
sally,hooted,[END]
i'd,have,given,my,eye,teeth,to,have,been,there,[END]
eleanor,butler,broke,in,[END]
what,are,you,two,talking,about,[END]
i,could,use,a,good,laugh,[END]
brewton,only,had,two,pounds,of,sausage,left,and,he'd,promised,them,to,minnie,wentworth,[END]
get,scarlett,to,tell,you,said,sally,still,chuckling,[END]
this,girl,of,yours,is,a,wonder,eleanor,but,i've,got,to,go,[END]
she,put,her,hand,on,the,basket,of,onions,that,scarlett,had,designated,[END]
i'll,take,this,she,said,to,the,vendor,[END]
yes,lena,the,whole,basket,[END]
just,pour,them,into,a,croaker,sack,and,give,them,to,lila,[END]
how's,your,boy,is,he,still,whooping,[END]
before,she,got,involved,in,a,discussion,of,cough,remedies,she,turned,to,scarlett,and,looked,up,into,her,face,[END]
i,hope,you'll,call,me,sally',and,come,see,me,scarlett,[END]
i'm,at,home,the,first,wednesday,of,the,month,in,the,afternoon,[END]
scarlett,didn't,know,it,but,she,had,just,advanced,to,the,highest,level,of,charleston's,tight-knit,stratified,society,[END]
doors,that,would,have,opened,a,polite,crack,for,eleanor,butler's,daughter-in-law,swung,wide,for,a,protégée,of,sally,brewton's,[END]
eleanor,butler,gladly,accepted,scarlett's,judgments,on,the,potatoes,and,carrots,she,needed,to,buy,[END]
then,she,made,her,purchases,of,cornmeal,hominy,flour,and,rice,[END]
finally,she,bought,butter,buttermilk,cream,milk,and,eggs,[END]
celie's,basket,was,overflowing,[END]
we'll,have,to,take,everything,out,and,repack,it,mrs,butler,fretted,[END]
i'll,carry,something,scarlett,offered,[END]
she,was,impatient,to,be,gone,before,she,had,to,meet,any,more,of,mrs,butler's,friends,[END]
they,had,stopped,so,often,the,walk,through,the,vegetable,and,dairy,sections,had,taken,them,more,than,an,hour,[END]
she,didn't,mind,meeting,the,women,who,were,selling,the,produce,she,wanted,to,mark,them,down,in,her,mind,very,clearly,because,she,was,sure,she'd,be,dealing,with,them,in,the,future,[END]
miss,eleanor,was,too,soft,[END]
she,was,sure,she,could,do,better,on,the,prices,[END]
it,would,be,fun,[END]
as,soon,as,she,got,the,hang,of,things,she'd,offer,to,take,over,some,of,the,shopping,[END]
not,the,fishy,things,though,[END]
they,made,her,sick,[END]
not,she,discovered,when,she,ate,them,[END]
dinner,was,a,revelation,[END]
the,she-crab,soup,was,a,velvety,blend,of,tastes,that,made,her,open,her,eyes,wide,[END]
she'd,never,tasted,anything,so,subtly,delicious,except,in,new,orleans,[END]
of,course,[END]
now,that,she,remembered,it,rhett,had,identified,many,of,the,dishes,he,ordered,for,them,as,one,kind,of,seafood,or,another,[END]
scarlett,had,a,second,bowl,of,soup,and,relished,every,drop,then,did,full,justice,to,the,rest,of,the,generous,dinner,including,dessert,a,whipped-cream-topped,crusty,nut,and,fruit,confection,that,mrs,butler,identified,as,huguenot,torte,[END]
that,afternoon,she,had,indigestion,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,[END]
not,from,overeating,[END]
eulalie,and,pauline,upset,her,[END]
we're,on,our,way,to,see,carreen,pauline,announced,when,they,arrived,and,we,figured,scarlett,would,want,to,go,with,us,[END]
sorry,to,interrupt,[END]
i,didn't,know,you'd,just,be,finishing,dinner,[END]
her,mouth,was,tight,with,disapproval,of,a,meal,that,would,last,so,long,[END]
eulalie,released,a,small,sigh,of,envy,[END]
carreen,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,see,carreen,at,all,[END]
but,she,couldn't,say,that,her,aunts,would,have,a,fit,[END]
i'd,just,love,to,go,auntie,she,cried,but,i'm,really,not,feeling,very,well,[END]
i'm,just,going,to,put,a,cool,cloth,on,my,forehead,and,lie,down,[END]
she,dropped,her,eyes,[END]
you,know,how,it,is,[END]
there,[END]
let,them,think,i'm,having,female,troubles,[END]
they're,much,too,prissy-nice,to,ask,any,questions,[END]
she,was,right,[END]
her,aunts,made,the,hastiest,possible,farewells,[END]
scarlett,saw,them,to,the,door,careful,to,walk,as,if,she,had,cramping,in,her,stomach,[END]
eulalie,patted,her,shoulder,sympathetically,when,she,kissed,her,goodbye,[END]
you,have,yourself,a,good,long,rest,now,she,said,[END]
scarlett,nodded,meekly,[END]
and,come,to,our,house,in,the,morning,at,nine-thirty,[END]
it's,a,half-hour,walk,to,saint,mary's,for,mass,[END]
scarlett,stared,gape-mouthed,with,horror,[END]
mass,had,never,crossed,her,mind,[END]
at,that,moment,a,genuine,stab,of,pain,made,her,almost,double,over,[END]
all,afternoon,she,cowered,on,the,bed,with,her,stays,loosed,and,a,hot,water,bottle,on,her,stomach,[END]
the,indigestion,was,uncomfortable,and,unfamiliar,therefore,frightening,[END]
but,far,far,more,frightening,was,her,abject,fear,of,god,[END]
ellen,o'hara,had,been,a,devout,catholic,and,she,had,done,her,best,to,make,religion,part,of,the,fabric,of,life,at,tara,[END]
there,were,evening,prayers,litany,and,rosary,and,constant,gentle,reminders,to,her,daughters,about,their,duties,and,obligations,as,christians,[END]
the,plantation's,isolation,was,a,sorrow,to,ellen,because,she,missed,the,consolations,of,the,church,[END]
in,her,quiet,way,she,tried,to,provide,them,to,her,family,[END]
by,the,time,they,were,twelve,years,old,scarlett,and,her,sisters,had,the,imperatives,of,the,catechism,firmly,implanted,by,their,mother's,patient,teaching,[END]
now,scarlett,squirmed,with,guilt,because,she,had,neglected,all,religious,observance,for,so,many,years,[END]
her,mother,must,be,weeping,in,heaven,[END]
oh,why,did,her,mother's,sisters,have,to,live,in,charleston,[END]
nobody,in,atlanta,had,ever,expected,her,to,go,to,mass,[END]
mrs,butler,wouldn't,have,fussed,at,her,or,at,worst,she,might,have,expected,her,to,go,to,the,episcopal,church,with,her,[END]
that,wouldn't,be,so,bad,[END]
scarlett,had,some,vague,notion,that,god,didn't,pay,attention,to,anything,that,happened,in,a,protestant,church,[END]
but,he,would,know,the,minute,she,stepped,over,the,threshold,of,saint,mary's,that,she,was,a,fearful,sinner,who,hadn't,been,to,confession,since,[END]
since,she,couldn't,even,remember,the,last,time,[END]
she,wouldn't,be,able,to,take,communion,and,everyone,would,know,that,was,why,[END]
she,imagined,the,invisible,guardian,angels,ellen,had,told,her,about,when,she,was,a,child,[END]
all,of,them,were,frowning,scarlett,pulled,the,covers,up,over,her,head,[END]
she,didn't,know,that,her,concept,of,religion,was,as,superstitious,and,ill-formed,as,any,stone,age,man's,[END]
she,only,knew,that,she,was,frightened,and,unhappy,and,angry,that,she,was,trapped,in,a,dilemma,[END]
what,was,she,going,to,do,[END]
she,remembered,her,mother's,serene,candlelit,face,telling,her,family,and,her,servants,that,god,loved,the,stray,lamb,most,of,all,but,it,wasn't,much,comfort,[END]
she,couldn't,think,of,any,way,to,get,out,of,going,to,mass,[END]
it,wasn't,fair,[END]
just,when,things,had,started,to,go,so,well,too,[END]
mrs,butler,had,told,her,that,sally,brewton,gave,very,exciting,whist,parties,and,she,was,sure,to,be,invited,[END]
16,[END]
scarlett,did,of,course,go,to,mass,[END]
to,her,surprise,the,ancient,ritual,and,the,responses,were,strangely,comforting,like,old,friends,in,the,new,life,she,was,beginning,[END]
it,was,easy,to,remember,her,mother,when,her,lips,were,murmuring,the,our,father,and,the,smooth,beads,of,the,rosary,were,so,familiar,to,her,fingers,[END]
ellen,must,be,pleased,to,see,her,there,on,her,knees,she,was,sure,and,it,made,her,feel,good,[END]
because,it,was,inescapable,she,made,a,confession,and,went,to,see,carreen,too,[END]
the,convent,and,her,sister,turned,out,to,be,two,more,surprises,[END]
scarlett,had,always,imagined,convents,as,fortresslike,places,with,locked,gates,where,nuns,scrubbed,stone,floors,from,morning,till,night,[END]
in,charleston,the,sisters,of,mercy,lived,in,a,magnificent,brick,mansion,and,taught,school,in,its,beautiful,ballroom,[END]
carreen,was,radiantly,happy,in,her,vocation,so,changed,from,the,quiet,withdrawn,girl,scarlett,remembered,that,she,didn't,seem,like,the,same,person,at,all,[END]
how,could,she,be,angry,with,a,stranger,[END]
especially,a,stranger,who,seemed,somehow,to,be,older,than,she,instead,of,her,baby,sister,[END]
carreen,sister,mary,joseph,was,so,extravagantly,glad,to,see,her,too,[END]
scarlett,felt,warmed,by,the,freely,expressed,love,and,admiration,[END]
if,only,suellen,was,half,as,nice,she,thought,she,wouldn't,feel,so,shut,out,at,tara,[END]
it,was,a,positive,pleasure,to,visit,carreen,and,take,tea,in,the,lovely,formal,garden,at,the,convent,even,if,carreen,did,talk,so,much,about,the,little,girls,in,her,arithmetic,class,that,it,nearly,put,scarlett,to,sleep,[END]
in,what,seemed,like,almost,no,time,at,all,sunday,mass,followed,by,breakfast,at,her,aunt's,house,and,tuesday,afternoon,tea,with,carreen,were,welcome,quiet,moments,in,scarlett's,busy,schedule,[END]
for,she,was,very,busy,[END]
a,blizzard,of,calling,cards,had,descended,on,eleanor,butler's,house,in,the,week,after,scarlett,educated,sally,brewton,about,onions,[END]
eleanor,was,grateful,to,sally,at,least,she,thought,she,was,[END]
wise,in,the,ways,of,charleston,she,was,apprehensive,for,scarlett,[END]
even,in,the,spartan,conditions,of,post-war,life,society,was,a,quicksand,of,unstated,rules,of,behavior,a,byzantine,labyrinth,of,overelaborate,refinements,lying,in,wait,to,trap,the,unwary,and,uninitiated,[END]
she,tried,to,guide,scarlett,[END]
you,needn't,call,on,all,these,people,who,left,cards,dear,she,said,[END]
it's,enough,to,leave,your,own,cards,with,the,corner,turned,down,[END]
that,acknowledges,the,call,made,on,you,and,your,willingness,to,be,acquainted,and,says,that,you,aren't,actually,coming,in,the,house,to,see,the,person,[END]
is,that,why,so,many,of,the,cards,were,all,bent,up,[END]
i,thought,they,were,just,old,and,knocked,around,[END]
well,i'm,going,to,go,see,every,single,one,of,them,[END]
i'm,glad,everybody,wants,to,be,friends,i,do,too,[END]
eleanor,held,her,tongue,[END]
it,was,a,fact,that,most,of,the,cards,were,old,and,knocked,around,[END]
no,one,could,afford,new,ones,almost,no,one,[END]
and,those,who,could,wouldn't,embarrass,those,who,couldn't,by,having,new,ones,made,[END]
it,was,accepted,custom,now,to,leave,all,cards,received,on,a,tray,in,the,entrance,hall,for,discreet,retrieval,by,their,owners,[END]
she,decided,that,for,the,moment,she,wouldn't,complicate,scarlett's,education,with,that,particular,bit,of,information,[END]
the,dear,child,had,shown,her,a,box,of,a,hundred,fresh,white,cards,that,she,had,brought,from,atlanta,[END]
they,were,so,new,that,they,were,still,interleaved,with,tissue,[END]
they,should,last,for,a,long,time,[END]
she,watched,scarlett,set,out,with,high-spirited,determination,and,she,felt,the,way,she,had,when,rhett,aged,three,had,called,triumphantly,to,her,from,the,topmost,limb,of,a,gigantic,oak,tree,[END]
eleanor,butler's,apprehensions,were,unnecessary,[END]
sally,brewton,had,been,explicit,[END]
the,girl,is,almost,totally,lacking,in,education,and,she,has,the,taste,of,a,hottentot,[END]
but,she,has,vigor,and,strength,and,she's,a,survivor,[END]
we,need,her,kind,in,the,south,yes,even,in,charleston,[END]
perhaps,especially,in,charleston,[END]
i'm,sponsoring,her,i,expect,all,my,friends,to,make,her,feel,welcome,here,[END]
soon,scarlett's,days,were,a,whirlwind,of,activity,[END]
beginning,with,an,hour,or,more,at,the,market,then,a,big,breakfast,at,the,house,usually,including,brewton's,sausage,she,was,out,and,about,by,ten,o'clock,freshly,dressed,with,pansy,trotting,behind,carrying,her,card,case,and,personal,supply,of,sugar,an,expected,accompaniment,to,all,guests,in,rationing,times,[END]
there,was,enough,time,to,pay,as,many,as,five,calls,before,she,returned,for,dinner,[END]
afternoons,were,taken,up,by,visits,to,ladies,having,their,at,home,days,or,whist,parties,or,excursions,with,new,friends,to,king,street,for,shopping,or,receiving,callers,with,miss,eleanor,[END]
scarlett,loved,the,constant,activity,[END]
even,more,she,loved,the,attention,paid,her,[END]
most,of,all,she,loved,hearing,rhett's,name,on,everyone's,lips,[END]
a,few,old,women,were,openly,critical,[END]
they,had,disapproved,of,him,when,he,was,young,and,they,would,never,relent,[END]
but,most,of,them,forgave,his,earlier,sins,[END]
he,was,older,now,chastened,[END]
and,he,was,devoted,to,his,mother,[END]
old,ladies,who,had,lost,their,own,sons,and,grandsons,in,the,war,could,well,understand,eleanor,butler's,glowing,happiness,[END]
the,younger,women,regarded,scarlett,with,poorly,concealed,envy,[END]
they,delighted,in,telling,all,the,facts,and,all,the,rumors,about,what,rhett,was,doing,when,he,left,the,city,without,explanation,[END]
some,said,that,their,husbands,knew,for,sure,that,rhett,was,financing,the,political,movement,to,throw,out,the,carpetbagger,government,in,the,state,capital,[END]
others,whispered,that,he,was,recapturing,the,butler,family,portraits,and,furnishings,at,the,point,of,a,gun,[END]
all,of,them,had,stories,about,his,exploits,during,the,war,when,his,sleek,dark,ship,raced,through,the,union,blockade,fleet,like,a,death-dealing,shadow,[END]
they,had,a,special,look,on,their,faces,when,they,talked,about,him,a,mixture,of,curiosity,and,romantic,imaginings,[END]
rhett,was,more,myth,than,man,[END]
and,he,was,scarlett's,husband,[END]
how,could,they,not,envy,her,[END]
scarlett,was,at,her,best,when,she,was,constantly,busy,and,these,were,good,days,for,her,[END]
the,social,rounds,were,just,what,she,needed,after,the,terrifying,loneliness,of,atlanta,and,she,quickly,forgot,the,desperation,she,had,felt,[END]
atlanta,must,have,been,wrong,that's,all,[END]
she'd,done,nothing,to,deserve,such,cruelty,or,everybody,in,charleston,wouldn't,like,her,so,much,[END]
and,they,did,why,else,would,they,invite,her,[END]
the,thought,was,immensely,gratifying,[END]
she,returned,to,it,often,[END]
whenever,she,was,paying,her,calls,or,receiving,calls,with,mrs,butler,or,visiting,her,specially,chosen,friend,anne,hampton,at,the,confederate,home,or,gossiping,over,coffee,at,the,market,scarlett,always,wished,that,rhett,could,see,her,[END]
sometimes,she,even,looked,quickly,around,her,imagining,that,he,was,there,so,intense,was,her,desire,[END]
oh,if,only,he'd,come,home,[END]
he,seemed,closest,to,her,in,the,quiet,time,after,supper,when,she,sat,with,his,mother,in,the,study,and,listened,with,fascination,while,miss,eleanor,talked,[END]
she,was,always,willing,to,remember,things,rhett,had,done,or,said,when,he,was,a,little,boy,[END]
scarlett,enjoyed,miss,eleanor's,other,stories,too,[END]
sometimes,they,were,wickedly,funny,[END]
eleanor,butler,like,most,of,her,charleston,contemporaries,had,been,educated,by,governesses,and,travel,[END]
she,was,well-read,but,not,intellectual,spoke,the,romance,languages,adequately,but,with,a,terrible,accent,was,familiar,with,london,paris,rome,florence,but,only,the,famous,historic,attractions,and,luxury,shops,[END]
she,was,true,to,her,era,and,her,class,[END]
she,had,never,questioned,the,authority,of,her,parents,or,her,husband,and,she,did,her,duty,in,all,respects,without,complaining,[END]
what,set,her,apart,from,most,women,of,her,type,was,that,she,had,an,irrepressible,quiet,sense,of,fun,[END]
she,enjoyed,whatever,life,brought,her,and,found,the,human,condition,fundamentally,entertaining,and,she,was,a,gifted,teller,of,stories,with,a,repertoire,that,ranged,from,accounts,of,amusing,incidents,in,her,own,life,to,the,classic,southern,storehouse,of,the,skeletons,in,the,closets,of,every,family,in,the,region,[END]
scarlett,if,she,had,known,the,reference,could,accurately,have,called,eleanor,her,personal,scheherazade,[END]
she,never,realized,that,mrs,butler,was,trying,indirectly,to,stretch,her,mind,and,her,heart,[END]
eleanor,could,see,the,vulnerability,and,courage,that,had,drawn,her,beloved,son,to,scarlett,[END]
she,could,also,see,that,something,had,gone,horribly,wrong,with,the,marriage,so,wrong,that,rhett,wanted,nothing,more,to,do,with,it,[END]
she,knew,without,being,told,that,scarlett,was,desperately,determined,to,get,him,back,and,for,her,own,reasons,she,was,even,more,eager,for,reconciliation,than,scarlett,was,[END]
she,wasn't,certain,whether,scarlett,could,make,rhett,happy,but,she,believed,with,all,her,heart,that,another,child,would,make,the,marriage,a,success,[END]
rhett,had,visited,her,with,bonnie,she,would,never,forget,the,joy,of,it,[END]
she,had,loved,the,little,girl,and,loved,even,more,seeing,her,son,so,happy,[END]
she,wanted,that,happiness,again,for,him,and,the,joy,again,for,herself,[END]
she,was,willing,to,do,anything,in,her,power,to,accomplish,it,[END]
because,she,was,so,occupied,scarlett,had,been,in,charleston,for,more,than,a,month,before,she,noticed,that,she,was,bored,[END]
it,happened,at,sally,brewton's,the,least,boring,place,in,town,when,everyone,was,talking,about,fashion,a,subject,that,had,previously,been,of,consuming,interest,to,scarlett,[END]
at,first,she,was,fascinated,to,hear,sally,and,her,circle,of,friends,mention,paris,[END]
rhett,had,once,brought,her,a,bonnet,from,paris,the,most,beautiful,most,exciting,gift,she'd,ever,received,[END]
green,to,match,her,eyes,he'd,said,with,glorious,wide,silk,ribbons,to,tie,under,her,chin,[END]
she,made,herself,listen,to,what,alicia,savage,was,saying,though,what,a,skinny,old,lady,like,her,could,know,about,dressing,was,hard,to,figure,[END]
or,sally,either,[END]
with,her,face,and,flat,chest,nothing,would,make,her,look,good,[END]
do,you,remember,worth's,fittings,[END]
mrs,savage,said,[END]
i,thought,i'd,collapse,standing,on,the,platform,so,long,[END]
a,half,dozen,voices,spoke,at,once,sharing,complaints,about,the,brutality,of,paris,dressmakers,[END]
others,argued,with,them,saying,that,any,inconvenience,was,a,small,price,to,pay,for,the,quality,that,only,paris,could,supply,[END]
several,sighed,over,memories,of,gloves,and,boots,and,fans,and,perfume,[END]
scarlett,turned,automatically,toward,whatever,voice,was,speaking,an,interested,expression,on,her,face,[END]
when,she,heard,laughter,she,laughed,[END]
but,she,thought,about,other,things,whether,there,was,any,of,that,good,pie,left,from,dinner,to,have,for,supper,[END]
her,blue,dress,that,could,use,a,fresh,collar,[END]
rhett,[END]
she,looked,at,the,clock,behind,sally's,head,[END]
she,couldn't,leave,for,at,least,eight,more,minutes,[END]
and,sally,had,seen,her,looking,[END]
she'd,have,to,pay,attention,[END]
the,eight,minutes,seemed,like,eight,more,hours,[END]
all,anybody,talked,about,miss,eleanor,was,clothes,[END]
i,thought,i'd,go,crazy,i,was,so,bored,[END]
scarlett,collapsed,into,the,chair,opposite,mrs,butler's,[END]
clothes,had,lost,their,fascination,for,her,when,she,was,reduced,to,the,four,serviceable,drab-colored,frocks,rhett's,mother,helped,her,order,from,the,dressmaker,[END]
even,the,ballgowns,that,were,being,made,held,small,interest,[END]
there,were,only,two,for,the,upcoming,six-week,series,of,balls,almost,every,night,[END]
they,were,dull,too,dull,colors,one,blue,silk,and,one,claret-colored,velvet,and,dull,design,with,hardly,any,trim,[END]
still,even,the,dullest,ball,meant,music,and,dancing,and,scarlett,dearly,loved,to,dance,[END]
rhett,would,be,back,from,the,plantation,too,miss,eleanor,had,promised,her,[END]
if,only,she,didn't,have,to,wait,so,long,for,the,season,to,start,[END]
three,weeks,suddenly,seemed,unendurably,boring,to,contemplate,with,nothing,to,do,but,sit,around,and,talk,to,women,[END]
oh,how,she,wished,something,exciting,would,happen,[END]
scarlett's,wish,was,granted,very,soon,but,not,in,the,way,she,wanted,[END]
instead,the,excitement,was,terrifying,[END]
it,started,as,malicious,gossip,that,had,people,laughing,all,over,town,[END]
mary,elizabeth,pitt,a,spinster,in,her,forties,claimed,that,she,had,awakened,in,the,middle,of,the,night,and,seen,a,man,in,her,room,[END]
just,as,plain,as,anything,she,said,with,a,kerchief,over,his,face,like,jesse,james,[END]
if,ever,i,heard,wishful,thinking,someone,unkindly,commented,that's,it,[END]
mary,elizabeth,must,be,twenty,years,older,than,jesse,james,[END]
the,newspaper,had,been,printing,a,series,of,articles,romanticizing,the,daring,exploits,of,the,james,brothers,and,their,gang,[END]
but,the,following,day,the,story,took,an,ugly,turn,[END]
alicia,savage,was,also,in,her,forties,but,she,had,been,married,twice,and,everyone,knew,that,she,was,a,calm-natured,rational,woman,[END]
she,too,had,woken,up,and,seen,a,man,in,her,bedroom,standing,beside,her,bed,looking,at,her,in,the,moonlight,[END]
he,was,holding,the,curtain,back,to,let,the,light,in,and,he,was,staring,over,a,kerchief,that,hid,the,lower,part,of,his,face,[END]
the,upper,part,was,shadowed,by,the,bill,of,his,cap,[END]
he,was,wearing,the,uniform,of,a,union,soldier,[END]
mrs,savage,screamed,and,threw,a,book,from,her,bedside,table,at,him,[END]
he,went,through,the,curtains,onto,the,piazza,before,her,husband,reached,her,room,[END]
a,yankee,[END]
suddenly,everyone,was,afraid,[END]
women,alone,were,frightened,for,themselves,women,with,husbands,were,frightened,for,themselves,and,even,more,afraid,for,their,husbands,because,if,a,man,injured,a,union,soldier,he'd,go,to,prison,or,even,be,hanged,[END]
the,next,night,and,the,next,the,soldier,materialized,in,a,woman's,bedroom,[END]
on,the,third,night,the,report,was,the,worst,of,all,[END]
it,wasn't,moonlight,that,woke,theodosia,harding,it,was,the,movement,of,a,warm,hand,on,the,coverlet,over,her,breasts,[END]
only,darkness,met,her,eyes,when,she,opened,them,[END]
but,she,could,hear,strangled,breathing,feel,a,crouching,presence,[END]
she,cried,out,then,fainted,from,fear,[END]
no,one,knew,what,might,have,happened,next,[END]
theodosia,had,been,sent,to,cousins,in,summerville,[END]
everyone,said,she,was,in,a,state,of,collapse,[END]
near,idiocy,added,the,ghoulish,[END]
a,delegation,of,charleston,men,went,to,army,headquarters,with,the,elderly,lawyer,josiah,anson,as,their,spokesman,[END]
they,were,going,to,begin,their,own,night,patrols,in,the,old,part,of,the,city,[END]
if,they,surprised,the,intruder,they'd,deal,with,him,themselves,[END]
the,commandant,agreed,to,the,patrols,[END]
but,he,warned,that,if,any,union,soldier,was,hurt,the,responsible,man,or,men,would,be,executed,[END]
there'd,be,no,vigilante,justice,or,random,attacks,on,northern,troops,under,the,guise,of,protecting,charleston's,women,[END]
scarlett's,fears,long,years,of,them,crashed,on,her,like,a,tidal,wave,[END]
she,had,grown,contemptuous,of,the,occupation,troops,like,everyone,else,in,charleston,she,ignored,them,acted,as,if,they,were,not,there,and,they,got,out,of,her,way,as,she,walked,briskly,down,the,sidewalk,on,her,way,to,pay,a,call,or,go,shopping,[END]
now,she,was,afraid,of,every,blue,uniform,she,saw,[END]
any,one,of,them,might,be,the,midnight,intruder,[END]
she,could,imagine,him,all,too,well,a,figure,springing,out,from,the,dark,[END]
her,sleep,was,broken,by,hideous,dreams,memories,really,[END]
again,and,again,she,saw,the,yankee,straggler,who'd,come,to,tara,smelled,the,rank,smell,of,him,saw,his,filthy,hairy,hands,pawing,through,the,trinkets,in,her,mother's,work,box,his,red-rimmed,eyes,hot,with,violent,lust,staring,at,her,and,his,broken-toothed,mouth,wet,and,twisted,in,an,anticipatory,leer,[END]
she'd,shot,him,[END]
obliterated,the,mouth,and,the,eyes,in,an,explosion,of,blood,and,bits,of,bone,and,viscous,red-streaked,gobbets,of,his,brains,[END]
she'd,never,been,able,to,forget,the,echoing,boom,of,the,shot,and,the,ghastly,red,spatterings,and,her,fierce,rending,triumph,[END]
oh,if,only,she,had,a,pistol,to,protect,herself,and,miss,eleanor,from,the,yankee,[END]
but,there,was,no,weapon,in,the,house,[END]
she,ransacked,cupboards,and,trunks,wardrobes,and,dresser,drawers,even,the,shelves,behind,the,books,in,the,library,[END]
she,was,defenseless,helpless,[END]
for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,felt,weak,unable,to,face,and,overcome,any,obstacle,in,her,way,[END]
it,all,but,crippled,her,[END]
she,begged,eleanor,butler,to,send,a,message,to,rhett,[END]
eleanor,temporized,[END]
yes,yes,she'd,send,word,[END]
yes,she'd,tell,him,what,alicia,had,said,about,the,hulking,size,of,the,man,and,the,unearthly,glint,of,moonlight,in,his,inhumanly,black,eyes,[END]
yes,she'd,remind,him,that,she,and,scarlett,were,two,women,alone,in,the,big,house,at,night,that,the,servants,all,went,to,their,own,homes,after,supper,except,for,manigo,an,old,man,and,pansy,a,small,weak,girl,[END]
yes,she'd,make,the,note,urgent,and,she'd,dispatch,it,right,away,on,the,very,next,trip,of,the,boat,that,brought,game,from,the,plantation,[END]
but,when,will,that,be,miss,eleanor,[END]
rhett,has,to,come,now,[END]
that,magnolia,tree,is,practically,a,ladder,from,the,ground,to,the,piazza,outside,our,rooms,[END]
scarlett,clutched,mrs,butler's,arm,shook,it,for,emphasis,[END]
eleanor,patted,her,hand,[END]
soon,dear,it's,bound,to,be,soon,[END]
we,haven't,had,any,duck,for,a,month,and,roast,duck,is,a,particular,favorite,of,mine,[END]
rhett,knows,that,[END]
besides,everything,will,be,all,right,now,[END]
ross,and,his,friends,are,going,to,patrol,every,night,[END]
ross,[END]
scarlett,screamed,inwardly,[END]
what,could,a,drunk,like,ross,butler,do,[END]
or,any,of,the,charleston,men,[END]
most,of,them,were,old,men,or,cripples,or,still,boys,[END]
if,they'd,been,any,use,they,wouldn't,have,lost,the,stupid,war,[END]
why,should,anyone,trust,them,to,fight,the,yankees,now,[END]
she,battered,her,need,against,eleanor,butler's,impenetrable,optimism,and,she,lost,[END]
for,a,while,it,seemed,the,patrols,were,effective,[END]
there,were,no,reports,of,intruders,and,everyone,calmed,down,[END]
scarlett,had,her,first,at,home,day,which,was,so,well,attended,that,her,aunt,eulalie,complained,that,there,wasn't,enough,cake,to,go,around,[END]
eleanor,butler,tore,up,the,note,she,had,written,rhett,[END]
people,went,to,church,went,shopping,played,whist,took,out,their,evening,clothes,to,air,them,and,make,repairs,before,the,season,began,[END]
scarlett,came,in,from,her,round,of,morning,calls,with,glowing,cheeks,from,walking,too,quickly,[END]
where's,mrs,[END]
butler,[END]
she,demanded,of,manigo,[END]
when,he,replied,that,she,was,in,the,kitchen,scarlett,ran,to,the,back,of,the,house,[END]
eleanor,butler,looked,up,at,scarlett's,rushed,entry,[END]
good,news,scarlett,[END]
i,had,a,letter,from,rosemary,this,morning,[END]
she'll,be,home,day,after,tomorrow,[END]
better,wire,her,to,stay,scarlett,snapped,[END]
her,voice,was,harsh,emotionless,[END]
the,yankee,got,to,harriet,madison,last,night,[END]
i,just,heard,[END]
she,looked,at,the,table,near,mrs,butler,[END]
ducks,[END]
those,are,ducks,you're,plucking,[END]
the,plantation,boat,came,[END]
i,can,go,back,to,the,plantation,on,it,to,get,rhett,[END]
you,can't,go,alone,in,that,boat,with,four,men,scarlett,[END]
i,can,take,pansy,whether,she,likes,it,or,not,[END]
here,give,me,a,sack,and,some,of,those,biscuits,[END]
i'm,hungry,[END]
i'll,eat,them,on,the,way,[END]
but,scarlett,[END]
but,me,no,buts,miss,eleanor,[END]
just,hand,me,the,biscuits,[END]
i'm,going,[END]
what,am,i,doing,[END]
scarlett,thought,near,panic,[END]
i,should,never,have,dashed,off,this,way,rhett's,going,to,be,furious,with,me,[END]
and,i,must,look,awful,[END]
it's,bad,enough,just,to,show,up,where,i,don't,belong,at,least,i,could,look,pretty,[END]
i,had,it,all,planned,so,different,[END]
she,had,thought,about,it,a,thousand,times,what,it,would,be,like,when,next,she,saw,rhett,[END]
sometimes,she,imagined,that,he'd,come,home,to,the,house,late,she'd,be,in,her,nightdress,the,one,with,the,drawstring,neck-tied,loose,and,she'd,be,brushing,her,hair,before,bedtime,[END]
rhett,had,always,loved,her,hair,he,said,it,was,a,live,thing,sometimes,in,the,early,days,he'd,brush,it,for,her,to,see,the,blue,cracklings,of,electricity,[END]
often,she,pictured,herself,at,the,tea,table,dropping,a,piece,of,sugar,into,a,cup,with,the,silver,tongs,elegantly,held,in,her,fingers,[END]
she'd,be,chatting,cozily,with,sally,brewton,and,he'd,see,how,much,at,home,she,was,how,welcomed,by,charleston's,most,interesting,people,[END]
he'd,catch,up,her,hand,and,kiss,it,and,the,tongs,would,drop,but,it,wouldn't,matter,[END]
or,she,was,with,miss,eleanor,after,supper,the,two,of,them,in,their,chairs,before,the,fire,so,comfortable,together,so,close,but,with,a,place,waiting,for,him,[END]
only,once,had,she,envisioned,going,to,the,plantation,because,she,didn't,know,what,the,place,was,like,except,that,sherman's,men,had,burned,it,[END]
her,daydream,began,allright,she,and,miss,eleanor,arrived,with,hampers,of,cakes,and,champagne,in,a,lovely,green-painted,boat,resting,against,piles,of,silk,cushions,holding,bright,flowered,parasols,[END]
picnic,they,called,out,and,rhett,laughed,and,ran,to,them,his,arms,open,[END]
but,then,it,fizzled,out,in,blankness,[END]
rhett,hated,picnics,for,one,thing,[END]
he,said,you,might,as,well,live,in,a,cave,if,you,were,going,to,eat,sitting,on,the,ground,like,an,animal,instead,of,in,a,chair,at,a,table,like,a,civilized,human,being,[END]
certainly,she,had,never,thought,of,the,possibility,that,she'd,show,up,like,this,squashed,amid,boxes,and,barrels,of,god,knows,what,on,a,scabby,boat,that,smelled,to,high,heaven,[END]
now,that,she,was,away,from,the,city,she,was,more,worried,about,rhett's,anger,than,about,the,prowling,yankee,[END]
suppose,he,just,tells,the,boatmen,to,turn,right,around,and,take,me,back,[END]
the,boatmen,dipped,their,oars,into,the,green-brown,water,only,to,steer,the,tide's,invisible,powerful,slow,current,carried,them,[END]
scarlett,looked,impatiently,at,the,banks,of,the,wide,river,[END]
it,didn't,seem,to,her,that,they,were,moving,at,all,[END]
everything,was,the,same,wide,stretches,of,tall,brown,grasses,that,swayed,slowly,oh,so,slowly,in,the,tidal,current,and,behind,them,thick,woods,draped,with,motionless,gray,curtains,of,spanish,moss,under,them,the,tangled,growth,of,overgrown,evergreen,shrubs,[END]
it,was,all,so,silent,[END]
why,weren't,there,any,birds,singing,for,heaven's,sake,[END]
and,why,was,it,getting,so,dark,already,[END]
it,began,to,rain,[END]
long,before,the,oars,started,a,steady,pull,toward,the,left,bank,she,was,soaked,to,the,skin,and,shivering,miserable,in,body,and,mind,[END]
the,bump,of,the,bow,against,a,dock,jarred,her,from,her,huddled,desolation,[END]
she,looked,up,through,the,blur,of,rain,on,her,face,and,saw,a,figure,in,streaming,black,oilskins,illuminated,by,a,blazing,torch,[END]
the,face,was,invisible,under,a,deep,hood,[END]
throw,me,a,line,[END]
rhett,leaned,forward,one,arm,outstretched,[END]
good,trip,boys,[END]
scarlett,pushed,against,the,crates,nearest,her,to,stand,[END]
her,legs,were,too,cramped,to,hold,her,and,she,fell,back,toppling,the,topmost,crate,with,a,crash,[END]
what,the,hell,[END]
rhett,caught,the,noosed,rope,that,snaked,to,him,from,the,boatman,and,dropped,the,circle,over,a,mooring,post,[END]
toss,up,the,stern,line,he,ordered,[END]
what's,making,that,racket,[END]
are,you,men,drunk,[END]
no,sir,mister,rhett,the,boatmen,chorused,[END]
it,was,the,first,time,they,had,spoken,since,they,had,left,the,dock,in,charleston,[END]
one,of,them,gestured,toward,the,two,women,in,the,stern,of,the,barge,[END]
my,god,[END]
said,rhett,[END]
17,[END]
do,you,feel,better,now,[END]
rhett's,voice,was,carefully,controlled,[END]
scarlett,nodded,dumbly,[END]
she,was,wrapped,in,a,blanket,wearing,a,coarse,work,shirt,of,rhett's,underneath,and,sitting,on,a,stool,near,an,open,fire,with,her,bare,feet,in,a,tub,of,hot,water,[END]
how,are,you,doing,pansy,[END]
scarlett's,maid,on,another,stool,in,another,blanket,cocoon,grinned,and,allowed,as,how,she,was,doing,just,fine,excepting,that,she,was,powerful,hungry,[END]
rhett,chuckled,[END]
and,so,am,i,when,you,dry,out,we'll,eat,[END]
scarlett,pulled,the,blanket,more,closely,around,her,[END]
he's,being,too,nice,i've,seen,him,like,this,before,all,smiles,and,warm,as,sunshine,[END]
then,it,would,turn,out,that,he,was,really,mad,enough,to,spit,nails,all,the,time,[END]
it's,because,pansy's,here,that's,why,he's,putting,on,this,act,[END]
when,she's,gone,he'll,turn,on,me,[END]
maybe,i,can,say,i,need,her,to,stay,with,me,but,for,what,[END]
i'm,already,undressed,and,i,can't,put,my,clothes,on,again,until,they,dry,and,lord,knows,when,that,will,be,with,the,rain,outside,and,the,inside,so,dank,[END]
how,can,rhett,bear,to,live,in,this,place,[END]
it's,awful,[END]
the,room,they,were,in,was,lit,only,by,the,fire,[END]
it,was,a,large,square,perhaps,twenty,feet,to,a,side,with,a,packed-earth,floor,and,stained,walls,that,had,lost,most,of,their,plaster,[END]
it,smelled,of,cheap,whiskey,and,tobacco,juice,with,an,underlay,of,scorched,wood,and,fabric,[END]
the,only,furniture,was,an,assortment,of,crude,stools,and,benches,plus,a,scattering,of,dented,metal,cuspidors,[END]
the,mantelpiece,over,the,wide,fireplace,and,the,frames,around,the,doors,and,windows,looked,like,some,kind,of,mistake,[END]
they,were,made,of,pine,beautifully,carved,with,a,delicate,fretwork,design,and,oiled,to,a,glowing,golden,brown,[END]
in,one,corner,there,was,a,rough,staircase,with,splintered,wooden,treads,and,a,sagging,unsafe,railing,[END]
scarlett's,and,pansy's,clothes,were,draped,over,the,length,of,it,[END]
the,white,petticoats,billowed,from,time,to,time,when,a,draft,caught,them,like,ghosts,lurking,in,deep,shadows,[END]
why,didn't,you,stay,in,charleston,scarlett,[END]
supper,was,over,and,pansy,had,been,sent,to,sleep,with,the,old,black,woman,who,cooked,for,rhett,[END]
scarlett,squared,her,shoulders,[END]
your,mother,didn't,want,to,disturb,you,in,your,paradise,here,[END]
she,looked,around,the,room,disdainfully,[END]
but,i,believe,you,should,know,what's,going,on,[END]
there's,a,yankee,soldier,creeping,into,bedrooms,at,night,ladies',bedrooms,and,handling,them,[END]
one,girl,went,clean,out,of,her,mind,and,had,to,be,sent,off,[END]
she,tried,to,read,his,face,but,it,was,expressionless,[END]
he,was,looking,at,her,silent,as,if,he,was,waiting,for,something,[END]
well,[END]
don't,you,care,that,your,mother,and,i,could,be,murdered,in,our,beds,or,something,worse,[END]
rhett's,mouth,turned,down,in,a,derisive,smile,[END]
am,i,hearing,correctly,[END]
maidenly,timidity,from,the,woman,who,drove,a,wagon,through,the,entire,yankee,army,because,it,was,in,her,way,[END]
come,now,scarlett,[END]
you've,been,known,to,tell,the,truth,[END]
why,did,you,come,all,this,way,in,the,rain,[END]
were,you,hoping,to,catch,me,in,the,arms,of,a,light,o',love,[END]
did,henry,hamilton,recommend,that,as,a,way,to,get,me,to,start,paying,your,bills,again,[END]
what,on,earth,are,you,talking,about,rhett,butler,[END]
what,has,uncle,henry,got,to,do,with,anything,[END]
such,convincing,ignorance,[END]
i,compliment,you,[END]
but,you,can't,expect,me,to,believe,for,an,instant,that,your,crafty,old,lawyer,didn't,notify,you,when,i,cut,off,the,money,i,was,sending,to,atlanta,[END]
i'm,too,fond,of,henry,hamilton,to,credit,such,negligence,[END]
stopped,sending,the,money,[END]
you,can't,do,that,[END]
scarlett's,knees,turned,to,jelly,[END]
rhett,couldn't,mean,it,[END]
what,would,happen,to,her,[END]
the,house,on,peachtree,street,the,tons,of,coal,it,took,to,heat,it,the,servants,to,clean,and,cook,and,wash,and,keep,the,garden,and,the,horses,and,polish,the,carriages,the,food,for,all,of,them,why,it,cost,a,fortune,[END]
how,could,uncle,henry,pay,the,bills,[END]
he'd,use,her,money,[END]
no,no,that,couldn't,be,[END]
she'd,scrabbled,along,with,no,food,in,her,belly,broken,shoes,on,her,feet,her,back,breaking,and,her,hands,bleeding,while,she,worked,in,the,fields,to,keep,from,starving,[END]
she'd,given,up,all,her,pride,turned,her,back,on,everything,she'd,been,taught,done,business,with,low-down,people,not,fit,to,spit,on,schemed,and,cheated,worked,day,and,night,for,her,money,[END]
she,wouldn't,let,it,go,she,couldn't,[END]
it,was,hers,[END]
it,was,the,only,thing,she,had,[END]
you,can't,take,my,money,[END]
she,screamed,at,rhett,[END]
but,it,came,out,a,cracked,whisper,[END]
he,laughed,[END]
i,haven't,taken,any,away,from,you,my,pet,[END]
i've,only,stopped,adding,to,it,[END]
as,long,as,you're,living,in,the,house,i,provide,in,charleston,there's,no,reason,for,me,to,maintain,an,empty,house,in,atlanta,[END]
of,course,if,you,were,to,return,to,it,it,would,no,longer,be,empty,[END]
then,i'd,feel,obliged,to,begin,paying,for,it,again,[END]
rhett,walked,over,to,the,fireplace,where,he,could,see,her,face,in,the,light,of,the,flames,[END]
his,challenging,smile,disappeared,and,his,forehead,creased,with,concern,[END]
you,really,didn't,know,did,you,[END]
hold,on,scarlett,i'll,get,you,a,brandy,[END]
you,look,like,you're,going,to,pass,out,[END]
he,had,to,steady,her,hands,with,his,to,hold,the,glass,to,her,lips,[END]
she,was,trembling,uncontrollably,[END]
when,the,glass,was,empty,he,dropped,it,on,the,floor,and,chafed,her,hands,until,they,warmed,and,stopped,shaking,[END]
now,tell,me,in,sober,truth,is,there,really,a,soldier,breaking,into,bedrooms,[END]
rhett,you,didn't,mean,it,did,you,[END]
you,aren't,going,to,stop,sending,the,money,to,atlanta,[END]
to,hell,with,the,money,scarlett,i,asked,you,a,question,[END]
to,hell,with,you,she,said,i,asked,you,one,[END]
i,should,have,known,you,wouldn't,be,able,to,think,of,anything,else,once,money,was,mentioned,[END]
all,right,i'll,send,some,to,henry,[END]
now,will,you,answer,me,[END]
you,swear,[END]
i,swear,[END]
tomorrow,[END]
yes,[END]
yes,dammit,tomorrow,[END]
now,once,and,for,all,what's,this,story,about,a,yankee,soldier,[END]
scarlett's,sigh,of,relief,seemed,to,last,forever,[END]
then,she,drew,breath,into,her,lungs,and,told,him,everything,she,knew,about,the,intruder,[END]
you,say,alicia,savage,saw,his,uniform,[END]
yes,scarlett,answered,[END]
then,she,added,spitefully,he,doesn't,care,how,old,they,are,[END]
maybe,he's,raping,your,mother,right,this,minute,[END]
rhett's,big,hands,clenched,[END]
i,should,strangle,you,scarlett,[END]
the,world,would,be,a,better,place,[END]
he,questioned,her,for,almost,an,hour,until,she,was,drained,of,everything,she'd,heard,[END]
very,well,he,said,then,we'll,leave,tomorrow,as,soon,as,the,tide,turns,[END]
he,walked,to,a,door,and,threw,it,open,[END]
good,he,said,the,sky,is,clear,[END]
it'll,be,an,easy,run,[END]
past,his,silhouette,scarlett,could,see,the,night,sky,[END]
there,was,a,three-quarter,moon,[END]
she,stood,wearily,[END]
then,she,saw,the,mist,from,the,river,that,covered,the,ground,outside,[END]
the,moonlight,made,it,white,and,for,a,confused,moment,she,wondered,if,it,had,snowed,[END]
a,billow,of,mist,enveloped,rhett's,feet,and,ankles,then,dissipated,into,the,room,[END]
he,closed,the,door,and,turned,[END]
without,the,moonlight,the,room,seemed,very,dark,until,a,match,flared,illuminating,rhett's,chin,and,nose,from,below,[END]
he,touched,it,to,a,lamp,wick,and,she,could,see,his,face,[END]
scarlett,ached,with,longing,[END]
he,put,the,glass,chimney,on,the,lamp,and,held,it,high,[END]
come,with,me,[END]
there's,a,bedroom,upstairs,where,you,can,sleep,[END]
it,was,not,nearly,as,primitive,as,the,room,downstairs,[END]
the,tall,four-post,bed,had,a,thick,mattress,and,fat,pillows,and,a,bright,woolen,blanket,over,its,crisp,linen,sheets,[END]
scarlett,didn't,look,at,the,other,furnishings,[END]
she,let,the,blanket,fall,from,her,shoulders,and,climbed,the,set,of,steps,beside,the,bed,to,burrow,under,the,covers,[END]
he,stood,over,her,a,moment,before,he,left,the,room,[END]
she,listened,to,his,footsteps,[END]
no,he,wasn't,going,downstairs,he'd,be,close,by,[END]
scarlett,smiled,then,slept,[END]
the,nightmare,began,as,it,had,always,begun,with,the,mist,[END]
it,was,years,since,scarlett,had,dreamed,it,but,her,unconscious,mind,remembered,even,as,it,created,the,dream,and,she,began,to,twist,and,thrash,and,whimper,deep,in,the,back,of,her,throat,dreading,what,was,to,come,[END]
then,again,she,was,running,with,her,straining,heart,pounding,in,her,ears,running,stumbling,and,running,through,a,thick,white,fog,that,twined,cold,swirling,tendrils,around,her,throat,and,legs,and,arms,[END]
she,was,cold,as,cold,as,death,and,hungry,and,terrified,[END]
it,was,the,same,it,had,always,been,the,same,and,each,time,worse,than,the,time,before,as,if,the,terror,and,hunger,and,cold,accumulated,grew,stronger,[END]
and,yet,it,was,not,the,same,[END]
for,in,the,past,she,had,been,running,and,reaching,for,something,unnamed,and,unknowable,and,now,ahead,of,her,she,could,glimpse,through,streaks,in,the,mist,rhett's,broad,back,always,moving,away,[END]
and,she,knew,that,he,was,what,she,was,searching,for,that,when,she,reached,him,the,dream,would,lose,its,power,and,fade,away,never,to,return,[END]
she,ran,and,ran,but,he,was,always,far,ahead,always,with,his,back,turned,on,her,[END]
then,the,fog,thickened,and,he,began,to,disappear,and,she,cried,out,to,him,[END]
rhett,[END]
rhett,[END]
rhett,[END]
rhett,[END]
rhett,[END]
hush,hush,now,[END]
you're,dreaming,it's,not,real,[END]
rhett,[END]
yes,i'm,here,[END]
hush,now,[END]
you're,all,right,[END]
strong,arms,lifted,her,and,held,her,and,she,was,warm,and,safe,at,last,[END]
scarlett,half-woke,with,a,start,[END]
there,was,no,mist,[END]
instead,a,lamp,on,a,table,cast,a,glowing,light,and,she,could,see,rhett's,face,bent,close,above,hers,[END]
oh,rhett,she,cried,[END]
it,was,so,awful,[END]
the,old,dream,[END]
yes,yes,well,almost,[END]
there,was,something,different,i,can't,remember,[END]
but,i,was,cold,and,hungry,and,i,couldn't,see,because,of,the,fog,and,i,was,so,frightened,rhett,it,was,terrible,[END]
he,held,her,close,and,his,voice,vibrated,in,his,hard,chest,next,to,her,ear,[END]
of,course,you,were,cold,and,hungry,[END]
that,supper,wasn't,fit,to,eat,and,you've,kicked,off,your,blankets,[END]
i'll,pull,them,up,and,you'll,sleep,just,fine,[END]
he,laid,her,down,against,the,pillows,[END]
don't,leave,me,[END]
it'll,come,back,[END]
rhett,spread,the,blankets,up,over,her,[END]
there'll,be,biscuits,for,breakfast,and,hominy,and,butter,enough,to,turn,them,yellow,[END]
think,about,that,and,country,ham,and,fresh,eggs,and,you'll,sleep,like,a,baby,[END]
you've,always,been,a,good,feeder,scarlett,[END]
his,voice,was,amused,[END]
and,tired,[END]
she,closed,her,heavy,eyelids,[END]
rhett,[END]
it,was,a,blurred,drowsy,sound,[END]
he,paused,in,the,doorway,his,hand,shading,the,lamplight,[END]
yes,scarlett,[END]
thank,you,for,coming,to,wake,me,[END]
how,did,you,know,[END]
you,were,yelling,loud,enough,to,break,the,windows,[END]
the,last,sound,she,heard,was,his,warm,gentle,laughter,[END]
it,was,like,a,lullaby,[END]
true,to,rhett's,prediction,scarlett,ate,an,enormous,breakfast,before,she,went,to,look,for,him,[END]
he'd,been,up,before,dawn,the,cook,told,her,[END]
he,was,always,up,before,the,sun,[END]
she,looked,at,scarlett,with,undisguised,curiosity,[END]
i,should,wear,her,out,for,her,impudence,scarlett,thought,but,she,was,so,content,she,couldn't,summon,up,any,real,anger,[END]
rhett,had,held,her,comforted,her,even,laughed,at,her,[END]
just,as,he,used,to,before,things,went,wrong,[END]
she'd,been,so,right,to,come,to,the,plantation,[END]
she,should,have,done,it,before,instead,of,frittering,away,her,time,at,a,million,tea,parties,[END]
the,sunlight,made,her,narrow,her,eyes,when,she,stepped,outside,the,house,[END]
it,was,strong,already,warm,on,her,head,although,it,was,still,very,early,[END]
she,shaded,her,eyes,with,her,hand,and,looked,around,her,[END]
a,soft,moan,was,her,first,reaction,[END]
the,brick,terrace,under,her,feet,continued,to,her,left,for,a,hundred,yards,[END]
broken,blackened,and,grass-grown,it,was,a,frame,for,a,monumental,charred,ruin,[END]
jagged,remnants,of,walls,and,chimneys,were,all,that,remained,of,what,had,been,a,magnificent,mansion,[END]
tumbled,mounds,of,smoke,and,firestained,bricks,within,the,fragments,of,walls,were,heart-stopping,mementos,of,sherman's,army,[END]
scarlett,was,heartsick,[END]
this,had,been,rhett's,home,rhett's,life,lost,forever,before,he,could,come,back,to,reclaim,it,[END]
nothing,in,her,troubled,life,had,ever,been,as,bad,as,this,[END]
she'd,never,known,the,degree,of,pain,he,must,have,felt,must,still,feel,a,hundred,times,a,day,when,he,saw,the,ruins,of,his,home,[END]
no,wonder,he,was,determined,to,rebuild,to,find,and,regain,everything,he,could,of,the,old,possessions,[END]
she,could,help,him,[END]
hadn't,she,plowed,and,planted,and,harvested,tara's,fields,herself,[END]
why,she'd,wager,rhett,didn't,even,know,good,seed,corn,from,bad,[END]
she'd,be,proud,to,help,because,she,knew,how,much,it,meant,what,a,victory,it,was,over,the,despoilers,when,the,land,was,reborn,with,tender,new,growth,[END]
i,understand,she,thought,triumphantly,[END]
i,can,feel,what,he's,feeling,[END]
i,can,work,with,him,[END]
we,can,do,this,together,[END]
i,don't,mind,a,dirt,floor,[END]
not,if,it's,with,rhett,[END]
where,is,he,[END]
i've,got,to,tell,him,[END]
scarlett,turned,away,from,the,shell,of,the,house,and,found,herself,facing,a,vista,unlike,anything,she'd,ever,seen,in,her,life,[END]
the,brick,terrace,on,which,she,was,standing,led,onto,a,grass-covered,earth,parterre,the,highest,of,a,series,of,grass,terraces,that,unfolded,in,perfectly,contoured,sweeping,movement,down,to,a,pair,of,sculpted,lakes,in,the,shape,of,gigantic,butterfly,wings,[END]
between,them,a,wide,grassy,path,led,to,the,river,and,the,boat,landing,[END]
the,extravagant,scale,was,so,perfectly,proportioned,that,the,great,distances,appeared,less,and,the,whole,was,like,a,carpeted,outdoor,room,[END]
the,lush,grass,hid,the,scars,of,war,as,though,it,had,never,been,[END]
it,was,a,scene,of,sunlit,tranquillity,of,nature,lovingly,shaped,into,harmony,with,man,[END]
in,the,distance,a,bird,sang,an,extended,melody,as,if,in,celebration,[END]
oh,how,pretty,[END]
she,said,aloud,[END]
movement,to,the,left,of,the,lowest,terrace,caught,scarlett's,eye,[END]
it,must,be,rhett,[END]
she,began,to,run,[END]
down,the,terraces,the,undulation,increased,her,speed,and,she,felt,a,giddy,intoxicating,joyful,freedom,she,laughed,and,threw,her,arms,wide,a,bird,or,a,butterfly,about,to,soar,into,the,blue,blue,skies,[END]
she,was,breathless,when,she,reached,the,place,where,rhett,was,standing,and,watching,her,[END]
scarlett,panted,her,hand,on,her,chest,until,her,breath,returned,[END]
then,i've,never,had,such,fun,[END]
she,said,still,half-gasping,[END]
what,a,wonderful,place,this,is,rhett,[END]
no,wonder,you,love,it,[END]
did,you,run,down,that,lawn,when,you,were,a,little,boy,[END]
did,you,feel,like,you,could,fly,[END]
oh,my,darling,how,horrible,to,see,the,burning,[END]
i'm,broken-hearted,for,you,i'd,like,to,kill,every,yankee,in,the,world,[END]
oh,rhett,i've,got,so,much,to,tell,you,[END]
i've,been,thinking,[END]
it,can,all,come,back,darling,just,like,the,grass,[END]
i,understand,i,really,truly,do,understand,what,you're,doing,[END]
rhett,looked,at,her,strangely,cautiously,[END]
what,do,you,understand,',scarlett,[END]
why,you're,here,instead,of,in,town,[END]
why,you,must,bring,the,plantation,back,to,life,[END]
tell,me,what,you've,done,what,you're,going,to,do,[END]
it's,so,exciting,[END]
rhett's,face,lit,up,and,he,gestured,toward,the,long,rows,of,plants,behind,him,[END]
they,burned,he,said,but,they,didn't,die,[END]
it,looks,as,if,perhaps,they,were,even,strengthened,by,the,burning,[END]
the,ashes,may,have,given,them,something,they,needed,[END]
i've,got,to,find,out,[END]
i've,got,so,much,to,learn,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,low,stubby,remains,[END]
she,didn't,know,those,dark,green,shiny,leaves,[END]
what,kind,of,tree,is,it,[END]
do,you,grow,peaches,here,[END]
they're,not,trees,[END]
scarlett,they're,shrubs,[END]
camellias,[END]
the,first,ones,ever,brought,to,america,were,planted,here,at,dunmore,landing,[END]
these,are,offshoots,over,three,hundred,all,told,[END]
do,you,mean,they're,flowers,[END]
of,course,[END]
the,most,nearly,perfect,flower,in,the,world,[END]
the,chinese,worship,them,[END]
but,you,can't,eat,flowers,[END]
what,crops,are,you,planting,[END]
i,can't,think,about,crops,[END]
i've,got,a,hundred,acres,of,garden,to,save,[END]
that's,crazy,rhett,[END]
what's,a,flower,garden,good,for,[END]
you,could,grow,something,to,sell,[END]
i,know,cotton,doesn't,grow,'round,here,but,there,must,be,some,good,cash,crop,[END]
why,at,tara,we,put,every,foot,of,land,to,use,[END]
you,could,plant,right,up,to,the,walls,of,the,house,[END]
just,look,how,green,and,thick,that,grass,is,[END]
the,land,must,be,as,rich,as,anything,[END]
all,you'd,have,to,do,is,plow,it,and,drop,in,the,seed,and,it,would,probably,sprout,faster,than,you,could,get,out,of,the,way,[END]
she,looked,eagerly,at,him,ready,to,share,her,hard-earned,knowledge,[END]
you're,a,barbarian,scarlett,rhett,said,heavily,[END]
go,up,to,the,house,and,tell,pansy,to,get,ready,[END]
i'll,meet,you,at,the,dock,[END]
what,had,she,done,wrong,[END]
one,minute,he,was,full,of,life,and,excitement,then,all,of,a,sudden,it,was,gone,and,he,was,cold,a,stranger,[END]
she'd,never,understand,him,if,she,lived,to,be,a,hundred,[END]
she,strode,rapidly,up,the,green,terraces,blind,now,to,their,beauty,and,into,the,house,[END]
the,boat,moored,to,the,landing,was,very,different,from,the,scabrous,barge,that,had,brought,scarlett,and,pansy,to,the,plantation,[END]
it,was,a,sleek,brown-painted,sloop,with,bright,brass,fittings,and,gilt,scroll,trim,[END]
beyond,it,in,the,river,was,another,boat,one,that,she'd,much,prefer,scarlett,thought,angrily,[END]
it,was,five,times,the,size,of,the,sloop,and,it,had,two,decks,with,white,and,blue,gingerbread,scrollwork,trim,and,a,bright,red,rear,paddlewheel,[END]
gaily,colored,bunting,flags,were,strung,from,its,smokestacks,and,brightly,dressed,men,and,women,crowded,the,rails,on,both,decks,[END]
it,looked,festive,and,fun,[END]
it's,just,like,rhett,scarlett,brooded,to,go,to,the,city,in,his,dinky,little,boat,instead,of,hailing,the,steamer,to,pick,us,up,[END]
she,reached,the,landing,just,as,rhett,took,off,his,hat,and,made,a,sweeping,flamboyant,bow,to,the,people,on,the,paddlewheeler,[END]
do,you,know,those,folks,[END]
she,said,[END]
maybe,she,was,wrong,maybe,he,was,signalling,[END]
rhett,turned,from,the,river,replacing,his,hat,[END]
indeed,i,do,[END]
not,individually,i,hope,but,in,the,whole,[END]
that's,the,weekly,excursion,boat,from,charleston,up,the,river,and,back,[END]
a,highly,profitable,business,for,one,of,our,carpetbagger,citizens,[END]
yankees,buy,tickets,well,in,advance,for,the,pleasure,of,seeing,the,skeletons,of,the,burned-out,plantation,houses,[END]
i,always,greet,them,if,it's,convenient,it,amuses,me,to,see,the,confusion,it,engenders,[END]
scarlett,was,too,appalled,to,say,a,word,[END]
how,could,rhett,make,a,joke,out,of,a,bunch,of,yankee,buzzards,laughing,at,what,they'd,done,to,his,home,[END]
she,settled,herself,obediently,on,a,cushioned,bench,in,the,small,cabin,but,as,soon,as,rhett,stepped,up,on,deck,she,jumped,up,to,examine,the,intricate,arrangement,of,cupboards,shelves,supplies,and,equipment,each,thing,in,a,place,obviously,designed,for,its,storage,[END]
she,was,still,busily,satisfying,her,curiosity,as,the,sloop,moved,slowly,along,the,riverbank,for,a,short,distance,and,then,tied,up,again,[END]
rhett,called,out,crisp,orders,[END]
pass,those,bundles,over,and,tie,them,down,on,the,bow,[END]
scarlett,poked,her,head,up,from,the,hatch,to,see,what,was,going,on,[END]
gracious,peace,what,was,all,this,[END]
dozens,of,black,men,were,leaning,on,picks,and,shovels,and,watching,as,a,series,of,bulky,sacks,were,thrown,to,a,crewman,on,the,sloop,[END]
where,on,earth,could,they,be,[END]
this,place,looked,like,the,back,side,of,the,moon,[END]
there,was,a,huge,clearing,in,the,woods,with,a,big,pit,dug,in,it,and,gigantic,piles,of,what,looked,like,pale,chunks,of,rock,on,one,side,[END]
chalky,dust,filled,the,air,and,soon,her,nostrils,and,she,sneezed,[END]
pansy's,echoing,sneeze,from,the,rear,deck,caught,her,attention,[END]
no,fair,she,thought,[END]
pansy,had,a,good,view,of,everything,[END]
i'm,coming,up,scarlett,shouted,[END]
cast,off,rhett,said,at,the,same,time,[END]
the,sloop,moved,quickly,caught,by,the,fast,river,current,sending,scarlett,tumbling,down,from,the,short,ladder-stair,into,a,graceless,sprawl,in,the,cabin,[END]
damn,you,rhett,butler,i,could,have,broken,my,neck,[END]
you,didn't,[END]
stay,put,[END]
i'll,be,down,shortly,[END]
scarlett,heard,the,creaking,of,ropes,and,the,sloop,picked,up,speed,[END]
she,scrambled,to,one,of,the,benches,and,pulled,herself,up,[END]
almost,immediately,rhett,stepped,easily,down,the,ladder,his,head,bent,to,clear,the,hatch,[END]
he,straightened,up,and,his,head,grazed,the,polished,wood,above,it,[END]
scarlett,glared,at,him,[END]
you,did,that,on,purpose,she,grumbled,[END]
did,what,[END]
he,opened,one,of,the,small,portholes,and,closed,the,hatch,[END]
good,he,said,then,we've,got,a,following,wind,and,a,strong,current,[END]
we'll,be,in,the,city,in,record,time,[END]
he,dropped,onto,the,bench,opposite,scarlett,and,lounged,back,sleek,and,sinuous,as,a,cat,[END]
i,assume,you,won't,object,if,i,smoke,[END]
his,long,fingers,dipped,into,the,interior,pocket,of,his,coat,and,extracted,a,cheroot,[END]
i,object,a,lot,[END]
why,am,i,shut,up,down,here,in,the,dark,[END]
i,want,to,go,upstairs,in,the,sun,[END]
above,rhett,corrected,automatically,[END]
this,is,a,rather,small,craft,[END]
the,crew,is,black,pansy,is,black,you,are,white,and,a,woman,[END]
they,get,the,cockpit,you,get,the,cabin,[END]
pansy,can,roll,her,eyes,at,the,two,men,laugh,at,their,somewhat,indelicate,gallantries,and,they'll,all,three,have,a,pleasant,time,[END]
your,presence,would,spoil,it,[END]
so,at,the,same,time,that,the,underclass,is,enjoying,the,journey,you,and,i,the,privileged,elite,will,be,thoroughly,miserable,cooped,up,in,each,other's,company,while,you,continue,to,pout,and,whine,[END]
i'm,not,pouting,and,whining,[END]
and,i'll,thank,you,not,to,talk,to,me,as,if,i,was,a,child,[END]
scarlett,pulled,in,her,lower,lip,[END]
she,hated,it,when,rhett,made,her,feel,foolish,[END]
what,was,that,quarry,we,stopped,at,[END]
that,my,dear,was,the,salvation,of,charleston,and,my,passport,back,into,the,bosom,of,my,people,[END]
it,is,a,phosphate,mine,[END]
there,are,dozens,of,them,scattered,along,both,rivers,[END]
he,lit,his,cigar,with,prolonged,appreciation,and,the,smoke,spiraled,upward,to,the,porthole,[END]
i,see,your,eyes,gleaming,scarlett,[END]
it's,not,the,same,as,a,gold,mine,[END]
you,can't,make,coins,or,jewelry,out,of,phosphate,[END]
but,ground,and,washed,and,treated,with,certain,chemicals,it,makes,the,best,quick-acting,fertilizer,in,the,world,[END]
there,are,customers,waiting,for,as,much,of,it,as,we,can,produce,[END]
so,you're,getting,richer,than,ever,[END]
yes,i,am,[END]
but,more,to,the,point,this,is,respectable,charleston,money,[END]
i,can,spend,as,much,of,my,ill-gotten,speculator,profit,as,i,like,now,without,disapproval,[END]
everyone,can,tell,themselves,that,it,comes,from,phosphates,even,though,the,mine,is,puny,in,size,[END]
why,don't,you,make,it,bigger,[END]
i,don't,have,to,[END]
it,serves,my,purpose,just,as,it,is,[END]
i,have,a,foreman,who,doesn't,cheat,me,much,a,couple,of,dozen,laborers,who,work,almost,as,much,as,they,loaf,and,respectability,[END]
i,can,spend,my,time,and,money,and,sweat,on,what,i,care,about,and,right,now,that's,restoring,the,gardens,[END]
scarlett,was,annoyed,almost,past,bearing,[END]
wasn't,that,just,like,rhett,to,fall,into,a,tub,of,butter,[END]
and,to,waste,the,chance,[END]
no,matter,how,rich,he,was,he,could,stand,to,get,richer,[END]
there,was,no,such,ouir,and,got,a,decent,day's,work,out,of,those,men,he,could,triple,the,yield,[END]
with,another,couple,of,dozen,laborers,he,could,double,that,[END]
forgive,me,for,interrupting,your,empire,building,scarlett,but,i,have,a,serious,question,to,ask,you,[END]
what,would,it,take,to,convince,you,that,you,should,leave,me,in,peace,and,go,back,to,atlanta,[END]
scarlett,gaped,at,him,[END]
she,was,genuinely,astonished,[END]
he,couldn't,possibly,mean,what,he,was,saying,not,after,he,had,held,her,so,tenderly,last,night,[END]
you're,joking,she,accused,[END]
no,i,am,not,[END]
i've,never,been,more,serious,in,my,life,and,i,want,you,to,take,me,seriously,[END]
it,has,never,been,my,habit,to,explain,to,anyone,what,i'm,doing,or,what,i'm,thinking,nor,do,i,have,any,real,confidence,that,you,will,understand,what,i'm,going,to,tell,you,[END]
but,i'm,going,to,try,[END]
i,am,working,harder,than,i've,ever,had,to,work,in,my,life,scarlett,[END]
i,burned,my,bridges,in,charleston,so,thoroughly,and,so,publicly,that,the,stench,of,the,destruction,is,still,in,the,nostrils,of,everyone,in,town,[END]
it's,immeasurably,stronger,than,the,worst,sherman,could,do,because,i,was,one,of,their,own,and,i,defied,everything,they,built,their,lives,on,[END]
winning,my,way,back,into,charleston's,good,graces,is,like,climbing,an,ice-covered,mountain,in,the,dark,[END]
one,slip,and,i'm,dead,[END]
so,far,i've,been,very,cautious,and,very,slow,and,i've,made,some,small,headway,[END]
i,can't,take,the,risk,of,your,destroying,all,i've,done,[END]
i,want,you,to,leave,and,i'm,asking,your,price,[END]
scarlett,laughed,with,relief,[END]
is,that,all,[END]
you,can,set,your,mind,at,rest,if,that's,what's,worrying,you,[END]
why,everybody,in,charleston,just,loves,me,[END]
i'm,rushed,off,my,feet,with,invitations,to,this,and,that,and,not,a,day,goes,by,that,somebody,doesn't,come,up,to,me,in,the,market,and,ask,my,advice,about,her,shopping,[END]
rhett,drew,on,his,cigar,[END]
then,he,watched,the,bright,end,of,it,cool,and,become,ash,[END]
i,was,afraid,i'd,be,wasting,my,breath,he,said,at,last,[END]
i,was,right,[END]
i'll,admit,you've,lasted,longer,and,been,more,restrained,than,i,expected,oh,yes,i,hear,some,news,from,town,when,i'm,on,the,plantation,but,you're,like,a,powder,keg,lashed,to,my,back,on,that,ice-mountain,scarlett,[END]
you're,dead,weight,unlettered,uncivilized,catholic,and,an,exile,from,everything,decent,in,atlanta,[END]
you,could,blow,up,in,my,face,any,minute,[END]
i,want,you,gone,[END]
what,will,it,take,[END]
scarlett,seized,on,the,only,accusation,she,could,defend,[END]
i'd,be,grateful,if,you'd,tell,me,what's,wrong,with,being,a,catholic,rhett,butler,[END]
we,were,god-fearing,long,before,you,episcopalians,were,ever,heard,of,[END]
rhett's,sudden,laughter,made,no,sense,to,her,[END]
pax,henry,tudor,he,said,which,made,no,sense,either,[END]
but,his,next,words,struck,to,the,bone,with,their,accuracy,[END]
we,won't,waste,time,debating,theology,scarlett,[END]
the,fact,is,and,you,know,it,as,well,as,i,do,that,for,no,defensible,reason,roman,catholics,are,looked,down,on,in,southern,society,[END]
in,charleston,today,you,can,attend,saint,phillip's,or,saint,michael's,or,the,huguenot,church,or,first,scots,presbyterian,[END]
even,the,other,episcopal,and,presbyterian,churches,are,slightly,suspect,and,any,other,protestant,denomination,is,considered,rank,individualistic,display,[END]
roman,catholicism,is,beyond,the,pale,[END]
it's,not,reasonable,and,god,knows,it's,not,christian,but,it,is,a,fact,[END]
scarlett,was,silent,[END]
she,knew,he,was,right,[END]
rhett,used,her,momentary,defeat,to,repeat,his,original,question,[END]
what,do,you,want,scarlett,[END]
you,can,tell,me,[END]
i've,never,been,shocked,at,the,darker,corners,of,your,nature,[END]
he,really,means,it,she,thought,with,despair,[END]
all,the,tea,parties,i've,sat,through,and,the,dreary,clothes,i,had,to,wear,and,tramping,through,the,cold,dark,every,morning,to,the,market,it,was,all,for,nothing,[END]
she,had,come,to,charleston,to,get,rhett,back,and,she,had,not,won,[END]
i,want,you,scarlett,said,with,stark,honesty,[END]
this,time,it,was,rhett,who,was,silent,[END]
she,could,see,only,his,outline,and,the,pale,smoke,from,his,cigar,[END]
he,was,so,near,if,she,moved,her,foot,a,few,inches,it,would,touch,his,[END]
she,wanted,him,so,much,that,she,felt,physical,pain,[END]
she,wanted,to,double,over,to,ease,it,hold,it,inside,her,so,it,couldn't,grow,any,worse,[END]
but,she,sat,tall,waiting,for,him,to,speak,[END]
18,[END]
overhead,scarlett,could,hear,a,rumble,of,voices,punctuated,by,pansy's,high-pitched,giggle,[END]
it,made,the,silence,in,the,cabin,seem,even,worse,[END]
a,half,million,in,gold,said,rhett,[END]
what,did,you,say,[END]
i,must,have,heard,wrong,[END]
i,told,him,what,was,in,my,heart,and,he,hasn't,answered,[END]
i,said,i'll,give,you,half,a,million,dollars,in,gold,if,you,will,go,away,[END]
whatever,pleasure,you're,finding,in,charleston,can,hardly,be,worth,that,much,to,you,[END]
i'm,offering,you,a,handsome,bribe,scarlett,[END]
your,greedy,little,heart,can't,possibly,prefer,a,futile,attempt,to,save,our,marriage,to,a,fortune,bigger,than,you,ever,hoped,for,[END]
as,a,bonus,if,you,agree,i'll,resume,payments,for,expenses,of,that,monstrosity,on,peachtree,street,[END]
you,promised,last,night,that,you'd,send,the,money,to,uncle,henry,today,she,said,automatically,[END]
she,wished,he'd,be,quiet,for,a,minute,[END]
she,needed,to,think,[END]
was,it,really,a,futile,attempt,[END]
she,refused,to,believe,it,[END]
promises,are,made,to,be,broken,rhett,said,calmly,[END]
what,about,my,offer,scarlett,[END]
i,need,to,think,[END]
think,then,while,i,finish,my,cigar,[END]
then,i,want,your,answer,[END]
think,what,it,will,be,like,if,you,have,to,pour,your,own,money,into,that,horror,of,a,house,you,love,so,much,on,peachtree,street,you,have,no,conception,of,the,cost,[END]
and,then,think,about,having,a,thousand,times,the,money,you've,been,hoarding,all,these,years,a,king's,ransom,scarlett,all,at,one,time,and,all,yours,[END]
more,than,even,you,could,ever,spend,[END]
plus,the,house,expenses,paid,by,me,[END]
i'll,even,give,you,title,to,the,property,[END]
the,end,of,his,cigar,glowed,bright,[END]
scarlett,began,to,think,with,desperate,concentration,[END]
she,had,to,find,a,way,to,stay,[END]
she,couldn't,go,away,not,for,all,the,money,in,the,world,[END]
rhett,rose,to,his,feet,and,walked,to,the,porthole,[END]
he,threw,the,cigar,out,and,looked,through,the,opening,at,the,riverbank,for,a,moment,until,he,saw,a,landmark,[END]
the,sunlight,was,bright,on,his,face,[END]
how,much,he's,changed,since,he,left,atlanta,[END]
thought,scarlett,[END]
then,he,had,been,drinking,as,if,he,was,trying,to,blot,out,the,world,[END]
but,now,he,was,rhett,again,with,his,sun-darkened,skin,drawn,tight,over,the,fine,sharp,planes,of,his,face,and,his,clear,eyes,as,dark,as,desire,[END]
under,his,elegant,tailored,coat,and,linen,his,muscles,were,hard,visibly,swelling,when,he,moved,[END]
he,was,everything,a,man,should,be,[END]
she,wanted,him,back,and,she,was,going,to,get,him,no,matter,what,[END]
scarlett,took,a,deep,breath,[END]
she,was,ready,when,he,turned,toward,her,and,raised,one,eyebrow,in,interrogation,[END]
what's,it,to,be,scarlett,[END]
you,want,to,make,a,deal,you,said,rhett,[END]
scarlett,was,businesslike,[END]
but,you're,not,bargaining,you're,flinging,threats,at,my,head,like,rocks,[END]
besides,i,know,you're,just,bluffing,about,cutting,off,the,money,you,send,to,atlanta,[END]
you're,almighty,concerned,about,being,welcome,in,charleston,and,folks,don't,have,a,very,high,opinion,of,a,man,who,doesn't,take,care,of,his,wife,[END]
your,mother,wouldn't,be,able,to,hold,her,head,up,if,word,got,around,[END]
the,second,thing,the,pile,of,money,you're,right,[END]
i'd,be,glad,to,have,it,[END]
but,not,if,it,means,going,back,to,atlanta,right,now,[END]
i,might,as,well,show,my,cards,'cause,you,already,know,about,it,[END]
i,did,some,mighty,foolish,things,and,there's,no,taking,them,back,[END]
right,this,minute,i,haven't,got,a,friend,in,the,whole,state,of,georgia,[END]
i'm,making,friends,in,charleston,though,[END]
you,might,not,want,to,believe,it,but,it's,true,[END]
and,i'm,learning,a,lot,too,[END]
as,soon,as,people,in,atlanta,have,enough,time,to,forget,a,few,things,i,figure,i,can,make,up,for,my,mistakes,[END]
so,i've,got,a,deal,to,offer,you,[END]
you,stop,acting,so,hateful,to,me,you,act,nice,and,help,me,have,a,good,time,[END]
we,go,through,the,season,like,a,devoted,happy,husband,and,wife,[END]
then,come,spring,i'll,go,home,and,start,over,[END]
she,held,her,breath,[END]
he,had,to,say,yes,he,just,had,to,[END]
the,season,lasted,for,almost,eight,weeks,and,they'd,be,together,every,day,[END]
there,wasn't,a,man,on,two,feet,that,she,couldn't,have,eating,out,of,her,hand,if,he,was,around,her,that,much,[END]
rhett,was,different,from,other,men,but,not,that,different,[END]
there'd,never,been,a,man,she,couldn't,get,[END]
with,the,money,you,mean,[END]
well,of,course,with,the,money,[END]
do,you,take,me,for,a,fool,[END]
that's,not,exactly,my,idea,of,a,deal,scarlett,[END]
there's,nothing,in,it,for,me,[END]
you,take,the,money,i'm,willing,to,pay,you,to,leave,but,you,don't,leave,[END]
how,do,i,benefit,[END]
i,don't,stay,forever,and,i,don't,tell,your,mother,what,a,skunk,you,are,[END]
she,was,almost,certain,that,she,saw,him,smile,[END]
do,you,know,the,name,of,the,river,we're,on,scarlett,[END]
what,a,silly,question,[END]
and,he,hadn't,yet,agreed,to,the,season,[END]
what,was,going,on,[END]
it's,the,ashley,river,[END]
rhett,pronounced,the,name,with,exaggerated,distinctness,[END]
it,calls,to,mind,that,estimable,gentleman,mr,wilkes,whose,affections,you,once,coveted,[END]
i,was,a,witness,to,your,capacity,for,dogged,devotion,scarlett,and,your,single-minded,determination,is,a,terrifying,thing,to,behold,[END]
you,have,recently,been,so,amiable,as,to,mention,that,you,have,decided,to,put,me,in,the,elevated,place,once,occupied,by,ashley,[END]
the,prospect,fills,me,with,alarm,[END]
scarlett,interrupted,she,had,to,[END]
he,was,going,to,say,no,she,could,tell,[END]
oh,fiddle-dee-dee,rhett,[END]
i,know,there's,no,point,in,going,after,you,[END]
you're,not,nice,enough,to,put,up,with,it,[END]
besides,you,know,me,too,well,[END]
rhett,laughed,without,humor,[END]
if,you,recognize,just,how,right,you,are,we,might,be,able,to,do,business,he,said,[END]
scarlett,was,careful,not,to,smile,[END]
i'm,willing,to,dicker,she,said,[END]
what,did,you,have,in,mind,[END]
this,time,rhett's,abrupt,laugh,was,genuine,[END]
i,do,believe,that,the,real,miss,o'hara,has,joined,us,he,said,[END]
these,are,my,terms,you,will,confide,to,my,mother,that,i,snore,and,therefore,we,always,sleep,in,separate,rooms,after,the,saint,cecilia,ball,which,concludes,the,season,you,will,express,an,urgent,desire,to,rush,back,to,atlanta,and,once,there,you,will,immediately,appoint,a,lawyer,henry,hamilton,or,any,other,to,meet,with,my,lawyers,to,negotiate,a,settlement,and,a,binding,separation,agreement,[END]
furthermore,you,will,never,again,set,foot,in,charleston,[END]
nor,will,you,write,or,otherwise,send,messages,to,me,or,to,my,mother,[END]
scarlett's,mind,was,racing,[END]
she,had,almost,won,[END]
except,for,the,separate,rooms,[END]
maybe,she,should,ask,for,more,time,[END]
no,not,ask,[END]
she,was,supposed,to,be,bargaining,[END]
i,might,agree,to,your,terms,rhett,but,not,your,timing,[END]
if,i,pack,up,the,day,after,all,the,parties,are,done,everybody,will,notice,[END]
you'll,be,going,back,to,the,plantation,after,the,ball,[END]
it,would,make,sense,if,i,started,thinking,about,atlanta,then,[END]
why,don't,we,say,i'll,go,the,middle,of,april,[END]
i'm,willing,for,you,to,tarry,a,while,in,town,after,i,go,to,the,country,[END]
but,april,first,is,more,appropriate,[END]
better,than,she'd,hoped,for,[END]
the,season,plus,more,than,a,month,[END]
and,she,hadn't,said,anything,herself,about,staying,in,the,city,after,he,went,to,the,plantation,[END]
she,could,follow,him,out,there,[END]
i,don't,want,to,know,which,one,of,us,is,the,april,fool,you're,talking,about,rhett,butler,but,if,you,swear,you'll,be,nice,for,the,whole,time,before,i,leave,you've,got,a,bargain,[END]
if,you,turn,mean,then,it's,you,that,broke,it,not,me,and,i,won't,leave,[END]
mrs,butler,your,husband's,devotion,will,make,you,the,envy,of,every,woman,in,charleston,[END]
he,was,mocking,but,scarlett,didn't,care,[END]
she'd,won,[END]
rhett,opened,the,hatch,admitting,sharp,salt,air,and,sunlight,and,a,surprisingly,strong,breeze,[END]
do,you,get,seasick,scarlett,[END]
i,don't,know,[END]
i've,never,been,in,a,boat,till,yesterday,[END]
you'll,find,out,soon,enough,[END]
the,harbor's,just,ahead,and,there's,a,sizable,chop,[END]
get,a,bucket,out,of,the,locker,behind,you,just,in,case,[END]
he,hurried,onto,the,deck,[END]
let's,get,the,jib,up,now,and,put,her,on,a,tack,[END]
we're,losing,way,he,shouted,into,the,wind,[END]
a,minute,later,the,bench,had,tilted,at,an,alarming,angle,and,scarlett,discovered,that,she,was,sliding,helplessly,from,it,[END]
the,slow,upriver,trip,in,the,wide,flat,barge,the,day,before,hadn't,prepared,her,for,the,action,of,a,sailing,vessel,[END]
coming,downriver,in,the,current,with,a,gentle,wind,half,filling,the,mainsail,had,been,faster,but,just,as,placid,as,the,barge,[END]
she,scrambled,to,the,short,ladder,and,pulled,herself,up,so,that,her,head,was,above,deck,level,[END]
the,wind,took,her,breath,away,and,lifted,the,feathered,hat,from,her,head,[END]
she,looked,up,and,saw,it,fluttering,in,the,air,while,a,sea,gull,squawked,frantically,and,flapped,its,wings,to,soar,away,from,the,bird-like,object,[END]
scarlett,laughed,with,delight,[END]
the,boat,heeled,higher,and,water,washed,over,its,low,side,foaming,[END]
it,was,thrilling,[END]
through,the,wind,scarlett,heard,pansy,scream,in,terror,[END]
what,a,goose,that,girl,was,[END]
scarlett,steadied,herself,and,started,up,the,ladder,[END]
the,roar,of,rhett's,voice,stopped,her,[END]
he,spun,the,wheel,and,the,sloop's,deck,returned,to,a,bobbing,level,its,sails,flapping,[END]
at,his,gesture,one,of,the,crew,took,the,wheel,[END]
the,other,one,was,holding,pansy,steady,while,she,vomited,over,the,stern,[END]
in,two,steps,rhett,was,at,the,top,of,the,ladder,scowling,at,scarlett,[END]
you,little,idiot,you,could,have,gotten,your,head,knocked,off,by,the,boom,[END]
get,down,below,where,you,belong,[END]
oh,rhett,no,[END]
let,me,come,up,where,i,can,see,what's,happening,[END]
it's,such,fun,[END]
i,want,to,feel,the,wind,and,taste,the,spray,[END]
you,don't,feel,sick,[END]
or,frightened,[END]
the,scornful,look,she,gave,him,was,her,answer,[END]
oh,miss,eleanor,it,was,the,most,wonderful,time,i've,ever,had,in,my,life,[END]
i,don't,know,why,every,man,in,the,world,doesn't,become,a,sailor,[END]
i'm,glad,you,enjoyed,yourself,dear,but,it,was,very,wicked,of,rhett,to,expose,you,to,all,that,sun,and,wind,[END]
you're,red,as,an,indian,[END]
mrs,butler,ordered,scarlett,to,her,room,with,glycerine,and,rosewater,compresses,on,her,face,[END]
then,she,scolded,her,tall,laughing,son,until,he,hung,his,head,in,pretended,shame,[END]
if,i,put,up,the,christmas,greens,i,brought,you,will,you,let,me,have,dessert,after,dinner,or,do,i,have,to,stand,in,the,corner,[END]
he,asked,in,mock,humility,[END]
eleanor,butler,spread,her,hands,in,surrender,[END]
i,don't,know,what,i'm,going,to,do,with,you,rhett,she,said,but,her,effort,not,to,smile,was,a,total,failure,[END]
she,loved,her,son,beyond,all,reason,[END]
that,afternoon,while,scarlett,was,submitting,to,a,treatment,of,lotions,for,her,sunburn,rhett,carried,one,of,the,holly,wreaths,he,had,brought,from,the,plantation,to,alicia,savage,as,a,gift,from,his,mother,[END]
how,kind,of,eleanor,and,of,you,rhett,[END]
thank,you,[END]
would,you,like,to,have,a,pre-seasonal,toddy,[END]
rhett,accepted,the,drink,with,pleasure,and,they,talked,idly,about,the,unusual,weather,the,winter,thirty,years,earlier,when,it,had,actually,snowed,the,year,it,rained,for,thirty-eight,days,in,a,row,[END]
they,had,known,each,other,as,children,[END]
their,families,had,houses,that,shared,a,garden,wall,and,a,mulberry,tree,with,sweet,fingerstaining,purple,fruit,on,branches,that,reached,low,on,both,sides,of,the,wall,[END]
scarlett's,scared,half,out,of,her,wits,about,the,yankee,bedroom,prowler,said,rhett,after,he,and,alicia,finished,reminiscing,[END]
i,hope,you,don't,mind,talking,about,it,with,an,old,friend,who,saw,up,your,skirts,when,you,were,five,[END]
mrs,savage,laughed,heartily,[END]
i'll,talk,freely,if,you'll,manage,to,forget,my,youthful,antipathy,to,undergarments,[END]
i,was,the,despair,of,the,whole,family,for,at,least,a,year,[END]
it's,funny,now,[END]
but,this,business,with,the,yankee,isn't,funny,at,all,[END]
somebody's,going,to,get,trigger-happy,and,shoot,a,soldier,and,then,there'll,be,the,devil,to,pay,[END]
tell,me,what,he,looked,like,alicia,[END]
i,have,a,theory,about,him,[END]
i,only,saw,him,for,an,instant,rhett,[END]
that,should,be,enough,[END]
tall,or,short,[END]
tall,yes,really,very,tall,[END]
his,head,was,only,a,foot,or,so,below,the,top,of,the,curtains,and,those,windows,are,seven,feet,four,inches,[END]
rhett,grinned,[END]
i,knew,i,could,count,on,you,[END]
you're,the,only,person,i've,ever,known,who,could,identify,the,biggest,scoop,of,ice,cream,at,a,birthday,party,from,the,other,side,of,the,room,[END]
eagle,eye',we,called,you,behind,your,back,[END]
and,to,my,face,i,seem,to,remember,along,with,other,unpleasant,personal,remarks,[END]
you,were,a,horrid,little,boy,[END]
you,were,a,loathsome,little,girl,[END]
i,would,have,loved,you,even,if,you,had,worn,underclothes,[END]
i,would,have,loved,you,if,you,hadn't,[END]
i,looked,up,your,skirts,plenty,of,times,but,i,couldn't,see,a,thing,[END]
be,merciful,alicia,[END]
at,least,call,it,a,kilt,[END]
they,smiled,companionably,at,one,another,[END]
then,rhett,resumed,the,questioning,[END]
alicia,remembered,a,great,many,details,once,she,began,to,think,[END]
the,soldier,was,young,very,young,indeed,with,the,ungainly,movements,of,a,boy,who,had,not,gotten,accustomed,to,the,spurt,of,growth,[END]
he,was,very,thin,too,[END]
the,uniform,hung,loosely,on,his,frame,[END]
his,wrists,showed,clearly,below,the,sleeve,binding,the,uniform,might,not,have,been,his,at,all,[END]
his,hair,was,dark,not,raven,like,yours,rhett,and,by,the,way,the,touch,of,gray,is,extremely,becoming,no,his,share,must,have,been,brown,and,looked,darker,in,the,shadows,[END]
yes,well,cut,and,almost,certainly,undressed,[END]
she,would,have,smelled,macassar,oil,[END]
bit,by,bit,alicia,pieced,together,her,memories,[END]
then,her,words,faltered,[END]
you,know,who,it,is,don't,you,alicia,[END]
i,must,be,wrong,[END]
you,must,be,right,[END]
you,have,a,son,the,right,age,about,fourteen,or,fifteen,and,you're,sure,to,know,his,friends,[END]
as,soon,as,i,heard,about,this,i,thought,it,had,to,be,a,charleston,boy,[END]
do,you,really,believe,a,yankee,soldier,would,break,into,a,woman's,bedroom,just,to,look,at,the,shape,of,her,under,a,coverlet,[END]
this,isn't,a,reign,of,terror,alicia,it's,a,miserable,boy,who's,confused,about,what,his,body,is,doing,to,him,[END]
he,wants,to,know,what,a,woman's,body,is,like,without,corsets,and,bustles,wants,to,know,so,much,that,he's,driven,to,stealing,looks,at,sleeping,women,[END]
most,likely,he's,ashamed,of,his,thoughts,when,he,sees,one,fully,dressed,and,awake,[END]
poor,little,devil,[END]
i,suppose,his,father,was,killed,in,the,war,and,there's,no,man,for,him,to,talk,to,[END]
he,has,an,older,brother,[END]
oh,[END]
then,maybe,i'm,wrong,[END]
or,you're,thinking,of,the,wrong,boy,[END]
i'm,afraid,not,[END]
tommy,cooper,is,the,boy's,name,[END]
he's,the,tallest,of,the,lot,of,them,and,the,cleanest,[END]
plus,he,all,but,choked,to,death,when,i,said,hello,to,him,on,the,street,two,days,after,the,incident,in,my,bedroom,[END]
his,father,died,at,bull,run,[END]
tommy,never,knew,him,[END]
his,brother's,ten,or,eleven,years,older,[END]
do,you,mean,edward,cooper,the,lawyer,[END]
alicia,nodded,[END]
it's,no,wonder,then,[END]
cooper,is,on,my,mother's,confederate,home,committee,i,met,him,at,the,house,[END]
he's,all,but,a,eunuch,[END]
tommy'll,get,no,help,from,him,[END]
he's,not,a,eunuch,at,all,he's,just,too,much,in,love,with,anne,hampton,to,see,his,brother's,needs,[END]
as,you,like,alicia,[END]
but,i'm,going,to,have,a,little,conference,with,tommy,[END]
rhett,you,can't,[END]
you'll,scare,the,poor,boy,to,death,[END]
the,poor,boy',is,scaring,the,female,population,of,charleston,to,death,[END]
thank,god,nothing,has,really,happened,yet,[END]
next,time,he,might,lose,control,[END]
or,he,might,get,shot,[END]
where,does,he,live,alicia,[END]
church,street,just,around,the,corner,from,broad,[END]
it's,the,one,of,the,brick,houses,on,the,south,side,of,saint,michael's,alley,[END]
but,rhett,what,are,you,going,to,say,[END]
you,can't,just,walk,in,and,haul,tommy,out,by,the,scruff,of,the,neck,[END]
trust,me,alicia,[END]
alicia,put,her,hands,on,each,side,of,rhett's,face,and,kissed,him,softly,on,the,lips,[END]
it's,good,to,have,you,back,home,again,neighbor,[END]
good,luck,with,tommy,[END]
rhett,was,sitting,on,the,coopers',piazza,drinking,tea,with,tommy's,mother,when,the,boy,came,home,[END]
mrs,cooper,introduced,her,son,to,rhett,then,sent,him,inside,to,leave,his,schoolbooks,and,wash,his,hands,and,face,[END]
mr,butler,is,going,to,take,you,to,his,tailor,tommy,[END]
he,has,a,nephew,in,aiken,who's,growing,as,fast,as,you,are,and,he,needs,you,to,try,on,things,so,he,can,pick,out,a,christmas,present,that,will,fit,[END]
out,of,sight,of,the,adults,tommy,grimaced,horribly,[END]
then,he,remembered,bits,and,pieces,he'd,heard,about,rhett's,flamboyant,youth,and,he,decided,he'd,be,happy,to,go,along,and,help,out,mr,butler,[END]
maybe,he'd,even,find,the,nerve,to,ask,mr,butler,a,few,questions,about,things,that,were,bothering,him,[END]
tommy,didn't,have,to,ask,[END]
as,soon,as,they,were,well,away,from,the,house,rhett,put,an,arm,around,the,boy's,shoulders,[END]
tom,he,said,i,have,it,in,mind,to,teach,you,a,few,valuable,lessons,[END]
the,first,is,how,to,lie,convincingly,to,a,mother,[END]
while,we're,riding,on,the,streetcar,you,and,i,will,talk,in,some,detail,about,my,tailor,and,his,shop,and,his,habits,[END]
you'll,practice,with,my,assistance,until,you've,got,your,story,straight,[END]
because,i,don't,have,a,nephew,in,aiken,and,we're,not,on,our,way,to,the,tailor,[END]
we're,going,to,ride,to,the,end,of,the,rutledge,avenue,line,then,go,for,a,healthy,walk,to,the,house,where,i,want,you,to,meet,some,friends,of,mine,[END]
tommy,cooper,agreed,without,argument,[END]
he,was,accustomed,to,having,his,elders,tell,him,what,to,do,and,he,liked,the,way,mr,butler,called,him,tom,[END]
before,the,afternoon,was,over,and,tom,was,delivered,back,to,his,mother,the,boy,was,looking,at,rhett,with,such,hero-worship,in,his,young,eyes,that,rhett,knew,he'd,be,saddled,with,tom,cooper,for,years,to,come,[END]
he,was,also,confident,that,tom,would,never,forget,the,friends,they'd,gone,to,see,[END]
among,charleston's,many,historic,firsts,was,the,first,recorded,whorehouse,for,gentlemen,only,[END]
it,had,moved,its,location,many,times,in,the,nearly,two,centuries,of,its,existence,but,it,had,never,missed,a,day's,business,despite,wars,epidemics,and,hurricanes,[END]
one,of,the,specialities,of,the,house,was,the,gentle,discreet,introduction,of,young,boys,to,the,pleasures,of,manhood,[END]
it,was,one,of,charleston's,cherished,traditions,[END]
rhett,speculated,sometimes,about,how,different,his,own,life,might,have,been,if,his,father,had,been,as,diligent,about,that,tradition,as,he,had,been,about,all,the,other,things,expected,of,a,charleston,gentleman,[END]
but,the,past,was,done,[END]
his,lips,curved,in,a,rueful,smile,[END]
he,had,been,able,at,least,to,stand,in,for,tommy's,dead,father,who,would,have,done,the,same,for,the,boy,[END]
traditions,did,have,their,uses,[END]
for,one,thing,there'd,be,no,more,yankee,midnight,prowler,[END]
rhett,went,home,to,have,a,self-congratulatory,drink,before,it,was,time,to,pick,up,his,sister,at,the,train,station,[END]
19,[END]
suppose,the,train's,early,rhett,[END]
eleanor,butler,looked,at,the,clock,for,the,tenth,time,in,two,minutes,[END]
i,hate,to,think,of,rosemary,being,at,the,station,with,nobody,there,when,it's,getting,dark,[END]
her,maid's,only,half-trained,you,know,[END]
and,half-witted,too,to,my,way,of,thinking,[END]
i,don't,know,why,rosemary,puts,up,with,her,[END]
that,train,has,never,in,its,history,been,less,than,forty,minutes,late,mama,and,even,if,it,were,on,time,that's,a,half,hour,from,now,[END]
i,asked,you,most,particularly,to,allow,plenty,of,time,to,get,there,[END]
i,should,have,gone,myself,like,i,planned,when,i,didn't,know,you'd,be,home,[END]
try,not,to,fret,mama,[END]
rhett,explained,again,what,he,had,already,told,his,mother,[END]
i,hired,a,hackney,to,pick,me,up,in,ten,minutes,[END]
then,it's,a,five-minute,ride,to,the,station,[END]
i'll,be,fifteen,minutes,early,the,train,will,be,an,hour,late,or,more,and,rosemary,will,arrive,home,on,my,arm,just,in,time,for,supper,[END]
may,i,ride,with,you,rhett,[END]
i'd,love,a,breath,of,air,[END]
scarlett,pictured,the,hour,enclosed,in,the,small,cab,of,the,hackney,[END]
she'd,ask,rhett,all,about,his,sister,he'd,like,that,[END]
he,was,crazy,about,rosemary,[END]
and,if,he,talked,enough,then,maybe,scarlett,would,know,what,to,expect,[END]
she,was,terrified,that,rosemary,wouldn't,like,her,that,she'd,be,another,ross,[END]
her,brother-in-law's,florid,letter,of,apology,had,done,nothing,to,make,her,stop,loathing,him,[END]
no,my,dear,you,may,not,ride,with,me,[END]
i,want,you,to,stay,just,as,you,are,on,that,couch,with,the,compresses,on,your,eyes,[END]
they're,still,swollen,from,sunburn,[END]
do,you,want,me,to,come,dear,[END]
mrs,butler,rolled,up,her,tatting,to,put,it,away,[END]
it,is,going,to,be,a,long,wait,i'm,afraid,[END]
i,don't,mind,waiting,at,all,mama,[END]
i've,got,some,plans,to,work,out,in,my,head,about,spring,planting,at,the,plantation,[END]
scarlett,settled,back,against,the,cushions,wishing,that,rhett's,sister,wasn't,coming,home,[END]
she,had,no,clear,idea,of,what,rosemary,would,be,like,and,she'd,rather,not,find,out,[END]
she,knew,from,bits,of,gossip,that,she'd,heard,that,rosemary's,birth,had,caused,a,lot,of,hidden,smiles,[END]
she,was,a,change,baby,born,when,eleanor,butler,was,over,forty,years,old,[END]
she,was,also,an,old,maid,one,of,the,domestic,casualties,of,the,war,too,young,to,marry,before,it,began,too,plain,and,too,poor,to,attract,the,attention,of,the,few,men,available,when,it,was,over,[END]
rhett's,return,to,charleston,and,his,fabulous,wealth,had,set,tongues,wagging,[END]
rosemary,would,have,a,substantial,dowry,now,[END]
but,she,seemed,to,be,always,away,visiting,a,cousin,or,a,friend,in,another,town,[END]
was,she,looking,for,a,husband,there,[END]
weren't,charleston,men,good,enough,for,her,[END]
everyone,had,been,waiting,for,the,announcement,of,an,engagement,for,more,than,a,year,but,there,was,not,even,a,hint,of,an,attachment,much,less,a,betrothal,[END]
rich,pickings,for,speculation,was,the,way,emma,anson,described,the,situation,[END]
scarlett,speculated,on,her,own,[END]
she'd,be,delighted,to,have,rosemary,marry,no,matter,what,it,cost,rhett,[END]
she,didn't,care,to,have,her,in,the,house,[END]
no,matter,if,rosemary,was,as,plain,as,a,mud,fence,she,was,still,younger,than,scarlett,and,rhett's,sister,to,boot,[END]
she'd,get,too,much,of,his,attention,[END]
she,tensed,when,she,heard,the,outside,door,open,a,few,minutes,before,suppertime,[END]
rosemary,had,arrived,[END]
rhett,entered,the,library,and,smiled,at,his,mother,[END]
your,wandering,girl,is,home,at,last,he,said,[END]
she's,sound,in,mind,and,limb,and,as,fierce,as,a,lion,from,hunger,[END]
as,soon,as,she,gets,her,hands,washed,she'll,probably,come,in,here,and,devour,your,flesh,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,door,with,apprehension,[END]
the,young,woman,who,came,through,it,a,moment,later,had,a,pleasant,smile,on,her,face,[END]
there,was,nothing,jungle-like,about,her,[END]
but,she,was,as,shocking,to,scarlett,as,if,she,had,worn,a,mane,and,roared,[END]
she,looks,just,like,rhett,[END]
no,it's,not,that,[END]
she's,got,the,same,black,eyes,and,hair,and,white,teeth,but,that's,not,what's,the,same,[END]
it's,more,the,way,she,is,she,just,kind,of,takes,over,like,he,does,[END]
i,don't,like,it,i,don't,like,it,at,all,[END]
her,green,eyes,narrowed,and,she,studied,rosemary,[END]
she's,not,really,as,plain,as,people,said,but,she,doesn't,do,anything,with,herself,[END]
look,at,how,she's,got,her,hair,all,skinned,back,in,that,big,knot,on,the,nape,[END]
and,she's,not,even,wearing,earbobs,though,her,ears,are,right,pretty,[END]
kind,of,sallow,[END]
i,guess,that's,what,rhett's,skin,would,be,like,if,he,wasn't,always,in,the,sun,[END]
but,a,bright-colored,frock,would,take,care,of,that,[END]
she,picked,the,worst,possible,thing,in,that,dull,browny-green,[END]
maybe,i,could,help,her,out,some,[END]
so,this,is,scarlett,[END]
rosemary,crossed,the,room,in,four,strides,[END]
oh,my,i'll,have,to,teach,her,to,walk,scarlett,thought,[END]
men,don't,like,women,who,gallop,like,that,[END]
scarlett,stood,before,rosemary,reached,her,smiling,a,sisterly,smile,and,tipped,her,face,upward,for,a,social,kiss,[END]
instead,of,touching,cheeks,in,the,approved,fashion,rosemary,stared,frankly,at,scarlett's,face,[END]
rhett,said,you,were,feline,she,said,[END]
i,see,what,he,means,with,those,green,eyes,[END]
i,do,hope,you'll,purr,at,me,and,not,spit,scarlett,[END]
i'd,like,for,us,to,be,friends,[END]
scarlett's,mouth,gaped,soundlessly,[END]
she,was,too,startled,to,speak,[END]
mama,do,say,supper's,ready,rosemary,said,[END]
she,had,already,turned,away,[END]
i,told,rhett,he,was,a,thoughtless,brute,not,to,bring,a,hamper,to,the,station,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,found,him,and,her,temper,flared,[END]
rhett,was,lounging,against,the,frame,of,the,door,his,mouth,twisted,in,sardonic,amusement,[END]
brute,[END]
she,thought,[END]
you,put,her,up,to,that,[END]
feline,am,i,[END]
i,wish,i,could,show,you,feline,[END]
i'd,like,to,scratch,that,laughter,right,out,of,your,eyes,[END]
she,looked,quickly,at,rosemary,[END]
was,she,laughing,too,[END]
no,she,was,embracing,eleanor,butler,[END]
supper,said,rhett,[END]
i,see,manigo,coming,to,announce,it,[END]
scarlett,pushed,her,food,around,on,her,plate,[END]
her,sunburn,was,painful,and,rosemary's,bumptiousness,was,giving,her,a,headache,[END]
for,rhett's,sister,was,passionately,and,loudly,opinionated,and,argumentative,[END]
the,cousins,she'd,been,visiting,in,richmond,were,hopeless,dolts,she,declared,and,she,had,hated,every,minute,of,the,time,there,[END]
she,was,absolutely,certain,that,not,one,of,them,had,ever,read,a,book,at,least,not,one,worth,reading,[END]
oh,dear,said,eleanor,butler,softly,[END]
she,looked,at,rhett,with,mute,entreaty,[END]
cousins,are,always,a,trial,rosemary,he,said,with,a,smile,[END]
let,me,tell,you,the,latest,on,cousin,townsend,ellinton,[END]
i,saw,him,in,philadelphia,recently,and,the,meeting,left,me,with,blurred,vision,for,a,week,[END]
i,kept,trying,to,look,him,in,the,eye,and,of,course,i,get,vertiginous,[END]
i'd,rather,be,dizzy,than,bored,to,death,[END]
his,sister,interrupted,[END]
can,you,picture,having,to,sit,around,after,supper,and,listen,to,cousin,miranda,read,aloud,from,the,waverley,novels,[END]
that,sentimental,claptrap,[END]
i,always,rather,enjoyed,scott,dear,and,so,did,you,i,thought,eleanor,said,soothingly,[END]
rosemary,was,not,soothed,[END]
mama,i,didn't,know,any,better,that,was,years,ago,[END]
scarlett,thought,longingly,of,the,quiet,after,supper,hours,she,had,been,sharing,with,miss,eleanor,[END]
obviously,there'd,be,no,more,of,those,with,rosemary,in,the,house,[END]
how,could,rhett,possibly,be,so,fond,of,her,[END]
now,she,seemed,bound,and,determined,to,pick,a,fight,with,him,[END]
if,i,were,a,man,you'd,let,me,go,rosemary,was,shouting,at,rhett,[END]
i've,been,reading,the,articles,about,rome,that,mr,henry,james,is,writing,and,i,feel,like,i'll,perish,of,ignorance,if,i,don't,get,to,see,it,for,myself,[END]
but,you're,not,a,man,my,dear,rhett,said,calmly,[END]
where,on,earth,did,you,get,copies,of,the,nation,[END]
you,could,be,strung,up,for,reading,a,liberal,rag,like,that,[END]
scarlett's,ears,perked,up,and,she,broke,into,the,conversation,[END]
why,don't,you,let,rosemary,go,rhett,[END]
rome's,not,so,far,[END]
and,i'm,sure,we,must,know,somebody,who,has,kin,there,[END]
it,can't,be,any,farther,than,athens,and,the,tarletons,have,about,a,million,cousins,in,athens,[END]
rosemary,gaped,at,her,[END]
who,are,these,tarletons,and,what,does,athens,have,to,do,with,rome,[END]
she,said,[END]
rhett,coughed,to,mask,his,laughter,[END]
then,he,cleared,his,throat,[END]
athens,and,rome,are,the,names,of,country,towns,in,georgia,rosemary,he,drawled,[END]
would,you,like,to,pay,them,a,visit,[END]
rosemary,put,her,hands,to,her,head,in,a,dramatic,gesture,of,despair,[END]
i,cannot,credit,what,i'm,hearing,[END]
who,would,want,to,go,to,georgia,for,pity's,sake,[END]
i,want,to,go,to,rome,the,real,rome,the,eternal,city,[END]
in,italy,[END]
scarlett,felt,the,color,rising,in,her,cheeks,[END]
i,should,have,known,she,meant,italy,[END]
but,before,she,could,burst,out,as,noisily,as,rosemary,the,door,to,the,dining,room,crashed,open,with,a,bang,that,silenced,all,of,them,with,shock,and,ross,stumbled,panting,for,breath,into,the,candlelit,room,[END]
help,me,he,gasped,the,guard,is,after,me,[END]
i,shot,the,yankee,who's,been,breaking,into,bedrooms,[END]
in,seconds,rhett,was,at,his,brother's,side,holding,his,arm,[END]
the,sloop's,at,the,dock,and,there's,no,moon,the,two,of,us,can,sail,her,he,said,with,calming,authority,[END]
as,he,left,the,room,he,turned,his,head,to,speak,quietly,over,his,shoulder,[END]
tell,them,i,left,as,soon,as,i,delivered,rosemary,so,that,i,could,catch,the,tide,upriver,and,you,haven't,seen,ross,don't,know,anything,about,anything,[END]
i'll,send,word,[END]
eleanor,butler,rose,from,her,chair,without,haste,as,if,this,were,a,normal,evening,and,she,had,finished,eating,supper,[END]
she,walked,to,scarlett,put,an,arm,around,her,[END]
scarlett,was,shaking,[END]
the,yankees,were,coming,[END]
they'd,hang,ross,for,shooting,one,of,them,and,they'd,hang,rhett,for,trying,to,help,ross,escape,[END]
why,couldn't,he,let,ross,take,care,of,himself,[END]
he,had,no,right,to,leave,his,women,unprotected,and,alone,when,the,yankees,were,coming,[END]
eleanor,spoke,and,there,was,steel,in,her,voice,even,though,it,was,as,soft,and,slow,as,ever,[END]
i'm,going,to,take,rhett's,dishes,and,silver,into,the,kitchen,[END]
the,servants,must,be,told,what,to,say,and,there,must,be,no,indication,that,he,was,here,[END]
will,you,and,rosemary,please,rearrange,the,table,for,three,settings,[END]
what,are,we,going,to,do,miss,eleanor,[END]
the,yankees,are,coming,[END]
scarlett,knew,she,should,stay,calm,she,despised,herself,for,being,so,frightened,[END]
but,she,couldn't,control,her,fear,[END]
she,had,come,to,think,that,the,yankees,were,toothless,only,laughable,and,in,the,way,[END]
it,was,shattering,to,be,reminded,that,the,occupying,army,could,do,anything,it,wanted,and,call,it,law,[END]
we're,going,to,finish,our,supper,said,mrs,butler,[END]
her,eyes,began,to,laugh,[END]
then,i,think,i,shall,read,aloud,from,ivanhoe,[END]
don't,you,have,anything,better,to,do,with,your,time,than,bully,a,household,of,women,[END]
rosemary,glared,at,the,union,captain,her,fisted,hands,on,her,hips,[END]
sit,down,and,be,quiet,rosemary,said,mrs,butler,[END]
i,apologize,for,my,daughter's,rudeness,captain,[END]
the,officer,was,not,won,over,by,eleanor's,conciliatory,politeness,[END]
go,ahead,and,search,the,house,he,ordered,his,men,[END]
scarlett,lay,supine,on,the,couch,with,chamomile,compresses,on,her,sunburned,face,and,swollen,eyes,[END]
she,was,grateful,for,their,protection,she,didn't,have,to,look,at,the,yankees,[END]
what,a,cool,head,miss,eleanor,had,to,think,of,arranging,a,sickroom,scene,in,the,library,[END]
still,curiosity,was,nearly,killing,her,[END]
she,couldn't,tell,what,was,going,on,with,only,sound,to,guide,her,[END]
she,could,hear,footsteps,and,doors,closing,and,then,silence,[END]
was,the,captain,gone,[END]
were,miss,eleanor,and,rosemary,gone,too,[END]
she,couldn't,stand,it,[END]
she,moved,one,hand,slowly,up,to,her,eyes,and,lifted,a,corner,of,the,damp,cloth,that,covered,them,[END]
rosemary,was,sitting,in,the,chair,near,the,desk,calmly,reading,a,book,[END]
ssst,scarlett,whispered,[END]
rosemary,quickly,closed,the,book,and,covered,the,title,with,her,hand,[END]
what,is,it,[END]
she,said,also,whispering,[END]
did,you,hear,something,[END]
no,i,don't,hear,a,thing,[END]
what,are,they,doing,[END]
where's,miss,eleanor,[END]
did,they,arrest,her,[END]
for,heaven's,sake,scarlett,what,are,you,whispering,for,[END]
rosemary's,normal,voice,sounded,terribly,loud,[END]
the,soldiers,are,searching,the,house,for,weapons,they're,confiscating,all,the,guns,in,charleston,[END]
mama's,following,them,around,to,make,sure,they,don't,confiscate,anything,else,[END]
was,that,all,[END]
scarlett,relaxed,[END]
there,were,no,guns,in,the,house,she,knew,because,she'd,looked,for,one,herself,[END]
she,closed,her,eyes,and,drifted,near,sleep,[END]
it,had,been,a,long,day,[END]
she,remembered,the,excitement,of,the,water,foaming,alongside,the,swift-moving,sloop,and,for,a,moment,she,envied,rhett,sailing,under,the,stars,[END]
if,only,she,could,have,been,with,him,instead,of,ross,[END]
she,wasn't,worried,that,the,yankees,would,catch,him,she,never,worried,about,rhett,[END]
he,was,invincible,[END]
when,eleanor,butler,returned,to,the,library,after,seeing,the,union,soldiers,out,she,tucked,her,cashmere,shawl,around,scarlett,who,had,fallen,into,a,deep,sleep,[END]
no,need,to,disturb,her,she,said,quietly,she'll,be,comfortable,here,[END]
let's,go,to,bed,rosemary,[END]
you've,had,a,long,trip,and,i'm,tired,and,tomorrow's,bound,to,be,very,active,[END]
she,smiled,to,herself,when,she,saw,the,bookmark,placed,well,along,in,the,pages,of,ivanhoe,[END]
rosemary,was,a,fast,reader,[END]
and,not,nearly,as,modern,as,she,liked,to,think,she,was,[END]
the,market,was,abuzz,with,indignation,and,ill-conceived,plans,the,next,morning,[END]
scarlett,listened,to,the,agitated,conversations,around,her,with,scorn,[END]
what,did,they,expect,the,charlestonians,[END]
that,the,yankees,would,let,people,go,around,shooting,them,and,do,nothing,[END]
all,they,were,going,to,do,was,make,things,worse,if,they,tried,to,argue,or,protest,[END]
what,difference,did,it,make,after,all,this,time,that,general,lee,had,talked,grant,into,allowing,confederate,officers,to,keep,their,sidearms,after,the,surrender,at,appomattox,[END]
it,was,still,the,end,of,the,south,and,what,good,did,a,revolver,do,you,if,you,were,too,poor,to,buy,bullets,for,it,[END]
as,for,duelling,pistols,[END]
who,on,earth,would,care,about,saving,them,[END]
they,weren't,good,for,anything,except,men,showing,off,how,brave,they,were,and,getting,their,fool,heads,blown,off,[END]
she,kept,her,mouth,shut,and,concentrated,on,the,shopping,[END]
otherwise,it,would,never,get,done,[END]
even,miss,eleanor,was,running,around,like,a,chicken,with,its,head,cut,off,talking,to,everybody,in,a,barely,audible,urgent,tone,[END]
they,say,the,men,all,want,to,finish,what,ross,started,she,told,scarlett,when,they,were,walking,home,[END]
it's,more,than,they,can,bear,to,have,their,homes,ransacked,by,the,troops,[END]
we,women,are,going,to,have,to,manage,things,the,men,are,too,hot,under,the,collar,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,chill,of,terror,[END]
she'd,thought,it,was,all,talk,[END]
surely,no,one,was,going,to,make,things,worse,[END]
there's,nothing,to,manage,[END]
she,exclaimed,[END]
the,only,thing,to,do,is,lie,low,till,it,blows,over,[END]
rhett,must,have,gotten,ross,away,safely,or,we'd,have,heard,[END]
mrs,butler,looked,astonished,[END]
we,cannot,allow,the,union,army,to,get,away,with,this,scarlett,surely,you,see,that,[END]
they've,already,searched,our,houses,and,they've,announced,that,curfew,will,be,enforced,and,they're,arresting,all,the,black-market,dealers,in,rationed,goods,[END]
if,we,let,them,keep,on,the,way,they're,going,soon,we'll,be,back,where,we,were,in,'sixty-four,when,they,had,their,boots,on,our,necks,governing,every,breath,of,our,lives,[END]
it,simply,won't,do,[END]
scarlett,wondered,if,the,whole,world,was,going,mad,[END]
what,did,a,bunch,of,tea-drinking,lace-making,charleston,ladies,think,they,could,do,against,an,army,[END]
she,found,out,two,nights,later,[END]
lucinda,wragg's,wedding,had,been,scheduled,for,january,twenty-third,[END]
the,invitations,were,addressed,and,waiting,to,be,delivered,on,january,second,but,they,were,never,used,[END]
terrible,efficiency,was,rosemary,butler's,tribute,to,the,efforts,of,lucinda's,mother,her,own,mother,and,all,the,other,ladies,of,charleston,[END]
lucinda's,wedding,took,place,on,december,nineteenth,at,saint,michael's,church,at,nine,o'clock,in,the,evening,[END]
the,majestic,chords,of,the,wedding,march,sounded,through,the,open,doors,and,windows,of,the,packed,and,beautifully,decorated,church,precisely,at,the,hour,the,curfew,began,[END]
they,could,be,heard,clearly,in,the,guardhouse,across,the,street,from,saint,michael's,[END]
some,officer,later,told,his,wife,in,the,hearing,of,their,cook,that,he,had,never,seen,the,men,in,his,command,so,nervous,not,even,before,they,marched,into,the,wilderness,[END]
the,whole,city,heard,the,story,the,following,day,[END]
everyone,had,a,good,laugh,but,no,one,was,surprised,[END]
at,nine-thirty,the,entire,population,of,old,charleston,exited,from,saint,michael's,and,went,on,foot,along,meeting,street,to,the,reception,at,the,south,carolina,hall,[END]
men,and,women,and,children,aged,five,to,ninety-seven,years,old,strolled,laughing,in,the,warm,night,air,breaking,the,law,with,flagrant,defiance,[END]
there,was,no,way,the,union,command,could,claim,to,be,unaware,of,the,occurrence,it,took,place,under,their,very,noses,[END]
nor,was,there,any,way,they,could,arrest,the,miscreants,[END]
the,guardhouse,had,twenty-six,jail,cells,[END]
even,if,the,offices,and,corridors,had,been,used,there,was,not,enough,room,to,hold,all,the,people,[END]
saint,michael's,pews,had,had,to,be,moved,to,its,peaceful,graveyard,to,create,enough,space,for,everyone,to,crowd,inside,standing,shoulder,to,shoulder,[END]
during,the,reception,people,had,to,take,turns,to,get,out,onto,the,columned,porch,outside,the,crowded,ballroom,for,a,breath,of,air,and,a,view,of,the,helpless,patrol,marching,in,futile,discipline,along,the,empty,street,[END]
rhett,had,returned,to,the,city,that,afternoon,with,the,news,that,ross,was,safely,in,wilmington,[END]
scarlett,confessed,to,him,out,on,the,porch,that,she'd,been,afraid,to,go,to,the,wedding,even,with,him,as,escort,[END]
i,couldn't,believe,that,a,bunch,of,tea-party,ladies,could,lick,the,yankee,army,[END]
i've,got,to,say,it,rhett,[END]
these,charleston,folks,have,got,all,the,gumption,in,the,world,[END]
he,smiled,[END]
i,love,the,arrogant,fools,every,one,of,them,[END]
even,poor,old,ross,[END]
i,do,hope,he,never,learns,that,he,missed,the,yankee,by,a,mile,he'd,be,very,embarrassed,[END]
he,didn't,even,shoot,him,[END]
i,suppose,he,was,drunk,[END]
her,voice,was,thick,with,contempt,[END]
then,it,skidded,high,with,fear,[END]
then,the,prowler's,still,around,[END]
rhett,patted,her,shoulder,[END]
no,[END]
rest,assured,my,dear,you'll,hear,no,more,of,the,prowler,[END]
my,brother,and,little,lucinda's,hasty,wedding,have,put,the,fear,of,god,into,the,yankees,[END]
he,chuckled,with,rich,private,enjoyment,[END]
what's,so,funny,[END]
demanded,scarlett,suspiciously,[END]
she,hated,it,when,people,laughed,and,she,didn't,know,why,[END]
nothing,you,would,understand,said,rhett,[END]
i,was,congratulating,myself,on,single-handedly,solving,a,problem,and,then,my,bungling,brother,went,me,one,better,he,inadvertently,gave,the,whole,city,something,to,enjoy,and,feel,proud,about,[END]
look,at,them,scarlett,[END]
the,porch,was,more,crowded,than,ever,[END]
lucinda,wragg,now,lucinda,grimball,was,throwing,flowers,from,her,bouquet,down,to,the,soldiers,[END]
humph,[END]
i'd,sooner,throw,brickbats,myself,[END]
i'm,sure,you,would,[END]
you've,always,liked,the,obvious,[END]
lucinda's,way,requires,imagination,[END]
his,amused,lazy,drawl,had,become,viciously,cutting,[END]
scarlett,tossed,her,head,[END]
i'm,going,back,inside,[END]
i'd,a,far,sight,rather,be,suffocated,than,insulted,[END]
unseen,in,the,shadow,of,a,nearby,column,rosemary,cringed,at,the,cruelty,she,heard,in,rhett's,voice,and,the,angry,hurt,in,scarlett's,[END]
later,that,night,after,bedtime,she,tapped,on,the,door,of,the,library,where,rhett,was,reading,then,entered,and,closed,the,door,behind,her,[END]
her,face,was,blotched,red,from,weeping,[END]
i,thought,i,knew,you,rhett,she,blurted,but,i,don't,at,all,[END]
i,heard,you,talking,to,scarlett,tonight,on,the,porch,of,the,hall,[END]
how,could,you,be,so,mean,to,your,own,wife,[END]
who,are,you,going,to,turn,on,next,[END]
20,[END]
rhett,rose,quickly,from,his,chair,and,started,towards,his,sister,with,his,arms,outstretched,[END]
but,rosemary,held,her,hands,up,in,front,of,her,palms,outward,and,backed,away,[END]
his,face,darkened,with,pain,and,he,stood,very,still,his,arms,at,his,sides,[END]
he,wanted,above,all,things,to,shield,rosemary,from,hurt,and,now,he,was,the,source,of,her,anguish,[END]
his,mind,was,filled,with,rosemary's,short,sad,story,and,his,part,in,it,[END]
rhett,had,never,regretted,or,explained,anything,he,had,done,in,his,tempestuous,younger,years,[END]
there,was,nothing,he,was,ashamed,of,[END]
except,the,effects,on,his,young,sister,[END]
because,of,his,rebellious,defiance,of,family,and,society,his,father,had,disowned,him,[END]
rhett's,name,was,only,an,inked-over,line,in,the,butler,family,bible,when,rosemary's,birth,was,recorded,[END]
she,was,more,than,twenty,years,his,junior,[END]
he,did,not,even,see,her,until,she,was,thirteen,an,awkward,girl,with,long,legs,large,feet,and,budding,breasts,[END]
their,mother,had,disobeyed,her,husband,for,one,of,the,few,times,in,her,life,when,rhett,began,the,dangerous,life,of,blockade,runner,through,the,union,fleet,and,into,charleston,harbor,[END]
she,came,by,night,to,the,dock,where,his,ship,was,moored,bringing,rosemary,to,meet,him,[END]
the,deep,vein,of,loving,tenderness,in,rhett,was,inexpressively,moved,by,the,confusion,and,need,that,he,sensed,in,his,young,sister,and,he,welcomed,her,to,his,shirt,with,all,the,warmth,that,their,father,had,never,been,able,to,give,[END]
in,turn,rosemary,gave,him,the,trust,and,loyalty,that,their,father,had,never,inspired,[END]
the,bond,between,brother,and,sister,had,never,been,severed,despite,the,fact,that,they,saw,each,other,no,more,than,a,dozen,times,from,first,meeting,until,rhett,came,home,to,charleston,eleven,years,later,[END]
he,had,never,forgiven,himself,for,accepting,their,mother's,reassurance,that,rosemary,was,well,and,happy,and,sheltered,by,the,money,he,lavished,on,them,once,his,father,was,dead,and,could,no,longer,intercept,and,return,it,[END]
he,should,have,been,more,alert,more,attentive,he,accused,himself,later,[END]
then,perhaps,his,sister,would,not,have,grown,up,distrusting,men,the,way,she,did,[END]
perhaps,she,would,have,loved,and,married,and,had,children,[END]
as,it,was,when,he,returned,home,he,found,a,twenty-four-year-old,woman,with,the,same,awkwardness,of,the,thirteen-year-old,he,had,first,met,[END]
she,was,uncomfortable,with,all,men,except,him,she,used,the,distant,lives,in,novels,as,a,substitute,for,the,uncertainty,of,life,in,the,world,she,rejected,the,conventions,of,society,about,how,a,woman,should,look,and,think,and,behave,[END]
rosemary,was,a,bluestocking,distressingly,forthright,and,totally,lacking,in,feminine,wiles,and,vanity,[END]
rhett,loved,her,and,he,respected,her,prickly,independence,[END]
he,couldn't,make,up,for,the,years,he'd,missed,but,he,could,give,her,the,rarest,gift,of,all,his,inner,self,[END]
he,was,completely,honest,with,rosemary,talked,to,her,as,an,equal,and,on,occasion,even,confided,the,secrets,of,his,shirt,to,her,as,he,had,never,done,to,any,other,person,[END]
she,recognized,the,immensity,of,his,gift,and,she,adored,him,[END]
in,the,fourteen,months,that,rhett,had,been,home,the,over-tall,ill-at-ease,innocent,spinster,and,the,oversophisticated,disillusioned,adventurer,had,become,the,closest,of,friends,[END]
now,rosemary,felt,betrayed,[END]
she'd,seen,a,side,of,rhett,that,she,hadn't,known,existed,a,streak,of,cruelty,in,the,brother,she'd,known,as,unfailingly,kind,and,loving,[END]
she,was,confused,and,distrustful,[END]
you,haven't,answered,my,question,rhett,[END]
rosemary's,reddened,eyes,were,accusing,[END]
i'm,sorry,rosemary,he,said,cautiously,[END]
i,am,deeply,sorry,you,happened,to,hear,me,[END]
it,was,something,i,had,to,do,[END]
i,want,her,to,go,away,and,leave,all,of,us,alone,[END]
but,she's,your,wife,[END]
i,left,her,rosemary,[END]
she,wouldn't,divorce,me,as,i,offered,but,she,knew,the,marriage,was,over,[END]
then,why,is,she,here,[END]
rhett,shrugged,[END]
perhaps,we,should,sit,down,[END]
it's,a,long,tiring,story,[END]
slowly,methodically,rigidly,unemotional,rhett,told,his,sister,about,scarlett's,two,earlier,marriages,about,his,proposal,and,scarlett's,agreement,to,marry,him,for,his,money,[END]
he,also,told,her,about,scarlett's,near-obsessive,love,for,ashley,wilkes,throughout,all,the,years,he'd,known,her,[END]
but,if,you,knew,that,why,on,earth,did,you,marry,her,[END]
rosemary,asked,[END]
why,[END]
rhett's,mouth,twisted,in,a,smile,[END]
because,she,was,so,full,of,fire,and,so,recklessly,stubbornly,brave,[END]
because,she,was,such,a,child,beneath,all,her,pretenses,[END]
because,she,was,unlike,any,woman,i,had,ever,known,[END]
she,fascinated,me,infuriated,me,drove,me,mad,[END]
i,loved,her,as,consumingly,as,she,loved,him,[END]
from,the,day,i,first,laid,eyes,on,her,[END]
it,was,a,kind,of,disease,[END]
there,was,a,weight,of,sorrow,in,his,voice,[END]
he,bowed,his,head,into,his,two,hands,and,laughed,shakily,[END]
his,voice,was,muffled,and,blurred,by,his,fingers,[END]
what,a,grotesque,practical,joke,life,is,[END]
now,ashley,wilkes,is,a,free,man,and,would,marry,scarlett,on,a,moment's,notice,and,i,want,to,be,rid,of,her,[END]
naturally,that,makes,her,determined,to,have,me,[END]
she,wants,only,what,she,cannot,have,[END]
rhett,raised,his,head,[END]
i'm,afraid,he,said,quietly,afraid,that,it,will,all,begin,again,[END]
i,know,that,she's,heartless,and,completely,selfish,that,she's,like,a,child,who,cries,for,a,toy,and,then,breaks,it,once,she,has,it,[END]
but,there,are,moments,when,she,tilts,her,head,at,a,certain,angle,or,she,smiles,that,gleeful,smile,or,she,suddenly,looks,lost,and,i,come,close,to,forgetting,what,i,know,[END]
my,poor,rhett,[END]
rosemary,put,her,hand,on,his,arm,[END]
he,covered,it,with,his,own,[END]
then,he,smiled,at,her,and,he,was,himself,again,[END]
you,see,before,you,my,dear,the,man,who,was,once,the,marvel,of,the,mississippi,riverboats,[END]
i've,gambled,all,my,life,and,i've,never,lost,[END]
i'll,win,this,hand,too,[END]
scarlett,and,i,have,made,a,deal,[END]
i,couldn't,risk,having,her,here,in,this,house,too,long,[END]
either,i,would,fall,in,love,with,her,again,or,i,would,kill,her,[END]
so,i,dangled,gold,in,front,of,her,and,her,greed,for,money,outbalanced,the,undying,love,she,professes,for,me,[END]
she,will,be,leaving,for,good,when,the,season,is,over,[END]
until,then,all,i,have,to,do,is,keep,her,at,a,distance,outlast,her,and,outwit,her,[END]
i'm,almost,looking,forward,to,it,[END]
she,hates,to,lose,and,she,lets,it,show,[END]
it's,no,fun,beating,someone,who's,a,good,loser,[END]
his,eyes,laughed,at,his,sister,[END]
then,they,sobered,[END]
it,would,destroy,mama,if,she,knew,the,truth,about,my,miserable,marriage,but,she'd,be,ashamed,if,she,knew,that,i'd,walked,out,on,it,no,matter,how,unhappy,it,was,[END]
a,terrible,dilemma,[END]
this,way,scarlett,will,leave,i,will,be,the,injured,but,bravely,stoic,party,and,there'll,be,no,disgrace,[END]
and,no,regrets,[END]
only,for,having,been,a,fool,once,years,ago,[END]
i'll,have,the,very,powerful,solace,of,not,being,a,fool,the,second,time,[END]
it,does,a,lot,to,erase,the,humiliation,of,the,first,time,[END]
rosemary,stared,unabashedly,curious,[END]
what,if,scarlett,changed,[END]
she,might,grow,up,[END]
rhett,grinned,[END]
to,quote,the,lady,herself,when,pigs,fly,',[END]
21,[END]
go,away,[END]
scarlett,buried,her,face,in,a,pillow,[END]
it's,sunday,miss,scarlett,you,can't,sleep,late,[END]
miss,pauline,and,miss,eulalie,is,expecting,you,[END]
scarlett,groaned,[END]
it,was,enough,to,make,a,person,turn,episcopalian,[END]
at,least,they,got,to,sleep,later,the,service,at,saint,michael's,wasn't,until,eleven,o'clock,[END]
she,sighed,and,got,out,of,bed,[END]
her,aunts,wasted,no,time,in,beginning,to,lecture,her,about,what,would,be,expected,of,her,in,the,upcoming,season,[END]
she,listened,impatiently,while,eulalie,and,pauline,lectured,her,on,the,importance,of,decorum,inconspicuousness,deference,to,her,elders,ladylike,behavior,[END]
for,heaven's,sake,[END]
she'd,cut,her,teeth,on,all,those,rules,[END]
her,mother,and,mammy,had,drummed,them,into,her,from,the,time,she,could,walk,[END]
scarlett,set,her,jaw,mutinously,and,stared,at,her,feet,as,they,walked,to,saint,mary's,[END]
she,just,wouldn't,listen,that's,all,[END]
however,when,they,were,back,at,the,aunts',house,having,breakfast,pauline,said,something,that,forced,her,to,pay,attention,[END]
you,needn't,scowl,at,me,scarlett,[END]
i'm,only,telling,you,for,your,own,good,what,people,are,saying,[END]
there's,a,rumor,that,you,have,two,brand,new,ball,gowns,[END]
it's,a,scandal,when,everyone,else,is,happy,to,make,do,with,what,they've,been,wearing,for,years,[END]
you're,new,in,town,and,you,have,to,be,careful,of,your,reputation,[END]
rhett's,too,[END]
people,haven't,made,up,their,minds,about,him,yet,you,know,[END]
scarlett's,heart,gave,a,sickening,lurch,[END]
rhett,would,kill,her,if,she,ruined,things,for,him,[END]
what,about,rhett,[END]
please,tell,me,aunt,pauline,[END]
pauline,told,[END]
with,relish,[END]
all,the,old,stories,he,was,expelled,from,west,point,his,own,father,had,disowned,him,for,his,wild,behavior,he,was,known,to,have,made,money,in,disreputable,ways,as,a,professional,gambler,on,mississippi,riverboats,in,the,brawling,gold,fields,of,california,and,worst,of,all,through,consorting,with,scallywags,and,carpetbaggers,[END]
true,he'd,been,a,brave,soldier,for,the,confederacy,a,blockade,runner,and,a,gunner,in,lee's,army,and,he'd,given,most,of,his,dirty,money,to,the,confederate,cause,[END]
ha,[END]
scarlett,thought,[END]
rhett,sure,is,good,at,spreading,stories,[END]
but,nevertheless,his,past,was,definitely,unsavory,[END]
it,was,all,well,and,good,that,he'd,come,home,to,take,care,of,his,mother,and,sister,but,he'd,taken,his,own,sweet,time,getting,around,to,it,[END]
if,his,father,hadn't,starved,himself,to,death,to,pay,for,a,big,life,insurance,his,mother,and,sister,would,probably,have,died,of,neglect,[END]
scarlett,ground,her,teeth,to,keep,from,shouting,at,pauline,[END]
it,wasn't,true,about,the,insurance,[END]
rhett,had,never,never,for,a,minute,stopped,caring,about,his,mother,but,his,father,wouldn't,let,her,accept,anything,from,him,[END]
it,was,only,when,mr,butler,died,that,rhett,was,able,to,buy,miss,eleanor,the,house,and,give,her,money,[END]
and,even,mrs,butler,had,to,put,the,story,around,about,the,insurance,to,account,for,her,prosperity,[END]
because,rhett's,money,was,considered,dirty,[END]
money,was,money,couldn't,these,stiff-necked,charlestonians,see,that,[END]
what,difference,did,it,make,where,it,came,from,if,it,kept,a,roof,over,their,heads,and,food,in,their,bellies,[END]
why,didn't,pauline,stop,preaching,at,her,[END]
what,on,earth,was,she,talking,about,now,[END]
the,stupid,fertilizer,business,[END]
that,was,another,joke,[END]
there,wasn't,enough,fertilizer,in,the,world,to,account,for,the,money,rhett,was,throwing,away,on,foolishness,like,chasing,down,his,mother's,old,furniture,and,silver,and,pictures,of,great-grandparents,and,paying,perfectly,healthy,men,to,baby,his,precious,camellias,instead,of,growing,good,money,crops,[END]
there,are,a,number,of,charlestonians,doing,very,well,from,phosphates,but,they,don't,make,a,show,of,it,[END]
you,must,guard,against,this,tendency,to,extravagance,and,ostentation,[END]
he's,your,husband,it's,your,duty,to,warn,him,[END]
eleanor,butler,thinks,he,can,do,no,wrong,she's,always,spoiled,him,but,for,her,good,as,well,as,yours,and,rhett's,you've,got,to,see,to,it,that,the,butlers,don't,make,themselves,conspicuous,[END]
i,tried,to,speak,to,eleanor,sniffed,eulalie,but,she,didn't,hear,a,word,i,said,i'm,sure,of,it,[END]
scarlett's,narrowed,eyes,glinted,dangerously,[END]
i'm,more,grateful,than,i,can,tell,you,she,said,with,exaggerated,sweetness,and,i'll,pay,attention,to,every,word,[END]
now,i,really,have,to,run,[END]
thank,you,for,the,delicious,breakfast,[END]
she,stood,pecked,a,kiss,on,the,cheek,of,each,aunt,and,hurried,to,the,door,[END]
if,she,didn't,get,away,this,very,minute,she'd,scream,[END]
still,she'd,better,talk,to,rhett,about,what,the,aunts,had,said,[END]
you,do,see,don't,you,rhett,why,i,thought,i'd,better,tell,you,about,it,[END]
people,are,criticizing,your,mother,[END]
i,know,my,aunts,are,tiresome,old,busybodies,but,it's,tiresome,old,busybodies,who,always,seem,to,cause,all,the,trouble,[END]
you,remember,mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,meade,and,mrs,[END]
elsing,[END]
scarlett,had,hoped,rhett,would,thank,her,[END]
she,certainly,wasn't,prepared,for,his,laughter,[END]
bless,their,interfering,old,hearts,he,chuckled,[END]
come,with,me,scarlett,you'll,have,to,tell,mama,[END]
oh,rhett,i,couldn't,[END]
she'll,be,so,upset,[END]
you,must,[END]
this,is,serious,[END]
absurd,but,the,most,serious,matters,always,are,[END]
come,along,[END]
and,take,that,look,of,daughterly,concern,off,your,face,[END]
you,don't,give,a,damn,what,happens,to,my,mother,as,long,as,the,party,invitations,keep,arriving,and,we,both,know,it,[END]
that's,not,fair,[END]
i,love,your,mother,[END]
rhett,was,halfway,out,the,door,but,he,turned,and,strode,back,to,face,her,[END]
he,took,her,shoulders,in,his,hands,and,jolted,her,so,that,her,face,was,turned,up,[END]
his,eyed,were,cold,examining,her,expression,as,if,she,were,on,trial,[END]
don't,lie,to,me,about,my,mother,scarlett,[END]
i,warn,you,it's,dangerous,[END]
he,was,close,to,her,touching,her,[END]
scarlett's,lips,parted,she,knew,her,eyes,must,be,telling,him,how,much,she,longed,for,him,to,kiss,her,[END]
if,he'd,only,lower,his,head,a,little,she'd,meet,his,lips,with,hers,[END]
her,breath,was,caught,in,her,throat,[END]
rhett's,hands,tightened,she,felt,them,he,was,going,to,pull,her,to,him,a,tiny,sob,of,joy,vibrated,in,her,trapped,breath,[END]
damn,you,[END]
rhett,growled,quietly,[END]
he,pushed,himself,away,from,her,[END]
come,downstairs,[END]
mama's,in,the,library,[END]
eleanor,butler,dropped,her,tatting,into,her,lap,and,laid,her,hands,on,it,left,atop,right,[END]
it,was,a,signal,that,she,was,taking,scarlett's,account,seriously,giving,her,full,concentration,[END]
at,the,end,scarlett,waited,nervously,for,mrs,butler's,reaction,[END]
sit,down,both,of,you,eleanor,said,serenely,[END]
eulalie,is,quite,wrong,[END]
i,paid,full,attention,when,she,spoke,to,me,about,spending,so,much,money,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,widened,[END]
and,i,gave,it,considerable,thought,afterwards,eleanor,continued,[END]
particularly,with,regard,to,giving,rosemary,the,grand,tour,for,her,christmas,gift,rhett,[END]
no,one,in,charleston,has,been,able,to,do,that,for,many,years,practically,since,the,time,you,would,have,gone,if,you,hadn't,been,such,a,handful,that,your,father,sent,you,to,military,school,instead,[END]
however,i,decided,that,there,is,no,real,risk,of,ostracism,[END]
charlestonians,are,pragmatic,old,civilizations,always,are,[END]
we,recognize,that,wealth,is,desirable,and,poverty,extremely,disagreeable,[END]
and,if,one,is,poor,oneself,it's,helpful,to,have,rich,friends,[END]
people,would,consider,it,unforgivable,not,merely,deplorable,were,i,to,serve,scuppernong,wine,for,champagne,[END]
scarlett's,brow,was,knotted,[END]
she,was,having,some,trouble,understanding,[END]
not,that,it,mattered,the,even,peaceful,tone,of,mrs,butler's,voice,told,her,that,everything,was,all,right,[END]
perhaps,we,have,been,a,little,too,visible,eleanor,was,saying,but,right,now,no,one,in,charleston,can,afford,to,disapprove,of,the,butlers,because,rosemary,might,just,decide,to,accept,the,courtship,of,a,son,or,brother,or,cousin,of,the,family,and,her,marriage,settlement,could,solve,any,number,of,awkwardnesses,[END]
mama,you're,a,shameless,cynic,[END]
rhett,laughed,[END]
eleanor,butler,simply,smiled,[END]
what,are,you,laughing,at,[END]
said,rosemary,as,she,opened,the,door,[END]
her,eyes,moved,quickly,from,rhett,to,scarlett,and,back,again,[END]
i,could,hear,you,guffawing,halfway,down,the,hall,rhett,[END]
tell,me,the,joke,[END]
mama,was,being,worldly,he,said,[END]
he,and,rosemary,had,long,since,united,in,a,pact,to,protect,their,mother,from,the,realities,of,the,world,and,they,smiled,at,one,another,like,conspirators,[END]
scarlett,felt,shut,out,and,she,turned,her,back,on,them,[END]
may,i,sit,with,you,a,while,miss,eleanor,[END]
i,want,to,ask,your,advice,about,what,to,wear,to,the,ball,[END]
see,if,i,care,rhett,butler,that,you,cater,to,your,old,maid,sister,like,she,was,queen,of,the,may,[END]
and,if,you,think,you,can,upset,me,or,make,me,jealous,you'll,just,have,to,think,again,[END]
eleanor,butler,watched,puzzled,as,scarlett's,mouth,fell,half-open,in,surprise,and,her,eyes,glittered,with,excitement,[END]
eleanor,looked,behind,her,shoulder,wondering,what,scarlett,saw,[END]
but,although,scarlett's,gaze,was,fixed,she,wasn't,looking,at,anything,[END]
she,was,blinded,by,the,brightness,of,the,thought,that,had,come,to,her,[END]
jealous,[END]
what,a,fool,i've,been,[END]
of,course,that's,it,[END]
it,explains,everything,[END]
why,did,it,take,me,so,long,to,see,it,[END]
rhett,practically,rubbed,my,nose,in,it,when,he,made,such,a,to-do,about,the,name,of,the,river,[END]
ashley,[END]
he's,still,jealous,of,ashley,[END]
he's,always,been,crazy,jealous,of,ashley,that's,why,he,wanted,me,so,much,[END]
all,i,have,to,do,is,make,him,jealous,again,[END]
not,of,ashley,heavens,no,if,i,so,much,as,threw,a,smile,in,his,direction,he'd,be,looking,pitiful,at,me,and,begging,me,to,marry,him,[END]
no,i'll,find,somebody,else,somebody,right,here,in,charleston,[END]
that,won't,be,hard,at,all,[END]
the,season,starts,in,six,days,and,there'll,be,parties,and,balls,and,dancing,and,sitting,out,to,take,a,bite,of,cake,and,a,cup,of,punch,[END]
this,might,be,fancy,old,snobby,charleston,but,men,don't,change,with,geography,[END]
i'll,have,a,string,of,beaux,hanging,after,me,before,the,first,party's,half,done,[END]
i,can,hardly,wait,[END]
after,sunday,dinner,the,whole,family,went,to,the,confederate,home,carrying,baskets,of,greens,from,the,plantation,and,two,of,miss,eleanor's,whiskey-soaked,fruitcakes,[END]
scarlett,almost,danced,along,the,sidewalk,swinging,her,basket,and,singing,a,christmas,song,[END]
her,gaiety,was,infectious,and,soon,the,four,of,them,were,carolling,at,houses,on,the,way,[END]
come,in,cried,the,owners,of,each,house,they,serenaded,[END]
come,with,us,mrs,butler,suggested,instead,we're,going,to,decorate,the,home,[END]
there,were,more,than,a,dozen,willing,helpers,when,they,reached,the,lovely,shabby,old,house,on,broad,street,[END]
the,orphans,squealed,with,anticipation,when,the,cakes,were,unpacked,but,grown-ups,only,eleanor,said,firmly,[END]
however,[END]
and,she,took,out,the,sugar,cookies,she,had,brought,for,them,[END]
two,of,the,widows,who,lived,at,the,home,hurriedly,fetched,cups,of,milk,and,settled,the,children,in,chairs,around,a,low,table,on,the,piazza,[END]
now,we,can,hang,the,greens,in,peace,said,mrs,butler,[END]
rhett,you'll,do,the,ladder-climbing,please,[END]
scarlett,seated,herself,next,to,anne,hampton,[END]
she,liked,being,extra,nice,to,the,shy,young,girl,because,anne,was,so,much,like,melanie,[END]
it,made,scarlett,feel,that,in,some,way,she,was,making,up,for,all,the,unkind,thoughts,she,had,had,about,melly,all,the,years,that,melly,was,so,resolutely,loyal,to,her,[END]
also,anne,was,so,openly,admiring,that,her,company,was,always,a,pleasure,[END]
her,soft,voice,was,almost,animated,when,she,complimented,scarlett,on,her,hair,[END]
it,must,be,wonderful,to,have,such,dark,rich-looking,color,she,said,[END]
it's,like,the,deepest,black,silk,[END]
or,like,a,painting,i,saw,once,of,a,beautiful,sleek,black,panther,[END]
anne's,face,shone,with,innocent,worship,then,blushed,for,her,impertinence,in,making,such,a,personal,remark,[END]
scarlett,patted,her,hand,kindly,[END]
anne,couldn't,help,it,if,she,was,like,a,soft,timid,brown,field,mouse,[END]
later,when,the,decorations,were,done,and,the,tall,rooms,smelled,sweetly,resinous,from,pine,branches,anne,excused,herself,to,go,usher,in,the,children,for,carol,singing,[END]
how,melly,would,have,loved,this,thought,scarlett,[END]
there,was,a,lump,in,her,throat,when,she,looked,at,anne,her,arms,encircling,two,nervous,little,girls,while,they,sang,a,duet,[END]
melly,was,so,crazy,fond,of,children,[END]
for,an,instant,scarlett,felt,guilty,that,she,hadn't,sent,more,christmas,presents,to,wade,and,ella,but,then,the,duet,was,over,and,it,was,time,to,join,in,the,singing,and,she,had,to,concentrate,on,remembering,all,the,verses,of,the,first,noël,[END]
what,fun,that,was,[END]
she,exclaimed,after,they,left,the,home,[END]
i,do,love,christmastime,[END]
i,do,too,said,eleanor,[END]
it's,a,good,breathing,spell,before,the,season,[END]
though,this,year,won't,be,as,peaceful,as,usual,[END]
the,poor,yankee,soldiers,will,be,down,on,our,necks,more,than,likely,[END]
their,colonel,can't,just,let,it,slide,that,we,all,broke,curfew,with,such,a,bang,[END]
she,giggled,like,a,girl,[END]
what,fun,that,was,[END]
honestly,mama,[END]
said,rosemary,[END]
how,can,you,call,those,blue-coated,wretches,poor',yankees,[END]
because,they'd,much,rather,be,home,with,their,own,families,for,the,holidays,than,here,badgering,us,[END]
i,think,they're,embarrassed,[END]
rhett,chuckled,[END]
you,and,your,cronies,have,something,up,your,lace-edged,sleeves,i'll,bet,[END]
only,if,we're,driven,to,it,[END]
mrs,butler,giggled,again,[END]
we,figure,today's,calm,was,only,because,their,colonel,is,such,a,biblethumper,he,won't,order,any,action,on,the,sabbath,[END]
tomorrow,will,tell,the,tale,[END]
in,the,old,days,they,used,to,harass,us,by,going,through,our,baskets,to,search,for,contraband,when,we,left,the,market,[END]
if,they,try,it,again,they'll,be,dipping,their,hands,into,some,interesting,things,underneath,the,turnip,greens,and,rice,[END]
innards,[END]
guessed,rosemary,[END]
broken,eggs,[END]
scarlett,offered,[END]
itching,powder,suggested,rhett,[END]
miss,eleanor,giggled,for,the,third,time,[END]
and,a,few,more,things,besides,she,said,complacently,[END]
we,developed,a,number,of,interesting,tactics,back,then,[END]
this,crop,of,soldiers,wasn't,around,it,will,all,be,new,to,them,[END]
i'll,bet,a,lot,of,these,men,never,even,heard,of,poison,sumac,[END]
i,dislike,being,so,uncharitable,at,christmas,but,they've,got,to,learn,that,we,quit,being,afraid,of,them,a,long,time,ago,[END]
i,do,wish,ross,could,be,here,she,added,abruptly,all,laughter,gone,[END]
when,do,you,suppose,it,will,be,safe,for,your,brother,to,come,back,home,rhett,[END]
it,depends,on,how,quickly,you,and,your,friends,get,the,yankees,whipped,into,shape,mama,[END]
certainly,in,time,for,the,saint,cecilia,[END]
that's,all,right,then,[END]
it,doesn't,matter,if,he,misses,all,the,rest,as,long,as,he's,home,for,the,ball,[END]
scarlett,could,hear,the,capital,b,in,miss,eleanor's,voice,[END]
scarlett,was,certain,that,the,hours,would,drag,by,until,the,twenty-sixth,and,the,beginning,of,the,season,[END]
but,to,her,surprise,the,time,passed,so,quickly,that,she,could,hardly,keep,up,[END]
the,most,entertaining,part,of,it,all,was,the,battle,with,the,yankees,[END]
the,colonel,did,indeed,order,retaliation,for,the,curfew,humiliation,[END]
and,on,monday,the,market,rang,with,laughter,as,charleston's,ladies,packed,their,baskets,with,the,weapons,of,their,choice,[END]
the,following,day,the,soldiers,were,careful,to,keep,their,gloves,on,[END]
plunging,a,hand,into,some,loathsome-feeling,substance,or,suddenly,being,afflicted,with,fiery,itching,and,swelling,were,not,experiences,they,were,willing,to,repeat,[END]
the,fools,should,have,known,we'd,expect,them,to,do,just,what,they,did,scarlett,said,to,sally,brewton,at,a,whist,party,that,afternoon,[END]
sally,agreed,with,a,happy,reminiscent,laugh,[END]
i,had,a,loose-lidded,box,of,lamp,black,in,my,shopping,she,said,[END]
what,was,yours,[END]
cayenne,pepper,[END]
i,was,scared,to,death,i'd,start,sneezing,and,give,the,whole,trick,away,[END]
speaking,of,tricks,i,believe,that's,mine,[END]
new,rationing,regulations,had,been,posted,the,day,before,and,the,ladies,of,charleston,were,now,gambling,for,coffee,not,money,[END]
with,the,black,market,effectively,out,of,business,for,the,time,being,this,was,the,highest-stakes,card,game,scarlett,had,ever,been,in,[END]
she,loved,it,[END]
she,loved,tormenting,the,yankees,too,[END]
there,were,still,patrols,on,charleston's,streets,but,their,noses,had,been,tweaked,and,would,be,tweaked,again,and,again,until,they,admitted,defeat,[END]
with,her,as,one,of,the,tweakers,[END]
deal,she,said,i,feel,lucky,[END]
only,a,few,more,days,and,she,would,be,at,a,ball,dancing,with,rhett,[END]
he,was,keeping,away,from,her,now,managing,things,so,that,they,were,never,alone,together,but,on,the,dance,floor,they,would,be,together,and,touching,and,alone,no,matter,how,many,other,couples,were,on,the,floor,[END]
scarlett,held,the,white,camellias,rhett,had,sent,her,to,the,cluster,of,curls,at,the,nape,of,her,neck,and,twisted,her,head,to,see,herself,in,the,looking,glass,[END]
it,looks,like,a,gloh,of,fat,on,a,bunch,of,sausages,she,said,with,disgust,[END]
pansy,you'll,have,to,do,my,hair,different,[END]
pile,it,on,top,[END]
she,could,pin,the,flowers,in,between,the,waves,that,wouldn't,be,too,bad,[END]
oh,why,did,rhett,have,to,be,so,mean,telling,her,that,his,precious,old,plantation,flowers,were,the,only,jewels,she,could,wear,[END]
it,was,bad,enough,that,her,ball,gown,was,so,dowdy,[END]
but,with,nothing,to,dress,up,the,plainness,except,a,bunch,of,flowers,she,might,as,well,wear,a,flour,sack,with,a,hole,cut,for,her,head,[END]
she'd,counted,on,her,pearls,and,her,diamond,earbobs,[END]
you,don't,have,to,brush,a,hole,in,my,scalp,she,grumbled,at,pansy,[END]
yes'm,[END]
pansy,continued,to,brush,the,long,dark,mass,of,hair,with,vigorous,strokes,eradicating,the,curls,that,had,taken,so,long,to,arrange,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,her,reflection,with,growing,satisfaction,[END]
yes,that,was,much,better,[END]
her,neck,was,really,too,pretty,to,cover,[END]
it,was,much,better,to,wear,her,hair,up,[END]
and,her,earbobs,would,show,up,better,[END]
she,was,going,to,wear,them,no,matter,what,rhett,had,told,her,[END]
she,had,to,be,dazzling,she,had,to,win,the,admiration,of,every,man,at,the,ball,and,the,hearts,of,at,least,a,few,[END]
that,would,make,rhett,sit,up,and,take,notice,[END]
she,fastened,the,diamonds,into,her,earlobes,[END]
there,[END]
she,tilted,her,head,from,side,to,side,pleased,with,the,effect,[END]
do,you,like,this,miss,scarlett,[END]
pansy,gestured,toward,her,handiwork,[END]
no,[END]
do,it,fuller,above,the,ears,[END]
thank,goodness,rosemary,had,turned,down,her,offer,to,lend,pansy,this,evening,[END]
though,why,rosemary,hadn't,jumped,at,the,chance,was,a,mystery,she,needed,all,the,help,she,could,get,[END]
she'd,probably,bundle,her,hair,into,the,same,lumpy,old-maid,bun,she,always,wore,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
entering,the,ballroom,with,rhett's,sister,would,only,call,attention,to,how,much,prettier,she,was,[END]
that's,fine,pansy,she,said,good,humor,restored,[END]
her,hair,shone,like,a,raven's,wing,[END]
the,white,flowers,would,actually,be,very,becoming,[END]
hand,me,some,hairpins,[END]
a,half,hour,later,scarlett,was,ready,[END]
she,took,one,final,look,in,the,tall,pier,glass,[END]
the,deep,blue,watered,silk,of,her,gown,shimmered,in,the,lamp,light,and,made,her,powdered,bare,shoulders,and,bosom,look,as,pale,as,alabaster,[END]
her,diamonds,sparkled,brilliantly,as,did,her,green,eyes,[END]
black,velvet,ribbon,in,loops,bordered,the,gown's,train,and,a,wide,black,velvet,bow,lined,with,paler,blue,silk,sat,atop,the,gown's,bustle,emphasizing,her,tiny,waist,[END]
her,slippers,were,made,of,blue,velvet,with,black,laces,and,narrow,black,velvet,ribbon,was,tied,around,her,throat,and,each,wrist,[END]
white,camellias,tied,with,black,velvet,bows,were,pinned,to,her,shoulders,and,filled,a,silver-lace,bouquet,holder,[END]
she,had,never,looked,lovelier,and,she,recognized,it,[END]
excitement,made,her,cheeks,rosy,with,natural,color,[END]
scarlett's,first,ball,in,charleston,was,full,of,surprises,[END]
almost,nothing,was,the,way,she,expected,it,to,be,[END]
first,she,was,told,that,she'd,have,to,wear,her,boots,not,her,dancing,slippers,[END]
they,were,going,to,walk,to,the,ball,[END]
she,would,have,ordered,a,hackney,if,she'd,known,that,she,couldn't,believe,that,rhett,hadn't,done,it,[END]
it,didn't,help,that,pansy,was,supposed,to,carry,her,slippers,in,a,charleston,contraption,called,a,slipper,bag,because,she,didn't,have,a,slipper,bag,and,it,took,miss,eleanor's,maid,fifteen,minutes,to,find,a,basket,to,use,instead,[END]
why,hadn't,anyone,told,her,she,needed,one,of,the,miserable,things,[END]
we,didn't,think,of,it,rosemary,said,[END]
everybody,has,slipper,bags,[END]
everybody,in,charleston,maybe,thought,scarlett,but,not,in,atlanta,[END]
people,don't,walk,to,balls,there,they,ride,[END]
her,happy,anticipation,of,her,first,charleston,ball,began,to,change,to,uneasy,apprehension,[END]
what,else,was,going,to,be,different,[END]
everything,she,discovered,[END]
charleston,had,developed,formalities,and,rituals,in,the,long,years,of,its,history,that,were,unknown,in,the,vigorous,semi-frontier,world,of,north,georgia,[END]
when,the,fall,of,the,confederacy,cut,off,the,lavish,wealth,that,had,allowed,the,formality,to,develop,the,rituals,survived,the,only,thing,that,remained,of,the,past,cherished,and,unchangeable,for,that,reason,[END]
there,was,a,receiving,line,inside,the,door,of,the,ballroom,at,the,top,of,the,wentworth,house,[END]
everyone,had,to,line,up,on,the,stairs,waiting,to,enter,the,room,one,by,one,and,then,shake,hands,and,murmur,something,to,minnie,wentworth,then,to,her,husband,their,son,their,son's,wife,their,daughter's,husband,their,married,daughter,their,unmarried,daughter,[END]
while,all,the,time,the,music,was,playing,and,earlier,arrivals,were,dancing,and,scarlett's,feet,were,itching,to,dance,[END]
in,georgia,she,thought,impatiently,the,people,giving,the,party,come,forward,to,meet,their,guests,[END]
they,don't,keep,them,waiting,in,line,like,a,chain,gang,[END]
it's,a,sight,more,welcoming,than,this,foolishness,[END]
just,before,she,followed,mrs,butler,into,the,room,a,dignified,manservant,offered,her,a,tray,[END]
a,pile,of,folded,papers,was,on,it,little,booklets,held,together,by,thin,blue,twine,with,a,tiny,pencil,hanging,from,it,[END]
dance,cards,[END]
they,must,be,dance,cards,[END]
scarlett,had,heard,mammy,talk,about,balls,in,savannah,when,ellen,o'hara,was,a,girl,but,she'd,never,quite,believed,that,parties,were,so,peaceful,that,a,girl,looked,in,a,book,to,see,who,she,was,supposed,to,dance,with,[END]
why,the,tarleton,twins,and,the,fontaine,boys,would,have,split,their,britches,laughing,if,anyone,told,them,they,had,to,write,their,names,on,a,tiny,piece,of,paper,with,a,little,pencil,so,dinky,that,it,would,break,in,a,real,man's,fingers,[END]
she,wasn't,even,sure,she,wanted,to,dance,with,the,kind,of,pantywaist,who'd,be,willing,to,do,that,[END]
yes,she,was,[END]
she,was,sure,she'd,dance,with,the,devil,himself,horns,and,tail,and,all,just,to,be,able,to,dance,[END]
it,seemed,like,ten,years,not,one,since,the,masquerade,ball,in,atlanta,[END]
i'm,so,happy,to,be,here,said,scarlett,to,minnie,wentworth,and,her,voice,throbbed,with,sincerity,[END]
she,smiled,at,all,the,other,wentworths,each,in,turn,and,then,she,was,through,the,line,[END]
she,turned,toward,the,dancing,her,feet,already,moving,in,time,to,the,music,and,she,drew,in,her,breath,[END]
oh,it,was,so,beautiful,so,strange,and,yet,so,familiar,like,a,dream,she,only,half-remembered,[END]
the,candlelit,room,was,alive,with,music,with,the,colors,and,rustling,of,whirling,skirts,[END]
along,the,walls,dowagers,were,sitting,in,fragile,gold-painted,chairs,just,as,they,always,had,whispering,behind,their,fans,to,one,another,about,the,things,they,had,always,whispered,about,the,young,people,who,were,dancing,too,close,together,the,latest,horror,story,of,someone's,daughter's,prolonged,childbirth,the,newest,scandal,about,their,dearest,friends,[END]
waiters,in,full-dress,suits,moved,from,group,to,group,of,men,and,women,who,weren't,dancing,with,silver,trays,of,filled,glasses,and,frosted,silver,julep,cups,[END]
there,was,a,hum,of,blended,voices,punctuated,by,laughter,high,and,deep,the,age-old,beloved,noise,of,fortunate,light-hearted,people,enjoying,themselves,[END]
it,was,as,if,the,old,world,the,beautiful,carefree,world,of,her,youth,still,existed,as,if,nothing,was,changed,and,there,had,never,been,a,war,[END]
her,sharp,eyes,could,see,the,scabby,paint,on,the,walls,and,the,spur-gouges,in,the,floor,under,the,layers,of,wax,but,she,refused,to,notice,[END]
better,to,enter,the,illusion,to,forget,the,war,and,the,yankee,patrols,on,the,street,outside,[END]
there,was,music,and,there,was,dancing,and,rhett,had,promised,to,be,nice,[END]
nothing,more,was,needed,[END]
rhett,was,more,than,merely,nice,he,was,charming,[END]
and,no,one,on,earth,could,be,more,charming,than,rhett,when,he,wanted,to,be,[END]
unfortunately,he,was,just,as,charming,to,everyone,else,as,he,was,to,her,[END]
she,alternated,wildly,between,pride,that,every,other,woman,envied,her,and,raging,jealousy,that,rhett,was,paying,attention,to,so,many,others,[END]
he,was,attentive,to,her,she,couldn't,accuse,him,of,neglect,[END]
but,he,was,attentive,to,his,mother,too,and,to,rosemary,and,to,dozens,of,other,women,who,were,dreary,old,matrons,in,scarlett's,opinion,[END]
she,told,herself,that,she,mustn't,care,and,after,a,while,she,didn't,[END]
as,each,dance,ended,she,was,immediately,surrounded,by,men,who,insisted,that,her,previous,partner,introduce,them,so,that,they,could,beg,her,for,the,dance,to,follow,[END]
it,was,not,simply,that,she,was,new,in,town,a,fresh,face,in,a,crowd,of,people,who,all,knew,each,other,[END]
she,was,compellingly,alluring,[END]
her,decision,to,make,rhett,jealous,had,added,a,reckless,glitter,to,her,fascinating,unusual,green,eyes,and,a,heated,flush,of,excitement,colored,her,cheeks,like,a,red,flag,signalling,danger,[END]
many,of,the,men,who,vied,for,her,dances,were,the,husbands,of,friends,she'd,made,women,she,had,called,on,had,partnered,at,the,whist,table,had,gossiped,with,over,coffee,at,the,market,[END]
she,didn't,care,[END]
time,enough,to,mend,the,damage,after,rhett,was,hers,again,[END]
in,the,meantime,she,was,being,admired,and,complimented,and,flirted,with,and,she,was,in,her,element,[END]
nothing,had,really,changed,[END]
men,still,responded,the,same,way,to,her,fluttering,eyelashes,and,flickering,dimple,and,outrageous,flattery,[END]
they'll,believe,any,lie,you,tell,them,long,as,it,makes,them,feel,like,heroes,she,thought,with,a,wicked,smile,of,delight,that,made,her,partner,miss,a,step,[END]
she,jerked,her,toes,out,from,under,his,foot,[END]
oh,do,say,you,forgive,me,[END]
she,begged,[END]
i,must,have,caught,my,heel,in,the,hem,of,my,dress,[END]
what,a,dreadful,mistake,to,make,especially,when,i'm,lucky,enough,to,be,waltzing,with,a,wonderful,dancer,like,you,[END]
her,eyes,were,beguiling,and,the,rueful,pout,that,went,with,her,apology,made,her,lips,look,as,if,they,were,ready,for,a,kiss,[END]
there,were,some,things,that,a,girl,never,forgot,how,to,do,[END]
what,a,lovely,party,[END]
she,said,happily,when,they,were,walking,back,to,the,house,[END]
i'm,pleased,that,you,had,a,nice,time,eleanor,butler,said,[END]
and,i'm,very,very,pleased,for,you,too,rosemary,[END]
you,seemed,to,be,enjoying,yourself,[END]
hah,[END]
i,hated,it,mama,you,should,know,that,[END]
but,i'm,so,happy,that,i'm,going,to,europe,that,it,didn't,bother,me,to,go,to,the,silly,ball,[END]
rhett,laughed,[END]
he,was,walking,behind,scarlett,and,rosemary,his,mother's,hand,in,his,left,arm,[END]
his,laughter,was,warm,in,the,cold,december,night,[END]
scarlett,thought,of,the,warmth,of,his,body,imagined,that,she,could,sense,it,at,her,back,[END]
why,wasn't,she,on,his,arm,close,to,that,warmth,[END]
she,knew,why,mrs,butler,was,old,it,was,appropriate,that,her,son,support,her,[END]
but,that,didn't,lessen,scarlett's,longing,[END]
laugh,all,you,please,brother,dear,rosemary,said,but,i,don't,think,it's,funny,[END]
she,was,walking,backwards,now,half-trampling,the,train,of,her,gown,[END]
i,didn't,get,to,say,two,words,to,miss,julia,ashley,all,night,because,i,had,to,dance,with,all,those,ridiculous,men,[END]
who's,miss,julia,ashley,[END]
scarlett,asked,[END]
the,name,commanded,her,interest,[END]
she's,rosemary's,idol,said,rhett,and,the,only,person,i've,ever,been,afraid,of,in,my,adult,life,[END]
you,would,have,noticed,miss,ashley,if,you'd,seen,her,scarlett,[END]
she,always,wears,black,and,she,looks,like,she's,been,drinking,vinegar,[END]
oh,you,[END]
rosemary,sputtered,[END]
she,ran,to,rhett,and,hit,him,on,the,chest,with,her,fists,[END]
pax,[END]
he,cried,[END]
he,put,his,right,arm,around,her,and,pulled,her,close,to,his,side,[END]
scarlett,felt,the,wind,cold,off,the,river,[END]
she,lifted,her,chin,against,it,turned,forward,and,walked,the,remaining,few,steps,to,the,house,alone,[END]
22,[END]
another,sunday,meant,another,lecture,from,eulalie,and,pauline,scarlett,was,sure,of,it,[END]
she,was,in,fact,more,than,a,little,frightened,about,her,behavior,at,the,ball,[END]
perhaps,she'd,been,just,a,little,bit,too,lively,that,was,it,[END]
but,she,hadn't,had,fun,like,that,in,so,long,and,it,wasn't,her,fault,that,she,attracted,so,much,more,attention,than,the,prissy,charleston,ladies,was,it,[END]
besides,she,was,really,only,doing,it,for,rhett,so,he,would,stop,being,so,cold,and,distant,to,her,[END]
no,one,could,blame,a,wife,for,trying,to,hold,her,marriage,together,[END]
she,suffered,in,silence,the,heavy,unexpressed,disapproval,of,her,equally,silent,aunts,during,the,walk,to,and,from,saint,mary's,[END]
eulalie's,mournful,sniffling,during,mass,set,her,teeth,on,edge,but,she,managed,to,block,it,out,by,daydreaming,about,the,moment,when,rhett,would,abandon,his,stiff-necked,pride,and,admit,that,he,still,loved,her,[END]
for,he,did,didn't,he,[END]
whenever,he,held,her,in,his,arms,to,dance,she,felt,like,her,knees,had,turned,to,water,[END]
surely,she,couldn't,feel,the,lightning,in,the,air,when,they,touched,unless,he,felt,it,too,[END]
could,she,[END]
she'd,find,out,soon,[END]
he'd,have,to,do,more,than,just,rest,his,gloved,hand,on,her,waist,for,dancing,when,new,year's,eve,came,[END]
he'd,have,to,kiss,her,at,midnight,[END]
only,five,more,days,to,get,through,and,then,their,lips,would,meet,and,he'd,have,to,believe,how,much,she,truly,loved,him,[END]
her,kiss,would,tell,him,more,than,words,ever,could,[END]
the,ancient,beauty,and,mystery,of,the,mass,unfolded,before,her,unseeing,eyes,while,scarlett,imagined,her,wishes,coming,true,[END]
pauline's,sharp,elbow,stabbed,her,whenever,her,responses,were,late,[END]
the,silence,continued,unbroken,when,they,sat,down,for,breakfast,[END]
scarlett,felt,as,if,every,nerve,in,her,body,were,exposed,to,the,air,to,pauline's,icy,stare,to,the,sound,of,eulalie's,sniffing,[END]
she,couldn't,stand,it,any,longer,and,she,burst,out,in,angry,attack,at,them,before,they,could,attack,her,[END]
you,told,me,that,everybody,walked,everywhere,and,i've,got,broken,blisters,all,over,my,feet,from,doing,what,you,said,[END]
last,night,the,street,in,front,of,the,wentworths',ball,was,chock,full,of,carriages,[END]
pauline,raised,her,eyebrows,and,tightened,her,lips,[END]
do,you,see,what,i,mean,sister,[END]
she,said,to,eulalie,[END]
scarlett,is,determined,to,turn,her,back,on,everything,that,charleston,stands,for,[END]
it's,hard,to,see,what,importance,the,carriages,have,sister,compared,with,the,things,we,agreed,we,should,talk,about,to,her,[END]
as,an,example,pauline,insisted,[END]
it's,an,excellent,example,of,the,attitude,behind,all,the,other,things,[END]
scarlett,drained,her,cup,of,the,pale,weak,coffee,pauline,had,poured,and,set,it,down,in,the,saucer,with,a,crash,[END]
i'll,take,it,as,a,kindness,if,you'll,stop,talking,about,me,as,if,i,was,deaf,and,dumb,[END]
you,can,preach,at,me,till,you're,blue,in,the,face,if,you,want,to,but,first,tell,me,who,all,those,carriages,belonged,to,[END]
the,aunts,stared,at,her,from,wide,eyes,[END]
why,the,yankees,of,course,said,eulalie,[END]
carpetbaggers,added,pauline,with,precision,[END]
with,corrections,and,amendments,to,every,sentence,spoken,by,the,other,the,sisters,told,scarlett,that,the,coachmen,were,still,loyal,to,their,pre-war,owners,although,they,now,worked,for,the,newrich,uptown,people,[END]
during,the,season,they,manipulated,their,employers,in,various,clever,ways,so,that,they,could,drive,their,white,folks,to,balls,and,receptions,if,the,distance,was,too,far,or,the,weather,too,inclement,for,them,to,walk,[END]
on,the,night,of,the,saint,cecilia,they,just,flat,out,insist,on,having,the,evening,off,and,the,carriage,for,their,own,use,eulalie,added,[END]
they're,all,trained,coachmen,and,very,high-toned,pauline,said,so,the,carpetbaggers,are,terrified,of,offending,them,[END]
she,was,very,close,to,laughter,[END]
they,know,the,coachmen,despise,them,[END]
house,servants,have,always,been,the,most,snobbish,creatures,on,earth,[END]
certainly,these,house,servants,said,eulalie,gleefully,[END]
after,all,they're,charlestonians,just,as,much,as,we,are,[END]
that's,why,they,care,so,much,about,the,season,[END]
the,yankees,took,whatever,they,could,and,tried,to,destroy,everything,else,but,we,still,have,our,season,[END]
and,our,pride,[END]
pauline,announced,[END]
with,their,pride,and,a,penny,they,could,ride,the,streetcar,anyplace,it,went,scarlett,thought,sourly,[END]
but,she,was,grateful,that,they'd,gotten,sidetracked,onto,the,stories,about,faithful,old,family,servants,that,occupied,them,for,the,rest,of,the,meal,[END]
she,was,even,careful,to,eat,only,half,her,breakfast,so,that,eulalie,would,be,able,to,finish,it,as,soon,as,she,was,gone,[END]
aunt,pauline,ran,a,mighty,stingy,household,[END]
she,was,pleasantly,surprised,to,find,anne,hampton,at,the,butler,house,when,she,got,there,[END]
it,would,be,nice,to,bask,in,anne's,admiration,for,a,while,after,the,hours,of,cold,disapproval,from,her,aunts,[END]
but,anne,and,the,widow,from,the,home,who,was,with,her,were,almost,totally,occupied,with,the,bowls,full,of,camellias,that,had,been,sent,down,from,the,plantation,[END]
and,so,was,rhett,[END]
burnt,to,the,ground,he,was,saying,but,stronger,than,ever,once,they're,cleared,of,weeds,[END]
oh,look,[END]
anne,exclaimed,[END]
there's,the,reine,des,fleurs,[END]
and,a,rubra,plena,[END]
the,thin,elderly,widow,cupped,her,pale,hands,to,hold,the,vibrant,red,blossom,[END]
i,used,to,keep,mine,in,a,crystal,vase,on,the,pianoforte,[END]
anne's,eyes,blinked,rapidly,[END]
so,did,we,miss,harriet,and,the,alba,plena's,on,the,tea,table,[END]
my,alba,plena,isn't,as,healthy,as,i'd,hoped,rhett,said,[END]
the,buds,are,all,kind,of,stunted,[END]
the,widow,and,anne,both,laughed,[END]
you,won't,see,any,flowers,until,january,mr,butler,anne,explained,[END]
the,alba's,a,late,bloomer,[END]
rhett's,mouth,twisted,in,a,rueful,smile,[END]
so,am,i,it,seems,where,gardening,is,concerned,[END]
my,grief,[END]
thought,scarlett,[END]
next,thing,i,reckon,they'll,start,chatting,about,is,whether,cow,patties,are,better,than,horse,droppings,for,fertilizer,[END]
what,kind,of,sissyness,is,that,for,a,man,like,rhett,to,say,[END]
she,turned,her,back,on,them,and,sat,in,a,chair,close,to,the,settee,where,eleanor,butler,was,doing,her,tatting,[END]
this,piece,is,almost,long,enough,to,trim,the,neck,of,your,claret,gown,when,it,needs,freshening,she,said,to,scarlett,with,a,smile,[END]
halfway,through,the,season,it's,always,nice,to,have,a,change,[END]
i'll,be,finished,with,it,by,then,[END]
oh,miss,eleanor,you're,always,so,sweet,and,thoughtful,[END]
i,feel,my,bad,mood,going,right,away,[END]
honestly,i,marvel,at,you,being,such,good,friends,with,my,aunt,eulalie,[END]
she's,not,like,you,at,all,[END]
she's,forever,sniffling,and,complaining,and,squabbling,with,aunt,pauline,[END]
eleanor,dropped,her,ivory,tatting,shuttle,[END]
scarlett,you,astonish,me,[END]
of,course,eulalie's,my,friend,i,think,of,her,as,practically,a,sister,[END]
don't,you,know,that,she,almost,married,my,younger,brother,[END]
scarlett's,jaw,dropped,[END]
i,can't,imagine,anybody,wanting,to,marry,aunt,eulalie,she,said,frankly,[END]
but,my,dear,she,was,a,lovely,girl,simply,lovely,[END]
she,came,to,visit,after,pauline,married,carey,smith,and,settled,in,charleston,[END]
the,house,they're,in,was,the,smith,town,house,their,plantation,was,over,on,the,wando,river,[END]
my,brother,kemper,was,smitten,at,once,[END]
everyone,expected,them,to,marry,[END]
then,he,was,thrown,from,his,horse,and,was,killed,[END]
eulalie's,considered,herself,a,widow,ever,since,[END]
aunt,eulalie,in,love,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,believe,it,[END]
i,was,sure,you,must,know,said,mrs,butler,[END]
she's,your,family,[END]
but,i,don't,have,any,family,scarlett,thought,not,the,way,miss,eleanor,means,[END]
not,close,and,caring,and,knowing,all,about,everybody's,heart,secrets,[END]
all,i,have,is,nasty,old,suellen,and,carreen,with,her,nun's,veil,and,her,vows,to,the,convent,[END]
suddenly,she,felt,very,lonely,despite,the,cheerful,faces,and,conversation,around,her,[END]
i,must,be,hungry,she,decided,that's,why,i,feel,like,bursting,into,tears,[END]
i,should,have,eaten,all,my,breakfast,[END]
she,was,doing,full,justice,to,dinner,when,manigo,came,in,and,spoke,quietly,to,rhett,[END]
excuse,me,rhett,said,it,seems,we've,got,a,yankee,officer,at,the,door,[END]
what,do,you,suppose,they're,up,to,now,[END]
scarlett,wondered,aloud,[END]
rhett,was,laughing,when,he,returned,a,moment,later,[END]
everything,but,a,white,flag,of,surrender,he,said,[END]
you've,won,mama,[END]
they're,inviting,all,the,men,to,come,to,the,guardhouse,and,take,back,the,guns,they,confiscated,[END]
rosemary,applauded,loudly,[END]
miss,eleanor,shushed,her,[END]
we,can't,take,too,much,credit,[END]
they,can't,risk,all,these,unprotected,houses,on,emancipation,day,[END]
she,went,on,to,answer,scarlett's,questioning,expression,[END]
new,year's,day,isn't,what,it,used,to,be,a,quiet,time,to,nurse,headaches,from,too,much,new,year's,eve,[END]
mr,lincoln,issued,the,emancipation,proclamation,on,a,january,first,so,now,it's,the,major,day,of,celebration,for,all,the,former,slaves,[END]
they,take,over,the,park,down,at,the,end,of,the,battery,and,shoot,off,firecrackers,and,pistols,all,day,and,all,night,while,they,get,drunker,and,drunker,[END]
we,lock,up,of,course,including,all,the,shutters,just,the,way,we,do,for,a,hurricane,[END]
but,it,helps,to,have,an,armed,man,in,the,house,too,[END]
scarlett,frowned,[END]
there,aren't,any,guns,in,the,house,[END]
there,will,be,said,rhett,[END]
plus,two,men,[END]
they're,coming,from,the,landing,just,for,the,occasion,[END]
and,when,will,you,be,going,[END]
eleanor,asked,rhett,[END]
on,the,thirtieth,[END]
i,have,an,appointment,with,julia,ashley,on,the,thirty-first,[END]
we,need,to,plan,our,united-front,strategy,[END]
rhett,was,leaving,[END]
going,to,his,wretched,smelly,old,plantation,[END]
he,wouldn't,be,here,to,kiss,her,on,new,year's,eve,[END]
now,scarlett,was,sure,she,was,going,to,cry,[END]
i'm,going,to,the,landing,with,you,said,rosemary,[END]
i,haven't,been,there,for,months,[END]
you,can't,go,to,the,landing,rosemary,[END]
rhett,was,carefully,patient,[END]
i'm,afraid,rhett's,right,dear,said,mrs,butler,[END]
he,can't,be,with,you,all,the,time,he's,got,too,much,business,to,take,care,of,[END]
and,you,cannot,be,in,the,house,or,any,place,else,with,only,that,child,you,have,for,a,maid,[END]
there's,too,much,coming,and,going,too,many,rough,people,[END]
i'll,take,your,celie,then,[END]
scarlett,will,let,you,borrow,pansy,to,help,you,dress,won't,you,scarlett,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
there,was,no,need,for,tears,[END]
i'll,go,with,you,rosemary,she,said,sweetly,[END]
pansy,too,[END]
new,year's,eve,would,come,to,the,plantation,too,[END]
without,a,ballroom,full,of,people,just,rhett,and,her,[END]
how,generous,of,you,scarlett,miss,eleanor,said,[END]
i,know,you'll,miss,going,to,the,balls,next,week,[END]
you're,luckier,than,you,deserve,rosemary,to,have,such,a,thoughtful,sister-in-law,[END]
i,don't,think,either,of,them,should,go,mama,i,won't,allow,it,said,rhett,[END]
rosemary,opened,her,mouth,to,protest,but,her,mother's,slightly,raised,hand,stopped,her,[END]
mrs,butler,spoke,quietly,you're,being,rather,inconsiderate,rhett,rosemary,loves,the,landing,as,much,as,you,do,and,she,doesn't,have,the,freedom,to,come,and,go,the,way,you,can,[END]
i,believe,you,should,take,her,especially,since,you're,also,going,to,julia,ashley's,[END]
she's,very,fond,of,your,sister,[END]
scarlett's,mind,was,racing,[END]
what,did,she,care,about,missing,some,dances,if,she,could,be,alone,with,rhett,[END]
she'd,get,rid,of,rosemary,somehow,maybe,this,miss,ashley,would,invite,her,to,stay,at,her,place,[END]
then,there,would,be,only,rhett,[END]
and,scarlett,[END]
she,remembered,him,in,her,room,when,she,was,at,the,landing,before,[END]
he'd,held,her,comforted,her,spoken,with,such,tenderness,[END]
just,wait,till,you,see,miss,julia's,plantation,scarlett,rosemary,said,loudly,[END]
it's,what,a,plantation,is,supposed,to,be,[END]
rhett,was,riding,ahead,of,them,pushing,aside,or,tearing,the,vines,of,honeysuckle,that,had,grown,across,the,trail,through,the,pinewoods,[END]
scarlett,followed,rosemary,uninterested,for,the,moment,in,what,rhett,was,doing,her,mind,busy,with,other,things,[END]
thank,goodness,this,old,horse,is,so,fat,and,lazy,[END]
i,haven't,ridden,horseback,for,so,long,that,anything,with,spirit,would,throw,me,for,sure,[END]
how,i,used,to,love,to,ride,[END]
back,then,[END]
when,the,stables,at,tara,were,full,[END]
pa,was,so,proud,of,his,horses,[END]
and,of,me,[END]
suellen,had,hands,like,anvils,she,could,ruin,the,mouth,of,an,alligator,[END]
and,carreen,was,afraid,even,of,her,pony,[END]
but,i,used,to,race,with,pa,hell,for,leather,on,the,roads,almost,winning,sometimes,[END]
katie,scarlett,he'd,say,you've,got,the,hands,of,an,angel,and,the,nerve,of,the,devil,himself,[END]
it's,the,o'hara,in,you,a,horse,will,always,recognize,an,irishman,and,give,his,best,for,him,[END]
darling,pa,[END]
tara's,woods,smelled,sharp,just,like,these,pine,prickling,in,my,nose,[END]
and,the,birds,singing,and,the,rustling,leaves,underfoot,and,the,peace,of,it,all,[END]
i,wonder,how,many,acres,rhett's,got,[END]
i'll,find,out,from,rosemary,[END]
she,probably,knows,right,down,to,the,square,inch,[END]
i,hope,this,miss,ashley,isn't,the,dragon,rhett,makes,her,out,to,be,[END]
what,was,it,rhett,said,[END]
she,looks,like,she,drinks,vinegar,[END]
he,is,funny,when,he's,nasty,as,long,as,it's,not,about,me,[END]
scarlett,[END]
catch,up,we're,almost,there,[END]
rosemary's,call,came,from,ahead,[END]
scarlett,flicked,the,neck,of,her,horse,with,her,crop,and,it,walked,marginally,faster,[END]
rhett,and,rosemary,were,already,out,of,the,wood,when,she,reached,them,[END]
at,first,all,she,could,see,was,rhett,sharp-edged,clear,in,the,bright,sunlight,[END]
how,handsome,he,is,and,how,well,he,sits,his,horse,not,a,sluggish,old,thing,like,mine,but,a,real,horse,with,plenty,of,fire,to,him,[END]
look,at,the,way,the,horse's,muscles,are,twitching,under,his,skin,yet,he's,still,as,a,statue,just,from,the,grip,of,rhett's,knees,and,his,hands,on,the,reins,[END]
his,hands,[END]
rosemary,gestured,catching,scarlett's,eye,directing,it,to,the,scene,ahead,and,scarlett,caught,her,breath,[END]
she,had,never,cared,about,architecture,never,noticed,it,[END]
even,the,magnificent,houses,that,made,charleston's,battery,world-famous,were,to,her,just,houses,[END]
however,there,was,something,about,the,severe,beauty,of,julia,ashley's,house,at,ashley,barony,that,she,recognized,as,different,from,anything,she'd,ever,known,and,grand,in,a,way,she,couldn't,define,[END]
it,sat,isolated,in,broad,stretches,of,grass,unadorned,with,garden,distant,from,the,ancient,huge,live,oak,trees,that,were,wide-spaced,sentinels,at,the,perimeter,of,the,lawn,[END]
square,made,of,brick,with,white-framed,door,and,windows,the,house,was,special,scarlett,whispered,[END]
no,wonder,that,it,alone,of,all,the,plantations,on,the,river,had,been,spared,the,torches,of,sherman's,army,[END]
even,the,yankees,wouldn't,dare,insult,the,mighty,presence,before,her,eyes,[END]
there,was,a,sound,of,laughter,followed,by,singing,[END]
scarlett,turned,her,head,[END]
the,house,awed,and,intimidated,her,[END]
far,to,her,left,she,saw,expanses,of,strong,insistent,green,completely,different,from,the,familiar,deep,rich,color,of,the,grass,[END]
dozens,of,black,men,and,women,were,working,and,singing,in,the,strange,green,[END]
why,they're,field,hands,tending,the,crop,of,whatever,it,is,[END]
so,many,of,them,too,[END]
her,mind,flew,to,the,cotton,fields,at,tara,that,had,once,stretched,as,far,as,she,could,see,just,as,this,strident,green,flowed,without,bounds,along,the,river,[END]
oh,yes,rosemary's,right,[END]
this,is,a,real,plantation,like,a,plantation's,meant,to,be,[END]
nothing,was,burned,nothing,was,changed,nothing,would,ever,change,[END]
time,itself,respected,the,majesty,of,ashley,barony,[END]
it's,good,of,you,to,meet,with,me,miss,ashley,said,rhett,[END]
he,bowed,over,the,hand,julia,ashley,held,out,to,him,the,back,of,his,ungloved,hand,supported,it,respectfully,and,his,lips,stopped,the,prescribed,inch,above,it,for,no,gentleman,would,commit,the,impertinence,of,actually,kissing,the,hand,of,a,maiden,lady,no,matter,how,advanced,her,years,[END]
it's,useful,to,us,both,mr,butler,julia,said,[END]
you're,miserably,ill-groomed,as,usual,rosemary,but,i'm,glad,to,see,you,[END]
introduce,your,sister-in-law,[END]
my,grief,she,really,is,a,dragon,scarlett,thought,nervously,[END]
i,wonder,if,she,expects,me,to,curtsey,[END]
this,is,scarlett,miss,julia,rosemary,said,smiling,[END]
she,didn't,seem,at,all,upset,by,the,older,woman's,criticism,[END]
how,do,you,do,mrs,[END]
butler,[END]
scarlett,was,sure,that,julia,ashley,didn't,care,to,know,how,she,did,at,all,[END]
how,do,you,do,she,replied,in,kind,[END]
she,inclined,her,head,in,a,slight,bow,the,degree,of,inclination,an,exact,replica,of,miss,ashley's,frigid,politeness,[END]
who,did,this,old,woman,think,she,was,anyhow,[END]
there,is,a,tea,tray,in,the,drawing,room,julia,said,[END]
you,may,pour,out,for,mrs,butler,rosemary,[END]
ring,if,you,need,more,hot,water,[END]
we'll,do,our,business,in,my,library,mr,butler,and,take,tea,afterwards,[END]
oh,miss,julia,can't,i,listen,while,you,and,rhett,talk,[END]
rosemary,begged,[END]
no,rosemary,you,may,not,[END]
and,that's,the,end,of,that,i,guess,scarlett,said,to,herself,[END]
julia,ashley,was,walking,away,with,rhett,obediently,following,behind,[END]
come,on,scarlett,the,drawing,room's,through,here,[END]
rosemary,opened,a,tall,door,and,gestured,to,scarlett,[END]
the,room,she,entered,was,a,surprise,to,scarlett,[END]
there,was,none,of,the,coldness,of,its,owner,about,it,and,nothing,intimidating,[END]
it,was,very,large,bigger,than,minnie,wentworth's,ballroom,[END]
but,the,floor,was,covered,with,an,old,persian,rug,with,a,background,of,faded,red,and,the,draperies,at,the,tall,windows,were,a,warm,soft,rose,color,[END]
a,bright,fire,crackled,in,the,wide,fireplace,sunlight,poured,through,the,sparkling,window,panes,onto,the,brightly,polished,silver,tea,service,onto,the,gold,and,blue,and,rose,velvet,upholstery,on,broad,comfortable,settees,and,winged,chairs,[END]
and,an,enormous,yellow,tabby,cat,was,sleeping,on,the,hearth,[END]
scarlett,shook,her,head,slightly,in,wonder,[END]
it,was,difficult,to,believe,that,this,cheerful,welcoming,room,had,any,connection,with,the,stiff-backed,woman,in,the,black,dress,she,had,met,outside,its,door,[END]
she,sat,next,to,rosemary,on,a,settee,[END]
tell,me,about,miss,ashley,she,said,avid,with,curiosity,[END]
miss,julia's,wonderful,[END]
rosemary,exclaimed,[END]
she,runs,ashley,barony,herself,she,says,she's,never,had,an,overseer,that,didn't,need,overseeing,[END]
and,she,has,practically,as,many,rice,fields,as,there,were,before,the,war,[END]
she,could,mine,phosphate,like,rhett,but,she,won't,have,anything,to,do,with,it,[END]
plantations,are,for,planting,she,says,not,for,rosemary's,voice,dropped,to,a,shocked,pleased,whisper,raping,the,land,to,get,what's,underneath,',[END]
she,keeps,it,all,the,way,it,was,[END]
there's,sugar,cane,and,a,press,to,make,her,own,molasses,and,a,blacksmith,to,shoe,the,mules,and,make,wheels,for,the,carts,and,a,cooper,to,make,barrels,for,the,rice,and,molasses,and,a,carpenter,for,fixing,things,a,tanner,to,make,harness,[END]
she,takes,her,rice,into,town,for,milling,and,she,buys,flour,and,coffee,and,tea,but,everything,else,comes,from,the,place,[END]
she's,got,cows,and,sheep,and,fowl,and,pigs,and,a,dairy,room,and,spring,house,and,smoke,house,and,storerooms,full,of,canned,vegetables,and,shelled,corn,and,preserved,fruit,from,the,summer,crops,[END]
she,makes,her,own,wine,too,[END]
rhett,claims,she's,even,got,a,still,out,in,the,pine,woods,she,gets,her,turpentine,from,[END]
does,she,still,have,slaves,[END]
scarlett's,words,were,sharply,sarcastic,[END]
the,days,of,the,great,plantations,were,over,and,there,was,no,bringing,them,back,[END]
oh,scarlett,you,sound,just,like,rhett,sometimes,[END]
i'd,like,to,shake,both,of,you,[END]
miss,julia,pays,wages,just,like,everybody,else,[END]
but,she,makes,the,plantation,earn,enough,to,pay,them,[END]
i'm,going,to,do,the,same,thing,at,the,landing,if,i,ever,get,the,chance,[END]
i,think,it's,horrible,that,rhett,won't,even,try,[END]
rosemary,began,to,clatter,cups,and,saucers,on,the,tea,tray,[END]
i,can't,remember,do,you,take,milk,or,lemon,scarlett,[END]
what,[END]
oh,milk,please,[END]
scarlett,had,no,interest,in,tea,[END]
she,was,reliving,the,fantasy,she'd,had,before,of,tara,brought,back,to,life,with,its,fields,studded,with,white,cotton,for,as,far,as,the,eye,could,see,and,its,barns,full,and,the,house,just,the,way,it,had,been,when,her,mother,was,alive,[END]
yes,there,was,some,of,the,long-forgotten,scent,of,lemon,oil,in,this,room,and,brass,polish,and,floor,wax,[END]
it,was,faint,but,she,was,sure,she,could,smell,it,in,spite,of,the,sharp,resinous,tang,of,the,pine,logs,in,the,fire,[END]
her,hand,automatically,accepted,the,cup,of,tea,that,rosemary,offered,and,held,it,letting,it,cool,while,she,daydreamed,[END]
why,not,make,tara,what,it,had,been,[END]
if,that,old,lady,can,run,this,plantation,i,can,run,tara,[END]
will,doesn't,know,what,tara,is,not,the,real,tara,the,best,plantation,in,clayton,county,[END]
a,two-mule,farm,he,calls,it,now,[END]
no,by,all,the,saints,tara's,much,much,more,than,that,[END]
i,could,do,it,too,i'll,bet,[END]
didn't,pa,say,a,hundred,times,that,i,was,a,true,o'hara,[END]
then,i,can,do,what,he,did,make,tara,into,what,he,made,it,[END]
maybe,even,better,[END]
i,know,how,to,keep,books,how,to,squeeze,out,a,profit,where,nobody,else,sees,the,possibilities,[END]
why,practically,all,the,places,around,tara,have,gone,back,to,scrub,pine,[END]
i'll,bet,i,could,buy,land,for,next,to,nothing,[END]
her,mind,leapt,from,one,picture,to,another,rich,fields,fat,cattle,her,old,bedroom,with,crisp,white,curtains,billowing,into,the,room,on,a,jasmine-scented,spring,breeze,riding,through,the,woods,cleared,of,underbrush,miles,of,chestnut-rail,fence,outlining,her,land,stretching,farther,and,farther,into,the,red-earth,countryside,[END]
she,had,to,set,the,vision,aside,[END]
reluctantly,she,focused,her,attention,on,rosemary's,insistent,loud,voice,[END]
rice,rice,rice,[END]
can't,rosemary,butler,ever,talk,about,anything,but,rice,[END]
what,can,rhett,possibly,find,to,talk,about,with,that,old,fright,miss,ashley,for,so,long,[END]
scarlett,shifted,position,again,on,the,settee,[END]
rhett's,sister,had,a,habit,of,leaning,toward,her,listener,when,she,was,excited,about,what,she,was,saying,[END]
rosemary,had,almost,driven,her,into,the,corner,of,the,long,settee,[END]
she,turned,eagerly,toward,the,door,when,it,opened,[END]
damn,rhett,anyhow,[END]
what,was,he,laughing,about,with,julia,ashley,[END]
he,might,think,it,was,amusing,to,leave,her,to,cool,her,heels,for,an,age,and,a,half,but,she,didn't,[END]
you,always,were,a,rogue,rhett,butler,julia,was,saying,but,i,don't,remember,that,you,included,impertinence,in,your,list,of,sins,[END]
miss,ashley,to,the,best,of,my,knowledge,impertinence,is,a,tag,attached,to,the,behavior,of,servants,toward,their,masters,and,young,people,toward,their,elders,[END]
while,i,am,in,all,things,your,obedient,servant,you,surely,cannot,be,suggesting,that,you,are,my,elder,[END]
contemporary,i'll,grant,with,pleasure,but,elder,is,out,of,the,question,[END]
why,he's,flirting,with,the,old,creature,[END]
i,guess,he,must,want,something,pretty,bad,if,he's,making,a,fool,of,himself,like,this,[END]
julia,ashley,made,a,sound,that,could,only,be,described,as,a,dignified,snort,[END]
very,well,then,she,said,i'll,agree,if,only,to,put,a,halt,to,this,absurdity,[END]
now,sit,down,and,stop,your,foolishness,[END]
rhett,moved,a,chair,closer,to,the,tea,table,and,bowed,ceremoniously,when,julia,seated,herself,in,it,[END]
thank,you,miss,julia,for,your,condescension,[END]
don't,be,such,an,ass,rhett,[END]
scarlett,frowned,at,both,of,them,[END]
was,that,all,[END]
all,that,to-do,about,changing,from,miss,ashley,and,mr,butler,to,rhett,and,miss,julia,[END]
rhett,was,an,ass,just,like,the,old,woman,said,[END]
but,miss,julia,was,mighty,close,to,acting,like,an,ass,herself,[END]
why,she,was,practically,simpering,at,rhett,[END]
it,was,nothing,short,of,disgusting,the,way,he,could,wrap,women,around,his,little,finger,[END]
a,maid,hurried,into,the,room,and,lifted,the,tray,of,tea,things,from,the,table,in,front,of,the,settee,[END]
she,was,followed,by,a,second,maid,who,quietly,moved,the,tea,table,to,a,place,in,front,of,julia,ashley,and,a,manservant,with,a,larger,silver,tray,holding,a,different,larger,silver,service,and,stands,of,fresh,sandwiches,and,cakes,[END]
scarlett,had,to,admit,it,no,matter,how,disagreeable,julia,ashley,might,be,the,old,woman,did,things,with,style,[END]
rhett,tells,me,you're,to,make,the,tour,rosemary,said,julia,[END]
yes,ma'am,[END]
i'm,so,excited,i,could,die,[END]
that,would,be,inconvenient,i,should,imagine,[END]
tell,me,have,you,begun,to,map,your,itinerary,[END]
not,really,miss,julia,[END]
i've,only,known,for,a,few,days,that,i,was,going,[END]
the,only,thing,i'm,certain,of,is,that,i,want,to,spend,as,long,as,possible,in,rome,[END]
you,must,be,sure,to,time,it,correctly,[END]
the,summer,heat,is,quite,intolerable,even,for,a,charlestonian,[END]
and,the,romans,all,abandon,the,city,for,the,mountains,or,the,sea,[END]
i,still,correspond,with,some,delightful,people,whom,you,would,enjoy,[END]
i'll,give,you,letters,of,introduction,of,course,[END]
if,i,might,suggest,[END]
oh,please,miss,julia,[END]
there's,so,much,i,want,to,know,[END]
scarlett,breathed,a,small,sigh,of,relief,[END]
she,didn't,put,it,past,rhett,to,tell,miss,ashley,about,the,mistake,she'd,made,thinking,that,the,only,rome,was,in,georgia,but,he'd,let,the,chance,go,by,[END]
now,he,was,putting,his,two,cents,in,talking,a,blue,streak,with,the,old,woman,about,all,the,people,with,strange,names,[END]
and,rosemary,lapping,it,all,up,[END]
the,conversation,interested,scarlett,not,at,all,[END]
but,she,wasn't,bored,[END]
she,watched,fascinated,every,move,that,julia,ashley,made,as,she,presided,at,the,tea,table,[END]
without,any,break,in,the,discussion,of,roman,antiquities,except,to,ask,scarlett,if,she,took,milk,or,lemon,and,how,many,lumps,of,sugar,julia,filled,cups,and,held,each,one,up,to,a,level,slightly,below,her,right,shoulder,for,one,of,the,maids,to,take,it,from,her,[END]
she,held,it,up,waited,no,longer,than,three,seconds,then,removed,her,hand,[END]
she,doesn't,even,look,[END]
scarlett,marvelled,[END]
if,the,maid,wasn't,there,or,wasn't,quick,enough,the,whole,thing,would,just,fall,on,the,floor,[END]
but,one,of,the,maids,was,always,there,and,the,cup,was,delivered,silently,to,the,correct,person,without,a,drop,spilled,[END]
where,did,he,come,from,[END]
scarlett,was,startled,when,the,manservant,appeared,at,her,side,offering,her,a,napkin,with,its,folds,shaken,out,and,the,three-tiered,stand,of,sandwiches,[END]
she,was,just,about,to,reach,out,and,take,one,when,the,man,produced,a,plate,which,he,held,near,her,hand,for,her,to,take,[END]
oh,i,see,there's,a,maid,handing,him,things,for,him,to,hand,to,me,[END]
mighty,complicated,for,a,fish-paste,sandwich,no,bigger,than,a,bite's,worth,[END]
but,she,was,impressed,by,the,elegance,of,it,all,even,more,impressed,when,the,man,held,an,elaborate,silver,pincer,in,his,whitegloved,hand,and,lifted,an,assortment,of,sandwiches,onto,her,plate,[END]
the,final,touch,was,the,small,table,with,a,lace-edged,cloth,on,it,that,the,second,maid,placed,beside,her,knees,just,when,she,was,wondering,how,she,was,going,to,manage,with,a,cup,and,saucer,in,one,hand,and,a,plate,in,the,other,[END]
despite,her,hunger,and,her,curiosity,about,the,sandwiches,what,kind,of,fancy,food,called,for,such,fancy,serving,scarlett,was,more,interested,in,the,silent,efficient,routine,of,the,servants,as,first,rosemary,and,then,rhett,were,provided,with,plate,sandwiches,table,[END]
it,was,almost,a,disappointment,when,miss,ashley,was,given,no,special,treatment,only,a,return,of,the,stand,to,the,table,in,front,of,her,[END]
fiddle-dee-dee,[END]
she's,even,unfolding,her,napkin,herself,[END]
it,was,a,definite,disappointment,when,she,bit,into,the,first,sandwich,and,it,was,only,bread,and,butter,even,though,the,butter,had,something,else,in,it,parsley,she,thought,no,something,stronger,maybe,chives,[END]
she,ate,contentedly,all,the,sandwiches,were,good,[END]
and,the,cakes,on,the,other,stand,looked,even,better,[END]
my,grief,[END]
they're,still,talking,about,rome,[END]
scarlett,glanced,toward,the,servants,[END]
they,were,standing,still,as,posts,along,the,wall,behind,miss,ashley,[END]
obviously,the,cakes,weren't,going,to,be,passed,any,time,soon,[END]
for,heaven's,sake,rosemary,had,only,eaten,one,half,of,one,sandwich,[END]
but,we're,being,inconsiderate,julia,ashley,said,[END]
mrs,butler,what,city,would,you,like,to,visit,[END]
or,do,you,share,rosemary's,conviction,that,all,roads,rightly,lead,to,rome,[END]
scarlett,put,on,her,best,smile,[END]
i'm,too,enchanted,by,charleston,to,even,think,about,going,any,place,else,miss,ashley,[END]
a,graceful,response,said,julia,although,it,does,rather,put,a,period,to,the,conversation,[END]
may,i,offer,you,some,tea,[END]
before,scarlett,could,accept,rhett,spoke,[END]
i'm,afraid,we,have,to,go,miss,julia,[END]
i,haven't,gotten,the,woods,trails,in,condition,yet,for,riding,in,the,dark,and,the,days,are,so,short,[END]
you,could,have,avenues,not,trails,if,you'd,put,your,men,to,work,on,the,land,instead,of,at,that,disgraceful,phosphate,mine,[END]
now,miss,julia,i,thought,we'd,reached,a,truce,[END]
so,we,did,[END]
and,i'll,honor,it,[END]
furthermore,i'll,admit,that,you,should,take,care,to,be,well,home,before,dusk,[END]
i've,been,indulging,myself,with,happy,memories,about,rome,and,i,haven't,watched,the,time,[END]
perhaps,rosemary,might,stay,the,night,with,me,[END]
i'd,see,her,to,the,landing,tomorrow,morning,[END]
oh,yes,[END]
thought,scarlett,[END]
unfortunately,that,won't,do,rhett,said,[END]
i,might,have,to,go,out,tonight,and,i,don't,want,scarlett,at,the,house,with,no,one,she,knows,except,her,georgia,maid,[END]
i,don't,mind,rhett,scarlett,said,loudly,truly,i,don't,[END]
do,you,think,i'm,some,kind,of,sissy,who's,afraid,of,the,dark,[END]
you're,quite,right,rhett,said,julia,ashley,[END]
and,you,should,cultivate,some,caution,mrs,butler,[END]
these,are,uncertain,times,[END]
julia's,tone,was,decisive,[END]
so,was,her,abrupt,movement,[END]
she,stood,and,walked,toward,the,door,[END]
i'll,see,you,out,then,[END]
hector,will,have,your,horses,brought,around,[END]
23,[END]
there,were,several,large,groups,of,angry-looking,black,men,and,one,small,group,of,black,women,in,the,horseshoe-shaped,grass,area,behind,the,house,at,the,landing,[END]
rhett,helped,scarlett,and,rosemary,step,down,from,the,mounting,block,near,the,makeshift,stables,and,held,on,to,their,elbows,while,the,stableboy,gathered,the,reins,and,led,the,horses,away,[END]
when,the,boy,was,out,of,earshot,rhett,spoke,with,hushed,urgency,[END]
i'm,going,to,walk,you,around,to,the,front,of,the,house,[END]
go,inside,and,straight,upstairs,to,one,of,the,bedrooms,[END]
close,the,door,and,stay,in,there,until,i,come,for,you,[END]
i'll,send,pansy,up,[END]
keep,her,with,you,[END]
what's,going,on,rhett,[END]
scarlett's,voice,had,a,quaver,in,it,[END]
i'll,tell,you,later,there's,no,time,now,[END]
just,do,as,i,say,[END]
he,kept,hold,of,the,two,women,forcing,them,to,match,his,purposeful,but,unhurried,pace,to,the,house,and,around,its,side,[END]
mist',butler,[END]
shouted,one,of,the,men,[END]
a,half,dozen,others,followed,him,as,he,started,to,walk,towards,rhett,[END]
this,isn't,good,thought,scarlett,calling,him,mr,butler,instead,of,mr,rhett,[END]
it's,not,friendly,at,all,and,there,must,be,close,to,fifty,of,them,[END]
stay,where,you,are,rhett,shouted,back,[END]
i'll,be,back,to,talk,to,you,as,soon,as,i,get,the,ladies,settled,[END]
rosemary,stumbled,on,a,loose,stone,in,the,path,and,rhett,jerked,her,upright,before,she,could,fall,[END]
i,don't,care,if,your,leg's,broken,he,muttered,keep,walking,[END]
i'm,all,right,rosemary,said,[END]
she,sounds,cool,as,ice,thought,scarlett,[END]
she,despised,herself,for,feeling,so,nervous,[END]
thank,goodness,they,were,almost,at,the,house,now,[END]
only,a,few,more,steps,and,they'd,be,around,it,[END]
she,was,unaware,that,she,was,holding,her,breath,until,they,neared,the,house,front,[END]
when,she,saw,the,green,terraces,that,stepped,down,to,the,butterfly,lakes,and,the,river,she,let,her,breath,out,in,a,whoosh,of,release,[END]
then,she,drew,it,in,sharply,[END]
as,they,turned,the,corner,onto,the,brick,terrace,she,saw,ten,white,men,sitting,on,it,leaning,back,against,the,house,wall,[END]
they,were,all,of,them,thin,lanky,their,pale,bare,ankles,showing,between,their,clumsy,heavy,shoes,and,the,bottoms,of,their,faded,overalls,[END]
across,their,knees,they,held,rifles,or,shotguns,in,a,loose,accustomed,grip,[END]
battered,wide-brimmed,hats,pulled,low,on,their,foreheads,shadowed,their,eyes,but,scarlett,knew,they,were,looking,at,rhett,and,his,women,[END]
one,of,them,expelled,a,stream,of,brown,tobacco,juice,across,the,lawn,in,front,of,rhett's,fine,riding,boots,[END]
you,can,thank,god,you,didn't,spatter,my,sister,clinch,dawkins,rhett,said,or,i'd,have,had,to,kill,you,[END]
i'll,talk,to,you,boys,in,a,few,minutes,i've,got,other,things,to,do,right,now,[END]
he,spoke,easily,casually,[END]
but,scarlett,could,feel,the,tension,in,his,hand,holding,her,arm,[END]
she,lifted,her,chin,and,walked,with,firm,strong,steps,to,match,rhett's,[END]
no,poor,white,trash,was,going,to,face,rhett,down,or,her,either,[END]
she,blinked,in,the,sudden,darkness,when,she,entered,the,house,[END]
what,a,stink,[END]
her,eyes,adjusted,rapidly,and,scarlett,saw,the,reason,for,the,benches,and,spittoons,in,the,main,room,downstairs,[END]
more,weathered,hungry-looking,poor,whites,were,sprawled,on,the,seats,filling,every,inch,of,space,[END]
they,too,were,armed,and,their,hat,brims,made,their,eyes,a,secret,[END]
the,floor,was,spotted,with,spit,and,pools,of,juice,ringed,the,spittoons,[END]
scarlett,pulled,her,arm,from,rhett's,hold,gathered,up,her,skirts,to,the,top,of,her,ankles,and,walked,to,the,staircase,[END]
two,steps,up,she,dropped,them,again,letting,the,train,of,her,riding,habit,drag,through,the,dust,[END]
she'd,be,damned,if,she'd,treat,that,rabble,to,a,look,at,a,lady's,ankle,[END]
she,mounted,the,rickety,staircase,as,if,she,hadn't,a,care,in,the,world,[END]
what's,happening,miss,scarlett,[END]
ain't,nobody,will,tell,me,nothing,[END]
pansy,started,wailing,the,moment,the,bedroom,door,closed,behind,her,[END]
hush,up,[END]
scarlett,ordered,[END]
do,you,want,everybody,in,south,carolina,to,hear,you,[END]
i,don't,want,to,have,nothing,to,do,with,nobody,in,south,carolina,miss,scarlett,[END]
i,want,to,go,back,to,atlanta,to,my,own,folks,[END]
i,don't,like,this,place,[END]
nobody,cares,two,pins,what,you,like,and,don't,like,so,you,just,march,yourself,over,to,that,corner,and,sit,on,that,stool,and,keep,quiet,[END]
if,i,hear,one,peep,out,of,you,i'll,[END]
i'll,do,something,terrible,[END]
she,looked,at,rosemary,[END]
if,rhett's,sister,broke,down,too,she,didn't,know,what,she'd,do,[END]
rosemary,looked,very,pale,but,she,seemed,composed,enough,[END]
she,was,sitting,on,the,edge,of,the,bed,looking,at,the,pattern,of,the,coverlet,as,if,she'd,never,seen,one,before,[END]
scarlett,walked,to,the,window,that,overlooked,the,back,lawn,[END]
if,she,stayed,to,one,side,of,it,no,one,below,could,see,her,looking,out,[END]
she,lifted,the,muslin,curtain,with,cautious,fingers,and,peered,out,[END]
was,rhett,out,there,[END]
dear,god,he,was,[END]
she,could,just,make,out,the,top,of,his,hat,a,dark,circle,in,the,middle,of,a,big,crowd,of,dark,heads,and,gesticulating,dark,hands,[END]
the,separate,groups,of,black,men,had,come,together,in,one,threatening,mass,[END]
they,could,stomp,him,to,death,in,half,a,minute,flat,she,thought,and,there's,nothing,i,can,do,to,stop,it,[END]
her,hand,crumpled,the,thin,curtain,in,anger,at,her,helplessness,[END]
better,get,away,from,that,window,scarlett,said,rosemary,[END]
if,rhett,starts,worrying,about,you,and,me,he'll,be,distracted,from,whatever,it,is,he,has,to,do,[END]
scarlett,whirled,to,the,attack,[END]
don't,you,care,what's,happening,[END]
i,care,plenty,but,i,don't,know,what's,happening,[END]
and,neither,do,you,[END]
i,know,that,rhett's,about,to,be,swamped,by,a,bunch,of,raging,darkies,[END]
why,don't,those,trashy,tobacco,spitters,use,the,guns,they're,sitting,around,with,[END]
then,we'd,really,be,in,a,fix,[END]
i,know,some,of,the,black,men,they,work,at,the,phosphate,mine,[END]
they,don't,want,anything,to,happen,to,rhett,or,they'd,lose,their,jobs,[END]
besides,plenty,of,them,are,butler,people,[END]
they,belong,here,[END]
it's,the,whites,i'm,scared,of,[END]
i,expect,rhett,is,too,[END]
rhett's,not,scared,of,anything,[END]
of,course,he,is,[END]
he'd,be,a,fool,if,he,wasn't,[END]
i'm,plenty,scared,and,so,are,you,[END]
i,am,not,[END]
then,you're,a,fool,[END]
scarlett's,jaw,dropped,[END]
the,whiplash,in,rosemary's,voice,shocked,her,more,than,the,insult,[END]
why,she,sounds,just,like,julia,ashley,[END]
a,half,hour,with,that,old,she-dragon,and,rosemary's,turned,into,a,monster,[END]
she,turned,hurriedly,to,the,window,again,[END]
it,was,beginning,to,get,dark,[END]
what,was,happening,[END]
she,couldn't,see,a,thing,[END]
only,dark,shapes,on,the,dark,ground,[END]
was,rhett,one,of,them,[END]
she,couldn't,tell,[END]
she,put,her,ear,against,the,windowpane,and,strained,to,hear,[END]
the,only,sound,was,a,muffled,whimpering,from,pansy,[END]
if,i,don't,do,something,i'll,go,mad,she,thought,and,she,began,to,pace,back,and,forth,across,the,small,room,[END]
why,does,a,big,plantation,like,this,have,such,cramped,little,bedrooms,[END]
she,complained,[END]
you,could,fit,two,rooms,like,this,into,any,one,of,the,rooms,at,tara,[END]
do,you,really,want,to,know,[END]
then,sit,down,[END]
there's,a,rocker,over,by,the,other,window,[END]
you,can,rock,instead,of,walking,[END]
i'll,light,the,lamp,and,i'll,tell,you,all,about,dunmore,landing,if,you'd,like,to,hear,[END]
i,can't,bear,to,sit,still,[END]
i'm,going,down,there,and,find,out,what's,going,on,[END]
scarlett,groped,in,the,darkness,for,the,doorknob,[END]
if,you,do,he'll,never,forgive,you,said,rosemary,[END]
scarlett's,hand,fell,to,her,side,[END]
the,match,striking,was,as,loud,as,a,pistol,shot,[END]
scarlett,felt,the,nerves,jump,under,her,skin,[END]
then,she,turned,surprised,to,see,that,rosemary,looked,just,the,same,as,always,[END]
she,was,in,the,same,place,too,sitting,on,the,edge,of,the,bed,[END]
the,kerosene,lamp,made,the,random,colors,of,the,coverlet,look,very,bright,[END]
scarlett,hesitated,for,a,moment,[END]
then,she,walked,to,the,rocking,chair,and,plopped,down,into,it,[END]
all,right,[END]
tell,me,about,dunmore,landing,[END]
she,began,to,rock,with,an,angry,push,of,her,feet,[END]
the,chair,squeaked,as,rosemary,talked,about,the,plantation,that,meant,so,much,to,her,[END]
scarlett,rocked,with,vicious,pleasure,[END]
the,house,they,were,in,rosemary,began,had,small,bedrooms,because,it,was,built,as,quarters,for,bachelor,guests,only,[END]
above,the,floor,they,were,on,was,another,floor,of,small,rooms,for,the,guests',manservants,[END]
the,rooms,downstairs,where,rhett's,office,and,the,dining,room,were,now,had,been,used,as,guest,rooms,also,a,place,for,late-night,toddies,and,card,games,and,sociability,[END]
all,the,chairs,were,red,leather,rosemary,said,softly,[END]
i,used,to,love,to,go,in,there,and,sniff,the,leather,and,whiskey,and,cigar,smoke,smell,when,all,the,men,were,out,hunting,[END]
the,landing's,named,after,the,place,the,butlers,lived,before,our,great-great-grandfather,left,england,for,barbados,[END]
our,great-grandfather,came,to,charleston,from,there,around,a,hundred,and,fifty,years,ago,[END]
he,built,the,landing,and,put,in,the,gardens,[END]
his,wife's,name,before,she,married,great-grandfather,was,sophia,rosemary,ross,[END]
that's,where,ross,and,i,get,our,names,from,[END]
where'd,rhett,get,his,name,[END]
he's,named,after,our,grandfather,[END]
rhett,told,me,your,grandfather,was,a,pirate,[END]
he,did,[END]
rosemary,laughed,[END]
he,would,say,that,[END]
granddaddy,ran,the,english,blockade,in,the,revolution,just,like,rhett,ran,the,yankee,blockade,in,our,war,[END]
he,was,bound,and,determined,to,get,his,rice,crop,out,and,he,wouldn't,let,anything,stop,him,[END]
i,imagine,he,did,some,pretty,sharp,trading,on,the,side,but,mainly,he,was,a,rice,planter,[END]
dunmore,landing,has,always,been,a,rice,plantation,[END]
that's,why,i,get,so,mad,at,rhett,[END]
scarlett,rocked,faster,[END]
if,she,starts,going,on,about,rice,again,i'll,scream,[END]
the,loud,double,report,of,a,shotgun,crashed,through,the,night,and,scarlett,did,scream,[END]
she,jumped,up,from,the,chair,and,ran,toward,the,door,[END]
rosemary,leapt,up,and,ran,after,her,[END]
she,threw,her,strong,arms,around,scarlett's,middle,and,held,her,back,[END]
let,me,go,rhett,might,be,scarlett,croaked,[END]
rosemary,was,squeezing,the,breath,out,of,her,[END]
rosemary's,arms,tightened,[END]
scarlett,struggled,to,get,free,[END]
she,heard,her,own,strangled,breath,loud,in,her,ears,and,strangely,more,distinct,the,creak,creak,creak,of,the,rocker,slowing,even,as,her,breath,was,slowing,[END]
the,lighted,room,seemed,to,be,turning,dark,[END]
her,flailing,hands,fluttered,weakly,and,her,straining,throat,made,a,faint,rasping,noise,[END]
rosemary,let,her,go,[END]
i'm,sorry,scarlett,thought,she,heard,rosemary,say,[END]
it,didn't,matter,[END]
the,only,thing,that,mattered,was,to,draw,great,gulps,of,air,into,her,lungs,[END]
it,even,made,no,difference,that,she'd,fallen,onto,her,hands,and,knees,[END]
it,was,easier,to,breathe,that,way,[END]
it,was,a,long,time,before,she,could,speak,[END]
she,looked,up,then,saw,rosemary,standing,with,her,back,against,the,door,[END]
you,almost,killed,me,scarlett,said,[END]
i'm,sorry,[END]
i,didn't,mean,to,hurt,you,[END]
i,had,to,stop,you,[END]
why,[END]
i,was,going,to,rhett,[END]
i've,got,to,go,to,rhett,[END]
he,meant,more,to,her,than,all,the,world,[END]
couldn't,this,stupid,girl,understand,that,[END]
no,she,couldn't,she'd,never,loved,anybody,never,had,anybody,love,her,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,scrabble,to,her,feet,[END]
oh,sweet,mary,mother,of,god,i'm,so,weak,[END]
her,hands,found,the,bedpost,[END]
slowly,she,pulled,herself,upright,[END]
she,was,as,white,as,a,ghost,her,green,eyes,blazed,like,cold,flames,[END]
i'm,going,to,rhett,she,said,[END]
rosemary,struck,her,then,[END]
not,with,her,hands,or,even,her,fists,[END]
scarlett,could,have,withstood,that,[END]
he,doesn't,want,you,rosemary,said,quietly,[END]
he,told,me,so,[END]
24,[END]
rhett,paused,in,mid-sentence,[END]
he,looked,at,scarlett,and,said,what,is,this,[END]
no,appetite,[END]
and,they,say,that,country,air,is,supposed,to,make,people,hungry,[END]
you,astonish,me,my,dear,[END]
i,do,believe,this,is,the,first,time,i've,ever,seen,you,peck,at,your,food,[END]
she,looked,up,from,her,untouched,plate,to,glare,at,him,[END]
how,did,he,even,dare,to,speak,to,her,when,he,had,been,talking,about,her,behind,her,back,[END]
who,else,had,he,talked,to,besides,rosemary,[END]
did,everybody,in,charleston,know,that,he,had,walked,out,in,atlanta,and,that,she'd,made,a,fool,of,herself,by,coming,after,him,[END]
she,looked,down,and,continued,to,push,bits,of,food,from,place,to,place,[END]
so,then,what,happened,[END]
rosemary,demanded,[END]
i,still,don't,understand,[END]
it,was,just,what,miss,julia,and,i,expected,[END]
her,field,hands,and,my,phosphate,diggers,had,cooked,up,a,plot,[END]
you,know,that,work,contracts,are,signed,on,new,year's,day,for,the,year,to,follow,[END]
miss,julia's,men,were,going,to,tell,her,that,i,paid,my,miners,almost,twice,what,she,paid,and,that,she'd,have,to,jack,up,their,salaries,or,they'd,come,to,me,[END]
my,men,were,going,to,play,the,same,game,only,the,other,way,around,[END]
it,never,entered,their,heads,that,miss,julia,and,i,were,on,to,them,[END]
the,grapevine,started,humming,the,minute,we,rode,over,to,ashley,barony,[END]
all,of,them,knew,the,game,was,up,[END]
you,saw,how,industrious,all,the,barony,workers,were,in,the,rice,fields,[END]

things,weren't,quite,that,smooth,here,[END]
word,had,gotten,out,that,the,landing,blacks,were,scheming,something,and,the,white,sharecroppers,across,the,summerville,road,got,edgy,[END]
they,did,what,poor,whites,always,do,grabbed,their,guns,and,got,ready,for,a,little,shooting,[END]
they,came,to,the,house,and,broke,in,and,stole,my,whiskey,then,passed,the,bottle,around,to,get,up,a,good,head,of,steam,[END]
after,you,were,safely,out,of,range,i,told,them,i'd,take,care,of,my,business,myself,and,i,high-tailed,it,out,to,the,back,of,the,house,[END]
the,blacks,were,scared,as,well,they,might,be,but,i,persuaded,them,that,i,could,calm,the,whites,down,and,that,they,should,go,home,[END]
when,i,got,back,to,the,house,i,told,the,sharecroppers,that,i'd,settled,everything,with,the,workers,and,they,should,go,on,home,too,[END]
i,probably,gave,it,to,them,too,fast,[END]
i,was,so,relieved,myself,that,there,hadn't,been,any,trouble,that,it,made,me,careless,[END]
i'll,be,smarter,next,time,[END]
if,god,forbid,there,is,a,next,time,[END]
anyhow,clinch,dawkins,flew,off,the,handle,[END]
he,was,looking,for,trouble,[END]
he,called,me,a,nigger,lover,and,cocked,that,cannon,of,a,shotgun,he's,got,and,turned,it,in,my,direction,[END]
i,didn't,wait,to,find,out,if,he,was,drunk,enough,to,shoot,i,just,stepped,over,and,knocked,it,up,[END]
the,sky,got,a,couple,of,holes,in,it,[END]
is,that,all,[END]
scarlett,half-shouted,[END]
you,could,have,let,us,know,[END]
i,was,too,busy,my,pet,[END]
clinch's,pride,was,wounded,so,he,pulled,a,knife,[END]
i,pulled,mine,and,we,had,an,active,ten,minutes,or,so,before,i,cut,off,his,nose,[END]
rosemary,gasped,[END]
rhett,patted,her,hand,[END]
only,the,end,of,it,[END]
it,was,too,long,anyhow,[END]
his,looks,are,significantly,improved,[END]
but,rhett,he'll,come,after,you,[END]
rhett,shook,his,head,[END]
no,i,can,assure,you,he,won't,[END]
it,was,a,fair,fight,[END]
and,clinch,is,one,of,my,oldest,companions,[END]
we,were,in,the,confederate,army,together,[END]
he,was,loader,for,the,cannon,i,commanded,[END]
there's,a,bond,between,us,that,a,small,slice,of,nose,can't,damage,[END]
i,wish,he'd,killed,you,said,scarlett,distinctly,[END]
i'm,tired,and,i'm,going,to,bed,[END]
she,pushed,her,chair,back,and,walked,with,a,dignified,tread,from,the,room,[END]
rhett's,words,deliberately,drawled,followed,her,[END]
no,greater,blessing,can,be,granted,a,man,than,the,devotion,of,a,loving,wife,[END]
scarlett's,heart,grew,hot,with,anger,[END]
i,hope,clinch,dawkins,is,outside,this,house,right,this,minute,she,muttered,just,waiting,for,a,clean,shot,[END]
for,that,matter,she,wouldn't,exactly,cry,her,eyes,out,if,the,second,barrel,got,rosemary,[END]
rosemary,lifted,her,wine,glass,to,rhett,in,a,salute,[END]
all,right,now,i,know,why,you,said,supper,was,a,celebration,[END]
i,for,one,am,celebrating,this,day,being,over,[END]
is,scarlett,sick,[END]
rhett,asked,his,sister,[END]
i,was,only,half-joking,about,her,appetite,[END]
it's,not,like,her,not,to,eat,[END]
she's,upset,[END]
i've,seen,her,upset,more,times,than,you,can,count,and,she's,eaten,like,a,longshoreman,every,time,[END]
this,isn't,just,her,temper,rhett,[END]
while,you,were,chopping,noses,scarlett,and,i,had,a,wrestling,match,ourselves,[END]
rosemary,described,scarlett's,panic,and,her,determination,to,go,to,him,[END]
i,didn't,know,how,dangerous,things,might,be,downstairs,so,i,held,her,back,[END]
i,hope,i,did,right,[END]
you,did,absolutely,right,[END]
anything,could,have,happened,[END]
i'm,afraid,i,held,a,little,too,tight,rosemary,confessed,[END]
she,almost,passed,out,she,couldn't,breathe,[END]
rhett,threw,his,head,back,and,laughed,[END]
by,god,i,wish,i'd,seen,that,[END]
scarlett,o'hara,pinned,to,the,mat,by,a,girl,[END]
there,must,be,a,hundred,women,in,georgia,who,would,have,clapped,the,skin,off,their,hands,applauding,you,[END]
rosemary,considered,confessing,the,rest,[END]
she,realized,that,what,she'd,said,to,scarlett,had,hurt,her,more,than,the,fight,[END]
she,decided,not,to,[END]
rhett,was,still,chuckling,no,sense,in,dimming,his,good,mood,[END]
scarlett,woke,before,dawn,[END]
she,lay,motionless,in,the,dark,room,afraid,to,move,[END]
breathe,like,you're,still,asleep,she,told,herself,you,wouldn't,wake,up,in,the,middle,of,the,night,unless,there'd,been,a,noise,or,something,[END]
she,listened,for,what,seemed,like,an,eternity,but,the,silence,was,heavy,and,unbroken,[END]
when,she,realized,that,it,was,hunger,that,had,wakened,her,she,almost,cried,with,relief,[END]
of,course,she,was,hungry,[END]
she'd,had,nothing,to,eat,since,breakfast,the,day,before,except,for,a,few,tea,sandwiches,at,ashley,barony,[END]
the,night,air,was,too,cold,for,her,to,wear,the,elegant,silk,dressing,gown,she'd,brought,with,her,[END]
she,wrapped,herself,in,the,coverlet,from,the,bed,[END]
it,was,heavy,wool,and,still,held,in,it,the,warmth,of,her,body,[END]
it,trailed,awkwardly,around,her,bare,feet,as,she,crept,quietly,through,the,dark,hallway,and,down,the,stairs,[END]
thank,goodness,the,banked,fire,in,the,great,fireplace,gave,out,some,heat,still,and,enough,light,for,her,to,see,the,door,to,the,dining,room,and,the,kitchen,beyond,[END]
she,didn't,care,what,she,might,find,even,cold,rice,and,stew,would,be,all,right,[END]
with,one,hand,holding,the,dark,coverlet,around,her,she,groped,for,the,doorknob,[END]
was,it,to,the,left,or,the,right,[END]
she,hadn't,noticed,[END]
stop,right,there,or,i'll,blow,a,hole,through,your,middle,[END]
rhett's,harsh,voice,made,her,jump,[END]
the,blanket,fell,away,and,cold,air,assaulted,her,[END]
great,balls,of,fire,[END]
scarlett,turned,on,him,and,bent,to,gather,up,the,folds,of,wool,[END]
didn't,i,have,enough,to,scare,me,witless,yesterday,[END]
do,you,have,to,start,up,again,[END]
you,nearly,made,me,jump,out,of,my,skin,[END]
what,are,you,doing,wandering,around,at,this,hour,scarlett,[END]
i,could,have,shot,you,[END]
what,are,you,doing,skulking,around,scaring,people,[END]
scarlett,draped,the,coverlet,around,her,shoulders,as,if,it,were,an,imperial,robe,of,ermine,[END]
i'm,going,to,the,kitchen,to,get,some,breakfast,she,said,with,all,the,dignity,she,could,muster,[END]
rhett,smiled,at,the,absurdly,haughty,figure,she,cut,[END]
i'll,make,up,the,fire,in,the,stove,he,said,[END]
i,was,thinking,of,some,coffee,myself,[END]
it's,your,house,[END]
i,reckon,you,can,have,coffee,if,you,want,some,[END]
scarlett,kicked,the,trailing,coverlet,behind,her,as,if,it,were,the,train,on,a,ball,gown,[END]
well,[END]
aren't,you,going,to,open,the,door,for,me,[END]
rhett,threw,some,logs,into,the,fireplace,[END]
the,hot,coals,touched,off,a,flare,of,dried,leaves,on,one,branch,of,wood,[END]
he,quickly,sobered,the,expression,on,his,face,before,scarlett,could,see,it,[END]
he,opened,the,door,to,the,dining,room,and,stepped,back,[END]
scarlett,swept,past,him,but,had,to,stop,almost,at,once,[END]
the,room,was,completely,dark,[END]
if,you'll,allow,me,rhett,struck,a,match,[END]
he,touched,it,to,the,lamp,above,the,table,then,carefully,adjusted,the,flame,[END]
scarlett,could,hear,the,laughter,in,his,voice,but,somehow,it,didn't,make,her,angry,[END]
i'm,so,hungry,i,could,eat,a,horse,she,admitted,[END]
not,a,horse,please,rhett,laughed,[END]
i've,only,got,three,and,two,of,them,are,no,damn,good,[END]
he,settled,the,glass,chimney,on,the,lamp,and,smiled,down,at,her,[END]
how,about,some,eggs,and,a,slice,of,ham,[END]
two,slices,said,scarlett,[END]
she,followed,him,into,the,kitchen,and,sat,on,a,bench,by,the,table,with,her,feet,tucked,up,under,the,blanket,while,he,lit,a,fire,in,the,big,iron,stove,[END]
when,the,pine,kindling,was,crackling,she,stretched,her,feet,out,to,the,warmth,[END]
rhett,brought,a,half-eaten,ham,and,bowls,of,butter,and,eggs,from,the,pantry,[END]
the,coffee,grinder's,on,the,table,behind,you,he,said,[END]
the,beans,are,in,that,can,[END]
if,you'll,grind,some,while,i,slice,the,ham,breakfast,will,be,ready,that,much,sooner,[END]
why,don't,you,grind,them,while,i,cook,the,eggs,[END]
because,the,stove's,not,hot,yet,miss,greedy,[END]
there's,a,pan,of,cold,corn,bread,next,to,the,grinder,[END]
that,should,tide,you,over,[END]
i'll,do,the,cooking,[END]
scarlett,swivelled,around,[END]
the,pan,under,the,napkin,had,four,squares,of,corn,bread,left,in,it,[END]
she,dropped,her,wrap,to,reach,for,a,piece,[END]
while,she,was,chewing,she,put,a,handful,of,coffee,beans,into,the,grinder,[END]
then,she,alternated,taking,bites,of,corn,bread,with,turning,the,handle,[END]
when,the,corn,bread,was,almost,gone,she,heard,the,sizzle,as,rhett,dropped,ham,slices,into,a,skillet,[END]
that,smells,like,heaven,she,said,happily,[END]
she,finished,grinding,the,coffee,with,a,spurt,of,rapid,cranks,[END]
where's,the,coffee,pot,[END]
she,turned,saw,rhett,and,began,to,laugh,[END]
he,had,a,dishtowel,tucked,into,the,waistband,of,his,trousers,and,a,long,fork,in,one,hand,[END]
he,waved,the,fork,in,the,direction,of,a,shelf,by,the,door,[END]
what's,so,funny,[END]
you,[END]
dodging,the,fat,spatters,[END]
cover,the,stove,hole,or,you'll,set,the,whole,pan,on,fire,[END]
i,should,have,known,you,wouldn't,know,what,to,do,[END]
nonsense,madam,[END]
i,prefer,the,adventure,of,the,open,flame,[END]
it,takes,me,back,to,the,delightful,days,of,frying,fresh,buffalo,steaks,at,a,campfire,[END]
but,he,slid,the,skillet,to,one,side,of,the,opening,in,the,stove,top,[END]
did,you,really,eat,buffalo,[END]
in,california,[END]
buffalo,and,goat,and,mule,and,the,meat,off,the,dead,body,of,the,person,who,didn't,make,the,coffee,when,i,wanted,it,[END]
scarlett,giggled,[END]
she,ran,across,the,cold,stone,floor,to,get,the,pot,[END]
they,ate,silently,at,the,kitchen,table,both,concentrating,hungrily,on,the,food,[END]
it,was,warm,and,friendly,in,the,dark,room,[END]
an,open,door,on,the,stove,gave,an,uneven,reddish,light,[END]
the,smell,of,coffee,brewing,on,the,stove,was,dark,and,sweet,[END]
scarlett,wanted,the,breakfast,to,last,forever,[END]
rosemary,must,have,lied,[END]
rhett,couldn't,have,told,her,he,didn't,want,me,[END]
rhett,[END]
hmm,[END]
he,was,pouring,the,coffee,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,ask,him,if,the,comfort,and,laughter,could,last,but,she,was,afraid,it,would,ruin,everything,[END]
is,there,any,cream,[END]
she,asked,instead,[END]
in,the,pantry,[END]
i'll,get,it,[END]
keep,your,feet,warm,by,the,stove,[END]
he,was,gone,only,a,few,seconds,[END]
while,she,stirred,sugar,and,cream,into,her,coflee,she,stirred,up,her,nerve,[END]
rhett,[END]
yes,[END]
scarlett's,words,tumbled,out,in,a,burst,quickly,so,that,he,couldn't,stop,her,[END]
rhett,can't,we,have,good,times,like,this,forever,[END]
this,is,a,good,time,you,know,it,is,[END]
why,do,you,have,to,keep,acting,as,though,you,hate,me,[END]
rhett,sighed,[END]
scarlett,he,said,wearily,any,animal,will,attack,if,it's,cornered,[END]
instinct,is,stronger,than,reason,stronger,than,will,[END]
when,you,came,to,charleston,you,were,backing,me,into,a,corner,[END]
crowding,me,[END]
you're,doing,it,now,[END]
you,can't,leave,well,enough,alone,[END]
i,want,to,be,decent,[END]
but,you,won't,let,me,[END]
i,will,i,will,let,you,[END]
i,want,you,to,be,[END]
you,don't,want,kindness,scarlett,you,want,love,[END]
unquestioning,undemanding,unequivocal,love,[END]
i,gave,you,that,once,when,you,didn't,want,it,[END]
i,used,it,all,up,scarlett,[END]
rhett's,tone,was,growing,colder,edged,with,harsh,impatience,[END]
scarlett,shrank,away,from,it,unconsciously,touching,the,bench,at,her,side,trying,to,find,the,warmth,of,the,discarded,coverlet,[END]
let,me,put,it,in,your,terms,scarlett,[END]
i,had,in,my,heart,a,thousand,dollars',worth,of,love,[END]
it,was,in,gold,not,greenbacks,[END]
and,i,spent,it,on,you,every,penny,of,it,[END]
as,far,as,love,is,concerned,i'm,bankrupt,[END]
you've,wrung,me,dry,[END]
i,was,wrong,rhett,and,i'm,sorry,[END]
i'm,trying,to,make,up,for,it,[END]
scarlett's,mind,was,racing,frantically,[END]
i,can,give,him,my,heart's,thousand,dollars',worth,of,love,she,thought,[END]
two,thousand,five,twenty,a,thousand,thousand,[END]
then,he'll,be,able,to,love,me,because,he,won't,be,bankrupt,any,more,[END]
he'll,have,it,all,back,and,more,[END]
if,he'll,just,take,it,[END]
i,have,to,make,him,take,it,[END]
scarlett,rhett,was,saying,there's,no,making,up',for,the,past,[END]
don't,destroy,the,little,that,is,left,[END]
let,me,be,kind,i'll,feel,better,for,it,[END]
she,seized,on,his,words,[END]
oh,yes,[END]
yes,rhett,please,[END]
be,kind,the,way,you,were,before,i,ruined,the,happy,time,we,were,having,[END]
i,won't,crowd,you,[END]
let's,just,have,fun,be,friends,until,i,go,back,to,atlanta,[END]
i'll,be,content,if,we,can,just,laugh,together,i,had,such,a,good,time,at,breakfast,[END]
my,you,are,a,sight,in,that,apron,thing,[END]
she,giggled,[END]
thank,god,he,couldn't,see,her,any,better,than,she,could,see,him,[END]
that's,all,you,want,[END]
relief,took,the,edge,from,rhett's,voice,[END]
scarlett,took,a,big,swallow,of,coffee,while,she,planned,what,to,say,[END]
then,she,managed,an,airy,laugh,[END]
well,of,course,silly,[END]
i,know,when,i'm,beat,[END]
i,figured,it,was,worth,a,try,that's,all,[END]
i,won't,crowd,you,any,more,but,please,make,the,season,good,for,me,[END]
you,know,how,much,i,love,parties,[END]
she,laughed,again,[END]
and,if,you,really,want,to,be,kind,rhett,butler,you,can,pour,me,another,cup,of,coffee,[END]
i,don't,have,a,hot-holder,and,you,do,[END]
after,breakfast,scarlett,went,upstairs,to,get,dressed,[END]
it,was,still,night,but,she,was,much,too,excited,to,think,about,going,back,to,sleep,[END]
she'd,patched,things,up,pretty,well,she,thought,[END]
his,guard,was,down,[END]
he,had,enjoyed,their,breakfast,too,she,was,sure,of,it,[END]
she,put,on,the,brown,travelling,costume,she,had,worn,on,the,boat,to,the,landing,then,brushed,her,dark,hair,back,from,her,temples,and,tucked,combs,in,to,hold,it,[END]
then,she,rubbed,just,a,small,amount,of,eau,de,cologne,across,her,wrists,and,throat,just,a,whiff,reminder,that,she,was,feminine,and,soft,and,desirable,[END]
walking,along,the,hall,and,down,the,stairs,she,was,as,quiet,as,she,could,be,[END]
the,longer,rosemary,stayed,asleep,the,better,[END]
the,east-facing,window,on,the,stair,landing,was,distinct,in,the,darkness,[END]
it,was,nearly,dawn,[END]
scarlett,blew,out,the,flame,in,the,lamp,she,was,carrying,[END]
oh,please,let,this,be,a,good,day,let,me,do,everything,right,[END]
let,it,be,like,breakfast,all,day,long,[END]
and,all,night,after,[END]
it's,new,year's,eve,[END]
the,house,had,the,special,quality,of,quiet,that,wraps,the,earth,just,before,sunrise,[END]
scarlett,stepped,carefully,to,make,no,noise,until,she,reached,the,center,room,below,[END]
the,fire,was,burning,brightly,rhett,must,have,put,more,logs,on,while,she,was,dressing,[END]
she,could,just,make,out,the,dark,shape,of,his,shoulders,and,head,framed,by,the,gray,semi-light,of,a,window,beyond,him,[END]
he,was,in,his,office,with,the,door,ajar,his,back,to,her,[END]
she,tiptoed,across,the,room,and,tapped,gently,on,the,door,frame,with,the,tips,of,her,fingers,[END]
may,i,come,in,[END]
she,whispered,[END]
i,thought,you'd,gone,back,to,bed,said,rhett,[END]
he,sounded,very,tired,[END]
she,remembered,that,he'd,been,up,all,night,guarding,the,house,[END]
and,her,[END]
she,wished,she,could,cradle,his,head,against,her,heart,and,stroke,his,tiredness,away,[END]
there,wasn't,much,point,to,going,to,sleep,there'll,be,roosters,crowing,like,crazy,as,soon,as,the,sun's,up,[END]
she,put,one,foot,tentatively,across,the,doorsill,[END]
is,it,all,right,if,i,sit,in,here,[END]
there's,not,such,a,reek,in,your,office,[END]
come,in,rhett,said,without,looking,at,her,[END]
scarlett,moved,quietly,to,a,chair,just,inside,the,office,[END]
over,rhett's,shoulder,she,could,see,the,window,becoming,more,distinct,[END]
i,wonder,what,he's,looking,for,so,hard,[END]
are,those,crackers,outside,again,[END]
or,clinch,dawkins,[END]
a,cock,crowed,and,her,whole,body,jerked,[END]
then,the,first,weak,rays,of,red,dawn,light,touched,the,scene,outside,the,window,[END]
the,jagged,tumbled,brick,ruins,of,dunmore,landing's,house,were,dramatically,lit,red,against,the,dark,sky,behind,them,[END]
scarlett,cried,out,[END]
it,looked,as,if,they,were,still,smoldering,[END]
rhett,was,watching,the,death,throes,of,his,home,[END]
don't,look,rhett,she,begged,don't,look,[END]
it,will,only,break,your,heart,[END]
i,should,have,been,here,i,might,have,stopped,them,[END]
rhett's,voice,was,slow,distant,as,if,he,didn't,know,that,he,was,speaking,[END]
you,couldn't,have,[END]
there,must,have,been,hundreds,of,them,[END]
they,would,have,shot,you,and,burned,everything,anyhow,[END]
they,didn't,shoot,julia,ashley,said,rhett,[END]
but,he,sounded,different,now,[END]
there,was,a,glimmer,of,wryness,almost,humor,beneath,his,words,[END]
the,red,light,outside,was,changing,becoming,more,golden,and,the,ruins,were,only,blackened,bricks,and,chimneys,with,the,sun-touched,sheen,of,dew,on,them,[END]
rhett's,swivel,chair,swung,around,[END]
he,rubbed,his,hand,over,his,chin,and,scarlett,could,almost,hear,the,rasp,of,the,unshaven,whiskers,[END]
he,had,shadows,under,his,eyes,visible,even,in,the,shadowy,room,and,his,black,hair,was,dishevelled,a,cowlick,standing,up,on,the,crown,an,untidy,lock,falling,on,his,forehead,[END]
he,stood,yawned,and,stretched,[END]
i,believe,it's,safe,to,sleep,a,little,now,[END]
you,and,rosemary,stay,in,the,house,till,i,wake,up,[END]
he,lay,down,on,a,wooden,bench,and,fell,asleep,at,once,[END]
scarlett,watched,him,as,he,slept,[END]
i,mustn't,ever,tell,him,again,that,i,love,him,[END]
that,makes,him,feel,pressured,[END]
and,when,he,turns,nasty,i,feel,small,and,cheap,for,having,said,it,[END]
no,i'll,never,say,it,again,not,until,he's,told,me,first,that,he,loves,me,[END]
25,[END]
rhett,was,busy,from,the,moment,he,woke,after,an,hour's,heavy,sleep,and,he,told,rosemary,and,scarlett,bluntly,to,keep,away,from,the,butterfly,lakes,[END]
he,was,building,a,platform,there,for,the,speeches,and,hiring,ceremonies,the,next,day,[END]
working,men,don't,take,kindly,to,the,presence,of,women,[END]
he,smiled,at,his,sister,[END]
and,i,certainly,don't,want,mama,asking,me,why,i,permitted,you,to,learn,such,a,colorful,new,vocabulary,[END]
at,rhett's,request,rosemary,led,scarlett,on,a,tour,of,the,overgrown,gardens,[END]
the,paths,had,been,cleared,but,not,gravelled,and,scarlett's,hem,was,soon,black,from,fine,dust,[END]
how,different,everything,was,from,tara,even,the,soil,[END]
it,seemed,unnatural,to,her,that,the,paths,and,the,dust,weren't,red,[END]
the,vegetation,was,so,thick,too,and,many,of,the,plants,were,unfamiliar,[END]
it,was,too,lush,for,her,upland,taste,[END]
but,rhett's,sister,loved,the,butler,plantation,with,a,passion,that,surprised,her,[END]
why,she,feels,about,this,place,just,the,way,i,feel,about,tara,[END]
maybe,i,can,get,along,with,her,after,all,[END]
rosemary,did,not,notice,scarlett's,efforts,to,find,a,common,ground,[END]
she,was,lost,in,a,lost,world,dunmore,landing,before,the,war,[END]
this,was,called,the,hidden,garden',because,of,the,way,the,tall,hedges,along,the,paths,kept,you,from,seeing,it,until,all,of,a,sudden,you,were,in,it,[END]
when,i,was,little,i'd,hide,in,here,whenever,bath,time,was,coming,[END]
the,servants,were,wonderful,to,me,they'd,thrash,around,the,hedges,shouting,back,and,forth,about,how,they,knew,they'd,never,find,me,[END]
i,thought,i'd,been,so,clever,[END]
and,when,my,mammy,stumbled,through,the,gate,she'd,always,act,surprised,to,see,me,[END]
i,loved,her,so,much,[END]
i,had,a,mammy,too,[END]
she,[END]
rosemary,was,already,moving,on,[END]
down,this,way,is,the,reflecting,pool,[END]
there,were,black,swans,and,white,ones,[END]
rhett,says,maybe,they'll,come,back,once,the,reeds,are,cut,out,and,all,that,filthy,algae,cleaned,up,[END]
see,that,clump,of,bushes,[END]
it's,really,an,island,purpose,built,for,the,swans,to,nest,on,[END]
it,was,all,grass,of,course,clipped,when,it,wasn't,nesting,season,[END]
and,there,was,a,miniature,greek,temple,of,white,marble,[END]
maybe,the,pieces,are,somewhere,in,the,tangle,[END]
a,lot,of,people,are,afraid,of,swans,[END]
they,can,do,terrible,injury,with,their,beaks,and,wings,[END]
but,ours,let,me,swim,with,them,once,the,cygnets,were,out,of,the,nest,[END]
mama,used,to,read,me,the,ugly,duckling,sitting,on,a,bench,by,the,pool,[END]
when,i,learned,my,letters,i,read,it,to,the,swans,[END]
this,path,goes,to,the,rose,garden,[END]
in,may,you,could,smell,them,for,miles,on,the,river,before,you,ever,got,to,the,landing,[END]
inside,the,house,on,rainy,days,with,the,windows,closed,the,sweetness,from,all,the,big,arrangements,of,roses,made,me,feel,sick,as,a,dog,[END]
down,there,by,the,river,was,the,big,oak,with,the,treehouse,in,it,[END]
rhett,built,it,when,he,was,a,boy,then,ross,had,it,[END]
i'd,climb,up,with,a,book,and,some,jam,biscuits,and,stay,for,hours,and,hours,[END]
it,was,much,better,than,the,playhouse,papa,had,the,carpenters,make,for,me,[END]
that,was,much,too,fancy,with,rugs,on,the,floors,and,furniture,in,my,size,and,tea,sets,and,dolls,[END]
come,this,way,[END]
the,cypress,swamp,is,over,there,[END]
maybe,there'll,be,some,alligators,to,watch,[END]
the,weather's,been,so,warm,they're,not,likely,to,be,in,their,winter,dens,[END]
no,thank,you,said,scarlett,[END]
my,legs,are,getting,tired,[END]
i,believe,i'll,sit,on,that,big,stone,for,a,while,[END]
the,big,stone,turned,out,to,be,the,base,of,a,fallen,broken,statue,of,a,classically,draped,maiden,[END]
scarlett,could,see,the,stained,face,in,a,thicket,of,brambles,[END]
she,wasn't,really,tired,of,walking,she,was,tired,of,rosemary,[END]
and,she,certainly,had,no,desire,to,see,any,alligators,[END]
she,sat,with,the,sun,warm,on,her,back,and,thought,about,what,she'd,seen,[END]
dunmore,landing,was,beginning,to,come,to,life,in,her,mind,[END]
it,hadn't,been,at,all,like,tara,she,realized,[END]
life,here,had,been,lived,on,a,scale,and,in,a,style,she,knew,nothing,about,[END]
no,wonder,charleston,people,had,a,reputation,for,thinking,they,were,the,be-all,and,end-all,[END]
they,had,lived,like,kings,[END]
despite,the,warmth,of,the,sun,she,felt,chilled,[END]
if,rhett,worked,day,and,night,for,the,rest,of,his,life,he'd,never,make,this,place,what,it,once,was,and,that,was,exactly,what,he,was,determined,to,do,[END]
there,wasn't,going,to,be,much,time,in,his,life,for,her,[END]
and,knowing,about,onions,and,yams,wouldn't,be,much,help,to,her,in,sharing,his,life,either,[END]
rosemary,returned,disappointed,[END]
she,hadn't,seen,a,single,'gator,[END]
she,talked,nonstop,while,they,were,walking,back,to,the,house,giving,their,old,names,to,gardens,that,were,now,only,areas,of,rank,weeds,boring,scarlett,with,complex,descriptions,of,the,varieties,of,rice,once,grown,in,fields,that,were,now,gone,to,marsh,grass,reminiscing,about,her,childhood,[END]
i,hated,it,when,summer,came,[END]
she,complained,[END]
why,[END]
asked,scarlett,[END]
she,had,always,loved,summer,when,there,were,parties,every,week,and,lots,of,visitors,and,noisy,shouting,racing,on,back,roads,between,the,fields,of,ripening,cotton,[END]
rosemary's,answer,wiped,away,the,apprehensions,that,were,preying,on,her,mind,[END]
in,the,low-country,scarlett,learned,summertime,was,citytime,[END]
there,was,a,fever,that,rose,from,the,swamps,to,lay,whites,low,[END]
malaria,[END]
because,of,it,everyone,left,their,plantations,from,the,middle,of,may,until,after,the,first,frost,in,late,october,[END]
so,rhett,would,have,time,for,her,after,all,[END]
there,was,the,season,too,for,nearly,two,more,months,[END]
he,had,to,be,there,to,escort,his,mother,and,sister,and,her,[END]
she'd,be,glad,to,let,him,fiddle,with,his,flowers,for,five,months,a,year,if,she,could,have,the,other,seven,[END]
she'd,even,learn,the,names,of,his,camellias,[END]
what,was,that,[END]
scarlett,stared,at,the,tremendous,white,stone,object,[END]
it,looked,like,an,angel,was,standing,on,a,big,box,[END]
oh,that's,our,tomb,said,rosemary,[END]
a,century,and,a,half,of,butlers,all,in,neat,rows,[END]
when,i,go,toes,up,that's,where,i'll,be,put,too,[END]
the,yankees,shot,off,big,chunks,of,the,angel's,wings,but,they,had,the,decency,to,leave,the,dead,alone,[END]
i,heard,that,some,places,they,dug,up,graves,to,look,for,jewelry,[END]
child,of,an,irish,immigrant,father,scarlett,was,overwhelmed,by,the,permanence,of,the,tomb,[END]
all,those,generations,and,all,the,generations,to,come,forever,and,ever,amen,[END]
i'm,going,back,to,a,place,with,roots,that,go,deep,rhett,had,said,[END]
now,she,understood,what,he,had,meant,[END]
she,felt,sorrow,for,what,he,had,lost,and,envy,that,she,had,never,had,it,[END]
come,on,scarlett,[END]
you're,standing,there,as,if,you,were,planted,[END]
we're,almost,back,to,the,house,[END]
you,can't,be,too,tired,to,walk,that,little,bit,[END]
scarlett,remembered,why,she,had,agreed,in,the,first,place,to,go,on,the,walk,with,rosemary,[END]
i'm,not,the,least,bit,tired,[END]
she,insisted,[END]
i,think,we,should,gather,some,pine,branches,and,things,to,decorate,the,house,a,little,[END]
these,are,the,holidays,after,all,[END]
good,idea,[END]
they'll,cut,the,stink,[END]
there's,plenty,of,pine,and,holly,too,in,the,wood,next,to,where,the,stables,used,to,be,[END]
and,mistletoe,scarlett,added,silently,[END]
she,wasn't,taking,any,chances,with,the,new,year's,eve,midnight,ritual,[END]
very,nice,said,rhett,when,he,came,up,to,the,house,after,the,platform,was,built,and,draped,with,red,white,and,blue,bunting,[END]
it,looks,festive,just,right,for,the,party,[END]
what,party,[END]
asked,scarlett,[END]
i,invited,the,sharecropper,families,[END]
it,makes,them,feel,important,and,god,willing,the,men,will,be,too,hungover,from,rotgut,whiskey,to,make,trouble,tomorrow,when,the,blacks,are,here,[END]
you,and,rosemary,and,pansy,will,go,upstairs,before,they,come,[END]
it's,likely,to,get,rough,[END]
scarlett,watched,the,roman,candles,arc,through,the,sky,from,her,bedroom,window,[END]
the,fireworks,to,celebrate,the,new,year,lasted,from,midnight,until,nearly,one,o'clock,[END]
she,wished,with,all,her,heart,that,she,had,stayed,in,the,city,[END]
tomorrow,she'd,be,cooped,up,all,day,while,the,blacks,celebrated,and,by,the,time,they,got,back,to,town,on,saturday,it,would,probably,be,too,late,to,wash,and,dry,her,hair,for,the,ball,[END]
and,rhett,had,never,kissed,her,[END]
during,the,days,that,followed,scarlett,recaptured,all,the,giddy,excitement,of,what,she,remembered,as,the,best,time,of,her,life,[END]
she,was,a,belle,with,men,clustered,around,her,at,receptions,with,her,dance,card,filled,as,soon,as,she,entered,the,ballroom,with,all,her,old,games,of,flirtation,producing,the,same,admiration,that,they,had,before,[END]
it,was,like,being,sixteen,again,with,nothing,to,think,about,other,than,the,last,party,and,the,compliments,she'd,been,paid,and,the,next,party,and,how,she,would,wear,her,hair,[END]
but,it,was,not,long,before,the,thrills,became,flat,[END]
she,was,not,sixteen,and,she,didn't,really,want,a,string,of,beaux,[END]
she,wanted,rhett,and,she,was,no,closer,to,winning,him,back,than,she,had,been,[END]
he,kept,up,his,end,of,their,bargain,he,was,attentive,to,her,at,parties,pleasant,to,her,whenever,they,were,together,in,the,house,with,other,people,[END]
yet,she,was,sure,that,he,was,looking,at,the,calendar,counting,the,days,until,he'd,be,rid,of,her,[END]
she,began,to,feel,moments,of,panic,[END]
what,if,she,lost,[END]
the,panic,always,bred,anger,[END]
she,focused,it,on,young,tommy,cooper,[END]
the,boy,was,always,hanging,around,rhett,with,hero-worship,clear,on,his,face,[END]
and,rhett,responded,too,[END]
it,enraged,her,[END]
tommy,had,been,given,a,small,sailboat,for,christmas,and,rhett,was,teaching,him,to,sail,[END]
there,was,a,handsome,brass,telescope,in,the,card,room,on,the,second,floor,and,scarlett,ran,to,it,whenever,she,could,on,the,afternoons,that,rhett,was,out,with,tommy,cooper,[END]
her,jealousy,was,like,probing,an,aching,tooth,with,her,tongue,but,she,couldn't,resist,the,compulsion,to,cause,herself,pain,[END]
it's,not,fair,[END]
they're,laughing,and,having,fun,and,skimming,the,water,as,free,as,a,bird,[END]
why,not,take,me,sailing,[END]
i,loved,it,so,that,time,we,came,back,from,the,landing,i'd,love,it,even,more,in,that,tiny,boat,the,cooper,boy,has,[END]
why,it's,alive,it,moves,so,quickly,so,lightly,so,[END]
so,happily,[END]
fortunately,there,were,few,afternoons,that,she,was,at,home,and,near,the,spy,glass,[END]
although,the,evening,receptions,and,balls,were,the,main,events,of,the,season,there,were,also,other,things,to,be,done,[END]
the,dedicated,whist,players,continued,to,gamble,miss,eleanor's,confederate,home,committee,had,meetings,about,fund,raising,to,buy,books,for,the,school,and,to,repair,a,leak,that,suddenly,appeared,in,the,roof,there,were,still,calls,to,pay,and,to,receive,[END]
scarlett,became,hollow-eyed,and,pale,from,fatigue,[END]
it,would,all,have,been,worth,it,if,rhett,was,the,one,feeling,jealous,and,not,her,[END]
but,he,seemed,to,be,unaware,of,the,admiration,she,was,provoking,[END]
or,worse,uninterested,[END]
she,had,to,make,him,notice,make,him,care,[END]
she,decided,to,choose,one,man,from,her,dozens,of,admirers,[END]
someone,handsome,[END]
rich,[END]
younger,than,rhett,[END]
someone,he'd,have,to,feel,jealous,of,[END]
heavens,she,looked,like,a,ghost,[END]
she,put,on,rouge,and,heavy,perfume,and,her,most,innocent,expression,for,the,hunt,[END]
middleton,courtney,was,tall,and,fair,with,sleepy-lidded,pale,eyes,and,extremely,white,teeth,that,he,flashed,in,a,wicked-looking,smile,[END]
he,was,the,epitome,of,what,scarlett,considered,a,sophisticated,man,about,town,[END]
best,of,all,he,too,had,a,phosphate,mine,and,it,was,twenty,times,the,size,of,rhett's,[END]
when,he,bowed,over,her,hand,in,greeting,scarlett,closed,her,fingers,over,his,[END]
he,looked,up,from,his,bow,and,smiled,[END]
dare,i,hope,that,you'll,honor,me,with,the,next,dance,mrs,[END]
butler,[END]
if,you,hadn't,asked,me,mr,courtney,it,would,have,broken,my,poor,heart,[END]
when,the,polka,ended,scarlett,opened,her,fan,in,the,slow,unfurling,known,as,languishing,fall,[END]
she,fluttered,it,near,her,face,to,lift,the,appealing,tendrils,of,hair,above,her,green,eyes,[END]
my,goodness,she,said,breathlessly,i'm,afraid,that,if,i,don't,get,a,little,air,i'm,liable,to,keel,right,over,into,your,arms,mr,courtney,[END]
will,you,be,so,kind,[END]
she,took,his,proffered,arm,and,leaned,on,it,while,he,escorted,her,to,a,bench,beneath,a,window,[END]
oh,please,mr,courtney,do,sit,here,beside,me,[END]
i'll,get,a,terrible,crick,in,my,neck,if,i,have,to,look,up,at,you,[END]
courtney,seated,himself,[END]
rather,close,[END]
i'd,hate,to,be,the,cause,of,any,injury,to,such,a,beautiful,neck,he,said,[END]
his,eyes,moved,slowly,down,her,throat,to,her,white,bosom,[END]
he,was,as,skillful,as,scarlett,was,at,the,game,they,were,playing,[END]
she,kept,her,eyes,modestly,lowered,as,if,she,didn't,know,what,courtney,was,doing,[END]
then,she,glanced,up,through,her,eyelashes,and,quickly,down,again,[END]
i,hope,my,silly,weak,spell,isn't,keeping,you,from,dancing,with,the,lady,closest,to,your,heart,mr,[END]
courtney,[END]
but,the,lady,you,speak,of,is,the,lady,closest,to,my,heart,right,now,mrs,[END]
butler,[END]
scarlett,looked,him,directly,in,the,eyes,and,smiled,enchantingly,[END]
you,be,careful,mr,courtney,[END]
you're,liable,to,turn,my,head,she,promised,[END]
i,certainly,intend,to,try,he,murmured,close,to,her,ear,[END]
his,breath,was,warm,on,her,neck,[END]
very,soon,the,public,romance,between,them,was,the,most,talked-about,topic,of,the,season,[END]
the,number,of,times,they,danced,together,at,each,ball,[END]
the,time,courtney,took,scarlett's,punch,cup,from,her,hand,and,put,his,lips,where,hers,had,been,on,the,[END]
overheard,snippets,of,their,innuendo-laden,raillery,[END]
middleton's,wife,edith,looked,increasingly,drawn,and,pale,[END]
and,no,one,could,understand,rhett's,imperturbability,[END]
why,didn't,he,do,something,[END]
the,little,world,of,charleston,society,wondered,[END]
26,[END]
the,yearly,races,were,second,only,to,the,saint,cecilia,ball,as,the,crowning,event,of,charleston's,social,season,[END]
indeed,there,were,many,people,largely,bachelors,who,considered,them,the,only,event,[END]
you,can't,gamble,on,a,bunch,of,waltzes,they,grumbled,mutinously,[END]
before,the,war,the,season,had,included,a,full,week,of,racing,and,the,saint,cecilia,society,hosted,three,balls,[END]
then,came,the,years,of,siege,an,artillery,shell,ignited,a,path,of,fire,through,the,city,that,consumed,the,building,where,the,balls,had,always,been,held,and,the,long,landscaped,oval,track,its,clubhouse,and,its,stables,were,used,as,a,confederate,army,encampment,and,hospitals,for,the,wounded,[END]
in,1865,the,city,surrendered,[END]
in,1866,an,enterprising,and,ambitious,wall,street,banker,named,august,belmont,bought,the,monumental,carved,stone,entrance,pillars,of,the,old,race,course,and,had,them,transported,north,to,become,the,entrance,to,his,belmont,park,racetrack,[END]
the,saint,cecilia,ball,found,a,borrowed,home,only,two,years,after,the,end,of,the,war,and,charlestonians,rejoiced,that,the,season,could,begin,again,[END]
it,took,longer,to,regain,and,restore,the,fouled,and,rutted,land,of,the,race,course,[END]
nothing,was,quite,the,samethere,was,one,ball,not,three,race,week,was,race,day,the,entrance,pillars,could,not,be,recovered,and,the,clubhouse,had,been,replaced,by,half-roofed,tiers,of,wooden,benches,[END]
but,on,the,bright,afternoon,in,late,january,1875,the,entire,remaining,population,of,old,charleston,was,en,fête,for,the,second,year,of,racing,[END]
the,streetcars,of,all,four,city,railway,lines,were,diverted,to,the,rutledge,avenue,route,that,ended,near,the,race,course,the,cars,were,hung,with,green,and,white,bunting,the,club,colors,and,the,horses,pulling,them,had,green,and,white,ribbons,braided,in,their,tails,and,manes,[END]
rhett,presented,his,three,ladies,with,green,and,white,striped,parasols,when,they,were,ready,to,leave,the,house,and,inserted,a,white,camellia,into,his,buttonhole,[END]
his,white,smile,was,brilliant,in,his,tanned,face,[END]
the,yankees,are,taking,the,bait,he,said,[END]
the,esteemed,mr,belmont,himself,has,sent,down,two,horses,and,guggenheim,has,one,[END]
they,don't,know,about,the,brood,mares,miles,brewton,hid,in,the,swamp,[END]
their,get,grew,into,a,mettlesome,family,a,bit,shaggy,from,swamp,living,and,unbeautiful,from,crossbreeding,with,strays,from,the,cavalry,but,miles,has,a,wonder,of,a,three-year-old,that's,going,to,make,every,big-money,pocket,a,lot,lighter,than,it,expected,to,be,[END]
you,mean,there's,betting,[END]
scarlett,asked,[END]
her,eyes,glittered,[END]
why,else,would,anyone,race,[END]
rhett,laughed,[END]
he,tucked,folded,banknotes,into,his,mother's,reticule,rosemary's,pocket,and,scarlett's,glove,[END]
put,it,all,on,sweet,sally,and,buy,yourselves,a,trinket,with,your,winnings,[END]
what,a,good,mood,he's,in,scarlett,thought,[END]
he,put,the,banknote,inside,my,glove,[END]
he,could,have,just,handed,it,to,me,he,didn't,have,to,touch,my,hand,that,way,no,not,my,hand,my,bare,wrist,[END]
why,it,was,practically,a,caress,[END]
he's,noticing,me,now,that,he,thinks,i'm,interested,in,somebody,else,[END]
really,noticing,me,not,just,paying,polite,attention,[END]
it's,going,to,work,[END]
she'd,been,worried,that,maybe,letting,middleton,have,every,third,dance,was,going,too,far,[END]
people,had,been,talking,she,knew,[END]
well,let,them,talk,if,a,little,gossip,would,bring,rhett,back,to,her,[END]
when,they,entered,the,grounds,of,the,race,course,scarlett,gasped,[END]
she'd,had,no,idea,it,was,so,big,[END]
or,that,there'd,be,a,band,[END]
and,so,many,people,[END]
she,looked,around,with,delight,[END]
then,she,caught,hold,of,rhett's,sleeve,[END]
rhett,[END]
rhett,[END]
there,are,yankee,soldiers,all,over,the,place,[END]
what,does,it,mean,[END]
are,they,going,to,stop,the,races,[END]
rhett,smiled,[END]
don't,you,think,yankees,gamble,too,[END]
or,that,we,should,mind,relieving,them,of,some,of,their,money,[END]
god,knows,they,didn't,object,to,taking,all,of,ours,[END]
i'm,glad,to,see,the,gallant,colonel,and,his,officers,sharing,in,the,simple,pleasures,of,the,vanquished,[END]
they've,got,a,lot,more,money,to,lose,than,our,kind,do,[END]
how,can,you,be,so,sure,they'll,lose,it,[END]
her,eyes,were,narrowed,calculating,[END]
the,yankee,horses,are,thoroughbreds,and,sweet,sally,is,nothing,but,a,swamp,pony,[END]
rhett's,mouth,twisted,[END]
pride,and,loyalty,don't,weigh,much,for,you,when,there's,money,involved,do,they,scarlett,[END]
well,go,ahead,my,pet,lay,your,bet,on,belmont's,filly,to,win,[END]
i,gave,you,the,money,you,can,do,what,you,like,with,it,[END]
he,walked,away,from,her,took,his,mother's,arm,and,gestured,up,at,the,stand,[END]
i,think,you'll,have,a,good,view,from,higher,up,mama,[END]
come,along,rosemary,[END]
scarlett,started,to,run,after,him,[END]
i,didn't,mean,she,said,but,his,wide,back,was,like,a,wall,[END]
she,shrugged,angrily,then,looked,from,right,to,left,[END]
where,did,she,go,to,place,a,bet,anyhow,[END]
can,i,help,you,ma'am,[END]
said,a,man,nearby,[END]
why,yes,maybe,you,can,[END]
he,looked,like,a,gentleman,and,his,accent,sounded,like,georgia,[END]

scarlett,had,to,pretend,to,listen,to,more,horse,talk,while,he,accompanied,her,to,the,booth,set,up,for,taking,bets,then,escorted,her,back,to,the,stands,[END]
scarlett,said,goodbye,to,him,with,a,feeling,of,escape,[END]
the,stands,were,very,nearly,full,but,she,had,no,trouble,finding,her,place,[END]
the,green,and,white,striped,parasols,were,a,beacon,[END]
scarlett,waved,hers,at,rhett,then,began,to,climb,the,risers,[END]
eleanor,butler,returned,her,salute,[END]
rosemary,looked,away,[END]
rhett,seated,scarlett,between,rosemary,and,his,mother,[END]
she,was,barely,settled,when,she,felt,eleanor,butler,stiffen,[END]
middleton,courtney,and,his,wife,edith,were,taking,seats,in,the,same,row,not,far,away,[END]
the,courtneys,nodded,and,smiled,a,friendly,greeting,[END]
the,butlers,returned,it,[END]
then,middleton,began,to,point,out,the,starting,gate,and,finish,line,to,his,wife,[END]
at,the,same,time,scarlett,said,you'll,never,guess,who,i,met,miss,eleanor,a,soldier,that,was,in,atlanta,when,i,first,went,to,live,there,[END]
she,could,feel,mrs,butler,relax,[END]
an,excited,stir,ran,through,the,crowd,[END]
the,horses,were,coming,onto,the,track,[END]
scarlett,stared,open-mouthed,eyes,shining,[END]
nothing,had,prepared,her,for,the,smooth,grass,oval,and,the,bright,checkerboards,and,stripes,and,harlequin,diamonds,of,the,racing,silks,[END]
gaudy,and,shining,and,festive,the,riders,paraded,past,the,grandstand,while,the,band,played,a,rollicking,oom-pah,tune,[END]
scarlett,laughed,aloud,without,knowing,it,[END]
it,was,a,child's,laughter,free,and,unconsidered,expressing,pure,joyful,surprise,[END]
oh,look,[END]
she,said,[END]
oh,look,[END]
she,was,so,enraptured,that,she,was,unaware,of,rhett's,eyes,watching,her,instead,of,the,horses,[END]
there,was,an,interval,for,refreshments,after,the,third,race,[END]
a,tent,hung,with,green,and,white,streamers,sheltered,long,tables,of,food,and,waiters,circulated,throughout,the,crowd,bearing,trays,of,champagne-filled,glasses,[END]
scarlett,took,one,of,emma,anson's,glasses,from,one,of,sally,brewton's,crested,trays,pretending,that,she,didn't,recognize,minnie,wentworth's,butler,who,was,serving,[END]
she'd,learned,charleston's,ways,of,dealing,with,shortages,and,loss,[END]
everyone,shared,their,treasures,and,their,servants,acting,as,if,they,belonged,to,the,host,or,hostess,of,the,event,[END]
that's,just,about,the,silliest,thing,i,ever,heard,she'd,said,when,mrs,butler,first,explained,the,charade,[END]
lending,and,borrowing,she,could,understand,[END]
but,pretending,that,emma,anson's,initials,belonged,on,minnie,wentworth's,napkins,made,no,sense,at,all,[END]
still,she,went,along,with,the,deception,if,that,was,the,term,for,it,[END]
it,was,just,one,more,of,the,peculiarities,of,charleston,[END]
scarlett,[END]
she,turned,quickly,to,the,speaker,[END]
it,was,rosemary,[END]
they'll,be,sounding,the,bell,any,minute,[END]
let's,go,back,before,the,rush,starts,[END]
people,were,starting,to,return,to,the,stands,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,them,through,the,opera,glasses,she'd,borrowed,from,miss,eleanor,[END]
there,were,her,aunts,thank,heaven,she,hadn't,run,into,them,in,the,refreshment,tent,[END]
and,sally,brewton,with,her,husband,miles,[END]
he,looked,almost,as,excited,as,she,did,[END]
good,grief,[END]
miss,julia,ashley,was,with,them,[END]
fancy,her,betting,on,the,horses,[END]
she,moved,the,glasses,from,side,to,side,[END]
it,was,fun,to,be,able,to,watch,people,when,they,didn't,know,you,were,looking,[END]
hah,[END]
there,was,old,josiah,anson,dozing,off,[END]
while,emma,was,talking,to,him,too,[END]
he'd,get,an,earful,if,she,found,out,he,was,asleep,[END]
ugh,[END]
ross,[END]
too,bad,he,had,come,back,but,miss,eleanor,was,pleased,[END]
margaret,looked,nervous,but,she,always,did,[END]
oh,there's,anne,[END]
my,grief,she,looks,like,the,old,woman,in,the,shoe,with,all,those,children,she's,got,with,her,[END]
they,must,be,the,orphans,[END]

must,be,she's,looking,up,at,him,as,if,he,could,walk,on,water,[END]
she's,practically,melting,[END]
scarlett,moved,the,glasses,upward,to,see,if,edward,was,being,as,obvious,as,anne,[END]
a,pair,of,shoes,trousers,jacket,[END]
her,heart,leapt,into,her,throat,[END]
it,was,rhett,[END]
he,must,be,talking,to,edward,[END]
her,gaze,lingered,for,a,moment,[END]
rhett,looked,so,elegant,[END]
she,shifted,the,glasses,and,eleanor,butler,came,into,view,[END]
scarlett,froze,not,even,breathing,[END]
it,couldn't,be,[END]
she,scanned,the,area,near,rhett,and,his,mother,[END]
nobody,was,there,yet,[END]
slowly,she,moved,the,glasses,back,to,look,at,anne,again,then,again,at,rhett,then,back,to,anne,[END]
there,was,no,doubt,about,it,[END]
scarlett,felt,sick,[END]
then,searingly,angry,[END]
that,miserable,little,sneak,[END]
she's,been,praising,me,to,the,skies,all,this,time,to,my,face,and,she's,wildly,in,love,with,my,husband,behind,my,back,[END]
i,could,strangle,her,to,death,with,my,bare,hands,[END]
her,hands,were,sweating,she,almost,lost,hold,of,the,glasses,when,she,swung,them,back,to,rhett,[END]
was,he,looking,at,anne,[END]
no,he,was,laughing,with,miss,eleanor,[END]
they,were,chatting,with,the,wentworths,[END]
greeting,the,hugers,[END]
the,halseys,[END]
the,savages,[END]
old,mr,pinckney,[END]
scarlett,kept,rhett,in,view,until,her,eyes,blurred,[END]
he,hadn't,looked,in,anne's,direction,even,once,[END]
she,was,staring,at,him,like,she,could,eat,him,with,a,spoon,and,he,didn't,even,notice,it,[END]
there's,nothing,to,fret,about,[END]
it's,just,a,silly,girl,with,a,crush,on,a,grown-up,man,[END]
why,shouldn't,anne,have,a,crush,on,him,[END]
why,shouldn't,every,woman,in,charleston,[END]
he's,so,handsome,and,so,strong,and,so,[END]
she,looked,at,him,with,yearning,naked,on,her,face,the,glasses,in,her,lap,[END]
rhett,was,bent,down,to,adjust,miss,eleanor's,shawl,across,her,shoulders,[END]
the,sun,was,low,in,the,sky,and,a,cold,fitful,wind,had,begun,to,blow,[END]
he,placed,his,hand,under,her,elbow,and,they,began,to,climb,the,steps,to,their,seats,the,very,picture,of,a,dutiful,son,with,his,mother,[END]
scarlett,waited,eagerly,for,them,to,arrive,[END]
the,partial,roof,over,the,grandstand,cast,an,angled,shadow,over,the,seats,[END]
rhett,changed,places,with,his,mother,so,that,she,could,be,warmed,by,what,sunlight,there,was,and,scarlett,had,him,beside,her,at,last,[END]
she,forgot,anne,at,once,[END]
when,the,horses,came,out,on,the,track,for,the,fourth,race,the,spectators,stood,up,first,two,then,several,groups,of,people,then,everyone,in,a,tidal,wave,of,anticipation,[END]
scarlett,was,almost,dancing,with,excitement,[END]
having,a,good,time,[END]
rhett,was,smiling,[END]
wonderful,[END]
which,horse,is,miles,brewton's,rhett,[END]
i,suspect,miles,rubbed,his,down,with,shoe-polish,[END]

the,dark,horse,you,might,say,[END]
number,six,is,guggenheim's,belmont,managed,post,position,his,pace-setter,is,number,four,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,ask,what,pace-setter,and,post,position,meant,but,there,was,no,time,they,were,about,to,start,[END]

scarlett,looked,[END]
sally,brewton's,face,was,more,monkey-like,than,ever,contorted,with,rage,and,she,was,shaking,her,fist,in,the,air,[END]
rhett,laughed,affectionately,[END]
i,might,just,jump,the,fence,and,keep,going,if,i,were,the,jockey,he,said,[END]
sally's,ready,to,use,his,skin,for,a,hearth,rug,[END]
i,don't,blame,her,one,bit,scarlett,declared,and,i,don't,think,it's,one,bit,funny,either,rhett,butler,[END]
he,laughed,again,[END]
may,i,dare,assume,that,you,put,your,money,on,sweet,sally,after,all,[END]
of,course,i,did,[END]
sally,brewton's,a,dear,friend,of,mine,and,besides,if,i,lost,it,was,your,money,not,mine,[END]
rhett,looked,at,scarlett,in,surprise,[END]
she,was,smiling,impishly,at,him,[END]
well,done,madam,he,murmured,[END]
the,pistol,shot,sounded,and,the,race,had,begun,[END]
scarlett,didn't,know,that,she,was,shouting,jumping,up,and,down,pounding,on,rhett's,arm,[END]
she,was,even,deaf,to,the,shouts,of,the,people,all,around,them,[END]
when,sweet,sally,won,by,a,half-length,she,let,out,a,yell,of,victory,[END]
we,won,[END]

after,what,you,said,this,afternoon,[END]
you,sounded,so,confident,[END]
he,smiled,[END]
i,despise,pessimism,[END]
and,i,wanted,everyone,to,have,a,good,time,[END]
but,didn't,you,bet,on,sweet,sally,too,[END]
don't,tell,me,you,bet,on,the,yankees,[END]
i,didn't,bet,at,all,[END]
his,jaw,was,hard,with,resolve,[END]
when,the,gardens,at,the,landing,are,cleared,and,planted,i'm,going,to,begin,bringing,the,stables,back,to,life,[END]
i've,already,retrieved,some,of,the,cups,that,butler,horses,won,when,our,colors,were,known,all,over,the,world,[END]
i'll,place,my,first,bet,when,i,have,a,horse,of,my,own,to,bet,on,[END]

that's,for,me,to,know,and,you,not,to,find,out,she,replied,with,a,jaunty,toss,of,her,head,[END]
scarlett,rhett,and,rosemary,laughed,together,[END]
27,[END]
scarlett,received,small,spiritual,benefit,from,mass,the,next,day,[END]
her,whole,focus,was,on,her,own,spirits,and,they,were,very,low,[END]
she'd,hardly,laid,eyes,on,rhett,at,the,big,party,given,by,the,jockey,club,after,the,races,[END]
walking,back,after,mass,she,tried,to,make,an,excuse,that,would,get,her,out,of,eating,with,her,aunts,but,pauline,wouldn't,hear,of,it,[END]
we,have,something,very,important,to,discuss,with,you,she'd,said,[END]
her,tone,was,portentous,[END]
scarlett,braced,herself,for,a,lecture,about,dancing,too,much,with,middleton,courtney,[END]
as,it,turned,out,his,name,wasn't,mentioned,at,all,[END]
eulalie,was,mournful,and,pauline,censorious,about,something,else,altogether,[END]
we've,learned,that,you,haven't,written,to,your,grandfather,robillard,for,years,scarlett,[END]
why,should,i,write,to,him,[END]
he's,nothing,but,a,crabby,old,man,who's,never,lifted,a,finger,for,me,in,my,whole,life,[END]
eulalie,and,pauline,were,shocked,speechless,[END]
good,[END]
thought,scarlett,[END]
her,eyes,gleamed,triumphantly,at,them,above,the,rim,of,her,cup,while,she,drank,her,coffee,[END]
you,don't,have,an,answer,to,that,do,you,[END]
he's,never,done,anything,for,me,and,he's,never,done,a,thing,for,you,either,[END]
who,gave,you,the,money,to,keep,body,and,soul,together,when,this,house,was,about,to,go,for,taxes,[END]
not,your,precious,father,that's,for,sure,[END]
it,was,me,[END]
it,was,me,who,paid,for,uncle,carey,to,get,a,decent,burial,when,he,died,too,and,it's,my,money,that,puts,clothes,on,your,backs,and,food,on,your,table,if,pauline,can,bear,to,open,the,pantry,door,on,the,stuff,she,hoards,in,there,[END]
so,you,can,gape,at,me,like,a,pair,of,goggle-eyed,frogs,but,there's,not,one,single,thing,you,can,say,[END]
but,pauline,echoed,by,eulalie,found,plenty,to,say,[END]
about,respect,for,one's,elders,loyalty,to,one's,family,duty,and,manners,and,good,breeding,[END]
scarlett,set,her,cup,on,its,saucer,with,a,crash,[END]
don't,you,dare,preach,over,me,aunt,pauline,[END]
i'm,sick,to,death,of,it,[END]
i,don't,care,a,fig,for,grandfather,robillard,[END]
he,was,horrid,to,mother,and,he's,been,horrid,to,me,and,i,hate,him,[END]
and,i,don't,care,if,i,burn,in,hell,for,it,[END]
it,felt,good,to,lose,her,temper,[END]
she'd,been,holding,it,in,too,long,[END]
there'd,been,too,many,tea,parties,too,many,receiving,lines,too,many,calls,and,too,many,callers,[END]
too,many,times,when,she'd,had,to,curb,her,tongue,she,who'd,always,said,what,she,thought,and,devil,take,the,hindmost,[END]
most,of,all,too,many,hours,of,listening,politely,to,charlestonians,brag,about,the,glories,of,their,fathers,and,grandfathers,and,great-grandfathers,on,and,on,all,the,way,back,to,the,middle,ages,[END]
the,very,last,thing,pauline,should,have,mentioned,was,respect,due,to,her,family,[END]
the,aunts,cowered,before,scarlett's,outburst,and,their,frightened,faces,gave,her,an,intoxicating,joyful,feeling,of,power,[END]
she'd,always,been,contemptuous,of,weakness,and,in,the,months,she'd,spent,in,charleston,she,had,had,no,power,she'd,been,the,weak,one,and,she'd,begun,to,feel,contempt,for,herself,[END]
now,she,unleashed,on,her,aunts,all,the,disgust,she,had,felt,at,her,own,craven,desire,to,please,[END]
there's,no,need,to,sit,there,staring,at,me,as,if,i,had,horns,on,my,head,and,a,pitchfork,in,my,hand,either,[END]
you,know,i'm,right,but,you're,just,too,lily-livered,to,say,it,for,yourself,[END]
grandfather,treats,everybody,like,dirt,[END]
i'll,bet,you,a,hundred,dollars,that,he,never,answers,all,the,mealymouth,letters,you,write,him,[END]
he,likely,doesn't,even,read,them,[END]
i,know,i,never,once,read,one,all,the,way,through,[END]
i,didn't,have,to,they,were,all,always,the,same,thing,whining,for,more,money,[END]
scarlett,covered,her,mouth,with,her,hand,[END]
she'd,gone,too,far,[END]
she'd,broken,three,of,the,unwritten,inviolate,rules,of,the,southern,code,of,behavior,she'd,said,the,word,money,she'd,reminded,her,dependents,of,the,charity,she'd,given,and,she'd,kicked,a,downed,foe,[END]
her,eyes,when,she,looked,at,her,weeping,aunts,were,stricken,with,shame,[END]
the,mended,china,and,darned,linen,on,the,table,reproached,her,[END]
i,haven't,even,been,very,generous,she,thought,[END]
i,could,have,sent,them,much,more,and,never,missed,it,[END]
i'm,sorry,she,whispered,and,she,began,to,cry,[END]
a,moment,passed,before,eulalie,wiped,her,eyes,and,blew,her,nose,[END]
i,heard,that,rosemary,has,a,new,suitor,she,said,in,a,watery,voice,[END]
have,you,met,him,scarlett,[END]
is,he,an,interesting,person,[END]
is,he,from,a,good,family,[END]
pauline,added,[END]
scarlett,winced,but,only,slightly,[END]
miss,eleanor,knows,his,people,she,said,and,says,they're,very,nice,[END]
rosemary,won't,have,anything,to,do,with,him,[END]
you,know,how,she,is,[END]
she,looked,at,her,aunts',worn,faces,with,real,affection,and,respect,[END]
they,had,kept,the,code,[END]
she,knew,they,would,keep,it,until,the,day,they,died,and,never,refer,to,the,way,she,had,broken,it,[END]
no,southerner,would,ever,deliberately,shame,another,[END]
she,straightened,her,shoulders,and,lifted,her,chin,[END]
his,name,is,elliott,marshall,she,said,and,he's,the,funniest-looking,thing,you'd,ever,want,to,see,skinny,as,a,stick,and,solemn,as,an,owl,[END]
she,forced,a,lilt,into,her,voice,[END]
he,must,be,mighty,brave,though,[END]
rosemary,could,pick,him,up,and,break,him,in,pieces,if,she,got,irritated,enough,[END]
she,leaned,forward,and,widened,her,eyes,[END]
did,you,hear,that,he's,a,yankee,[END]
pauline,and,eulalie,gasped,[END]
scarlett,nodded,rapidly,emphasizing,the,impact,of,the,revelation,[END]
from,boston,she,said,slowly,giving,each,word,full,weight,[END]
and,i,figure,you,can't,get,much,more,yankeefied,than,that,[END]
some,big,fertilizer,outfit,opened,an,office,down,here,and,he's,the,manager,[END]
she,settled,back,more,comfortably,in,her,chair,ready,for,a,long,stay,[END]
when,the,morning,was,spent,she,marvelled,at,the,time,and,rushed,to,the,hall,to,get,her,wrap,[END]

yankees,don't,have,sense,enough,to,know,when,they're,not,welcome,[END]
scarlett,kissed,pauline,and,eulalie,goodbye,at,the,front,door,[END]
thank,you,she,said,simply,[END]
you,come,right,back,and,have,dinner,with,us,if,that,yankee's,there,eulalie,giggled,[END]
yes,you,do,that,said,pauline,[END]
and,do,try,if,you,can,to,come,with,us,to,savannah,for,father's,birthday,party,[END]

pauline's,words,were,blurred,in,scarlett's,ears,[END]
how,could,the,season,be,so,short,[END]
she'd,thought,there,was,lots,of,time,left,to,get,rhett,back,[END]
we'll,see,she,said,hurriedly,i've,got,to,go,now,[END]
scarlett,was,surprised,to,find,rhett's,mother,at,home,alone,[END]
julia,ashley,invited,rosemary,to,dinner,at,her,house,eleanor,told,her,[END]
and,rhett,took,pity,on,the,cooper,boy,[END]
he's,out,sailing,[END]
today,[END]
it's,so,cold,[END]
it,is,[END]
just,when,i'd,begun,to,think,we,were,going,to,escape,winter,altogether,this,year,too,[END]
i,felt,it,yesterday,at,the,races,[END]
the,wind,had,a,real,bite,to,it,[END]
i,took,a,bit,of,a,chill,i,believe,[END]
mrs,butler,suddenly,smiled,in,a,conspiratorial,manner,[END]
what,do,you,say,to,a,quiet,dinner,on,the,card,table,before,the,fire,in,the,library,[END]
it,will,offend,manigo's,dignity,but,i,can,bear,it,if,you,can,[END]
it'll,be,so,cozy,just,the,two,of,us,[END]
i'd,like,that,very,much,miss,eleanor,i,really,would,[END]
suddenly,it,was,what,she,wanted,above,all,things,[END]
it,was,so,nice,when,we,used,to,have,our,quiet,suppers,that,way,she,thought,[END]
before,the,season,[END]
before,rosemary,came,home,[END]
a,voice,in,her,mind,added,before,rhett,came,back,from,the,landing,[END]
it,was,true,though,she,hated,to,admit,it,[END]
life,was,so,much,easier,when,she,wasn't,constantly,listening,for,his,step,watching,for,his,reactions,trying,to,guess,what,he,was,thinking,[END]
the,warmth,of,the,fire,was,so,relaxing,that,scarlett,caught,herself,yawning,[END]
excuse,me,miss,eleanor,she,said,hastily,it's,not,the,company,[END]
i,feel,exactly,the,same,way,said,mrs,butler,[END]
isn't,it,pleasant,[END]
she,yawned,too,and,the,contagion,caught,both,of,them,until,helpless,laughter,took,the,place,of,their,yawns,[END]
scarlett,had,forgotten,how,much,fun,rhett's,mother,could,be,[END]
i,love,you,miss,eleanor,she,said,without,thinking,[END]
eleanor,butler,took,her,hand,[END]
i'm,so,glad,dear,scarlett,[END]
i,love,you,too,[END]
she,sighed,softly,[END]
so,much,so,that,i'm,not,going,to,ask,any,questions,or,make,any,unwelcome,comments,[END]
i,just,hope,you,know,what,you're,doing,[END]
scarlett,squirmed,inwardly,[END]
then,she,bridled,at,the,implied,criticism,[END]
i'm,not,doing',anything,[END]
she,pulled,her,hand,away,[END]
eleanor,ignored,scarlett's,anger,[END]
how,are,eulalie,and,pauline,[END]
she,asked,easily,[END]
i,haven't,seen,either,of,them,to,talk,to,for,ages,[END]
the,season,wears,me,out,[END]
they're,fine,[END]
bossy,as,ever,[END]
they're,trying,to,make,me,go,to,savannah,with,them,for,grandfather's,birthday,[END]
good,heavens,[END]
mrs,butler's,tone,was,incredulous,[END]
you,mean,he's,not,dead,yet,[END]
scarlett,began,to,laugh,again,[END]
that,was,the,first,thing,i,thought,too,but,aunt,pauline,would,have,skinned,me,alive,if,i'd,said,so,[END]
he,must,be,about,a,hundred,[END]
eleanor's,brow,creased,in,thought,and,she,mumbled,under,her,breath,as,she,worked,out,the,arithmetic,[END]
over,ninety,for,sure,she,said,at,last,[END]
i,know,he,was,in,his,late,thirties,when,he,married,your,grandmother,in,1820,i,had,an,aunt,she's,dead,long,since,who,never,got,over,it,[END]
she,was,mad,about,him,and,he'd,been,quite,attentive,to,her,[END]
but,then,solange,your,grandmother,decided,to,notice,him,and,poor,aunt,alice,didn't,stand,a,chance,[END]
i,was,only,ten,at,the,time,but,that,was,old,enough,to,know,what,was,going,on,[END]
alice,tried,to,kill,herself,and,everything,was,in,an,uproar,[END]
scarlett,felt,wide,awake,now,[END]
what,did,she,do,[END]
drank,a,bottle,of,paregoric,[END]
it,was,touch,and,go,whether,she'd,live,or,not,[END]
over,grandfather,[END]
he,was,an,incredibly,dashing,man,[END]
so,handsome,with,that,wonderful,straight,bearing,that,soldiers,have,[END]
and,a,french,accent,of,course,[END]
when,he,said,good,morning',he,sounded,like,a,hero,from,an,opera,[END]
dozens,of,women,were,in,love,with,him,[END]
i,heard,my,father,say,one,time,that,pierre,robillard,was,solely,responsible,for,the,roof,on,the,huguenot,church,[END]
he'd,come,up,from,savannah,once,in,a,while,for,the,services,because,they're,in,french,[END]
the,church,walls,would,practically,bulge,with,a,congregation,full,of,women,and,the,collection,plate,was,filled,to,overflowing,[END]
eleanor,smiled,reminiscently,[END]
come,to,think,of,it,my,aunt,alice,eventually,married,a,professor,of,french,literature,at,harvard,[END]
so,all,the,language,practicing,she,must,have,done,came,in,handy,after,all,[END]
scarlett,refused,to,let,mrs,butler,be,sidetracked,[END]
never,mind,that,tell,me,more,about,grandfather,[END]
and,grandmother,[END]
i,asked,you,about,her,once,but,you,just,brushed,it,off,[END]
eleanor,shook,her,head,[END]
i,don't,know,how,to,describe,your,grandmother,[END]
she,wasn't,like,anybody,else,in,the,world,[END]
was,she,very,beautiful,[END]
yes,and,no,[END]
that's,the,problem,with,talking,about,her,she,was,always,changing,[END]
she,was,so,so,french,[END]
they,have,a,saying,the,french,that,no,woman,can,be,truly,beautiful,who,is,not,also,sometimes,truly,ugly,[END]
they're,such,a,subtle,people,and,so,wise,and,so,impossible,for,an,anglo-saxon,to,understand,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,understand,what,miss,eleanor,was,trying,to,say,[END]
there's,a,portrait,of,her,at,tara,and,she,looks,beautiful,she,said,stubbornly,[END]
yes,she,would,for,her,portrait,[END]
she,could,be,beautiful,or,not,as,she,chose,[END]
she,chose,to,be,anything,she,liked,[END]
she,had,a,quality,of,absolute,stillness,sometimes,and,you'd,almost,forget,she,was,there,[END]
then,she'd,turn,her,slanted,dark,eyes,on,you,and,suddenly,you'd,find,yourself,irresistibly,drawn,to,her,[END]
children,swarmed,to,her,[END]
animals,too,[END]
even,women,felt,it,[END]
it,drove,men,out,of,their,minds,[END]
your,grandfather,was,every,inch,the,military,man,accustomed,to,command,[END]
but,your,grandmother,had,only,to,smile,and,he,became,her,slave,[END]
she,was,considerably,older,than,he,was,and,it,made,no,difference,[END]
she,was,a,catholic,and,it,made,no,difference,she,insisted,on,a,catholic,household,and,catholicism,for,their,children,and,he,agreed,to,everything,although,he,was,rigidly,protestant,[END]
he,would,have,agreed,to,let,them,be,druids,if,that,was,her,desire,[END]
she,was,all,the,world,to,him,[END]
i,remember,when,she,decided,that,she,must,be,surrounded,by,pink,light,because,she,was,getting,older,[END]
he,said,that,no,soldier,would,live,in,a,room,with,so,much,as,a,pink,shade,on,a,lamp,[END]
it,was,too,effeminate,[END]
she,said,it,would,make,her,happy,lots,of,pink,[END]
it,ended,up,that,not,only,the,walls,of,the,rooms,inside,were,painted,but,even,the,house,itself,[END]
he,would,do,anything,to,make,her,happy,[END]
eleanor,sighed,[END]
it,was,all,wonderfully,mad,and,romantic,[END]
poor,pierre,[END]
when,she,died,he,died,too,in,a,way,[END]
he,kept,everything,in,the,house,exactly,the,way,she,had,left,it,[END]
it,was,hard,on,your,mother,and,her,sisters,i,fear,[END]
in,the,portrait,solange,robillard,was,wearing,a,dress,that,clung,to,her,body,so,tightly,that,it,suggested,that,she,was,wearing,nothing,under,it,[END]
that,must,be,what,drove,men,out,of,their,minds,including,her,husband,scarlett,thought,[END]
often,you,remind,me,of,her,eleanor,said,and,scarlett,was,suddenly,interested,again,[END]
how,so,miss,eleanor,[END]
your,eyes,are,shaped,the,same,that,little,upward,tilt,at,the,corner,of,them,[END]
and,you,have,the,same,intensity,you,fairly,vibrate,with,it,[END]
both,of,you,strike,me,as,in,some,way,more,fully,alive,than,most,people,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
she,felt,very,satisfied,[END]
eleanor,butler,looked,at,her,fondly,[END]
now,i,believe,i'll,have,my,nap,she,said,[END]
she,thought,she'd,handled,that,conversation,very,well,[END]
she'd,said,nothing,untrue,but,she'd,managed,to,avoid,saying,too,much,[END]
she,certainly,didn't,want,her,son's,wife,to,know,that,her,grandmother,had,had,many,lovers,and,that,dozens,of,duels,had,been,fought,over,her,[END]
no,telling,what,kind,of,ideas,that,might,put,in,scarlett's,head,[END]
eleanor,was,profoundly,disturbed,by,the,obvious,trouble,between,her,son,and,his,wife,[END]
it,was,not,something,she,could,ask,rhett,about,[END]
if,he,wanted,her,to,know,he,would,have,told,her,[END]
and,scarlett's,reaction,to,her,hint,about,the,unpleasant,situation,with,the,courtney,man,made,it,clear,that,she,didn't,want,to,confide,her,feelings,either,[END]
mrs,butler,closed,her,eyes,and,tried,to,rest,[END]
when,all,was,said,and,done,there,was,nothing,she,could,do,except,hope,for,the,best,[END]
rhett,was,a,grown,man,and,scarlett,a,grown,woman,[END]
even,though,in,her,opinion,they,were,behaving,like,undisciplined,children,[END]
scarlett,was,trying,to,rest,too,[END]
she,was,in,the,card,room,telescope,at,hand,[END]
there,had,been,no,sight,of,tommy,cooper's,sailboat,when,she,looked,[END]
rhett,must,have,taken,him,up,the,river,instead,of,into,the,harbor,[END]
maybe,she,shouldn't,even,look,for,them,[END]
when,she'd,looked,through,the,opera,glasses,at,the,races,she'd,lost,faith,in,anne,she,was,still,hurting,from,it,[END]
for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,felt,old,[END]
and,very,tired,[END]
what,difference,did,it,make,any,of,it,[END]
anne,hampton,was,hopelessly,in,love,with,another,woman's,husband,[END]
hadn't,she,done,the,same,thing,when,she,was,anne's,age,[END]
fallen,in,love,with,ashley,and,ruined,her,life,with,rhett,by,clinging,to,that,hopeless,love,long,after,she,could,see,but,wouldn't,that,the,ashley,she,loved,was,only,a,dream,[END]
would,anne,waste,her,youth,the,same,way,dreaming,of,rhett,[END]
what,was,the,use,of,love,if,all,it,did,was,ruin,things,[END]
scarlett,rubbed,the,back,of,her,hand,across,her,lips,[END]
what's,wrong,with,me,[END]
i'm,brooding,like,an,old,hen,[END]
i've,got,to,do,something,go,for,a,walk,anything,to,shake,off,this,awful,feeling,[END]
manigo,knocked,gently,on,the,door,[END]
you,got,a,caller,if,you,is,home,missus,rhett,[END]
scarlett,was,so,happy,to,see,sally,brewton,that,she,nearly,kissed,her,[END]
take,this,chair,sally,it's,the,closest,to,the,fire,[END]
isn't,it,a,shock,to,have,winter,settle,in,at,last,[END]
i,told,manigo,to,bring,the,tea,tray,[END]
honestly,i,think,seeing,sweet,sally,win,that,race,was,about,the,most,exciting,thing,i,ever,saw,in,my,life,[END]
she,was,babbling,from,relief,[END]
sally,amused,her,with,a,highly,colored,account,of,miles,kissing,their,horse,and,the,jockey,too,[END]
it,lasted,until,manigo,had,set,the,tea,tray,on,the,table,in,front,of,scarlett,and,left,[END]
miss,eleanor's,having,a,rest,or,i'd,let,her,know,you,were,here,said,scarlett,[END]
when,she,wakes,up,[END]
i'll,be,gone,sally,interrupted,[END]
i,know,eleanor,naps,in,the,afternoon,and,rhett,is,out,sailing,and,rosemary,is,at,julia's,[END]
that's,why,i,picked,this,time,to,come,[END]
i,want,to,talk,to,you,alone,[END]
scarlett,spooned,tea,leaves,into,the,pot,[END]
she,was,mystified,[END]
sally,brewton,of,all,people,sounded,uneasy,and,nothing,ever,fazed,sally,[END]
she,poured,hot,water,onto,the,leaves,and,put,the,lid,on,the,pot,[END]
scarlett,i'm,going,to,do,the,unforgivable,said,sally,briskly,[END]
i'm,going,to,meddle,in,your,life,[END]
what's,much,worse,i'm,going,to,give,you,some,unsolicited,advice,[END]
go,ahead,and,have,an,affair,with,middleton,courtney,if,you,want,to,but,for,god's,sake,be,discreet,[END]
what,you're,doing,is,in,appallingly,poor,taste,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,widened,in,shock,[END]
have,an,affair,[END]
only,loose,women,did,things,like,that,[END]
how,dare,sally,brewton,insult,her,this,way,[END]
she,drew,herself,up,to,her,tallest,[END]
i'll,have,you,know,mrs,brewton,that,i'm,just,as,much,a,lady,as,you,are,she,said,stiffly,[END]
then,act,like,it,[END]
meet,middleton,somewhere,in,the,afternoons,and,pleasure,yourself,all,you,like,but,don't,make,your,husband,and,his,wife,and,everyone,in,town,watch,you,two,panting,at,each,other,in,a,ballroom,like,a,dog,after,a,bitch,in,heat,[END]
scarlett,thought,that,nothing,could,be,as,horrifying,as,sally's,words,[END]
the,next,ones,proved,her,wrong,[END]
i,should,warn,you,though,that,he's,not,very,good,in,bed,[END]
he's,don,juan,in,the,ballroom,but,a,village,idiot,once,he,takes,off,his,dancing,pumps,and,tailcoat,[END]
sally,reached,over,to,the,tray,and,shook,the,teapot,[END]
if,you,let,this,steep,much,longer,we'll,be,able,to,tan,hides,with,it,[END]
do,you,want,me,to,pour,[END]
she,peered,closely,at,scarlett's,face,[END]
my,god,she,said,slowly,you're,as,ignorant,as,a,newborn,babe,aren't,you,[END]
i,am,sorry,scarlett,i,didn't,realize,[END]
here,let,me,give,you,a,cup,of,tea,with,lots,of,sugar,[END]
scarlett,drew,back,into,her,chair,[END]
she,wanted,to,cry,to,cover,her,ears,[END]
she'd,admired,sally,been,proud,to,be,a,friend,of,hers,and,sally,had,turned,out,to,be,no,better,than,trash,[END]
my,poor,child,said,sally,if,i,had,known,i,would,have,been,a,lot,easier,on,you,[END]
as,it,is,consider,this,an,accelerated,education,[END]
you're,in,charleston,and,married,to,a,charlestonian,scarlett,[END]
you,can't,afford,to,wrap,your,backwoods,innocence,around,you,as,a,shield,[END]
this,is,an,old,city,with,an,old,civilization,[END]
an,essential,part,of,being,civilized,is,consideration,for,the,sensibilities,of,others,[END]
you,can,do,anything,you,like,provided,you,do,it,discreetly,[END]
the,unpardonable,sin,is,to,force,your,peccadilloes,down,the,throats,of,your,friends,[END]
you,must,make,it,possible,for,others,to,pretend,they,don't,know,what,you're,doing,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,believe,what,she,was,hearing,[END]
this,was,not,at,all,like,pretending,that,initialed,napkins,belonged,to,someone,else,[END]
this,was,disgusting,[END]
although,she,had,married,three,times,while,she,was,in,love,with,someone,else,she,had,never,thought,of,physically,betraying,any,one,of,her,husbands,[END]
she,could,yearn,for,ashley,imagine,ashley's,embraces,but,she,would,never,have,sneaked,off,to,meet,him,for,an,hour,in,bed,[END]
i,don't,want,to,be,civilized,she,thought,with,despair,[END]
she'd,never,be,able,to,look,at,any,woman,in,charleston,again,without,wondering,if,she,and,rhett,were,lovers,or,had,ever,been,lovers,[END]
why,had,she,come,to,this,place,[END]
she,didn't,belong,here,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,belong,in,the,kind,of,place,sally,brewton,was,talking,about,[END]
i,think,you'd,better,go,home,she,said,[END]
i,don't,feel,very,well,[END]
sally,nodded,ruefully,[END]
i,do,apologize,for,upsetting,you,scarlett,[END]
it,may,make,you,feel,better,to,know,that,there,are,lots,of,other,innocents,in,charleston,my,dear,you're,not,the,only,one,[END]
unmarried,girls,and,maiden,ladies,of,all,ages,are,never,told,about,things,they'd,rather,not,know,[END]
there,are,many,faithful,wives,too,[END]
i'm,lucky,enough,to,be,one,of,them,[END]
i'm,sure,miles,has,strayed,a,time,or,two,but,i've,never,been,tempted,[END]
perhaps,you're,the,same,way,i,rather,hope,so,for,your,sake,[END]
i,apologize,again,for,my,clumsiness,scarlett,[END]
i'll,go,now,[END]
pull,yourself,together,and,drink,your,tea,[END]
and,behave,better,with,middleton,[END]
sally,pulled,on,her,gloves,with,quick,practiced,motions,and,started,for,the,door,[END]
wait,[END]
said,scarlett,[END]
please,wait,sally,[END]
i've,got,to,know,[END]
who,[END]
rhett,and,who,[END]
sally's,monkey,face,crumpled,in,sympathy,[END]
nobody,we,know,she,said,gently,[END]
i,swear,to,you,[END]
he,was,only,nineteen,when,he,left,charleston,and,at,that,age,boys,go,to,a,bordello,or,to,a,willing,poor,white,girl,[END]
since,he,returned,he's,demonstrated,great,delicacy,in,refusing,all,offers,without,hurting,any,feelings,[END]
charleston,isn't,a,sink,of,iniquity,dear,[END]
people,don't,feel,any,social,pressure,to,be,constantly,rutting,[END]
i'm,sure,that,rhett,is,faithful,to,you,[END]
i'll,see,myself,out,[END]
as,soon,as,sally,was,gone,scarlett,ran,upstairs,to,her,bedroom,and,locked,herself,in,[END]
she,threw,herself,across,the,bed,and,wept,uncontrollably,[END]
grotesque,visions,assaulted,her,mind,of,rhett,with,one,woman,[END]
another,[END]
still,another,and,another,and,another,of,the,ladies,she,saw,at,parties,every,day,[END]
what,a,fool,she'd,been,to,believe,that,he,would,be,jealous,of,her,[END]
when,she,could,no,longer,bear,her,thoughts,she,rang,for,pansy,then,washed,and,powdered,her,face,[END]
she,couldn't,sit,and,smile,and,talk,with,miss,eleanor,when,she,woke,up,[END]
she,had,to,get,away,at,least,for,a,while,[END]
we're,going,out,she,told,pansy,[END]
hand,me,my,pelisse,[END]
scarlett,walked,for,miles,quickly,and,silently,uncaring,whether,pansy,was,keeping,up,[END]
as,she,passed,charleston's,tall,beautiful,old,houses,she,didn't,see,their,crumbling,pastel,stucco,walls,as,proud,evidence,of,survival,she,saw,only,that,they,cared,not,how,they,looked,to,passers-by,and,turned,their,shoulders,to,the,street,to,face,inward,toward,their,private,walled,gardens,[END]
secrets,[END]
they,keep,their,secrets,she,thought,[END]
except,from,each,other,[END]
everyone,pretends,about,everything,[END]
28,[END]
it,was,nearly,dark,when,scarlett,got,back,and,the,house,looked,silent,and,forbidding,[END]
no,light,showed,through,the,curtains,drawn,each,day,at,sundown,[END]
she,opened,the,door,carefully,making,no,sound,[END]
tell,manigo,that,i,have,a,headache,and,i,don't,want,any,supper,she,said,to,pansy,while,they,were,still,in,the,vestibule,[END]
then,come,undo,my,laces,[END]
i'm,going,straight,to,bed,[END]
manigo,would,have,to,notify,the,kitchen,and,the,family,[END]
she,couldn't,face,conversation,with,anyone,[END]
she,crept,quietly,up,the,stairs,past,the,open,doors,of,the,warmly,lit,drawing,room,[END]
rosemary's,loud,voice,was,proclaiming,miss,julia,ashley's,opinion,about,something,or,other,[END]
scarlett,hastened,her,footsteps,[END]
she,extinguished,the,lamp,and,curled,up,tightly,under,the,covers,after,pansy,undressed,her,trying,to,hide,from,her,own,desperate,unhappiness,[END]
if,only,she,could,sleep,forget,sally,brewton,forget,everything,escape,[END]
darkness,was,all,around,her,mocking,her,dry,sleepless,eyes,[END]
she,couldn't,even,cry,all,her,tears,had,been,spent,in,the,emotional,storm,after,sally's,hellish,revelations,[END]
the,latch,grated,and,light,poured,into,the,room,as,the,door,swung,open,[END]
scarlett,turned,her,head,towards,it,startled,by,the,sudden,brightness,[END]
rhett,was,standing,in,the,doorway,a,lamp,in,his,raised,hand,[END]
it,cast,harsh,shadows,on,the,strong,planes,of,his,wind-burned,face,and,salt-stiff,black,hair,[END]
he,was,still,wearing,the,clothes,he'd,worn,sailing,they,clung,wet,to,his,hard,chest,and,muscled,arms,and,legs,[END]
his,expression,was,dark,with,barely,controlled,emotion,and,he,loomed,huge,and,dangerous,[END]
scarlett's,heart,leapt,with,primitive,fear,yet,her,breath,quickened,from,excitement,[END]
this,was,what,she,had,dreamed,of,rhett,coming,into,her,bedroom,with,passion,overriding,his,cool,self-control,[END]
he,strode,to,the,bed,closing,the,door,with,a,kick,[END]
you,can't,hide,from,me,scarlett,he,said,[END]
get,up,[END]
in,one,motion,his,arm,swept,the,unlit,lamp,off,the,table,onto,the,floor,with,a,splintering,crash,and,his,big,hand,set,the,lighted,one,down,with,such,force,that,it,rocked,perilously,[END]
he,threw,back,the,quilts,grabbed,her,arms,and,dragged,her,from,the,bed,onto,her,feet,[END]
her,dark,tumbled,hair,fell,across,her,neck,and,shoulders,and,over,his,hands,[END]
the,lace,that,edged,the,open,neck,of,her,nightdress,quivered,from,the,pounding,of,her,heart,[END]
hot,blood,stained,her,cheeks,red,and,deepened,the,green,color,of,her,eyes,fixed,on,his,[END]
rhett,threw,her,painfully,against,the,bed's,thick,carved,post,and,backed,away,[END]
damn,you,for,an,interfering,fool,he,said,hoarsely,[END]
i,should,have,killed,you,the,minute,you,set,foot,in,charleston,[END]
scarlett,held,on,to,the,bedpost,to,keep,from,falling,[END]
she,felt,the,surging,thrill,of,danger,in,her,veins,[END]
what,had,happened,to,put,him,in,such,a,state,[END]

rhett's,mouth,twisted,[END]
how,fetching,you,look,my,dear,[END]
bosom,heaving,and,eyes,wide,with,innocence,[END]
the,pity,of,it,is,that,you,probably,are,innocent,by,your,warped,definition,[END]
never,mind,the,pain,you've,caused,a,harmless,woman,by,casting,your,net,over,her,witless,husband,[END]
scarlett's,lips,curved,in,an,uncontrollable,smile,of,victory,[END]
he,was,furious,about,her,conquest,of,middleton,courtney,[END]
she,had,done,it,made,him,admit,that,he,was,jealous,[END]
now,he'd,have,to,admit,that,he,loved,her,she'd,make,him,say,it,[END]
i,don't,give,a,damn,that,you,made,a,spectacle,of,yourself,rhett,said,instead,[END]
in,fact,it,was,rather,diverting,to,watch,a,middleaged,woman,convince,herself,that,she,was,still,an,irresistible,nubile,girl,[END]
you,can't,grow,past,sixteen,can,you,scarlett,[END]
the,height,of,your,ambition,is,to,remain,eternally,the,belle,of,clayton,county,[END]
today,the,joke,ceased,to,be,funny,he,shouted,[END]
scarlett,recoiled,from,the,sudden,noise,[END]
he,clenched,his,fists,visibly,took,command,of,his,fury,[END]
as,i,left,church,this,morning,he,said,quietly,an,old,friend,who,is,also,a,close,cousin,drew,me,to,one,side,and,volunteered,to,serve,as,my,second,when,i,challenge,middleton,courtney,to,a,duel,[END]
he,never,doubted,that,that,must,be,my,intention,[END]
regardless,of,the,truth,of,the,matter,your,good,name,had,to,be,defended,[END]
for,the,sake,of,the,family,[END]
scarlett's,small,white,teeth,bit,into,her,lower,lip,[END]
what,did,you,say,to,him,[END]
exactly,what,i,am,about,to,say,to,you,[END]
a,duel,will,not,be,necessary,[END]
my,wife,is,unaccustomed,to,society,and,acted,in,a,way,subject,to,misinterpretation,because,she,didn't,know,any,better,[END]
i'll,instruct,her,in,what,is,expected,of,her,',[END]
his,arm,moved,as,rapidly,as,a,striking,snake,and,his,hand,closed,cruelly,around,her,wrist,[END]
lesson,one,he,said,[END]
he,pulled,her,to,him,with,a,sudden,jerk,[END]
scarlett,was,pinned,against,his,chest,with,her,arm,twisted,and,held,high,on,her,back,[END]
rhett's,face,was,close,above,her,his,eyes,boring,into,hers,[END]
i,do,not,mind,if,the,entire,world,thinks,i'm,a,cuckold,my,dear,devoted,little,wife,but,i,will,not,be,forced,to,fight,middleton,courtney,[END]
rhett's,breath,was,warm,and,salty,in,her,nose,and,on,her,lips,[END]
lesson,two,he,said,[END]
if,i,kill,the,jackass,i,will,have,to,leave,town,or,be,hung,by,the,military,and,that,would,be,inconvenient,for,me,[END]
and,i,certainly,have,no,intention,of,making,myself,an,easy,target,for,him,[END]
he,might,accidentally,shoot,straight,and,wound,me,which,would,be,another,kind,of,inconvenience,[END]
scarlett,struck,at,him,with,her,free,hand,but,he,trapped,it,easily,in,his,and,twisted,it,up,next,to,the,other,[END]
his,arms,were,a,cage,holding,her,against,him,[END]
she,could,feel,the,moisture,in,his,shirt,seeping,through,her,nightdress,to,her,skin,[END]
lesson,three,said,rhett,[END]
it,would,be,the,irony,of,the,age,for,me,or,even,an,imbecile,like,courtney,to,risk,death,in,order,to,save,your,dishonest,little,soul,from,dishonor,[END]
therefore,lesson,four,you,will,follow,my,instructions,for,your,behavior,at,all,public,appearances,until,the,season,is,ended,[END]
no,head-hanging,chagrin,my,pet,[END]
it's,not,your,style,and,it,would,only,add,fuel,to,the,fire,of,gossip,[END]
you,will,hold,your,curled,head,high,and,continue,your,relentless,pursuit,of,lost,youth,[END]
but,you,will,distribute,your,attentions,more,evenly,among,the,beguiled,male,population,[END]
i,will,be,happy,to,advise,you,which,gentlemen,to,favor,[END]
in,fact,i,will,insist,on,giving,you,advice,[END]

lesson,five,you,will,do,exactly,what,i,tell,you,to,do,[END]
away,from,the,heat,of,rhett's,body,the,wet,silk,nightdress,felt,like,ice,on,scarlett's,breasts,and,stomach,[END]
she,crossed,her,arms,over,herself,for,warmth,but,it,was,useless,[END]
her,mind,was,as,icy,as,her,body,and,the,things,he,had,said,rang,clearly,through,it,[END]
he,didn't,care,[END]
he,had,been,laughing,at,her,[END]
he,was,concerned,only,with,his,convenience,[END]
how,dare,he,[END]
how,dare,he,laugh,at,her,in,public,and,revile,her,to,his,skin,and,throw,her,around,in,her,own,room,like,a,sack,of,meal,[END]
a,charleston,gentleman,was,as,much,a,lie,as,a,charleston,lady,[END]
two-faced,lying,double-dealing,[END]
scarlett,lifted,her,fists,to,hit,him,but,he,was,still,gripping,her,shoulders,and,her,balled,hands,fell,ineffectually,on,his,chest,[END]
she,twisted,and,broke,free,[END]
rhett,raised,his,palms,to,ward,off,her,blows,and,laughter,rumbled,low,in,his,brown,throat,[END]
scarlett,lifted,her,hands,only,to,push,her,wild,hair,back,from,her,face,[END]
you,can,save,your,breath,rhett,butler,[END]
i'll,need,no,advice,from,you,because,i,won't,be,here,to,ignore,it,[END]
i,hate,your,precious,charleston,and,i,despise,everybody,in,it,especially,you,[END]
i'm,leaving,tomorrow,[END]
she,faced,him,head-on,her,hands,on,her,hips,her,head,high,her,chin,out,[END]
her,body,was,visibly,trembling,in,the,clinging,silk,[END]
rhett,looked,away,[END]
no,scarlett,he,said,[END]
his,tone,was,leaden,[END]
you,will,not,leave,[END]
flight,would,only,serve,to,confirm,guilt,and,i'd,still,have,to,kill,courtney,[END]
you,blackmailed,me,into,allowing,you,to,stay,for,the,season,scarlett,and,stay,you,will,[END]
and,you,will,do,what,i,tell,you,to,do,and,you,will,appear,to,like,it,[END]
or,i,swear,before,god,that,i,will,break,every,bone,in,your,body,one,after,another,[END]
he,walked,to,the,door,[END]
with,his,hand,on,the,latch,he,looked,back,at,her,and,smiled,mockingly,[END]
and,don't,try,to,do,anything,clever,my,pet,[END]
i,will,be,watching,every,move,you,make,[END]
i,hate,you,[END]
scarlett,shouted,at,the,closing,door,[END]
when,she,heard,a,key,turning,in,the,lock,she,threw,the,mantel,clock,then,the,fireplace,poker,at,it,[END]
too,late,she,thought,of,the,piazza,and,the,other,bedrooms,[END]
when,she,ran,to,their,doors,they,too,were,locked,on,the,outside,[END]
she,returned,to,her,own,room,and,paced,its,length,and,width,until,she,was,exhausted,[END]
at,last,she,slumped,into,a,chair,and,pounded,weakly,on,its,armrests,until,her,hands,were,sore,[END]
i,am,going,to,leave,she,announced,aloud,and,there's,no,way,he,can,stop,me,[END]
the,tall,thick,locked,door,silently,gave,her,the,lie,[END]
there,was,no,point,in,fighting,rhett,she'd,have,to,outwit,him,somehow,[END]
there,had,to,be,a,way,and,she'd,find,it,[END]
no,need,to,burden,herself,with,luggage,she,could,go,with,only,the,clothes,on,her,back,[END]
that's,what,she'd,do,[END]
she'd,go,to,a,tea,or,a,whist,party,or,something,and,just,walk,away,in,the,middle,straight,to,the,horsecar,and,on,to,the,depot,[END]
she,had,plenty,of,money,for,a,ticket,to,where,[END]
as,always,when,scarlett,was,heartsore,she,thought,of,tara,[END]
there,was,peace,there,and,new,strength,[END]
and,suellen,[END]
if,only,tara,was,hers,all,hers,[END]
she,saw,again,the,daydreams,she'd,invented,when,she,visited,julia,ashley's,plantation,[END]
how,could,carreen,have,thrown,away,her,share,the,way,she,had,[END]
scarlett's,head,snapped,up,like,a,woods,animal,scenting,water,[END]
what,good,was,a,share,in,tara,to,the,convent,in,charleston,[END]
they,couldn't,sell,it,even,if,there,was,a,buyer,because,will,would,never,agree,nor,would,she,[END]
maybe,they,got,a,third,share,of,any,profit,from,the,cotton,crop,but,how,much,could,that,possibly,be,[END]
at,best,thirty,or,forty,dollars,a,year,[END]
why,they,would,jump,at,a,chance,to,sell,to,her,[END]
rhett,wanted,her,to,stay,did,he,[END]
fine,[END]
she'd,stay,but,only,if,he,helped,her,get,carreen's,third,of,tara,[END]
then,with,two-thirds,in,her,hand,she'd,offer,to,buy,out,will,and,suellen,[END]
if,will,refused,to,sell,she'd,throw,them,out,[END]
a,stab,of,conscience,halted,her,thoughts,but,scarlett,pushed,it,away,[END]
what,did,it,matter,how,much,will,loved,tara,[END]
she,loved,it,more,[END]
and,she,needed,it,[END]
it,was,the,only,place,she,cared,about,the,only,place,where,anyone,had,ever,cared,about,her,[END]
will,would,understand,he'd,see,that,tara,was,her,only,hope,[END]
she,ran,to,the,bell,pull,and,yanked,on,it,[END]
pansy,came,to,the,door,tried,it,turned,the,key,and,opened,it,[END]
tell,mr,butler,i,want,to,see,him,here,in,my,room,scarlett,said,[END]
and,bring,up,a,supper,tray,[END]
i'm,hungry,after,all,[END]
she,changed,into,a,dry,nightdress,and,a,warm,velvet,dressing,gown,then,brushed,her,hair,smooth,and,tied,it,back,with,a,velvet,ribbon,[END]
her,bleak,eyes,met,themselves,in,the,reflection,of,the,looking,glass,[END]
she,had,lost,[END]
she,wasn't,going,to,get,rhett,back,[END]
it,wasn't,supposed,to,be,like,this,[END]
too,much,too,fast,her,whole,world,had,turned,upside,down,in,only,a,few,hours,[END]
she,was,still,reeling,from,the,shock,of,what,sally,brewton,told,her,[END]
she,couldn't,stand,staying,in,charleston,after,what,she'd,learned,[END]
it,would,be,like,trying,to,build,a,house,on,shifting,sands,[END]
scarlett,pressed,her,hands,to,her,forehead,as,if,to,contain,the,maelstrom,of,confused,thoughts,[END]
she,couldn't,make,sense,of,so,many,things,spinning,through,her,brain,at,one,time,[END]
there,had,to,be,one,thing,she,could,concentrate,on,[END]
all,her,life,she'd,been,successful,if,she,put,all,her,attention,on,one,goal,[END]
tara,[END]
tara,it,would,be,[END]
when,she,finished,gaining,control,of,tara,then,she,would,think,about,all,the,rest,[END]
here's,your,supper,miss,scarlett,[END]
put,the,tray,on,that,table,pansy,and,leave,me,alone,[END]
i'll,ring,when,i'm,done,with,it,[END]
yes'm,[END]
mr,rhett,he,say,he'll,be,along,after,he,eats,[END]
leave,me,alone,[END]
rhett's,expression,was,unreadable,except,for,the,wariness,in,his,eyes,[END]
you,wanted,to,see,me,scarlett,[END]
yes,i,do,[END]
don't,worry,i'm,not,looking,for,a,fight,[END]
i,want,to,offer,you,a,trade,[END]
his,expression,did,not,change,[END]
he,said,nothing,[END]
scarlett,kept,her,voice,cool,and,businesslike,when,she,continued,[END]
you,and,i,both,know,that,you,can,force,me,to,stay,in,charleston,and,go,to,the,balls,and,receptions,[END]
and,we,both,know,that,once,you,get,me,to,one,there's,not,a,single,thing,you,can,do,about,what,i,might,say,or,do,[END]
i'm,offering,to,stay,and,to,act,however,you,want,me,to,act,if,you'll,help,me,get,something,i,want,that,has,nothing,to,do,with,you,or,charleston,[END]
rhett,sat,down,took,out,a,thin,cheroot,clipped,and,lit,it,[END]
i'm,listening,he,said,[END]
she,explained,her,plan,growing,more,intense,with,each,word,she,spoke,[END]
she,waited,eagerly,for,rhett's,opinion,when,she,finished,[END]
i,have,to,admire,your,nerve,scarlett,said,rhett,[END]
i,never,questioned,whether,you,could,hold,your,own,against,general,sherman,and,his,army,but,trying,to,outwit,the,roman,catholic,church,might,be,biting,off,more,than,you,can,chew,[END]
he,was,laughing,at,her,but,it,was,a,friendly,laugh,even,admiring,[END]
as,if,he,too,were,back,in,the,early,days,when,they,were,friends,[END]
i'm,not,trying,to,outwit,anybody,rhett,just,make,an,honest,deal,that's,all,[END]
rhett,grinned,[END]
you,[END]
make,an,honest,deal,[END]
you,disappoint,me,scarlett,[END]
are,you,losing,your,touch,[END]
honestly,[END]
i,don't,know,why,you,have,to,talk,so,ugly,[END]
you,know,very,well,i,wouldn't,take,advantage,of,the,church,[END]
scarlett's,prim,outrage,made,rhett,laugh,even,more,[END]
i,don't,know,anything,of,the,kind,he,said,[END]
tell,me,the,truth,is,this,why,you've,been,trotting,off,to,mass,every,sunday,rattling,your,beads,[END]
have,you,been,planning,this,all,along,[END]
no,i,haven't,[END]
i,can't,imagine,why,it,took,me,so,long,to,think,of,it,[END]
scarlett,covered,her,mouth,with,her,hand,[END]
how,did,rhett,do,it,[END]
he,always,could,surprise,her,into,telling,more,than,she,meant,to,[END]
she,lowered,her,hand,and,scowled,at,him,[END]
well,[END]
are,you,going,to,help,me,or,not,[END]
i'm,willing,to,help,but,i,don't,see,how,i,can,[END]
what,if,the,mother,superior,turns,you,down,[END]
will,you,still,stay,through,the,season,[END]
i,said,i,would,didn't,i,[END]
besides,there's,no,reason,for,her,to,turn,me,down,[END]
i'm,going,to,offer,much,more,than,will,can,possibly,send,her,[END]
you,can,use,your,influence,[END]
you,know,everybody,in,the,world,you,can,always,get,things,done,[END]
rhett,smiled,[END]
what,touching,faith,you,have,in,me,scarlett,[END]
i,know,every,rascal,and,crooked,politician,and,dishonest,businessman,within,a,thousand,miles,but,i,have,no,influence,at,all,with,the,good,people,in,this,world,[END]
the,best,i,can,do,for,you,is,give,you,a,little,advice,[END]
don't,try,to,pull,the,wool,over,the,lady's,eyes,[END]
tell,her,the,truth,if,you,can,and,agree,to,anything,she,asks,[END]
don't,bargain,[END]
what,a,ninny,you,are,rhett,butler,[END]
nobody,pays,asking,price,except,a,fool,[END]
the,convent,doesn't,really,need,money,anyhow,[END]
they've,got,that,big,house,and,all,the,sisters,work,for,no,wages,and,there,are,gold,candlesticks,and,a,big,gold,cross,on,the,altar,in,the,chapel,[END]
though,i,speak,with,the,tongues,of,men,and,of,angels,[END]
',[END]
rhett,murmured,with,a,chuckle,[END]
what,on,earth,are,you,talking,about,[END]
just,quoting,[END]
he,forced,his,face,into,a,serious,expression,but,his,dark,eyes,were,gleeful,[END]
i,wish,you,all,the,luck,in,the,world,scarlett,he,said,[END]
consider,it,my,benediction,[END]
he,left,her,room,with,his,composure,intact,then,he,laughed,with,genuine,delight,[END]
scarlett,would,keep,her,promise,she,always,did,[END]
with,her,help,he'd,smooth,over,the,scandal,then,in,only,two,weeks,the,season,would,end,and,scarlett,would,be,gone,[END]
he'd,be,free,of,the,tension,she,had,brought,to,the,life,he,was,trying,to,build,in,charleston,and,he'd,be,free,to,get,back,to,the,landing,[END]
there,was,so,much,that,he,wanted,to,do,on,the,plantation,[END]
scarlett's,bullheaded,assault,on,the,mother,superior,of,carreen's,convent,should,be,a,good,entertainment,to,divert,him,until,his,life,was,his,own,again,[END]
i'd,bet,on,the,roman,catholic,church,rhett,said,to,himself,[END]
it,thinks,of,time,in,aeons,not,in,weeks,[END]
but,i,wouldn't,want,to,bet,much,[END]
when,scarlett,takes,the,bit,between,her,teeth,she's,a,formidable,force,to,reckon,with,[END]
he,laughed,quietly,for,a,long,time,[END]
as,rhett,had,expected,scarlett's,relations,with,the,mother,superior,were,far,from,simple,[END]
she,won't,say,yes,and,she,won't,say,no,and,she,doesn't,even,listen,when,i,try,to,explain,the,good,sense,of,selling,[END]
scarlett,complained,after,her,first,visit,to,the,convent,[END]
and,her,second,visit,third,fifth,[END]
she,was,baffled,and,frustrated,[END]
rhett,listened,with,kind,patient,attention,while,she,raged,keeping,his,laughter,inside,[END]
he,knew,that,he,was,the,only,person,she,had,to,talk,to,[END]
in,addition,scarlett's,efforts,provided,him,with,fresh,delights,almost,daily,as,she,escalated,her,assault,on,the,holy,mother,church,[END]
she,began,going,to,mass,every,morning,confident,that,word,of,her,devotion,would,get,back,to,the,convent,[END]
then,she,started,visiting,carreen,so,often,that,she,learned,the,names,of,all,the,other,nuns,and,almost,half,of,the,students,[END]
after,a,week,of,gentle,noncommittal,responses,from,the,mother,superior,scarlett,was,so,desperate,that,she,even,began,to,accompany,her,aunts,when,they,paid,calls,on,friends,of,theirs,who,were,also,elderly,catholic,ladies,in,straitened,circumstances,[END]
i,believe,i'm,wearing,my,rosary,beads,down,to,half,their,size,rhett,she,exclaimed,angrily,[END]
how,can,that,awful,old,woman,be,so,mean,[END]
maybe,she,thinks,this,will,save,your,soul,rhett,suggested,[END]
fiddle-dee-dee,[END]
my,soul,is,just,fine,thank,you,very,much,[END]
it's,making,me,gag,at,the,smell,of,incense,that's,what,it's,doing,all,this,church,stuff,[END]
and,i,look,like,a,hag,because,i,never,get,enough,sleep,[END]
i,do,wish,there,wasn't,a,big,party,every,single,night,[END]
nonsense,[END]
those,shadows,under,your,eyes,make,you,look,spiritual,[END]
they,must,impress,the,mother,superior,enormously,[END]
oh,[END]
rhett,what,a,horrid,thing,to,say,[END]
i'll,have,to,go,powder,right,this,minute,[END]
in,fact,the,lack,of,sleep,was,beginning,to,show,on,scarlett's,face,[END]
and,frustration,was,etching,small,vertical,lines,between,her,eyebrows,[END]
everyone,in,old,charleston,was,talking,about,what,they,assumed,to,be,some,kind,of,religious,fervor,[END]
scarlett,was,a,different,person,[END]
at,receptions,and,balls,she,was,polite,but,abstracted,[END]
the,belle-temptress,had,retired,[END]
she,no,longer,accepted,invitations,to,play,whist,and,she'd,stopped,calling,on,the,ladies,at,whose,at-home,days,she,had,become,a,fixture,[END]
i'm,all,in,favor,of,honoring,god,sally,brewton,said,one,day,[END]
i,even,give,up,something,i,really,love,for,lent,[END]
but,i,think,scarlett's,going,too,far,[END]
it's,extravagant,[END]
emma,anson,disagreed,[END]
it,makes,me,think,much,better,of,her,than,i,did,before,[END]
you,know,i,thought,you,were,foolish,to,sponsor,her,the,way,you,did,sally,[END]
she,was,obviously,an,ignorant,vain,little,climber,[END]
now,i'm,willing,to,eat,my,words,[END]
there's,something,admirable,about,anyone,with,serious,religious,feelings,[END]
even,popish,ones,[END]
wednesday,morning,in,the,second,week,of,scarlett's,siege,was,dark,and,cold,and,rainy,[END]
i,just,can't,walk,all,the,way,to,the,convent,through,this,downpour,she,moaned,i'll,ruin,my,only,pair,of,boots,[END]
she,thought,with,longing,of,the,butlers',former,coachman,ezekiel,[END]
he,had,showed,up,like,a,magical,genie,from,a,bottle,on,the,two,rainy,nights,they,were,going,out,[END]
all,this,charleston,pretense,is,crazy,and,disgusting,but,i'd,be,glad,to,put,up,with,it,today,if,i,could,just,ride,in,a,nice,warm,dry,carriage,[END]
but,i,can't,[END]
and,i,have,to,go,so,i,will,[END]
mother,superior,left,this,morning,early,to,go,to,georgia,for,a,meeting,at,the,order's,school,there,said,the,nun,who,opened,the,convent's,door,[END]
no,one,knew,exactly,how,long,the,meeting,would,last,[END]
perhaps,one,day,or,several,or,maybe,a,week,or,more,[END]
i,don't,have,a,week,or,more,scarlett,shouted,inwardly,i,can't,even,afford,to,waste,a,day,[END]
she,plodded,back,to,the,house,through,the,rain,[END]
throw,away,these,damned,boots,she,ordered,pansy,[END]
and,get,me,out,some,dry,clothes,[END]
pansy,was,even,more,soaked,than,she,was,[END]
with,an,ostentatious,fit,of,pitiful,coughing,she,limped,off,to,do,scarlett's,bidding,[END]
i,should,take,a,strap,to,that,girl,scarlett,said,to,herself,but,she,was,more,heartsick,than,angry,[END]
the,rain,stopped,in,the,afternoon,[END]
miss,eleanor,and,rosemary,decided,to,go,up,to,king,street,shopping,[END]
scarlett,didn't,even,want,to,do,that,[END]
she,sat,in,her,room,brooding,until,the,walls,seemed,to,be,closing,in,on,her,then,she,went,downstairs,to,the,library,[END]
maybe,rhett,would,be,there,to,provide,some,sympathy,[END]
she,couldn't,talk,to,anyone,else,about,her,frustration,because,she,hadn't,told,anyone,else,what,she,was,doing,[END]
how,goes,the,reformation,of,the,catholic,church,[END]
he,asked,raising,one,eyebrow,[END]
she,burst,into,an,angry,account,of,the,mother,superior's,flight,[END]
he,made,sympathetic,noises,while,he,cut,and,lit,a,thin,cigar,[END]
i'm,going,out,onto,the,piazza,to,smoke,he,said,when,it,was,glowing,to,his,satisfaction,[END]
come,out,and,get,some,air,[END]
the,rainstorm,brought,summer,back,again,it's,very,warm,now,that,it's,blown,out,to,sea,[END]
the,sunlight,was,dazzling,after,the,dim,interior,of,the,dining,room,[END]
scarlett,shaded,her,eyes,breathing,in,the,damp,green,smell,of,the,garden,and,the,salt,tang,of,the,harbor,and,the,pungent,masculinity,of,cigar,smoke,[END]
suddenly,she,was,acutely,aware,of,rhett's,presence,[END]
she,was,so,disturbed,that,she,walked,away,several,paces,and,his,voice,when,he,spoke,seemed,to,come,from,a,great,distance,[END]
i,believe,that,the,school,the,sisters,have,in,georgia,is,in,savannah,[END]
you,might,go,down,after,the,saint,cecilia,for,your,grandfather's,birthday,[END]
your,aunts,have,been,nagging,you,enough,[END]
if,it's,an,important,church,meeting,the,bishop,will,be,there,perhaps,you'll,have,better,luck,with,him,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,think,about,rhett's,suggestion,but,she,couldn't,concentrate,[END]
not,with,him,so,near,[END]
strange,to,feel,so,shy,when,lately,they'd,been,so,comfortable,together,[END]
he,was,leaning,against,one,of,the,columns,placidly,enjoying,his,smoke,[END]
i'll,see,she,said,and,she,left,in,a,rush,before,she,began,to,cry,[END]
what,on,earth,is,wrong,with,me,[END]
she,thought,as,tears,streamed,from,her,eyes,[END]
i'm,turning,into,a,spineless,cry-baby,just,the,kind,of,creature,i,despise,[END]
so,what,if,it,takes,a,little,longer,to,get,what,i,want,[END]
i,will,have,tara,[END]
and,rhett,too,if,it,takes,a,hundred,years,[END]
29,[END]
i,have,never,been,so,annoyed,in,all,my,long,years,said,eleanor,butler,[END]
her,hands,were,shaking,when,she,poured,the,tea,[END]
a,crushed,thin,paper,sheet,was,on,the,floor,near,her,feet,[END]
the,telegram,had,arrived,while,she,and,rosemary,were,out,shopping,cousin,townsend,ellinton,and,his,wife,were,coming,down,from,philadelphia,to,visit,[END]
two,days',notice,[END]
eleanor,exclaimed,[END]
can,you,credit,it,[END]
you'd,think,they'd,never,heard,of,the,war,[END]
they'll,be,staying,in,a,suite,at,the,charleston,hotel,mama,rhett,said,soothingly,and,we'll,take,them,to,the,ball,[END]
it,won't,be,too,bad,[END]
it,will,be,awful,said,rosemary,[END]
i,don't,see,any,reason,we,have,to,put,ourselves,out,to,be,nice,to,yankees,[END]
because,they're,our,kin,said,her,mother,severely,[END]
and,you,will,be,extremely,nice,[END]
besides,your,cousin,townsend,isn't,a,yankee,at,all,[END]
he,fought,with,general,lee,[END]
rosemary,frowned,and,was,silent,[END]
miss,eleanor,began,to,laugh,[END]
i,must,stop,complaining,she,said,[END]
it'll,be,worth,it,in,the,long,run,to,see,townsend,and,henry,wragg,meet,each,other,[END]
townsend's,cross-eyed,and,henry's,wall-eyed,[END]
do,you,suppose,they'll,be,able,to,manage,to,shake,hands,[END]
the,ellintons,weren't,so,bad,scarlett,thought,even,though,you,didn't,know,where,to,look,when,you,talked,to,cousin,townsend,[END]
his,wife,hannah,wasn't,as,beautiful,as,miss,eleanor,had,predicted,which,was,agreeable,[END]
however,her,pearl-sewn,ruby,brocade,ball,gown,and,diamond,dog-collar,made,scarlett,feel,miserably,frumpy,in,her,tired,claret,velvet,and,camellias,[END]
thank,heaven,this,was,the,last,ball,and,the,end,of,the,season,[END]
i,would,have,called,anybody,a,liar,if,they'd,said,i,could,ever,get,tired,of,dancing,but,i've,had,more,than,my,fill,[END]
oh,if,only,everything,was,settled,about,tara,[END]
she,had,followed,rhett's,advice,she'd,thought,about,going,to,savannah,[END]
but,the,prospect,of,day,after,day,with,her,aunts,was,more,than,she,could,bear,and,she,had,decided,to,wait,for,the,mother,superior's,return,to,charleston,[END]
rosemary,was,going,to,visit,miss,julia,ashley,so,that,thorn,would,be,out,of,her,flesh,[END]
and,miss,eleanor,was,always,good,company,[END]
rhett,was,going,to,the,landing,[END]
she,wouldn't,think,about,that,now,[END]
if,she,did,she'd,never,be,able,to,get,through,the,evening,[END]
do,tell,cousin,townsend,scarlett,said,brightly,all,about,general,lee,[END]
is,he,really,as,handsome,as,everybody,says,[END]
ezekiel,had,polished,the,carriage,and,groomed,the,horses,until,they,looked,fit,to,carry,royalty,[END]
he,stood,by,the,carriage,block,holding,the,door,open,ready,to,assist,if,needed,when,rhett,helped,his,ladies,to,step,up,into,the,carriage,[END]
i,still,say,that,the,ellintons,should,be,riding,with,us,eleanor,stewed,[END]
we'd,be,squashed,to,death,rosemary,grumbled,[END]
rhett,told,her,to,be,quiet,[END]
there's,nothing,to,fret,about,mama,he,said,[END]
they're,directly,in,front,of,us,in,the,finest,rig,hannah's,money,can,rent,[END]
when,we,get,to,meeting,street,we'll,pass,them,so,we,can,be,there,first,to,escort,them,in,[END]
there's,nothing,whatsoever,to,worry,about,[END]
there's,plenty,and,you,know,it,rhett,[END]
yes,they're,nice,people,and,townsend's,kin,but,that,doesn't,alter,the,fact,that,hannah's,a,dyed-in-the-wool,yankee,[END]
i'm,afraid,she'll,be,pouted,to,death,[END]
be,what,[END]
asked,scarlett,[END]
rhett,explained,[END]
charlestonians,had,a,particularly,vicious,and,cunning,game,developed,after,the,war,[END]
they,treated,outsiders,with,so,much,graciousness,and,consideration,that,their,politeness,became,a,weapon,[END]
visitors,end,up,feeling,as,if,they're,wearing,shoes,for,the,first,time,in,their,lives,[END]
it's,said,that,only,the,strongest,ever,recover,from,the,experience,[END]
i,hope,we,won't,be,treated,to,a,display,of,it,tonight,[END]
the,chinese,never,developed,a,torture,to,match,it,although,they're,a,very,subtle,people,[END]
rhett,[END]
please,stop,begged,his,mother,[END]
scarlett,said,nothing,[END]
that's,what,they've,been,doing,to,me,she,thought,grimly,[END]
well,let,them,[END]
i,don't,have,to,put,up,with,charleston,much,longer,[END]
after,the,turn,onto,meeting,street,the,carriage,moved,into,place,at,the,end,of,a,long,line,of,carriages,one,by,one,they,stopped,to,release,passengers,then,slowly,moved,on,[END]
it'll,be,over,before,we,get,there,at,this,rate,scarlett,thought,[END]
she,looked,out,the,window,at,people,walking,the,ladies,followed,by,their,maids,carrying,their,slipper,bags,[END]
i,wish,we'd,walked,too,[END]
it,would,be,lovely,to,be,out,in,the,warm,air,instead,of,cooped,up,in,this,stuffy,little,space,[END]
she,was,startled,by,the,sharp,clanging,of,a,streetcar,bell,to,their,left,[END]
how,can,there,be,a,streetcar,running,[END]
she,wondered,[END]
they,always,stopped,at,nine,o'clock,[END]
she,heard,the,bells,from,st,michael's,steeple,ring,two,full,rounds,[END]
it,was,half,past,[END]
isn't,it,nice,to,see,the,streetcar,with,nobody,on,it,but,people,dressed,for,a,ball,[END]
said,eleanor,butler,[END]
did,you,know,scarlett,that,they,always,stop,running,the,cars,early,on,the,night,of,the,saint,cecilia,so,they,can,scrub,them,out,before,they,make,the,special,runs,to,take,people,to,the,ball,[END]
i,didn't,know,that,miss,eleanor,[END]
how,do,people,get,home,[END]
oh,they,run,another,special,at,two,when,the,ball's,over,[END]
what,if,somebody,wants,to,ride,who,isn't,going,to,the,ball,[END]
they,can't,of,course,[END]
nobody,would,even,think,of,it,[END]
everybody,knows,the,cars,don't,run,after,nine,o'clock,[END]
rhett,laughed,[END]
mama,you,sound,like,the,duchess,in,alice,in,wonderland,[END]
eleanor,butler,began,to,laugh,too,[END]
i,suppose,i,do,she,sputtered,cheerfully,then,laughed,even,harder,[END]
she,was,still,laughing,when,the,carriage,moved,forward,and,stopped,and,the,door,was,pulled,open,[END]
scarlett,looked,out,onto,a,scene,that,made,her,catch,her,breath,[END]
this,was,the,way,a,ball,should,be,[END]
tall,black,iron,poles,held,a,pair,of,enormous,lanterns,brightly,lit,with,a,half,dozen,gas,jets,[END]
they,illuminated,the,deep,portico,and,towering,white,columns,of,a,temple-like,building,set,back,from,the,street,behind,a,tall,iron,fence,[END]
a,gleaming,white,canvas,walkway,led,from,the,scoured,white,marble,carriage,block,to,the,portico's,steps,[END]
over,walkway,and,block,a,white,canvas,awning,had,been,erected,[END]
just,think,she,said,marvelling,you,could,go,from,your,carriage,to,the,ball,in,the,pouring,rain,and,not,a,drop,of,water,would,touch,you,[END]
that's,the,idea,rhett,agreed,but,it's,never,been,tested,[END]
it,never,rains,on,the,night,of,the,saint,cecilia,[END]
god,wouldn't,dare,[END]
rhett,[END]
eleanor,butler,was,genuinely,shocked,[END]
scarlett,smiled,at,rhett,pleased,that,he,could,make,fun,of,something,that,he,took,as,seriously,as,this,ball,[END]
he'd,told,her,all,about,it,how,many,years,and,years,it,had,been,going,on,everything,in,charleston,seemed,to,have,been,around,for,at,least,a,hundred,years,how,it,was,completely,run,by,men,[END]
only,men,could,be,members,of,the,society,[END]
step,down,scarlett,said,rhett,you,should,feel,right,at,home,here,[END]
this,building,is,the,hibernian,hall,[END]
inside,you'll,see,a,plaque,with,the,harp,of,ireland,in,best,gold,paint,[END]
don't,be,rude,scolded,his,mother,[END]
scarlett,stepped,out,with,her,pugnacious,chin,so,like,her,irish,father's,held,high,[END]
what,were,those,yankee,soldiers,doing,[END]
scarlett's,throat,contracted,with,momentary,fear,[END]
were,they,planning,to,cause,trouble,because,they'd,been,beaten,by,the,ladies,before,[END]
then,she,saw,the,crowds,behind,them,eager,faces,bobbing,from,side,to,side,in,an,effort,to,see,the,figures,emerging,from,the,carriages,[END]
why,the,yankees,are,holding,people,back,to,make,a,path,for,us,[END]
just,like,servants,like,the,torch,boys,or,the,footmen,[END]
serves,them,right,[END]
why,don't,they,just,give,up,and,go,away,[END]
nobody,pays,them,any,mind,anyhow,[END]
she,looked,over,the,heads,of,the,soldiers,and,smiled,brilliantly,at,the,staring,crowds,before,she,stepped,down,from,the,carriage,block,[END]
if,only,she,could,have,had,a,new,gown,instead,of,this,tired,old,thing,[END]
she'd,just,have,to,make,the,best,of,it,[END]
she,took,three,steps,forward,then,expertly,cast,the,gown's,train,from,across,her,arm,to,fall,behind,her,[END]
it,spread,out,on,the,white,walkway,untouched,by,dust,to,sweep,regally,behind,her,as,she,promenaded,into,the,ball,of,the,season,[END]
she,paused,in,the,entrance,hall,waiting,for,the,others,[END]
her,eyes,were,drawn,upward,following,the,graceful,arc,of,the,staircase,to,the,second,floor's,wide,landing,and,the,glittering,candlelit,crystal,chandelier,suspended,over,the,soaring,open,space,[END]
it,was,like,the,biggest,brightest,jewel,in,the,world,[END]
here,are,the,ellintons,said,mrs,butler,[END]
come,this,way,hannah,we'll,leave,our,wraps,in,the,ladies',cloakroom,[END]
but,hannah,ellinton,stopped,short,in,the,doorway,and,backed,away,involuntarily,[END]
rosemary,and,scarlett,had,to,move,aside,quickly,to,avoid,running,into,the,ruby,brocade,figure,in,front,of,them,[END]
what,could,be,wrong,[END]
scarlett,craned,her,neck,to,see,[END]
the,scene,had,become,so,familiar,to,her,during,the,season,that,she,couldn't,imagine,why,hannah,was,so,shocked,[END]
several,girls,and,women,were,seated,on,a,low,bench,near,the,wall,[END]
their,skirts,were,pulled,up,above,their,knees,their,feet,in,basins,of,soapy,water,[END]
while,they,gossiped,and,laughed,with,one,another,their,maids,washed,and,dried,and,powdered,their,feet,then,unrolled,their,mended,stockings,up,their,legs,and,put,their,dancing,slippers,on,[END]
it,was,the,regular,routine,for,all,the,women,who,walked,through,the,city's,dusty,streets,to,the,season's,balls,[END]
what,did,the,yankee,woman,expect,[END]
that,people,would,dance,in,their,boots,[END]
she,nudged,mrs,ellinton,[END]
you're,blocking,the,door,she,said,[END]
hannah,apologized,and,moved,on,inside,[END]
eleanor,butler,turned,from,the,mirror,where,she,was,rearranging,her,hairpins,[END]
good,she,said,i,was,afraid,for,a,minute,that,i'd,lost,you,[END]
she,hadn't,seen,hannah's,reaction,[END]
i,want,you,to,meet,sheba,[END]
she'll,take,care,of,anything,you,need,tonight,[END]
mrs,ellinton,was,led,unprotestingly,to,the,corner,of,the,room,where,the,fattest,woman,she,had,ever,seen,was,sitting,in,a,wide,worn,faded,brocade,wing,chair,her,goldenbrown,skin,only,a,tone,darker,than,the,gold,brocade,[END]
sheba,pushed,herself,up,from,her,throne,to,be,presented,to,mrs,butler's,guest,[END]
and,to,mrs,butler's,daughter-in-law,[END]
scarlett,hurried,over,eager,to,see,the,woman,she'd,heard,so,much,about,[END]
sheba,was,famous,[END]
everyone,knew,that,she,was,the,best,seamstress,in,all,charleston,trained,when,she,was,the,rutledges',slave,by,the,modiste,mrs,rutledge,imported,from,paris,to,make,her,daughter's,trousseau,[END]
she,still,sewed,for,mrs,rutledge,and,her,daughter,and,a,few,select,ladies,of,her,choosing,[END]
sheba,could,remake,rags,and,flour,sacks,into,creations,as,elegant,as,anything,in,godey's,lady's,book,[END]
baptized,queen,of,sheba,by,her,lay-preacher,father,she,was,indeed,a,queen,in,her,own,world,[END]
she,ruled,the,ladies',cloakroom,at,the,saint,cecilia,every,year,supervising,her,two,neatly,uniformed,maids,and,any,maids,accompanying,the,ladies,in,rapid,effective,action,to,meet,any,and,all,feminine,emergencies,[END]
torn,hems,spots,and,stains,lost,buttons,drooping,curls,faintness,overeating,bruised,insteps,broken,hearts,sheba,and,her,minions,dealt,with,them,all,[END]
every,ball,had,a,room,set,aside,for,ladies',needs,and,maids,to,staff,it,but,only,the,saint,cecilia,had,queen,of,sheba,[END]
she,politely,refused,to,work,her,magic,at,any,ball,other,than,the,finest,[END]
she,could,afford,to,be,particular,[END]
rhett,had,told,scarlett,what,most,people,knew,but,no,one,said,aloud,[END]
sheba,owned,the,most,lavish,and,profitable,whorehouse,on,notorious,mulatto,alley,the,stretch,of,chalmers,street,only,two,blocks,from,the,saint,cecilia,where,officers,and,soldiers,of,the,occupying,military,forces,spent,the,better,part,of,their,pay,packets,on,cheap,whiskey,crooked,gambling,wheels,and,women,of,every,age,every,shade,of,skin,and,every,price,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,hannah,ellinton's,bewildered,expression,[END]
i'll,bet,she's,one,of,those,abolitionists,who's,never,seen,a,black,person,close,up,in,her,life,she,thought,[END]
i,wonder,what,she'd,do,if,somebody,told,her,about,sheba's,other,business,[END]
rhett,said,sheha's,got,more,than,a,million,dollars,in,gold,in,a,vault,in,a,bank,in,england,[END]
i,doubt,the,ellintons,can,match,that,[END]
30,[END]
then,scarlett,reached,the,entrance,to,the,ballroom,it,was,her,turn,to,stop,short,unaware,that,there,were,others,following,her,[END]
she,was,overwhelmed,by,a,beauty,that,was,magical,too,lovely,to,be,real,[END]
the,huge,ballroom,was,lit,brilliantly,yet,softly,by,candlelight,[END]
from,four,cascades,of,crystal,that,seemed,to,float,high,above,[END]
from,paired,gilt-and-crystal,sconces,on,the,long,side,walls,[END]
from,tall,giltframed,mirrors,that,reflected,the,flames,again,and,again,in,opposing,images,[END]
from,night-black,tall,windows,that,acted,as,mirrors,[END]
from,tall,multi-armed,silver,candelabra,on,long,tables,at,each,side,of,the,door,holding,monumental,silver,punch,bowls,that,held,curving,light,reflections,golden,in,their,rounded,sides,[END]
scarlett,laughed,with,delight,and,stepped,across,the,sill,[END]
are,you,having,a,good,time,[END]
rhett,asked,her,much,later,[END]
my,yes,[END]
it,really,is,the,best,ball,of,the,season,[END]
she,meant,it,the,evening,had,been,everything,a,ball,should,be,filled,with,music,and,laughter,and,happiness,on,all,sides,[END]
she'd,been,less,than,pleased,when,she,was,given,her,dance,card,even,though,it,was,presented,with,a,bouquet,of,gardenias,framed,in,silver-lace,paper,[END]
the,governors,of,the,society,it,seemed,filled,in,the,names,on,all,the,ladies',cards,in,advance,[END]
but,then,she,saw,that,the,regimentation,was,masterfully,orchestrated,[END]
she,was,partnered,by,men,she,knew,men,she,had,never,met,before,old,men,young,men,long-time,charlestonians,visiting,guests,charlestonians,who,lived,in,many,other,places,but,always,came,home,for,the,saint,cecilia,[END]
so,that,every,dance,held,the,tantalizing,potential,of,surprise,and,the,assurance,of,change,[END]
and,no,embarrassment,[END]
middleton,courtney's,name,wasn't,on,her,card,[END]
she,had,nothing,to,think,about,except,the,pleasure,of,being,in,the,exquisite,room,dancing,to,the,beautiful,music,[END]
it,was,the,same,for,everyone,[END]
scarlett,giggled,when,she,saw,her,aunts,dancing,every,dance,even,eulalie's,usually,sorrowful,face,was,alight,with,pleasure,[END]
there,were,no,wallflowers,here,[END]
and,no,awkwardnesses,[END]
the,terribly,young,debutantes,in,their,fresh,white,gowns,were,paired,with,men,skillful,at,both,dancing,and,conversation,[END]
she,saw,rhett,with,at,least,three,of,them,but,never,with,anne,hampton,[END]
scarlett,wondered,briefly,how,much,the,wise,old,governors,knew,[END]
she,didn't,care,[END]
it,made,her,happy,[END]
and,it,made,her,laugh,to,see,the,ellintons,[END]
hannah,was,obviously,feeling,like,the,belle,of,the,ball,[END]
she,must,be,dancing,with,the,biggest,flatterers,in,charleston,scarlett,thought,maliciously,[END]
no,she,decided,townsend,looked,like,he,was,having,an,even,better,time,than,his,wife,[END]
somebody,sure,must,be,sweet,talking,him,[END]
they'd,certainly,never,forget,this,night,[END]
for,that,matter,neither,would,she,[END]
the,sixteenth,dance,was,coming,up,soon,[END]
it,was,reserved,josiah,anson,told,her,when,they,were,waltzing,for,sweethearts,and,married,couples,[END]
at,the,saint,cecilia,husbands,and,wives,were,always,newly,in,love,he,said,with,mock,solemnity,[END]
he,was,president,of,the,society,so,he,knew,[END]
it,was,one,of,the,saint,cecilia's,rules,[END]
she,would,be,dancing,it,with,rhett,[END]
so,when,he,took,her,in,his,arms,and,asked,her,if,she,was,enjoying,herself,she,said,yes,with,all,her,heart,[END]
at,one,o'clock,the,orchestra,played,the,last,phrase,of,the,blue,danube,waltz,and,the,ball,was,over,[END]
but,i,don't,want,it,to,be,over,scarlett,said,not,ever,[END]
good,replied,miles,brewton,one,of,the,governors,that's,exactly,how,we,hope,everyone,will,feel,[END]
now,everyone,goes,downstairs,for,supper,[END]
the,society,prides,itself,on,its,oyster,stew,almost,as,much,as,on,its,punch,[END]
i,hope,you've,had,a,cup,of,our,famous,mixture,[END]
indeed,i,have,[END]
i,thought,the,top,of,my,head,was,going,to,lift,right,off,[END]
the,saint,cecilia,punch,was,composed,largely,of,excellent,champagne,mixed,with,superlative,brandy,[END]
we,old,fellows,find,it,helpful,for,a,night,of,dancing,[END]
it,goes,to,our,feet,not,our,heads,[END]
fiddle-dee-dee,miles,[END]
sally,always,said,that,you,were,the,best,dancer,in,charleston,and,i,thought,she,was,just,bragging,[END]
but,now,i,know,she,was,only,telling,the,simple,truth,[END]
scarlett's,dimpling,smiling,extravagant,raillery,was,so,automatic,that,she,didn't,even,have,to,think,what,she,was,saying,[END]
what,was,taking,rhett,so,long,[END]
why,was,he,talking,to,edward,cooper,instead,of,escorting,her,to,supper,[END]
sally,brewton,would,never,forgive,her,for,tying,miles,up,this,way,[END]
oh,thank,goodness,rhett,was,coming,[END]
i'd,never,let,you,claim,your,enchanting,wife,if,you,weren't,so,much,bigger,than,i,rhett,[END]

a,great,privilege,ma'am,[END]
a,great,pleasure,sir,she,replied,with,a,curtsey,[END]
my,god,rhett,drawled,i,might,as,well,go,beg,sally,to,run,away,with,me,[END]
she's,turned,me,down,the,last,fifty,times,but,my,luck,might,have,changed,[END]
the,three,of,them,went,laughing,in,search,of,sally,[END]
she,was,sitting,on,a,windowsill,holding,her,slippers,in,her,hand,[END]
who,ever,said,that,the,proof,of,the,perfect,ball,is,that,you,dance,through,the,soles,of,your,slippers,[END]
she,asked,plaintively,[END]
i,did,and,now,i've,got,blisters,on,both,feet,[END]
miles,picked,her,up,[END]
i'll,carry,you,down,you,troublesome,woman,but,then,you,cover,your,feet,like,a,respectable,person,and,hobble,to,supper,[END]
brute,[END]
said,sally,[END]
scarlett,saw,the,look,they,exchanged,and,her,heart,cramped,with,envy,[END]
what,fascinating,thing,were,you,talking,about,with,edward,cooper,for,so,long,[END]
i'm,starving,[END]
she,looked,at,rhett,and,the,pain,grew,worse,[END]
i,won't,think,about,it,[END]
i,won't,ruin,this,perfect,night,[END]
he,was,informing,me,that,due,to,my,bad,influence,tommy's,grades,in,school,are,falling,[END]
as,a,punishment,he's,selling,the,little,boat,the,boy,loves,so,much,[END]
that's,cruel,[END]
scarlett,exclaimed,[END]
the,boy,will,get,it,back,[END]
i,bought,it,[END]
now,let's,get,to,supper,before,all,the,oysters,are,gone,[END]
for,once,in,your,life,scarlett,you're,going,to,have,more,food,than,you,can,possibly,eat,[END]
even,ladies,gorge,themselves,[END]
it's,traditional,[END]
the,season,is,over,and,it's,almost,lent,[END]
it,was,shortly,after,two,when,the,doors,to,the,hibernian,hall,opened,[END]
the,young,black,torch,boys,were,yawning,when,they,took,their,positions,to,light,the,revellers,out,[END]
as,their,torches,were,lit,the,dark,waiting,streetcar,on,meeting,street,came,to,life,on,its,tracks,[END]
the,driver,turned,up,the,blue-globed,lamp,on,its,roof,and,the,tall-chimneyed,lanterns,by,the,doors,[END]
the,horses,stamped,their,feet,and,bobbed,their,heads,[END]
a,white-aproned,man,swept,the,canvas,walkway,free,of,the,scattering,of,leaves,that,had,accumulated,then,slid,back,the,long,iron,bolt,and,swung,wide,the,gates,[END]
he,disappeared,into,the,shadows,just,as,the,sound,of,voices,poured,from,the,building,[END]
for,three,blocks,along,the,street,carriages,waited,to,move,in,turn,to,collect,their,passengers,[END]
wake,up,they're,coming,ezekiel,growled,to,the,sleeping,boys,in,the,footman,livery,[END]
they,jerked,at,his,prodding,finger,then,grinned,and,scrambled,down,from,their,resting,place,at,his,feet,[END]
people,came,pouring,through,the,open,doors,talking,laughing,pausing,on,the,porch,reluctant,to,see,the,end,of,the,evening,[END]
as,they,did,every,year,they,said,that,this,had,been,the,best,saint,cecilia,ever,the,best,orchestra,the,best,food,the,best,punch,the,best,time,they,had,ever,had,[END]
the,streetcar,driver,spoke,to,his,horses,[END]
i'll,get,you,to,your,stable,boys,don't,you,fret,[END]
he,pulled,the,handle,near,his,head,and,the,brightly,polished,bell,beside,the,blue,light,clanged,its,summons,[END]
good,night,good,night,cried,obedient,riders,to,the,people,on,the,porch,and,first,one,couple,then,three,then,a,laughing,avalanche,of,young,people,ran,along,the,white,canvas,path,[END]
their,elders,smiled,and,made,comments,about,the,tirelessness,of,youth,[END]
they,moved,at,a,slower,more,dignified,pace,[END]
in,some,cases,their,dignity,failed,to,hide,a,certain,unsteadiness,of,the,legs,[END]
scarlett,plucked,rhett's,sleeve,[END]
oh,do,let's,ride,the,car,rhett,[END]
the,air,feels,so,good,and,the,carriage,will,be,stuffy,[END]
there's,a,long,walk,after,we,get,off,[END]
i,don't,care,[END]
i'd,love,to,walk,some,[END]
he,took,a,deep,breath,of,the,fresh,night,air,[END]
i,would,too,he,said,[END]
i'll,tell,mama,[END]
go,on,to,the,car,and,save,us,a,place,[END]
they,hadn't,far,to,ride,[END]
the,streetcar,turned,east,on,broad,street,only,a,block,away,then,moved,grandly,through,the,silent,city,to,the,end,of,broad,in,front,of,the,post,office,building,[END]
it,was,a,merry,noisy,continuation,of,the,party,[END]
almost,everyone,on,the,crowded,car,joined,in,the,song,started,by,three,laughing,men,when,the,car,teetered,around,the,corner,[END]
oh,the,rock,island,line,its,a,fine,line,[END]
the,rock,island,line,it,is,the,road,to,ride,[END]
musically,the,performance,left,much,to,be,desired,but,the,singers,neither,knew,nor,cared,[END]
scarlett,and,rhett,sang,as,loudly,as,the,rest,[END]
when,they,stepped,down,from,the,car,she,continued,to,join,in,every,time,the,chorus,was,repeated,[END]
get,your,ticket,at,the,station,for,the,rock,island,line,[END]
rhett,and,three,other,volunteers,helped,the,driver,unharness,the,horses,lead,them,to,the,opposite,end,of,the,car,and,rehitch,them,for,the,journey,back,along,broad,then,up,meeting,to,the,terminal,[END]
they,returned,waves,and,cries,of,good,night,as,the,car,moved,away,taking,the,singers,with,it,[END]
do,you,suppose,they,know,any,other,song,[END]
scarlett,asked,[END]
rhett,laughed,[END]
they,don't,even,know,that,one,and,to,tell,the,truth,neither,do,i,it,didn't,seem,to,make,much,difference,[END]
scarlett,giggled,[END]
then,she,put,her,hand,over,her,mouth,[END]
her,giggle,had,sounded,very,loud,now,that,the,rock,island,line,was,faint,in,the,distance,[END]
she,watched,the,lighted,car,become,smaller,then,stop,then,start,then,disappear,as,it,turned,the,corner,[END]
it,was,very,quiet,and,very,dark,outside,the,pool,of,light,thrown,by,the,street,lamp,in,front,of,the,post,office,[END]
a,breath,of,wind,played,with,the,fringe,on,her,shawl,[END]
the,air,was,balmy,and,soft,[END]
it's,real,warm,she,whispered,to,rhett,[END]
he,murmured,a,wordless,affirmative,and,took,out,his,pocket,watch,held,it,in,the,lamplight,[END]
listen,he,said,quietly,[END]
scarlett,listened,[END]
everything,was,still,[END]
she,held,her,breath,to,listen,harder,[END]
now,[END]
said,rhett,[END]
saint,michael's,bells,chimed,once,twice,[END]
the,notes,hung,in,the,warm,night,for,a,long,time,[END]
half,past,rhett,said,with,approval,[END]
he,replaced,the,watch,in,its,pocket,[END]
both,of,them,had,taken,quite,a,bit,of,punch,[END]
they,were,in,the,condition,known,as,high,flown,where,everything,was,somewhat,magnified,in,effect,[END]
the,darkness,was,blacker,the,air,warmer,the,silence,deeper,the,memory,of,the,pleasant,evening,even,more,enjoyable,than,the,ball,itself,[END]
each,felt,a,quietly,glowing,inner,well-being,[END]
scarlett,yawned,happily,and,tucked,a,hand,into,rhett's,elbow,[END]
without,a,word,they,began,to,walk,into,the,darkness,toward,home,[END]
their,footsteps,were,loud,on,the,brick,sidewalk,bounced,back,from,the,buildings,[END]
scarlett,looked,uneasily,from,side,to,side,and,over,her,shoulder,at,the,looming,post,office,[END]
she,couldn't,recognize,anything,[END]
it's,so,quiet,she,thought,like,we,were,the,only,people,on,the,face,of,the,earth,[END]
rhett's,tall,form,was,a,part,of,the,darkness,his,white,shirt,front,covered,by,his,black,evening,cape,[END]
scarlett,tightened,her,hold,on,his,arm,above,the,crook,of,the,elbow,[END]
it,was,firm,and,strong,the,powerful,arm,of,a,powerful,man,[END]
she,moved,a,little,closer,to,his,side,[END]
she,could,feel,the,warmth,of,his,body,sense,the,bulk,and,strength,of,it,[END]
wasn't,that,a,wonderful,party,[END]
she,said,too,loudly,[END]
her,voice,echoed,sounding,strange,to,her,ears,[END]
i,thought,i'd,laugh,out,loud,at,old,look-down-your-nose,hannah,[END]
my,grief,when,she,got,a,taste,of,how,southerners,treat,folks,her,head,was,so,turned,i,expected,her,to,start,walking,backwards,to,see,where,she,was,going,[END]
rhett,chuckled,[END]
poor,hannah,he,said,she,may,never,again,in,her,life,feel,so,delightfully,attractive,and,witty,[END]
townsend's,no,fool,[END]
he,told,me,he,wants,to,move,back,to,the,south,[END]
this,visit,will,probably,make,hannah,agree,[END]
there's,a,foot,of,snow,on,the,ground,in,philadelphia,[END]
scarlett,laughed,softly,into,the,balmy,darkness,then,smiled,with,warm,contentment,[END]
when,she,and,rhett,walked,through,the,light,of,the,next,streetlamp,she,saw,that,he,was,smiling,too,[END]
there,was,no,further,need,to,talk,[END]
it,was,enough,that,they,were,both,feeling,good,both,smiling,walking,together,in,no,hurry,to,be,any,place,else,[END]
their,route,took,them,past,the,docks,[END]
the,sidewalk,abutted,a,long,row,of,ships,chandlers,narrow,buildings,with,tightly,shuttered,shops,on,street,level,and,the,darkened,windows,of,living,quarters,above,[END]
many,of,the,windows,were,open,to,the,almost-summery,warmth,of,the,night,[END]
a,dog,barked,half-heartedly,at,the,sound,of,their,steps,[END]
rhett,commanded,it,to,be,quiet,his,own,voice,muted,[END]
the,dog,whimpered,once,then,was,still,[END]
they,walked,forward,past,widely,spaced,street,lamps,[END]
rhett,adjusted,his,long,stride,automatically,to,match,scarlett's,shorter,one,and,the,sound,of,heels,on,brick,became,a,single,clack,clack,clack,clack,testimony,of,the,comfortable,unity,of,the,moment,[END]
one,street,lamp,had,gone,out,[END]
in,the,patch,of,greater,darkness,scarlett,noticed,for,the,first,time,that,the,sky,seemed,very,near,its,spangling,of,stars,brighter,than,she,could,remember,them,ever,before,[END]
one,star,looked,almost,close,enough,to,touch,[END]
rhett,look,at,the,sky,she,said,softly,[END]
the,stars,look,so,close,[END]
he,stopped,walking,put,his,hand,over,hers,to,signal,her,to,stop,too,[END]
it's,because,of,the,sea,he,said,the,sound,of,his,voice,low,and,warm,[END]
we're,past,the,warehouses,now,and,there's,only,water,[END]
listen,and,you,can,hear,it,breathing,[END]
they,stood,very,still,[END]
scarlett,strained,to,hear,[END]
the,rhythmic,slap,slap,of,the,moving,water,against,the,invisible,pilings,of,the,seawall,became,audible,[END]
gradually,it,seemed,to,get,louder,until,she,was,amazed,she,hadn't,been,hearing,it,all,the,time,[END]
then,another,sound,merged,with,the,cadence,of,the,tidal,river,[END]
it,was,music,a,thin,high,slow,procession,of,notes,[END]
the,purity,of,them,made,her,eyes,fill,with,unexpected,tears,[END]
do,you,hear,it,[END]
she,asked,fearfully,[END]
was,she,imagining,things,[END]
yes,[END]
it's,a,homesick,sailor,on,the,ship,anchored,out,there,[END]
the,tune,is,across,the,wide,missouri,',[END]
they,make,those,flute-like,whistles,themselves,[END]
some,of,them,have,a,real,gift,for,playing,[END]
he,must,have,the,watch,[END]
see,there's,a,lantern,in,the,rigging,that's,where,the,ship,is,[END]
the,lantern's,supposed,to,warn,any,other,ship,traffic,that,she's,anchored,there,but,you,always,have,a,man,on,watch,too,to,look,for,anything,approaching,[END]
maybe,two,in,busy,lanes,like,this,river,[END]
there,are,always,small,boats,people,who,know,the,river,moving,at,night,when,no,one,can,see,them,[END]
why,would,they,do,that,[END]
a,thousand,reasons,all,of,them,either,dishonest,or,noble,depending,on,who's,telling,the,story,[END]
rhett,sounded,as,if,he,were,talking,to,himself,more,than,to,scarlett,[END]
she,looked,at,him,but,it,was,too,dark,to,see,his,face,[END]
she,looked,back,at,the,ship's,lantern,that,she,had,mistaken,for,a,star,and,listened,to,the,tide,and,the,music,of,the,yearning,anonymous,sailor,[END]
saint,michael's,bells,rang,the,three-quarter,hour,[END]
scarlett,tasted,salt,on,her,lips,[END]
do,you,miss,the,blockade,running,rhett,[END]
he,laughed,once,[END]
let's,just,say,i'd,like,to,be,ten,years,younger,[END]
he,laughed,again,lightly,mocking,amused,at,himself,[END]
i,play,with,sailboats,under,the,guise,of,being,kind,to,confused,young,men,[END]
it,gives,me,the,pleasure,of,being,on,the,water,and,feeling,the,wind,blowing,free,[END]
there's,nothing,like,it,for,making,a,man,feel,like,a,god,[END]
he,moved,forward,pulling,scarlett,into,motion,[END]
their,pace,was,slightly,faster,but,still,in,step,[END]
scarlett,tasted,the,air,and,thought,of,the,wing-like,sails,of,the,small,boats,that,skimmed,the,harbor,almost,flying,[END]
i,want,to,do,that,she,said,i,want,to,go,sailing,more,than,anything,in,the,whole,world,[END]
oh,rhett,will,you,take,me,[END]
it's,as,warm,as,summer,you,don't,absolutely,have,to,go,back,to,the,landing,tomorrow,[END]
say,you,will,please,rhett,[END]
he,thought,for,a,moment,[END]
very,soon,she'd,be,out,of,his,life,forever,[END]
why,not,[END]
it's,a,shame,to,waste,the,weather,he,said,[END]
scarlett,pulled,at,his,arm,[END]
come,on,let's,hurry,[END]
it's,late,and,i,want,to,get,an,early,start,[END]
rhett,held,back,[END]
i,won't,be,able,to,take,you,sailing,if,you've,got,a,broken,neck,scarlett,[END]
watch,your,step,[END]
we've,only,got,a,few,more,blocks,to,go,[END]
she,fell,into,step,with,him,again,smiling,to,herself,[END]
it,was,wonderful,to,have,something,to,look,forward,to,[END]
just,before,they,reached,the,house,rhett,stopped,stopping,her,[END]
wait,a,second,[END]
his,head,was,lifted,up,listening,[END]
scarlett,wondered,what,he,was,hearing,[END]
oh,for,heaven's,sake,it,was,just,saint,michael's,clock,again,[END]
the,chimes,ended,and,the,deep,reverberating,single,bell,tolled,three,times,[END]
distant,but,distinct,in,the,warm,darkness,the,voice,of,the,watchman,in,the,steeple,called,to,the,sleeping,old,city,[END]
three,[END]
o'clock,[END]
and,all's,well,[END]
31,[END]
rhett,looked,at,the,costume,scarlett,had,assembled,with,such,care,and,one,eyebrow,skidded,upward,while,his,mouth,twitched,downward,at,the,corner,[END]
well,i,didn't,want,to,get,sunburned,again,she,said,defensively,[END]
she,was,wearing,a,wide-brimmed,straw,hat,that,mrs,butler,kept,near,the,garden,door,for,protection,from,the,sun,when,she,went,out,to,cut,flowers,[END]
she,had,wrapped,yards,of,bright,blue,tulle,around,the,crown,of,the,hat,and,tied,the,ends,under,her,chin,in,a,bow,that,she,thought,very,becoming,[END]
she,had,her,favorite,parasol,with,her,a,saucy,pale,blue,flowered,silk,pagoda-shape,with,a,dark,blue,tasselled,fringe,[END]
it,kept,her,dull,proper,brown,twill,walking-out,costume,from,being,so,boring,she,thought,[END]
what,made,rhett,think,he,could,criticize,anybody,else,anyhow,[END]
he,looked,like,a,field,hand,she,thought,in,those,beat-up,old,breeches,and,that,plain,shirt,without,so,much,as,a,collar,never,mind,a,proper,cravat,and,coat,[END]
scarlett,set,her,jaw,[END]
you,said,nine,o'clock,rhett,and,that's,what,it,is,[END]
shall,we,go,[END]
rhett,made,a,sweeping,bow,then,picked,up,a,battered,canvas,bag,and,slung,it,over,his,shoulders,[END]
we,shall,go,he,said,[END]
there,was,something,suspicious,about,his,voice,[END]
he's,up,to,something,scarlett,thought,but,i'm,not,about,to,let,him,get,away,with,it,[END]
she'd,had,no,idea,that,the,boat,was,so,small,[END]
or,that,it,would,be,at,the,bottom,of,a,long,ladder,that,looked,so,slimy,wet,[END]
she,looked,accusingly,at,rhett,[END]
nearly,low,tide,he,said,[END]
that's,why,we,had,to,get,here,by,nine-thirty,[END]
after,the,tide,turns,at,ten,we,would,have,a,hard,time,getting,into,the,harbor,[END]
of,course,it,will,be,a,help,bringing,us,back,up,the,river,to,dock,[END]
if,you're,quite,certain,that,you,want,to,go,[END]
quite,thank,you,[END]
scarlett,put,her,white-gloved,hand,on,one,projecting,rail,of,the,ladder,and,started,to,turn,around,[END]
wait,[END]
said,rhett,[END]
she,looked,up,at,him,with,a,stonily,determined,face,[END]
i'm,not,willing,to,let,you,break,your,neck,to,spare,me,the,trouble,of,taking,you,out,for,an,hour,[END]
that,ladder's,very,slippery,[END]
i'll,go,down,one,rung,before,you,to,make,sure,you,don't,lose,your,footing,in,those,foolish,city,boots,[END]
stand,by,while,i,get,ready,[END]
he,opened,the,drawstring,of,the,canvas,bag,and,took,out,a,pair,of,canvas,shoes,with,rubber,soles,[END]
scarlett,watched,in,silent,stubbornness,[END]
rhett,took,his,time,removing,his,hoots,putting,on,the,shoes,placing,the,boots,in,the,bag,tightening,the,drawstring,making,an,intricate-looking,knot,in,it,[END]
he,looked,at,her,with,a,sudden,smile,that,took,her,breath,away,[END]
stay,right,there,scarlett,a,wise,man,knows,when,he's,beaten,[END]
i'll,stow,this,gear,and,come,back,for,you,[END]
in,a,flash,he,hoisted,the,bag,on,his,shoulder,and,was,halfway,down,the,ladder,before,scarlett,understood,what,he,was,talking,about,[END]
you,skinnied,down,and,up,that,thing,like,greased,lightning,she,said,with,honest,admiration,when,rhett,was,beside,her,again,[END]
or,a,monkey,he,corrected,[END]
come,on,my,dear,time,and,tide,wait,for,no,man,not,even,a,woman,[END]
scarlett,was,no,stranger,to,ladders,and,she,had,a,good,head,for,heights,[END]
as,a,child,she,had,climbed,trees,to,their,topmost,swaying,branches,and,scampered,up,into,the,hayloft,of,the,barn,as,if,its,narrow,ladder,were,a,broad,flight,of,stairs,[END]
but,she,was,grateful,for,rhett's,steadying,arm,around,her,waist,on,the,algae-coated,rungs,and,very,glad,to,reach,the,relative,stability,of,the,small,boat,[END]
she,sat,quietly,on,the,board,seat,in,the,stern,while,rhett,efficiently,attached,the,sails,to,the,mast,and,tested,the,lines,[END]
the,white,canvas,lay,in,heaps,on,the,covered,bow,and,inside,the,open,cockpit,[END]
ready,[END]
he,said,[END]
oh,yes,[END]
then,let's,cast,off,[END]
he,freed,the,lines,that,hugged,the,tiny,sloop,to,the,dock,and,pushed,away,from,the,barnacle-crusted,pier,support,with,a,paddle,[END]
the,fast-running,ebb,tide,grabbed,the,little,boat,at,once,and,pulled,it,into,the,river,[END]
sit,where,you,are,and,keep,your,head,down,on,your,knees,rhett,ordered,[END]
he,hoisted,the,jib,cleared,halyard,and,sheet,and,the,narrow,sail,filled,with,wind,luffing,gently,[END]
now,[END]
rhett,sat,on,the,seat,beside,scarlett,and,hooked,his,elbow,over,the,tiller,between,them,[END]
with,his,two,hands,he,began,to,haul,up,the,mainsail,[END]
there,was,a,great,noise,of,creaking,and,rattling,[END]
scarlett,stole,a,sideways,look,without,lifting,her,head,[END]
rhett's,eyes,were,squinting,against,the,sun,and,he,was,frowning,in,concentration,[END]
but,he,looked,happy,as,happy,as,she,had,ever,seen,him,[END]
the,mainsail,bellied,out,with,a,booming,snap,and,rhett,laughed,[END]
good,girl,[END]
he,said,[END]
scarlett,knew,that,he,wasn't,talking,to,her,[END]
are,you,ready,to,go,in,[END]
oh,no,rhett,[END]
not,ever,[END]
scarlett,was,in,a,transport,of,delight,with,the,wind,and,the,sea,unconscious,of,the,spray,spotting,her,clothes,the,water,running,across,her,boots,the,total,ruin,of,her,gloves,and,miss,eleanor's,hat,the,loss,of,her,parasol,[END]
she,had,no,thoughts,only,sensation,[END]
the,sloop,was,a,mere,sixteen,feet,long,its,hull,sometimes,barely,inches,above,the,sea,[END]
it,rode,waves,and,current,like,an,eager,young,animal,climbing,to,the,crests,then,swooping,into,the,troughs,with,a,dashing,plunge,that,left,scarlett's,stomach,somewhere,high,up,near,her,throat,and,threw,a,fan,of,salty,droplets,into,her,face,and,open,exultant,mouth,[END]
she,was,part,of,it,she,was,the,wind,and,the,water,and,the,salt,and,the,sun,[END]
rhett,looked,at,her,rapt,expression,smiled,at,the,sodden,foolish,tulle,bow,under,her,chin,[END]
duck,he,ordered,and,put,the,tiller,over,for,a,short,tack,into,the,wind,[END]
they'd,stay,out,a,bit,longer,[END]
would,you,like,to,take,the,tiller,[END]
he,offered,[END]
i'll,teach,you,to,sail,her,[END]
scarlett,shook,her,head,[END]
she,had,no,desire,to,control,she,was,happy,simply,to,be,[END]
rhett,knew,how,remarkable,it,was,for,scarlett,to,turn,down,an,opportunity,to,rule,understood,the,depth,of,her,response,to,the,joyous,freedom,of,sail,on,sea,[END]
he,had,felt,the,same,rapture,often,in,his,youth,[END]
even,now,he,had,brief,moments,of,it,from,time,to,time,moments,that,sent,him,back,onto,the,water,again,and,again,in,search,of,more,[END]
duck,he,said,again,[END]
and,put,the,little,sloop,into,a,long,reach,[END]
the,suddenly,increased,speed,brought,water,foaming,onto,the,deep-slanted,edge,of,the,hull,[END]
scarlett,let,out,a,cry,of,delight,[END]
overhead,the,cry,was,repeated,by,a,soaring,sea,gull,bright,white,against,the,high,wide,cloudless,blue,sky,[END]
rhett,looked,up,and,grinned,[END]
the,sun,was,warm,on,his,back,the,wind,sharp,and,salty,on,his,face,[END]
it,was,a,good,day,to,be,alive,[END]
he,lashed,the,tiller,and,moved,forward,in,a,stoop,to,get,the,canvas,bag,[END]
the,sweaters,he,pulled,out,of,it,were,stretched,and,misshapen,with,age,stiff,with,dried,brine,[END]
they,were,made,of,thick,wool,in,a,blue,so,dark,that,it,looked,almost,black,[END]
rhett,crab-walked,back,to,the,stern,and,sat,down,on,the,raked,outer,edge,of,the,cockpit,[END]
the,cant,of,the,hull,dropped,with,his,weight,and,the,lively,little,boat,hissed,through,the,water,on,an,almost,even,keel,[END]
put,this,on,scarlett,[END]
he,held,one,of,the,sweaters,out,to,her,[END]
i,don't,need,it,[END]
it's,like,summertime,today,[END]
the,air's,warm,enough,but,not,the,water,[END]
it's,february,whether,it,seems,like,summer,or,not,[END]
the,spray,will,chill,you,without,your,knowing,it,[END]
put,on,the,sweater,[END]
scarlett,made,a,face,but,she,took,the,sweater,from,him,[END]
you'll,have,to,hold,my,hat,[END]
i'll,hold,your,hat,[END]
rhett,pulled,the,second,grimier,sweater,over,his,head,[END]
then,he,helped,scarlett,[END]
her,head,emerged,and,the,wind,assaulted,her,dishevelled,hair,pulling,it,free,from,dislodged,combs,and,hairpins,and,tossing,it,in,long,dark,leaping,streamers,[END]
she,shrieked,and,grabbed,wildly,at,it,[END]
now,look,what,you've,done,[END]
she,shouted,[END]
the,wind,whipped,a,thick,strand,of,hair,into,her,open,mouth,making,her,sputter,and,blow,[END]
when,she,pulled,the,hair,free,it,tore,out,of,her,grasp,and,flew,into,snarled,witches',locks,with,the,rest,[END]
give,me,my,hat,quick,before,i'm,bald-headed,she,said,[END]
my,grief,i'm,a,mess,[END]
she,had,never,in,her,life,looked,so,beautiful,[END]
her,face,was,alight,with,joy,rosy,from,windburn,glowing,amid,the,wild,dark,cloud,of,hair,[END]
she,tied,the,ridiculous,hat,firmly,on,her,head,tucked,her,subdued,tangled,hair,into,the,back,of,the,sweater,[END]
i,don't,suppose,you,have,anything,to,eat,in,that,bag,of,yours,do,you,[END]
she,asked,hopefully,[END]
only,sailors',rations,said,rhett,hardtack,and,rum,[END]
that,sounds,delicious,[END]
i've,never,tasted,either,one,[END]
it's,not,much,past,eleven,scarlett,[END]
we'll,be,home,for,dinner,[END]
restrain,yourself,[END]
can't,we,stay,out,all,day,[END]
i'm,having,such,a,good,time,[END]
another,hour,i,have,a,meeting,with,my,lawyers,this,afternoon,[END]
bother,your,lawyers,said,scarlett,but,under,her,breath,[END]
she,refused,to,get,angry,and,spoil,her,pleasure,[END]
she,looked,at,the,sunspangled,water,and,the,white,curls,of,foam,on,each,side,of,the,bow,then,flung,out,her,arms,and,arched,her,back,in,a,luxurious,cat-like,stretch,[END]
the,sleeves,of,the,sweater,were,so,long,that,they,extended,past,her,hands,flapping,in,the,wind,[END]
careful,my,pet,rhett,laughed,you,might,blow,away,[END]
he,freed,the,tiller,preparing,to,come,about,looking,automatically,for,any,other,vessels,that,might,be,in,his,proposed,path,[END]
look,scarlett,he,said,urgently,quick,[END]
out,there,to,starboard,to,your,right,[END]
i'll,bet,you've,never,seen,that,before,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,scanned,the,marshy,shore,in,the,near,distance,[END]
then,halfway,between,boat,and,shore,a,gleaming,gray,shape,curved,above,the,water,for,a,moment,before,disappearing,beneath,it,[END]
a,shark,[END]
she,exclaimed,[END]
no,two,three,sharks,[END]
they're,coming,right,at,us,rhett,[END]
do,they,want,to,eat,us,[END]
my,dear,imbecilic,child,those,are,dolphins,not,sharks,[END]
they,must,be,heading,for,the,ocean,[END]
hold,tight,and,duck,[END]
i'm,going,to,bring,her,around,tight,[END]
maybe,we,can,travel,with,them,[END]
it's,the,most,charming,thing,in,the,world,to,be,in,the,middle,of,a,school,of,them,[END]
they,love,to,play,[END]
play,[END]
fish,[END]
you,must,think,i'm,mighty,gullible,rhett,[END]
she,bent,under,the,swinging,boom,[END]
they,aren't,fish,[END]
just,watch,[END]
you'll,see,[END]
there,were,seven,dolphins,in,the,pod,[END]
by,the,time,rhett,maneuvered,the,sloop,onto,the,course,the,sleek,mammals,were,following,the,dolphins,were,far,ahead,[END]
rhett,stood,and,shaded,his,eyes,against,the,sun,[END]
damn,[END]
he,said,[END]
then,immediately,in,front,of,the,sloop,a,dolphin,leapt,from,the,water,bowed,its,back,and,dived,with,a,splash,back,into,the,water,[END]
scarlett,pounded,on,rhett's,thigh,with,a,sweater-mittened,fist,[END]
did,you,see,that,[END]
rhett,dropped,onto,the,seat,[END]
i,saw,it,[END]
he,came,to,tell,us,to,get,a,move,on,[END]
the,others,are,probably,waiting,for,us,[END]
look,[END]
two,dolphins,had,broken,water,ahead,[END]
their,graceful,leaps,made,scarlett,clap,her,hands,[END]
she,pushed,the,sweater,sleeves,up,her,arms,and,clapped,again,this,time,successfully,[END]
two,yards,to,her,right,the,first,dolphin,surfaced,cleared,his,blow,hole,with,a,spurt,of,spume,then,lazily,rocked,back,down,into,the,water,[END]
oh,rhett,i,never,saw,anything,so,darling,[END]
it,was,smiling,at,us,[END]
rhett,was,smiling,too,[END]
i,always,think,they're,smiling,and,i,always,smile,back,[END]
i,love,dolphins,always,have,[END]
the,dolphins,treated,rhett,and,scarlett,to,what,could,only,be,called,a,game,[END]
they,swam,alongside,under,across,the,bow,sometimes,singly,sometimes,in,twos,or,threes,[END]
diving,and,surfacing,blowing,rolling,leaping,looking,from,eyes,that,seemed,human,seemed,to,be,laughing,above,the,engaging,smile-like,mouth,at,the,clumsy,boat-bound,man,and,woman,[END]
there,[END]
rhett,pointed,when,one,burst,from,the,surface,in,a,leap,and,there,[END]
scarlett,yelled,when,another,leapt,in,the,opposite,direction,[END]
there,[END]
and,there,[END]
and,there,[END]
whenever,the,dolphins,broke,water,[END]
it,was,a,surprise,each,time,always,in,a,spot,that,was,different,from,the,places,where,scarlett,and,rhett,were,looking,[END]
they're,dancing,scarlett,insisted,[END]
frolicking,rhett,suggested,[END]
showing,off,they,agreed,[END]
the,show,was,enchanting,[END]
because,of,it,rhett,was,careless,[END]
he,didn't,see,the,dark,patch,of,cloud,that,was,spreading,across,the,horizon,behind,them,[END]
his,first,warning,was,when,the,steady,fresh,wind,suddenly,dropped,[END]
the,taut,billowing,sails,went,limp,and,the,dolphins,nosed,abruptly,down,into,the,water,and,disappeared,[END]
he,looked,then,too,late,over,his,shoulder,and,saw,the,squall,racing,over,the,water,and,the,sky,[END]
get,down,into,the,belly,of,the,boat,scarlett,he,said,quietly,and,hold,on,[END]
we're,about,to,have,a,storm,[END]
don't,be,frightened,i've,sailed,through,much,worse,[END]
she,looked,behind,and,her,eyes,widened,[END]
how,could,it,be,so,sunny,and,blue,in,front,of,them,and,so,black,back,there,[END]
without,a,word,she,slid,down,and,found,a,handhold,beneath,the,seat,where,she,and,rhett,had,been,sitting,[END]
he,was,making,rapid,adjustments,to,the,rigging,[END]
we'll,have,to,run,before,it,he,said,then,he,grinned,[END]
you'll,get,wet,but,it,will,be,a,hell,of,a,ride,[END]
at,that,moment,the,squall,hit,[END]
day,turned,to,liquid,near-night,as,the,clouds,blackened,the,sky,and,loosed,sheets,of,rain,on,them,[END]
scarlett,opened,her,mouth,to,cry,out,and,it,was,immediately,filled,with,water,[END]
we'll,have,to,run,before,it,he,said,then,he,grinned,[END]
you'll,get,wet,but,it,will,be,a,hell,of,a,ride,[END]

day,turned,to,liquid,near-night,as,the,clouds,blackened,the,sky,and,loosed,sheets,of,rain,on,them,[END]
scarlett,opened,her,mouth,to,cry,out,and,it,was,immediately,filled,with,water,[END]
my,god,i'm,drowning,she,thought,[END]
she,bent,over,and,spat,and,coughed,until,her,mouth,and,throat,were,clear,[END]
she,tried,to,lift,her,head,to,see,what,was,happening,to,ask,rhett,what,was,that,terrible,noise,[END]
but,her,giddy,battered,hat,was,collapsed,onto,her,face,and,she,couldn't,see,anything,[END]
i've,got,to,get,rid,of,it,or,i'll,suffocate,[END]
she,tore,at,the,tulle,bow,under,her,chin,with,her,free,hand,[END]
her,other,hand,was,desperately,gripping,the,metal,handle,she,had,found,[END]
the,boat,was,pitching,and,yawing,creaking,as,if,it,was,coming,apart,[END]
she,could,feel,the,sloop,racing,down,down,it,must,be,almost,standing,on,its,nose,it's,going,to,go,straight,through,the,water,right,to,the,bottom,of,the,sea,[END]
oh,sweet,mother,of,god,i,don't,want,to,die,[END]
with,a,shudder,the,sloop,stopped,its,plunge,[END]
scarlett,pulled,the,wet,tulle,roughly,over,her,chin,over,her,face,and,she,was,free,of,the,smothering,folds,of,wet,straw,[END]
she,could,see,[END]
she,looked,at,the,water,then,up,at,water,then,up,[END]
up,[END]
up,[END]
there,was,a,wall,of,water,higher,than,the,tip,of,the,mast,ready,to,fall,and,smash,the,frail,wooden,shell,to,bits,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,scream,but,her,throat,was,paralyzed,by,fear,[END]
the,sloop,was,shaking,and,groaning,it,rode,with,a,sickening,slide,up,the,side,of,the,wall,then,hung,on,the,top,shuddering,for,an,endless,terrifying,moment,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,were,narrowed,against,the,rain,pouring,down,on,her,head,with,terrible,pounding,blows,streaming,down,over,her,face,[END]
on,all,sides,there,were,angry,surging,foam-streaked,mountainous,waves,with,curling,breaking,white,tops,streaming,fans,of,spume,into,the,furious,wind,and,rain,[END]
rhett,she,tried,to,shout,[END]
oh,god,where,was,rhett,[END]
she,turned,her,head,from,side,to,side,trying,to,see,through,the,rain,[END]
then,just,as,the,sloop,dove,furiously,down,the,other,side,of,the,wave,she,found,him,[END]
god,damn,his,soul,[END]
he,was,kneeling,his,back,and,shoulders,straight,his,head,and,chin,high,and,he,was,laughing,into,the,wind,and,the,rain,and,the,waves,[END]
his,left,hand,gripped,the,tiller,with,corded,strength,and,his,right,hand,was,outstretched,holding,on,to,the,line,that,was,wrapped,around,his,elbow,and,forearm,and,wrist,the,sheet,that,led,to,the,fearful,pull,of,the,huge,wind-filled,mainsail,[END]
he's,loving,this,[END]
the,fight,with,the,wind,the,death,danger,[END]
he,loves,it,[END]
i,hate,him,[END]
scarlett,looked,up,at,the,towering,threat,of,the,next,wave,and,for,a,wild,despairing,instant,she,waited,for,it,to,topple,to,trap,to,destroy,her,[END]
then,she,told,herself,that,she,had,nothing,to,fear,[END]
rhett,could,manage,anything,even,the,ocean,itself,[END]
she,lifted,her,head,as,his,was,lifted,and,gave,herself,over,to,the,wild,perilous,excitement,[END]
scarlett,did,not,know,about,the,chaotic,power,of,the,wind,[END]
as,the,little,sloop,rode,up,the,side,of,the,thirty-foot,wave,the,wind,stopped,[END]
it,was,only,for,a,few,seconds,a,freak,of,the,center,of,the,squall,but,the,mainsail,flattened,and,the,boat,slewed,to,broadside,carried,erratically,by,water,current,only,in,a,perilous,climb,[END]
scarlett,was,aware,that,rhett,was,rapidly,freeing,his,arm,from,the,encircling,slack,line,that,he,was,doing,something,different,with,the,swinging,tiller,but,she,had,no,hint,that,anything,was,wrong,until,the,crest,of,the,wave,was,nearly,under,the,keel,and,rhett,shouted,jibe,[END]
jibe,and,threw,his,body,painfully,over,hers,[END]
she,heard,a,rattling,creaking,noise,close,to,her,head,and,sensed,the,slow,then,faster,then,rushing,swing,of,the,heavy,boom,above,[END]
everything,happened,very,fast,yet,it,seemed,to,be,terribly,unnaturally,slow,as,though,the,whole,world,were,stopping,[END]
she,looked,without,understanding,at,rhett's,face,so,near,to,hers,and,then,it,was,gone,and,he,was,on,his,knees,again,doing,something,she,didn't,know,what,except,that,heavy,loops,of,thick,rope,were,falling,on,her,[END]
she,didn't,see,the,crosswind,ruffle,then,suddenly,fill,the,wet,canvas,of,the,mainsail,and,propel,it,to,the,opposite,side,of,the,wayless,sloop,with,an,ever-mounting,force,so,mightly,that,there,was,a,crack,like,the,sound,of,lightning,striking,and,the,thick,mast,broke,and,was,carried,into,the,sea,by,the,momentum,and,weight,of,the,sail,[END]
the,hull,of,the,boat,bucked,then,lifted,to,starboard,and,rolled,slowly,following,the,pull,of,the,fouled,rigging,until,it,was,upside,down,[END]
capsized,in,the,cold,storm-torn,sea,[END]
she'd,never,known,such,cold,could,exist,[END]
cold,rain,pelting,her,colder,waters,surrounding,her,pulling,at,her,[END]
her,whole,body,must,be,frozen,[END]
her,teeth,were,chattering,uncontrollably,making,such,a,noise,in,her,head,that,she,couldn't,think,couldn't,understand,what,was,happening,except,that,she,must,be,paralyzed,because,she,couldn't,move,[END]
and,yet,she,was,moving,in,sickening,swings,and,surging,lifts,and,terrible,terrible,falling,falling,[END]
i'm,dying,[END]
oh,god,don't,let,me,die,[END]
i,want,to,live,[END]
scarlett,[END]
the,sound,of,her,name,was,louder,than,the,clacking,of,her,teeth,and,it,penetrated,to,her,consciousness,[END]
scarlett,[END]
she,knew,that,voice,it,was,rhett's,voice,[END]
and,that,was,rhett's,arm,around,her,holding,her,[END]
but,where,was,he,[END]
she,couldn't,see,anything,through,the,water,that,kept,hitting,her,face,glazing,and,stinging,her,eyes,[END]
she,opened,her,mouth,to,answer,and,at,once,it,was,filled,with,water,[END]
scarlett,craned,her,head,up,as,hard,as,she,could,and,blew,the,water,from,her,mouth,[END]
if,only,her,teeth,would,be,still,[END]
rhett,she,tried,to,say,[END]
thank,god,[END]
his,voice,was,very,close,[END]
behind,her,[END]
she,was,beginning,to,make,some,kind,of,sense,of,things,[END]
rhett,she,said,again,[END]
now,listen,carefully,my,darling,listen,harder,than,you've,ever,listened,in,your,life,[END]
we've,got,one,chance,and,we're,going,to,take,it,[END]
the,sloop,is,right,here,i'm,holding,on,to,the,rudder,[END]
we've,got,to,get,under,it,and,use,it,for,protection,[END]
that,means,we've,got,to,go,under,the,water,and,come,up,under,the,hull,of,the,boat,[END]
do,you,understand,[END]
everything,in,her,cried,out,no,[END]
if,she,went,under,the,water,she'd,drown,[END]
it,was,pulling,her,already,dragging,at,her,[END]
if,she,went,under,she'd,never,come,up,[END]
panic,seized,her,[END]
she,couldn't,breathe,[END]
she,wanted,to,hold,on,to,rhett,and,she,wanted,to,scream,and,scream,and,scream,[END]
stop,it,[END]
the,words,were,clear,[END]
and,the,voice,was,her,own,[END]

he,didn't,wait,for,her,to,answer,but,began,at,once,to,shout,one,[END]
two,[END]
scarlett,inhaled,in,jerky,spurts,[END]
then,she,was,pulled,down,down,and,water,filled,her,nose,and,ears,and,eyes,and,consciousness,[END]
in,seconds,it,was,over,[END]
she,gulped,air,gratefully,[END]
i've,been,holding,your,arms,scarlett,so,you,wouldn't,grab,me,and,drown,us,both,[END]
rhett,moved,his,grip,to,her,waist,[END]
the,freedom,felt,wonderful,[END]

i'm,going,to,cut,the,laces,on,your,boots,too,scarlett,[END]
don't,kick,when,you,feel,something,grab,your,foot,[END]
it'll,be,me,[END]
those,heavy,skirts,and,petticoats,will,have,to,go,too,[END]
just,hold,on,tight,[END]
i,won't,be,long,[END]
it,seemed,like,forever,[END]
scarlett,used,the,time,to,assess,her,surroundings,[END]
things,weren't,too,bad,if,she,could,ignore,the,cold,[END]
the,overturned,sloop,made,a,roof,over,her,head,so,that,the,rain,was,not,hitting,her,[END]
for,some,reason,the,water,was,calmer,too,[END]
she,couldn't,see,it,the,inside,of,the,hull,was,totally,dark,but,she,knew,it,was,so,[END]
although,the,boat,was,rising,and,falling,with,the,surge,of,the,waves,in,the,same,dizzying,rhythm,the,surface,of,the,sheltered,water,was,almost,flat,no,choppy,little,waves,to,break,against,her,face,[END]
she,felt,rhett's,touch,on,her,left,foot,[END]
good,[END]
i'm,not,really,paralyzed,[END]
scarlett,took,a,deep,breath,for,the,first,time,since,the,storm,hit,[END]
how,strange,her,feet,felt,[END]
she'd,had,no,idea,how,heavy,and,constricting,boots,were,[END]
oh,[END]
the,hand,at,her,waist,was,strangefeeling,[END]
she,could,sense,the,sawing,motion,of,the,knife,[END]
then,suddenly,a,tremendous,weight,slid,down,her,legs,and,her,shoulders,bobbed,up,out,of,the,water,[END]
she,cried,out,in,surprise,[END]
the,sound,of,her,cry,reverberated,in,the,hollow,space,beneath,the,wooden,hull,[END]
it,was,so,loud,that,she,almost,lost,her,handhold,from,the,shock,of,it,[END]
then,rhett,burst,through,the,water,[END]
he,was,very,close,to,her,[END]
how,do,you,feel,[END]
he,asked,[END]
it,sounded,as,if,he,was,shouting,[END]
shhh,said,scarlett,[END]
not,so,loud,[END]
how,do,you,feel,[END]
he,asked,quietly,[END]
frozen,nearly,to,death,if,you,really,want,to,know,[END]
the,water's,cold,but,not,that,cold,[END]
if,we,were,in,the,north,atlantic,[END]
rhett,butler,if,you,tell,me,one,of,your,blockade-running,adventure,stories,i'll,i'll,drown,you,[END]
his,laughter,filled,the,air,around,them,and,it,seemed,somehow,to,make,it,warmer,[END]
but,scarlett,was,still,furious,[END]
how,you,can,laugh,at,a,time,like,this,is,beyond,me,[END]
it's,not,funny,to,be,dangling,in,freezing,water,in,the,middle,of,a,terrible,storm,[END]
when,things,are,at,their,worst,scarlett,the,only,thing,to,do,is,find,something,to,laugh,about,[END]
it,keeps,you,sane,[END]
and,it,stops,your,teeth,chattering,from,fear,[END]
she,was,too,exasperated,to,speak,[END]
the,worst,of,it,was,that,he,was,right,[END]
the,chattering,had,stopped,when,she,stopped,thinking,that,she,was,going,to,die,[END]
now,i'm,going,to,cut,the,laces,on,your,corset,scarlett,[END]
you,can't,breathe,easily,in,that,cage,[END]
just,hold,still,so,i,don't,cut,your,skin,[END]
there,was,an,embarrassing,intimacy,in,the,movement,of,his,hands,under,the,sweater,tearing,open,her,basque,and,her,shirtwaist,[END]
it,had,been,years,since,he,had,last,put,his,hands,on,her,body,[END]
now,breathe,deep,said,rhett,when,he,pulled,the,cut,corset,and,camisole,away,[END]
women,today,never,learn,how,to,breathe,[END]
fill,your,lungs,all,the,way,[END]
i'm,rigging,a,support,for,us,with,some,line,i,cut,[END]
you'll,be,able,to,turn,loose,that,cleat,when,i'm,done,and,massage,your,hands,and,arms,[END]
keep,breathing,[END]
it'll,warm,up,your,blood,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,do,what,rhett,said,but,her,arms,felt,terribly,heavy,when,she,lifted,them,[END]
it,was,much,easier,just,to,let,her,body,rest,in,the,harness-like,rope,support,under,her,arms,and,rise,and,fall,limp,with,the,rise,and,fall,of,the,waves,[END]
she,was,feeling,very,sleepy,[END]
why,did,rhett,have,to,keep,talking,so,much,[END]
why,did,he,insist,on,fussing,at,her,about,rubbing,her,arms,[END]
scarlett,[END]
the,sound,was,very,loud,[END]
scarlett,[END]
you,cannot,go,to,sleep,[END]
you've,got,to,keep,moving,[END]
kick,your,feet,[END]
kick,me,if,you,want,to,but,move,your,legs,[END]
rhett,began,to,rub,her,shoulders,vigorously,then,her,upper,arms,his,touch,was,rough,[END]
stop,it,[END]
that,hurts,[END]
her,words,were,weak,like,the,mewing,of,a,kitten,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,eyes,and,the,darkness,became,darker,[END]
she,didn't,feel,so,cold,any,more,only,very,tired,and,sleepy,[END]
with,no,warning,rhett,slapped,her,face,so,hard,that,her,head,jerked,backwards,and,hit,the,wooden,hull,with,a,crash,that,echoed,in,the,enclosed,space,[END]
scarlett,came,full,awake,shocked,and,angry,[END]
how,dare,you,[END]
i'll,pay,you,back,for,that,when,we,get,out,of,here,rhett,butler,just,see,if,i,don't,[END]
that's,better,said,rhett,[END]
he,continued,to,rub,her,arms,roughly,though,scarlett,was,trying,to,push,his,hands,away,[END]
keep,talking,i'll,do,the,massage,[END]
give,me,your,hands,so,i,can,rub,them,[END]
i,certainly,will,not,[END]
i'll,keep,my,hands,to,myself,and,i'll,thank,you,to,do,the,same,[END]
you're,rubbing,my,flesh,right,off,my,bones,[END]
better,my,rubbing,than,crabs,eating,it,said,rhett,harshly,[END]
listen,to,me,[END]
if,you,let,yourself,give,in,to,the,cold,scarlett,you'll,die,[END]
i,know,you,want,to,sleep,but,that's,the,sleep,of,death,[END]
and,by,god,if,i,have,to,beat,you,black,and,blue,i,will,not,allow,you,to,die,[END]
you,stay,awake,and,breathe,and,keep,moving,[END]
talk,keep,talking,i,don't,give,a,damn,what,you,say,just,let,me,hear,your,cantankerous,fishwife,tones,so,i'll,know,you're,alive,[END]
scarlett,was,aware,of,the,paralyzing,cold,again,as,rhett,rubbed,life,back,into,her,flesh,[END]
are,we,going,to,get,out,of,this,[END]
she,asked,without,emotion,[END]
she,tried,to,move,her,legs,[END]
of,course,we,are,[END]
how,[END]
the,current,is,carrying,us,ashore,it's,an,incoming,tide,[END]
it'll,take,us,back,where,we,came,from,[END]
scarlett,nodded,in,the,darkness,[END]
she,remembered,all,the,fuss,about,leaving,before,the,tide,turned,[END]
nothing,in,rhett's,voice,revealed,his,knowledge,that,the,power,of,gale-force,winds,would,make,all,normal,tidal,activity,meaningless,[END]
the,storm,might,be,carrying,them,through,the,mouth,of,the,harbor,into,the,vast,reaches,of,the,atlantic,ocean,[END]
how,long,before,we,get,there,[END]
scarlett's,tone,was,querulous,[END]
her,legs,felt,like,huge,tree,trunks,[END]
and,rhett,was,rubbing,her,shoulders,raw,[END]
i,don't,know,he,answered,[END]
you'll,need,all,your,courage,scarlett,[END]
he,sounds,as,solemn,as,a,sermon,[END]
rhett,who,always,makes,fun,of,everything,[END]
oh,my,god,[END]
scarlett,willed,her,lifeless,legs,to,move,and,forced,terror,away,with,iron,determination,[END]
i,don't,need,courage,half,as,much,as,something,to,eat,she,said,[END]
why,the,devil,didn't,you,grab,that,dirty,old,bag,of,yours,when,we,turned,over,[END]
it's,stowed,under,the,bow,[END]
by,god,scarlett,your,gluttony,may,be,the,saving,of,us,[END]
i'd,forgotten,all,about,it,[END]
pray,it's,still,there,[END]
the,rum,spread,life-restoring,tentacles,of,warmth,through,her,thighs,her,legs,her,feet,and,scarlett,began,to,push,them,back,and,forth,[END]
the,pain,of,returning,circulation,was,intense,but,she,welcomed,it,[END]
it,meant,she,was,alive,all,of,her,[END]
why,rum,just,might,be,better,than,brandy,she,thought,after,a,second,drink,[END]
it,sure,did,warm,a,person,up,[END]
too,bad,that,rhett,insisted,on,rationing,it,but,she,knew,he,was,right,[END]
it,would,be,too,awful,to,run,out,of,the,warmth,in,the,bottle,before,they,were,safe,on,land,[END]
in,the,meantime,she,was,even,able,to,join,in,rhett's,tribute,to,their,prize,[END]
yo,ho,ho,and,a,bottle,of,rum,',[END]
she,sang,with,him,when,he,finished,each,verse,of,the,sea,chanty,[END]
and,afterwards,scarlett,thought,of,little,brown,jug,how,i,love,thee,[END]
their,voices,echoed,so,loudly,inside,the,hull,that,it,was,possible,to,pretend,that,they,weren't,growing,weaker,as,the,cold,gripped,their,bodies,[END]
rhett,put,his,arms,around,scarlett,and,held,her,close,to,his,body,to,share,its,warmth,[END]
and,they,sang,all,the,favorites,they,could,remember,while,the,sips,of,rum,came,closer,together,with,less,and,less,effect,[END]
how,about,the,yellow,rose,of,texas',[END]
rhett,suggested,[END]
we,sang,that,twice,already,[END]
sing,that,song,pa,loved,so,much,rhett,[END]
i,remember,the,two,of,you,staggering,down,the,street,together,in,atlanta,bellowing,like,stuck,pigs,[END]
sure,and,we,sounded,like,a,choir,of,angels,rhett,said,mimicking,gerald,o'hara's,brogue,[END]
when,first,i,saw,sweet,peggy,'twas,on,a,market,day,[END]
',[END]
he,sang,the,first,verse,of,peg,in,a,low,back'd,car,then,admitted,he,didn't,know,the,rest,[END]
you,must,know,every,word,of,it,scarlett,[END]
sing,it,for,me,[END]
she,tried,but,couldn't,find,the,strength,[END]
i've,forgotten,she,said,to,cover,her,weakness,[END]
she,was,so,tired,[END]
if,only,she,could,rest,her,head,against,rhett's,warmth,and,sleep,[END]
his,arms,felt,so,wonderful,holding,her,[END]
her,head,dropped,[END]
it,was,too,heavy,to,hold,up,any,longer,[END]
rhett,shook,her,[END]
scarlett,do,you,hear,me,[END]
scarlett,[END]
i,feel,a,change,in,the,current,i,swear,it,we're,very,near,shore,[END]
you,can't,give,up,now,[END]
come,on,my,darling,let,me,see,some,more,of,that,gumption,of,yours,[END]
hold,up,your,head,my,pet,it's,almost,over,[END]
so,cold,[END]
damn,you,for,a,quitter,scarlett,o'hara,[END]
i,should,have,let,sherman,get,you,in,atlanta,[END]
you,weren't,worth,saving,[END]
the,words,registered,slowly,in,her,fading,consciousness,and,produced,only,a,feeble,stirring,of,anger,[END]
but,it,was,enough,[END]
her,eyes,opened,and,her,head,lifted,to,meet,the,dimly,sensed,challenge,[END]
take,a,deep,breath,rhett,commanded,[END]
we're,going,in,[END]
he,put,his,big,hand,over,her,nose,and,mouth,and,dove,under,the,water,with,her,feebly,struggling,body,held,close,[END]
they,surfaced,outside,the,hull,near,a,line,of,tall,cresting,combers,[END]
almost,there,my,love,rhett,gasped,[END]
he,bent,one,arm,around,scarlett's,neck,and,held,her,heavy,head,in,his,hand,while,he,swam,expertly,through,a,breaking,wave,and,used,its,power,to,carry,them,into,the,shallows,[END]
a,thin,rain,was,falling,blown,almost,horizontal,by,the,gusting,wind,[END]
rhett,cradled,scarlett's,limp,form,to,his,chest,and,huddled,over,it,kneeling,in,the,white,frothing,edge,of,the,water,[END]
a,comber,rose,far,behind,him,and,raced,toward,the,beach,[END]
it,began,to,curl,over,on,itself,then,the,foam-streaked,gray,water,crashed,surged,toward,land,and,the,rolling,roiling,forces,in,it,struck,rhett's,back,and,roared,across,his,sheltering,body,[END]
when,the,wave,had,passed,over,and,spent,itself,he,rose,unsteadily,to,his,feet,and,stumbled,forward,onto,the,beach,clasping,scarlett,to,him,[END]
his,bare,feet,and,legs,were,cut,in,a,hundred,places,by,the,fragments,of,shell,that,the,breaker,had,thrown,against,him,but,he,was,uncaring,[END]
he,ran,clumsily,through,the,deep,clinging,sand,to,an,opening,in,the,line,of,immense,sand,dunes,and,climbed,a,short,way,into,a,bowl-like,area,sheltered,from,the,winds,[END]
there,he,gently,placed,scarlett's,body,on,the,soft,sand,[END]
his,voice,broke,as,he,called,scarlett's,name,over,and,over,again,while,he,tried,to,bring,life,into,her,chilled,whiteness,by,rubbing,every,part,of,her,with,his,two,hands,[END]
her,snarled,glistening,black,hair,was,spilled,around,her,head,and,shoulders,and,her,black,eyebrows,and,lashes,were,shocking,streaks,across,her,colorless,wet,face,[END]
rhett,slapped,her,cheeks,softly,and,urgently,with,the,backs,of,his,fingers,[END]
when,her,eyes,opened,their,color,looked,as,strong,as,emeralds,[END]
rhett,shouted,in,primitive,triumph,[END]
scarlett's,fingers,half,closed,around,the,shifting,solidity,of,the,rain-hardened,sand,[END]
land,she,said,[END]
and,she,began,to,cry,in,gasping,sobs,[END]
rhett,put,one,arm,under,her,shoulders,and,lifted,her,into,the,protection,of,his,bent,crouching,body,[END]
with,his,free,hand,he,touched,her,hair,her,cheeks,mouth,chin,[END]
my,darling,my,life,[END]
i,thought,i'd,lost,you,[END]
i,thought,i'd,killed,you,[END]
i,thought,oh,scarlett,you're,alive,[END]
don't,cry,my,dearest,it's,all,over,[END]
you're,safe,[END]
it's,all,right,[END]
everything,he,kissed,her,forehead,her,throat,her,cheeks,[END]
scarlett's,pale,skin,warmed,with,color,and,she,turned,her,head,to,meet,his,kissed,with,her,own,[END]
and,there,was,no,cold,no,rain,no,weakness,only,the,burning,of,rhett's,lips,on,her,lips,on,her,body,the,heat,of,his,hands,[END]
and,the,power,she,felt,under,her,fingers,when,she,gripped,his,shoulders,[END]
and,the,pounding,of,her,heart,in,her,throat,against,his,lips,the,strong,beat,of,his,shirt,beneath,her,palms,when,she,tangled,her,fingers,in,the,thick,curling,hair,on,his,chest,[END]
yes,[END]
i,did,remember,it,it,wasn't,a,dream,[END]
yes,this,is,the,dark,swirling,that,draws,me,in,and,closes,out,the,world,and,makes,me,alive,so,alive,and,free,and,spinning,up,to,the,heart,of,the,sun,[END]
yes,[END]
she,shouted,again,and,again,meeting,rhett's,passion,with,her,own,her,demands,the,same,as,his,[END]
until,in,the,swirling,spiraling,rapture,there,were,no,longer,words,or,thoughts,only,a,union,beyond,mind,beyond,time,beyond,the,world,[END]
32,[END]
he,loves,me,[END]
what,a,fool,i,was,to,doubt,what,i,knew,[END]
scarlett's,swollen,lips,curved,in,a,lazy,surfeited,smile,and,she,slowly,opened,her,eyes,[END]
rhett,was,sitting,beside,her,[END]
his,arms,were,wrapped,across,his,knees,his,face,hidden,in,the,hollow,they,made,[END]
scarlett,stretched,luxuriantly,[END]
for,the,first,time,she,felt,the,rasping,sand,against,her,skin,noticed,her,surroundings,[END]
why,it's,pouring,down,rain,[END]
we'll,catch,our,death,[END]
we'll,have,to,find,some,shelter,before,we,make,love,again,[END]
her,dimples,flickered,and,she,stifled,a,giggle,[END]
maybe,not,we,sure,didn't,pay,any,attention,to,the,weather,just,now,[END]
she,reached,out,her,hand,and,traced,rhett's,spine,with,her,fingernails,[END]
he,jerked,away,as,if,she'd,burned,him,turning,in,a,rush,to,face,her,then,springing,to,his,feet,[END]
she,couldn't,read,his,expression,[END]
i,didn't,want,to,wake,you,he,said,[END]
try,to,get,some,more,rest,if,you,can,[END]
i'm,going,to,look,for,some,place,to,dry,out,and,build,a,fire,[END]
there,are,shacks,on,all,these,islands,[END]
i'll,go,with,you,[END]
scarlett,struggled,to,get,up,[END]
rhett's,sweater,was,across,her,legs,and,she,was,still,wearing,hers,[END]
she,felt,burdened,by,their,water-laden,weight,[END]
no,[END]
you,stay,here,[END]
he,was,walking,away,up,the,steep,dunes,[END]
scarlett,gaped,foolishly,not,believing,her,eyes,[END]
rhett,[END]
you,can't,leave,me,[END]
i,won't,let,you,[END]
but,he,kept,climbing,[END]
she,could,see,only,his,broad,back,with,his,wet,shirt,clinging,to,it,[END]
at,the,top,of,the,dune,he,halted,[END]
his,head,turned,slowly,from,side,to,side,[END]
then,his,hunched,shoulders,squared,[END]
he,turned,and,slid,recklessly,down,the,steep,slope,[END]
there's,a,cottage,[END]
i,know,where,we,are,[END]
get,up,[END]
rhett,held,his,hand,out,to,help,scarlett,rise,[END]
she,clasped,it,eagerly,[END]
the,cottages,that,some,charlestonians,had,built,on,the,nearby,islands,were,designed,to,capture,the,cooler,sea,breezes,in,the,hot,humid,days,of,the,long,southern,summer,[END]
they,were,retreats,from,the,city,and,the,city's,formality,little,more,than,unornamented,shacks,with,deep,shaded,porches,and,weathered,clapboard,siding,perched,on,creosoted,timbers,to,raise,them,above,the,blistering,summer,sands,[END]
in,the,cold,driving,rain,the,shelter,rhett,had,found,looked,derelict,and,inadequate,to,stand,against,the,buffeting,wind,[END]
but,he,knew,these,island,houses,had,stood,for,generations,and,had,kitchen,fireplaces,where,meals,were,prepared,[END]
exactly,the,shelter,needed,for,shipwreck,survivors,[END]
he,broke,open,the,door,to,the,cottage,with,a,single,kick,[END]
scarlett,followed,him,inside,[END]
why,was,he,so,silent,[END]
he'd,hardly,said,a,word,to,her,not,even,when,he,was,carrying,her,in,his,arms,through,the,thicket,of,low,shrubs,at,the,base,of,the,sand,dunes,[END]
i,want,him,to,talk,scarlett,thought,i,want,to,hear,his,voice,saying,how,much,he,loves,me,[END]
lord,knows,he,made,me,wait,long,enough,[END]
he,found,a,worn,patchwork,quilt,in,a,cupboard,[END]
take,off,those,wet,things,and,wrap,up,in,this,he,said,[END]
he,tossed,the,quilt,onto,her,lap,[END]
i'll,have,a,fire,started,in,a,minute,[END]
scarlett,dropped,her,torn,pantalets,on,top,of,the,soaked,sweater,and,dried,herself,on,the,quilt,[END]
it,was,soft,and,it,felt,good,[END]
she,wrapped,it,shawl-fashion,then,sat,down,again,on,the,hard,kitchen,chair,[END]
the,quilt,made,an,envelope,for,her,feet,on,the,floor,[END]
she,was,dry,for,the,first,time,in,hours,but,she,began,to,shiver,[END]
rhett,brought,dry,wood,in,from,a,box,on,the,porch,outside,the,kitchen,[END]
in,a,few,minutes,there,was,a,small,fire,in,the,big,fireplace,[END]
almost,at,once,it,bit,into,the,teepee,of,logs,and,a,tall,orange,burst,of,flame,leapt,into,crackling,life,[END]
it,lit,his,brooding,face,[END]
scarlett,hobbled,across,the,room,to,warm,herself,at,the,fire,[END]
why,don't,you,get,out,of,your,wet,things,too,rhett,[END]
i'll,let,you,have,the,quilt,to,dry,off,on,it,feels,wonderful,[END]
she,dropped,her,eyes,as,if,she,were,embarrassed,by,her,boldness,[END]
her,thick,lashes,fluttered,on,her,cheeks,[END]
rhett,did,not,respond,[END]
i'll,just,get,soaked,again,when,i,go,back,out,he,said,[END]
we're,only,a,couple,of,miles,from,fort,moultrie,[END]
i'll,go,get,help,[END]
rhett,walked,into,the,small,pantry,adjoining,the,kitchen,[END]
bother,fort,moultrie,[END]
scarlett,wished,he'd,stop,rooting,around,in,the,pantry,like,that,[END]
how,could,she,talk,to,him,when,he,was,in,another,room,[END]
rhett,emerged,with,a,bottle,of,whiskey,in,one,hand,[END]
the,shelves,are,pretty,bare,he,said,with,a,brief,smile,but,the,necessities,are,there,[END]
he,opened,a,cupboard,and,took,down,two,cups,[END]
clean,enough,he,said,[END]
i'll,pour,us,a,drink,[END]
he,set,cups,and,bottle,down,on,the,table,[END]
i,don't,want,a,drink,[END]
i,want,[END]
he,interrupted,before,she,could,tell,him,what,she,wanted,[END]
i,need,a,drink,he,said,[END]
he,poured,the,cup,half,full,drank,it,in,one,long,swallow,then,shook,his,head,[END]
no,wonder,they,left,it,here,it's,real,rotgut,[END]
still,[END]
he,poured,again,[END]
scarlett,watched,him,with,a,look,of,amused,indulgence,[END]
poor,darling,how,nervous,he,is,[END]
when,she,spoke,her,voice,was,heavy,with,loving,patience,[END]
you,don't,have,to,be,so,skittery,rhett,[END]
it's,not,like,you,compromised,me,or,anything,[END]
we're,two,married,people,who,love,each,other,that's,all,[END]
rhett,stared,at,her,over,the,rim,of,the,cup,then,put,it,carefully,down,on,the,table,[END]
scarlett,what,happened,out,there,had,nothing,to,do,with,love,[END]
it,was,a,celebration,of,survival,that's,all,[END]
you,see,it,after,every,battle,in,wartime,[END]
the,men,who,don't,get,killed,fall,on,the,first,woman,they,see,and,prove,they're,still,alive,by,using,her,body,[END]
in,this,case,you,used,mine,too,because,you'd,narrowly,escaped,dying,[END]
it,had,nothing,to,do,with,love,[END]
the,harshness,of,his,words,took,scarlett's,breath,away,[END]
but,then,she,remembered,his,hoarse,voice,in,her,ear,the,words,my,darling,my,life,i,love,you,repeated,a,hundred,times,[END]
no,matter,what,rhett,might,say,he,loved,her,[END]
she,knew,it,in,the,innermost,center,of,her,soul,the,place,where,there,were,no,lies,[END]
he's,still,afraid,that,i,don't,really,love,him,[END]
that's,why,he,won't,admit,how,much,he,loves,me,[END]
she,began,to,move,toward,him,[END]
you,can,say,anything,you,like,rhett,but,it,won't,change,the,truth,[END]
i,love,you,and,you,love,me,and,we,made,love,to,prove,it,to,each,other,[END]
rhett,drank,the,whiskey,[END]
then,he,laughed,harshly,[END]
i,never,thought,you,were,a,silly,little,romantic,scarlett,[END]
you,disappoint,me,[END]
you,used,to,have,some,sense,in,your,hard,little,head,[END]
a,primitive,hasty,coupling,should,never,be,confused,with,love,[END]
though,god,knows,it,happens,often,enough,to,fill,churches,with,wedding,ceremonies,[END]
scarlett,continued,to,walk,[END]
you,can,talk,till,you're,blue,but,that,won't,change,anything,[END]
she,put,a,hand,to,her,face,and,wiped,away,the,tears,that,were,pouring,from,her,eyes,[END]
she,was,very,close,to,him,now,[END]
she,could,smell,the,salt,on,his,skin,the,whiskey,on,his,breath,[END]
you,do,love,me,she,sobbed,you,do,you,do,[END]
the,quilt,fell,to,the,floor,when,she,let,go,of,it,to,reach,out,to,rhett,[END]
take,me,in,your,arms,and,tell,me,you,don't,love,me,and,then,i'll,believe,it,[END]
rhett's,hands,abruptly,caught,her,head,and,he,kissed,her,with,bruising,possessive,strength,[END]
scarlett's,arms,closed,behind,his,neck,as,his,hands,moved,down,her,throat,and,her,shoulders,and,she,gave,herself,up,to,abandonment,[END]
but,rhett's,fingers,suddenly,closed,around,her,wrists,and,he,pried,her,arms,apart,away,from,his,neck,away,from,him,and,his,mouth,was,no,longer,seeking,hers,his,body,was,drawing,away,[END]
why,[END]
she,cried,[END]
you,want,me,[END]
he,cast,her,away,releasing,her,wrists,stumbling,backwards,in,the,first,uncontrolled,action,she,had,ever,seen,him,take,[END]
yes,by,christ,[END]
i,do,want,you,and,sicken,for,you,[END]
you're,a,poison,in,my,blood,scarlett,a,sickness,of,my,soul,[END]
i've,known,men,with,a,hunger,for,opium,that,was,like,my,hunger,for,you,[END]
i,know,what,happens,to,an,addict,[END]
he,becomes,enslaved,then,destroyed,[END]
it,almost,happened,to,me,but,i,escaped,[END]
i,won't,risk,it,again,[END]
i,won't,destroy,myself,for,you,[END]
he,crashed,through,the,door,and,out,into,the,storm,[END]
the,wind,howled,through,the,open,door,icy,against,scarlett's,bare,skin,[END]
she,grabbed,up,the,quilt,from,the,floor,and,wrapped,it,around,her,[END]
she,pushed,against,the,wind,to,the,yawning,doorway,but,could,see,nothing,through,the,rain,[END]
it,took,all,her,strength,to,pull,the,door,closed,[END]
she,had,very,little,strength,left,[END]
her,lips,still,felt,warm,from,rhett's,kiss,[END]
but,the,rest,of,her,was,shivering,[END]
she,curled,up,in,front,of,the,fire,with,the,quilt,wrapped,securely,around,her,[END]
she,was,tired,so,very,tired,[END]
she'd,have,a,little,nap,until,rhett,came,back,[END]
she,slid,into,a,sleep,so,profound,that,it,was,more,nearly,coma,[END]
exhaustion,said,the,army,doctor,rhett,brought,back,from,fort,moultrie,and,exposure,[END]
it's,a,miracle,your,wife,isn't,dead,mr,butler,[END]
let's,hope,she,doesn't,lose,the,use,of,her,legs,the,circulation's,all,but,shut,down,[END]

rhett,swaddled,scarlett's,limp,body,quickly,and,lifted,her,in,his,arms,[END]
here,now,give,her,to,the,sergeant,[END]
you're,not,in,such,good,condition,yourself,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,opened,[END]
her,clouded,mind,registered,the,blue,uniforms,around,her,then,her,eyes,rolled,back,in,her,head,[END]
the,doctor,closed,the,eyelids,with,fingers,practiced,in,battlefield,medicine,[END]

that's,a,good,girl,take,another,little,sip,[END]
no,i,don't,want,to,see,no,ugly,screwed-up,face,like,that,[END]

so,close,so,nearly,the,same,but,not,the,same,[END]
weak,tears,seeped,from,the,corners,of,scarlett's,closed,eyes,[END]
for,a,minute,she'd,thought,she,was,home,at,tara,with,mammy,tending,her,[END]
she,forced,her,eyes,to,open,to,focus,[END]
the,black,woman,bending,over,her,smiled,[END]
her,smile,was,beautiful,[END]
compassionate,[END]
wise,[END]
loving,[END]
patient,[END]
unyieldingly,bossy,[END]
scarlett,smiled,back,[END]
there,now,ain't,that,just,what,i,told,them,[END]

that,don't,set,too,well,in,heaven,[END]
scarlett,swallowed,[END]
then,she,gulped,[END]
the,sweetened,milk,tasted,better,than,anything,she'd,tasted,in,weeks,[END]
when,it,was,all,gone,she,rubbed,her,mouth,with,the,back,of,her,hand,to,erase,the,milk,mustache,[END]
i'm,mighty,hungry,rebekah,could,i,have,something,to,eat,[END]
the,big,black,woman,nodded,[END]
just,a,second,she,said,[END]
then,she,closed,her,eyes,and,put,her,palms,together,in,prayer,[END]
her,lips,moved,silently,and,she,rocked,back,and,forth,giving,thanks,in,an,intimate,talk,with,her,lord,[END]
when,she,finished,she,pulled,the,coverlet,up,over,scarlett's,shoulders,and,tucked,it,around,them,[END]
scarlett,was,asleep,[END]
the,medicine,in,the,milk,was,laudanum,[END]
scarlett,tossed,fitfully,while,she,slept,[END]
when,she,thrashed,off,the,coverlet,rebekah,tucked,her,in,again,and,stroked,her,forehead,until,the,lines,of,distress,were,soothed,away,[END]
but,rebekah,could,do,nothing,about,the,dreams,[END]
they,were,disjointed,chaotic,fragments,of,scarlett's,memories,and,fears,[END]
there,was,hunger,the,never-ending,desperate,hunger,of,the,bad,days,at,tara,[END]
and,yankee,soldiers,coming,closer,and,closer,to,atlanta,looming,in,the,shadows,of,the,piazza,outside,her,window,handling,her,and,whispering,that,her,legs,would,have,to,come,off,sprawling,in,a,pool,of,blood,on,the,floor,at,tara,the,blood,spurting,spreading,becoming,a,torrent,of,red,that,rose,into,a,mountainous,wave,higher,and,still,higher,over,a,screaming,small,scarlett,[END]
and,there,was,cold,with,ice,covering,trees,and,shrivelling,flowers,and,forming,a,shell,around,her,so,that,she,couldn't,move,and,couldn't,be,heard,although,she,was,calling,rhett,rhett,rhett,come,back,inside,the,icicles,that,were,falling,from,her,lips,[END]
her,mother,passed,through,her,dream,and,scarlett,smelled,lemon,verbena,but,ellen,never,spoke,[END]
gerald,o'hara,jumped,a,fence,then,another,then,fence,after,fence,into,infinity,sitting,backwards,on,a,shining,white,stallion,that,was,singing,with,gerald,in,a,human,voice,about,scarlett,in,a,low,back'd,car,[END]
the,voices,changed,became,women's,voices,became,hushed,[END]
she,couldn't,hear,what,they,were,saying,[END]
scarlett,licked,her,dry,lips,and,opened,her,eyes,[END]
why,it's,melly,[END]
oh,she,looks,so,worried,poor,thing,[END]
don't,be,frightened,scarlett,said,hoarsely,[END]
it's,all,right,[END]
he's,dead,[END]
i,shot,him,[END]

the,bad,dreams,are,all,over,now,scarlett,[END]
the,doctor,said,you're,going,to,be,well,in,no,time,at,all,[END]
anne,hampton's,dark,eyes,were,shining,with,earnestness,[END]
eleanor,butler's,face,appeared,over,her,shoulder,[END]
we've,come,to,take,you,home,my,dear,she,said,[END]
this,is,ridiculous,scarlett,complained,[END]
i,can,perfectly,well,walk,[END]
rebekah,clamped,a,hand,on,her,shoulder,and,continued,to,push,the,wheelchair,slowly,along,the,crushed,oyster-shell,road,[END]
i,feel,like,a,fool,grumbled,scarlett,but,she,slumped,back,in,the,chair,[END]
her,head,was,throbbing,with,sharp,dagger-like,pains,[END]
the,rainstorm,had,brought,back,weather,suitable,for,february,[END]
the,air,was,crisp,with,a,bite,in,the,wind,that,was,still,blowing,[END]
at,least,miss,eleanor,brought,my,fur,cape,she,thought,[END]
i,must,have,had,a,mighty,close,call,if,i'm,allowed,to,wear,the,furs,she,thought,were,so,showy,[END]
where,is,rhett,[END]
why,isn't,he,taking,me,home,[END]
i,wouldn't,let,him,go,out,again,said,mrs,butler,firmly,[END]
i,sent,for,our,doctor,and,told,manigo,to,put,rhett,straight,to,bed,[END]
he,was,blue,with,cold,[END]
anne,spoke,quietly,bending,near,scarlett's,ear,[END]
miss,eleanor,was,alarmed,when,the,storm,came,up,so,suddenly,[END]
we,rushed,from,the,home,to,the,mooring,basin,and,when,they,said,the,boat,hadn't,come,back,she,got,frantic,[END]
i,doubt,that,she,sat,down,once,all,afternoon,she,was,just,pacing,back,and,forth,on,the,piazza,looking,out,into,the,rain,[END]
under,a,nice,roof,thought,scarlett,impatiently,[END]
it's,all,well,and,good,for,anne,to,sound,so,concerned,for,miss,eleanor,but,she,wasn't,the,one,freezing,to,death,[END]
my,son,told,me,you,worked,a,miracle,tending,his,wife,miss,eleanor,said,to,rebekah,[END]
i,don't,know,how,we'll,ever,thank,you,[END]
wasn't,me,missus,it,was,the,good,lord,[END]
i,talked,to,jesus,for,her,poor,little,shivering,thing,[END]
i,said,this,ain't,lazarus,lord,[END]
while,rebekah,repeated,her,story,to,mrs,butler,anne,answered,scarlett's,question,about,rhett,[END]
he,had,waited,until,the,doctor,said,that,scarlett,was,out,of,danger,then,he'd,taken,the,ferry,to,charleston,to,set,his,mother's,mind,at,rest,knowing,how,worried,she,must,be,[END]
it,gave,us,all,a,shock,when,we,saw,a,yankee,soldier,coming,through,the,gate,anne,laughed,[END]
he'd,borrowed,dry,clothes,from,the,sergeant,[END]
scarlett,refused,to,leave,the,ferry,in,the,wheelchair,[END]
she,insisted,that,she,was,perfectly,capable,of,walking,to,the,house,and,she,did,walk,stepping,out,as,if,nothing,had,happened,[END]
but,she,was,tired,when,they,arrived,so,tired,that,she,accepted,anne's,help,to,climb,the,stairs,[END]
and,after,a,tray,with,a,hot,bean,soup,and,corn,muffins,she,fell,again,into,a,deep,sleep,[END]
there,were,no,nightmares,this,time,[END]
she,was,in,the,familiar,soft,luxury,of,linen,sheets,and,feather,mattress,and,she,knew,that,rhett,was,only,a,few,steps,away,[END]
she,slept,for,fourteen,strength-restoring,hours,[END]
she,saw,the,flowers,the,minute,she,woke,up,[END]
hothouse,roses,[END]
there,was,an,envelope,propped,against,the,vase,[END]
scarlett,reached,greedily,for,it,[END]
his,bold,slashing,handwriting,was,starkly,black,on,the,creamcolored,paper,[END]
scarlett,touched,it,lovingly,before,she,began,to,read,[END]
there,is,nothing,that,i,can,say,about,what,happened,yesterday,except,that,i,am,profoundly,ashamed,and,sorry,to,have,been,the,cause,of,such,great,pain,and,danger,for,you,[END]
scarlett,wriggled,with,pleasure,[END]
your,courage,and,valiant,spiris,were,truly,heroic,and,i,shall,always,regard,you,with,admiration,and,respect,[END]
i,regret,bitterly,all,that,occurred,after,we,escaped,from,the,long,ordeal,[END]

rhett,[END]
scarlett,stared,at,the,letter,at,first,too,shocked,to,hurt,[END]

the,fearful,loneliness,she'd,known,in,atlanta,had,made,her,timid,apprehensive,eager,to,please,in,charleston,[END]
now,she,had,taken,her,life,back,into,her,own,hands,and,she,felt,vibrant,with,strength,[END]
not,man,nor,beast,could,bother,her,now,[END]
rhett,loved,her,and,she,was,queen,of,the,world,[END]
she,coolly,removed,her,hat,and,her,fur,cape,and,dropped,them,on,a,marble-topped,console,in,the,hall,[END]
then,she,began,to,take,off,her,apple,green,kid,gloves,[END]
she,could,feel,her,aunts,staring,[END]
they'd,done,plenty,of,that,already,[END]
but,scarlett,was,very,pleased,to,be,wearing,her,green,and,brown,plaid,travelling,costume,instead,of,the,drab,outfits,she'd,worn,in,charleston,[END]
she,fluffed,up,the,dark,green,taffeta,bow,that,made,her,eyes,sparkle,so,[END]
when,her,gloves,had,joined,hat,and,cape,she,pointed,to,them,[END]
pansy,take,these,things,upstairs,and,put,them,away,in,the,prettiest,bedroom,you,can,find,[END]
stop,cringing,in,the,corner,like,that,nobody's,going,to,bite,you,[END]
scarlett,you,can't,[END]
you,must,wait,[END]
the,aunts,were,wringing,their,hands,[END]
if,grandfather's,too,mean,to,come,out,and,meet,us,we'll,just,have,to,shift,for,ourselves,[END]
god's,nightgown,aunt,eulalie,[END]
you,grew,up,here,you,and,aunt,pauline,can't,you,just,make,yourselves,at,home,[END]
scarlett's,words,and,manner,were,bold,enough,but,when,a,basso,voice,bellowed,jerome,[END]
from,the,rear,of,the,house,she,felt,her,palms,grow,damp,[END]
her,grandfather,she,suddenly,remembered,had,eyes,that,cut,right,through,you,and,made,you,wish,you,were,anywhere,except,under,his,gaze,[END]
the,imposing,black,manservant,who,had,admitted,her,now,gestured,scarlett,and,her,aunts,toward,the,open,door,at,the,end,of,the,hall,[END]
scarlett,let,eulalie,and,pauline,go,first,[END]
the,bedroom,was,a,tremendous,high-ceilinged,space,that,had,formerly,been,a,spacious,parlor,[END]
it,was,crowded,with,furniture,all,the,sofas,and,chairs,and,tables,that,had,been,in,the,parlor,plus,a,massive,four-posted,bed,with,gilt,eagles,crouching,on,top,of,the,posts,[END]
in,one,corner,of,the,room,was,a,flag,of,france,and,a,headless,tailor's,dummy,wearing,the,gold-epauletted,medal-hung,uniform,that,pierre,robillard,had,worn,when,he,was,a,young,man,and,an,officer,in,napoleon's,army,[END]
the,old,man,pierre,robillard,was,in,the,bed,sitting,erect,against,a,mass,of,huge,pillows,glaring,at,his,visitors,[END]
why,he's,shrunk,up,to,almost,nothing,[END]
he,was,such,a,big,old,man,but,he's,practically,lost,in,that,big,bed,nothing,but,skin,and,bones,[END]
hello,grandfather,scarlett,said,i've,come,to,see,you,for,your,birthday,[END]
it's,scarlett,ellen's,daughter,[END]
i,haven't,lost,my,memory,said,the,old,man,[END]
his,strong,voice,belied,his,fragile,body,[END]
but,apparently,your,memory,fails,you,[END]
in,this,house,young,people,do,not,speak,unless,they,are,spoken,to,[END]
scarlett,bit,her,tongue,to,keep,silent,[END]
i'm,not,a,child,to,be,talked,to,that,way,and,you,should,be,grateful,anybody,comes,to,see,you,at,all,[END]
no,wonder,mother,was,so,happy,to,have,pa,take,her,away,from,home,[END]
et,vous,mesfilles,[END]
qu,'ist-ce-que,vous,voulez,cette,fois,[END]
pierre,robillard,growled,at,his,daughters,[END]
eulalie,and,pauline,rushed,to,the,bedside,both,speaking,at,once,[END]
my,grief,[END]
they're,talking,french,[END]
what,on,earth,am,i,doing,here,[END]
scarlett,sank,down,onto,a,gold,brocade,sofa,wishing,she,was,some,place,any,place,else,[END]
rhett,better,come,after,me,soon,or,i'll,go,crazy,in,this,house,[END]
it,was,getting,dark,outside,and,the,shadowed,corners,of,the,room,were,mysterious,[END]
the,headless,soldier,seemed,about,to,move,[END]
scarlett,felt,cold,fingers,on,her,spine,and,told,herself,not,to,be,silly,[END]
but,she,was,glad,when,jerome,and,a,sturdy-looking,black,woman,came,in,carrying,a,lamp,[END]
while,the,maid,pulled,the,curtains,jerome,lit,the,gas,lamps,on,each,wall,[END]
he,asked,scarlett,politely,if,she,would,move,so,that,he,could,get,behind,the,sofa,[END]
when,she,stood,she,saw,her,grandfather's,eyes,on,her,and,she,turned,away,from,them,[END]
she,found,herself,facing,a,big,painting,in,an,ornate,gilt,frame,[END]
jerome,lit,one,lamp,then,a,second,and,the,painting,came,to,life,[END]
it,was,a,portrait,of,her,grandmother,[END]
scarlett,recognized,her,at,once,from,the,painting,at,tara,[END]
but,this,one,was,very,different,[END]
solange,robillard's,dark,hair,was,not,piled,high,on,her,head,as,in,tara's,portrait,[END]
it,fell,instead,like,a,warm,cloud,over,her,shoulders,and,down,her,bare,arms,to,the,elbow,bound,only,by,a,fillet,of,gleaming,pearls,[END]
her,arrogant,thin,nose,was,the,same,but,her,lips,held,a,beginning,smile,instead,of,a,sneer,and,her,tip-tilted,dark,eyes,looked,from,their,corners,at,scarlett,with,the,laughing,magnetic,intimacy,that,had,challenged,and,lured,everyone,who'd,ever,known,her,[END]
she,was,younger,in,this,painting,but,nevertheless,a,woman,not,a,girl,[END]
the,provocative,round,breasts,half-exposed,at,tara,were,covered,by,the,thin,white,silk,gown,she,wore,[END]
covered,yet,visible,through,the,gauzy,silk,a,glimmer,of,white,flesh,and,rosy,nipples,[END]
scarlett,felt,herself,blushing,[END]
why,grandma,robillard,doesn't,look,like,a,lady,at,all,she,thought,automatically,disapproving,as,she'd,been,taught,she,should,[END]
involuntarily,she,remembered,herself,in,rhett's,arms,and,the,wild,hunger,for,his,hands,on,her,[END]
her,grandmother,must,have,felt,the,same,hunger,the,same,ecstasy,it,was,in,her,eyes,and,her,smile,[END]
so,it,can't,be,wrong,what,i,felt,[END]
or,was,it,[END]
was,it,some,taint,of,shamelessness,in,her,blood,handed,down,from,the,woman,who,smiled,at,her,from,the,painting,[END]
scarlett,stared,at,the,woman,above,her,on,the,wall,fascinated,[END]
scarlett,pauline,whispered,in,her,ear,[END]
père,wants,us,to,leave,now,[END]
say,good,night,quietly,and,come,with,me,[END]
supper,was,a,skimpy,meal,[END]
hardly,enough,in,scarlett's,opinion,for,one,of,the,bright-plumaged,fantasy,birds,painted,on,the,plates,that,held,it,[END]
that's,because,the,cook's,preparing,père's,birthday,feast,eulalie,explained,in,a,whisper,[END]
four,days,ahead,of,time,[END]
scarlett,said,loudly,[END]
what's,she,doing,watching,the,chicken,grow,up,[END]
good,heavens,she,grumbled,to,herself,she'd,be,as,skinny,as,grandfather,robillard,by,thursday,if,it,was,going,to,be,like,this,[END]
after,the,house,was,asleep,she,made,her,way,silently,down,to,the,basement,kitchen,and,ate,her,fill,of,the,cornbread,and,buttermilk,in,the,larder,[END]
let,the,servants,go,hungry,for,a,change,she,thought,pleased,that,her,suspicions,had,proven,accurate,[END]
pierre,robillard,might,keep,the,loyalty,of,his,daughters,when,their,stomachs,were,only,half-filled,but,his,servants,wouldn't,stay,unless,they,had,plenty,to,eat,[END]
the,next,morning,she,ordered,jerome,to,bring,her,eggs,and,bacon,and,biscuits,[END]
i,saw,plenty,in,the,kitchen,she,added,[END]
and,she,got,what,she,wanted,[END]
it,made,her,feel,much,better,about,her,meekness,the,night,before,[END]
it's,not,like,me,to,knuckle,under,that,way,she,thought,[END]
just,because,aunt,pauline,and,aunt,eulalie,were,shaking,like,leaves,that's,no,reason,for,me,to,let,the,old,man,scare,me,[END]
i,won't,let,it,happen,again,[END]
still,she,was,just,as,glad,that,she,had,the,servants,to,deal,with,and,not,her,grandfather,[END]
she,could,see,that,jerome,was,offended,and,it,rather,pleased,her,[END]
she,hadn't,had,a,show-down,with,anyone,in,a,long,time,and,she,did,love,to,win,[END]
the,other,ladies,will,have,bacon,and,eggs,too,she,told,jerome,[END]
and,this,isn't,enough,butter,for,my,biscuits,[END]
jerome,stalked,off,to,report,to,the,other,servants,[END]
scarlett's,demands,were,an,affront,to,them,all,[END]
not,because,they,meant,more,work,in,fact,she,was,only,asking,for,what,the,servants,always,had,for,breakfast,themselves,[END]
no,what,bothered,jerome,and,the,others,was,her,youth,and,energy,[END]
she,was,a,loud,disruption,of,the,house's,shrine-like,muted,atmosphere,[END]
the,servants,could,only,hope,that,she,would,leave,soon,and,without,wreaking,too,much,havoc,[END]
after,breakfast,eulalie,and,pauline,took,her,into,each,of,the,rooms,on,the,first,floor,talking,eagerly,about,the,parties,and,receptions,they,had,seen,in,their,youth,correcting,each,other,constantly,and,arguing,about,decades-old,details,[END]
scarlett,paused,for,a,long,time,in,front,of,the,portrait,of,three,young,girls,trying,to,see,her,mother's,composed,adult,features,in,the,chubby-cheeked,five-year-old,of,the,painting,[END]
scarlett,had,felt,isolated,in,charleston's,web,of,intermarried,generations,[END]
it,was,good,to,be,in,the,house,where,her,mother,had,been,born,and,reared,in,a,city,where,she,was,part,of,the,web,[END]
you,must,have,about,a,million,cousins,in,savannah,she,said,to,the,aunts,[END]
tell,me,about,them,[END]
can,i,meet,them,[END]
they're,my,cousins,too,[END]
pauline,and,eulalie,looked,confused,[END]
cousins,[END]
there,were,the,prudhommes,their,mother's,family,[END]
but,only,one,very,old,gentleman,was,in,savannah,the,widower,of,their,mother's,sister,[END]
the,rest,of,the,family,had,moved,to,new,orleans,many,years,ago,[END]
everyone,in,new,orleans,speaks,french,pauline,explained,[END]
and,as,for,the,robillards,they,were,the,only,ones,[END]
père,had,lots,of,cousins,in,france,brothers,too,two,of,them,[END]
but,he,was,the,only,one,to,come,to,america,[END]
eulalie,broke,in,[END]
but,we,have,many,many,friends,in,savannah,scarlett,[END]
you,can,certainly,meet,them,[END]
sister,and,i,will,be,paying,calls,and,leaving,cards,today,if,père,doesn't,need,us,to,stay,home,with,him,[END]
i'll,have,to,be,back,by,three,scarlett,said,quickly,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,be,out,when,rhett,arrived,nor,did,she,want,to,be,other,than,at,her,best,[END]
she'd,need,plenty,of,time,to,bathe,and,dress,before,the,train,from,charleston,got,in,[END]
but,rhett,didn't,come,and,when,scarlett,left,the,carefully,chosen,bench,in,the,immaculately,maintained,formal,garden,behind,the,house,she,felt,chilled,to,the,bone,[END]
she,had,refused,her,aunts',invitation,to,accompany,them,that,evening,to,the,musicale,they'd,been,invited,to,[END]
if,it,was,going,to,be,anything,like,the,tedious,reminiscences,of,the,old,ladies,they'd,called,on,that,morning,she'd,be,bored,to,death,[END]
but,her,grandfather's,malevolent,eyes,when,he,received,his,family,for,ten,minutes,before,supper,made,her,change,her,mind,[END]
anything,would,be,better,than,being,alone,in,the,house,with,grandfather,robillard,[END]
the,telfair,sisters,mary,and,margaret,were,the,recognized,cultural,guardians,of,savannah,and,their,musicale,was,nothing,like,the,ones,scarlett,had,known,before,[END]
usually,they,were,just,ladies,singing,showing,off,their,accomplishments,accompanied,by,other,ladies,on,the,pianoforte,[END]
it,was,obligatory,that,ladies,sing,a,little,play,the,piano,a,little,draw,or,paint,watercolors,a,little,and,do,fancy,needlework,a,little,[END]
at,the,telfairs',house,on,saint,james',square,the,standards,were,much,more,demanding,[END]
the,handsome,double,drawing,rooms,had,rows,of,gilt,chairs,across,their,centers,and,at,the,curved,end,of,one,of,the,rooms,a,piano,and,a,harp,and,six,chairs,with,music,stands,in,front,of,them,promised,some,real,performances,[END]
scarlett,made,mental,notes,of,all,the,arrangements,[END]
the,double,drawing,rooms,at,the,butler,house,could,easily,be,fixed,the,same,way,and,it,would,be,a,different,kind,of,party,from,what,everyone,else,did,[END]
she'd,have,a,reputation,as,an,elegant,hostess,in,no,time,at,all,[END]
she,wouldn't,be,old,and,frumpy,looking,like,the,telfair,sisters,either,[END]
or,as,dowdy,as,the,younger,women,who,were,here,[END]
why,was,it,that,everywhere,in,the,south,people,thought,they,had,to,look,poor,and,patched,to,prove,they,were,respectable,[END]
the,string,quartet,bored,her,and,she,thought,the,harpist,would,never,finish,[END]
she,did,enjoy,the,singers,even,though,she,had,never,heard,of,opera,at,least,there,was,a,man,singing,with,the,woman,instead,of,two,girls,together,[END]
and,after,the,songs,in,foreign,languages,they,did,a,group,of,songs,she,knew,[END]
the,man's,voice,was,wonderfully,romantic,in,beautiful,dreamer,and,it,throbbed,with,emotion,when,he,sang,come,back,to,erin,mavourneen,mavourneen,[END]
she,had,to,admit,he,sounded,a,lot,better,than,gerald,o'hara,in,his,cups,[END]
i,wonder,what,pa,would,make,of,all,this,[END]
scarlett,almost,giggled,aloud,[END]
he'd,probably,sing,along,and,add,something,from,a,flask,to,the,punch,too,[END]
then,he'd,ask,for,peg,in,a,low,back'd,car,[END]
just,as,she,had,asked,rhett,to,sing,it,[END]
the,room,and,the,people,in,it,and,the,music,disappeared,for,her,and,she,heard,rhett's,voice,booming,inside,the,overturned,sloop,felt,his,arms,holding,her,to,his,warmth,[END]
he,can't,do,without,me,[END]
he'll,come,to,me,this,time,[END]
it's,my,turn,[END]
scarlett,didn't,realize,that,she,was,smiling,during,a,touching,rendition,of,silver,threads,among,the,gold,[END]
the,next,day,she,sent,a,telegram,to,her,uncle,henry,giving,her,address,in,savannah,[END]
she,hesitated,then,added,a,question,[END]
had,rhett,transferred,any,money,to,her,[END]
what,if,rhett,tried,to,play,some,kind,of,game,again,and,stopped,sending,the,money,to,keep,up,the,house,on,peachtree,street,[END]
no,surely,he,wouldn't,do,that,[END]
just,the,opposite,[END]
his,letter,said,he,was,sending,the,half,million,[END]
it,couldn't,be,true,[END]
he,was,only,bluffing,when,he,wrote,all,those,hurtful,things,[END]
like,opium,he'd,said,[END]
he,couldn't,do,without,her,[END]
he'd,come,after,her,[END]
it,would,be,harder,for,him,to,swallow,his,pride,than,it,would,for,any,other,man,but,he'd,come,[END]
he,had,to,[END]
he,couldn't,do,without,her,[END]
especially,not,after,what,happened,on,the,beach,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,warm,weakness,travelling,through,her,body,and,she,forced,herself,to,remember,where,she,was,[END]
she,paid,for,the,telegram,and,listened,attentively,when,the,telegraph,operator,gave,her,directions,to,the,convent,of,the,sisters,of,mercy,[END]
then,she,set,off,at,such,a,rapid,pace,that,pansy,almost,had,to,run,to,keep,up,[END]
while,she,was,waiting,for,rhett,to,come,she,should,have,just,enough,time,to,track,down,carreen's,mother,superior,and,get,her,to,talk,to,the,bishop,as,rhett,had,suggested,[END]
savannah's,convent,of,the,sisters,of,mercy,was,a,big,white,building,with,a,cross,over,its,tall,closed,doors,surrounded,by,a,tall,iron,fence,with,closed,gates,surmounted,by,iron,crosses,[END]
scarlett's,rapid,pace,slowed,then,she,stopped,[END]
it,was,very,different,from,the,handsome,brick,house,in,charleston,[END]
is,you,going,in,there,miss,scarlett,[END]
pansy's,voice,had,a,quaver,in,it,[END]
i,better,wait,outside,[END]
i'm,a,baptist,[END]
don't,be,such,a,goose,[END]
pansy's,fearfulness,gave,scarlett,courage,[END]
it's,not,a,church,just,a,home,for,nice,ladies,like,miss,carreen,[END]
the,gate,opened,at,her,touch,[END]
yes,said,the,elderly,nun,who,opened,the,door,when,scarlett,rang,the,bell,yes,charleston's,mother,superior,was,there,[END]
no,she,couldn't,ask,her,to,see,mrs,butler,right,now,[END]
there,was,a,meeting,in,progress,[END]
no,she,didn't,know,how,long,it,would,last,nor,whether,the,mother,superior,would,be,able,to,see,mrs,butler,when,it,was,over,[END]
perhaps,mrs,butler,would,like,to,see,the,schoolrooms,the,convent,was,very,proud,of,its,school,[END]
or,it,was,possible,that,a,tour,of,the,new,cathedral,building,could,be,arranged,[END]
after,that,perhaps,the,mother,superior,could,be,sent,a,message,if,the,meeting,had,ended,[END]
scarlett,forced,herself,to,smile,[END]
the,last,thing,on,earth,i,want,to,do,is,admire,a,bunch,of,children,she,thought,angrily,[END]
or,look,at,some,church,either,[END]
she,was,about,to,say,that,she'd,simply,come,back,later,then,the,nun's,words,gave,her,an,idea,[END]
they,were,building,a,new,cathedral,were,they,[END]
that,cost,money,[END]
maybe,her,offer,to,buy,back,carreen's,share,of,tara,would,be,looked,on,more,favorably,here,than,it,had,been,in,charleston,just,like,rhett,said,[END]
after,all,tara,was,georgia,property,probably,controlled,by,the,bishop,of,georgia,[END]
suppose,she,offered,to,buy,a,stained,glass,window,in,the,new,cathedral,as,carreen's,dowry,[END]
the,cost,would,be,much,higher,than,carreen's,share,of,tara,was,worth,and,she'd,make,it,clear,that,the,window,was,in,exchange,not,in,addition,[END]
the,bishop,would,listen,to,reason,and,then,he'd,tell,the,mother,superior,what,to,do,[END]
scarlett's,smile,became,warmer,wider,[END]
i'd,be,honored,to,see,the,cathedral,sister,if,you're,sure,it's,not,too,much,trouble,[END]
pansy's,mouth,gaped,open,when,she,looked,up,at,the,soaring,twin,spires,of,the,handsome,gothic-design,cathedral,[END]
the,workmen,on,the,scaffolding,that,surrounded,the,nearly,completed,towers,looked,small,and,nimble,like,brightly,garbed,squirrels,high,in,paired,trees,[END]
but,scarlett,had,no,eyes,for,the,drama,overhead,[END]
her,pulse,was,quickened,by,the,organized,hubbub,on,the,ground,the,sounds,of,hammering,sawing,and,especially,by,the,familiar,resiny,smell,of,fresh-cut,lumber,[END]
oh,how,she,missed,the,lumber,mills,and,lumberyards,[END]
her,palms,itched,with,the,yearning,to,run,her,hands,over,the,clean,wood,to,be,busy,to,be,doing,something,making,a,difference,running,things,instead,of,taking,tea,from,dainty,cups,with,washed-out,dainty,old,ladies,[END]
scarlett,heard,barely,a,word,of,the,descriptive,wonders,outlined,by,the,young,priest,who,was,her,escort,[END]
she,did,not,even,notice,the,surreptitious,admiring,looks,of,the,burly,laborers,who,stood,back,from,their,work,to,allow,the,priest,and,his,companion,free,passage,[END]
she,was,too,preoccupied,to,listen,or,notice,[END]
what,fine,straight,trees,had,given,up,these,timbers,[END]
it,was,the,best,heart,pine,she'd,ever,seen,[END]
she,wondered,where,the,mill,was,what,kind,of,saws,it,had,what,kind,of,power,[END]
oh,if,only,she,was,a,man,[END]
then,she,could,ask,could,go,see,the,mill,instead,of,this,church,[END]
scarlett,scuffled,her,feet,through,a,mound,of,fresh,wood,shavings,and,inhaled,the,tonic,of,the,sharp,scent,of,them,[END]
i,must,get,back,to,the,school,for,dinner,said,the,priest,apologetically,[END]
of,course,father,i'm,ready,to,go,[END]
she,wasn't,but,what,else,could,she,say,[END]
scarlett,followed,him,out,of,the,cathedral,and,onto,the,sidewalk,[END]
begging,your,pardon,father,[END]
the,speaker,was,a,huge,redfaced,man,wearing,a,red,shirt,that,was,heavily,whitened,by,mortar,dust,[END]
the,priest,looked,diminutive,and,pale,beside,him,[END]
if,you,could,be,saying,a,small,blessing,on,the,work,father,[END]
the,lintel,to,the,chapel,of,the,sacred,heart,was,set,not,an,hour,ago,[END]
why,he,sounds,just,like,pa,at,his,most,irish,[END]
scarlett,bowed,her,head,for,the,priest's,blessing,as,did,the,groups,of,workmen,[END]
her,eyes,smarted,from,the,tang,of,the,cut,pine,and,the,quick,tears,for,her,father,that,she,blinked,away,[END]
i'll,go,see,pa's,brothers,she,decided,[END]
no,matter,that,they,must,be,about,a,hundred,years,old,pa,would,want,me,to,go,and,say,hello,at,least,[END]
she,walked,with,the,priest,back,to,the,convent,and,another,placid,refusal,by,the,elderly,nun,when,she,asked,to,see,the,mother,superior,[END]
scarlett,kept,her,temper,but,her,eyes,were,dangerously,bright,[END]
tell,her,i'll,be,back,this,afternoon,she,said,[END]
as,the,tall,iron,gate,swung,closed,behind,her,scarlett,heard,the,sound,of,church,bells,from,a,few,blocks,away,[END]
bother,[END]
she,said,[END]
she,was,going,to,be,late,for,dinner,[END]
34,[END]
scarlett,smelled,fried,chicken,as,soon,as,she,opened,the,door,of,the,big,pink,house,[END]
take,these,things,she,said,to,pansy,and,she,got,out,of,her,cape,and,hat,and,gloves,with,record,speed,[END]
she,was,very,hungry,[END]
eulalie,looked,at,her,with,huge,mournful,eyes,when,she,entered,the,dining,room,[END]
père,wants,to,see,you,scarlett,[END]
can't,it,wait,until,after,dinner,[END]
i'm,starving,[END]
he,said,the,minute,she,comes,',[END]
scarlett,picked,up,a,steaming,hot,roll,from,the,bread,basket,and,took,an,angry,bite,as,she,swung,on,her,heel,[END]
she,finished,it,while,she,marched,to,her,grandfather's,room,[END]
the,old,man,frowned,at,her,over,the,tray,that,rested,on,his,lap,in,the,big,bed,[END]
his,plate,scarlett,saw,held,only,mashed,potatoes,and,a,mound,of,soggy-looking,bits,of,carrot,[END]
my,grief,[END]
no,wonder,he,looks,so,fierce,[END]
there's,not,even,any,butter,on,the,potatoes,[END]
even,if,he,doesn't,have,a,tooth,in,his,head,they,could,feed,him,better,than,that,[END]
i,do,not,tolerate,a,disregard,for,the,schedule,of,my,house,said,the,old,man,[END]
i'm,sorry,grandfather,[END]
discipline,is,what,made,the,emperor's,armies,great,without,discipline,there,is,only,chaos,[END]
his,voice,was,deep,strong,fearsome,[END]
but,scarlett,saw,the,sharp,old,bones,jutting,under,his,heavy,linen,nightshirt,and,she,felt,no,fear,[END]
i,said,i,was,sorry,[END]
may,i,go,now,[END]
i'm,hungry,[END]
don't,be,impertinent,young,lady,[END]
there's,nothing,impertinent,about,being,hungry,grandfather,[END]
just,because,you,don't,want,to,eat,your,dinner,it,doesn't,mean,nobody,else,should,have,any,[END]
pierre,robillard,pushed,angrily,at,his,tray,[END]
pap,[END]
he,growled,[END]
not,fit,for,pigs,[END]
scarlett,edged,toward,the,door,[END]
i,have,not,dismissed,you,miss,[END]
she,felt,her,stomach,growl,[END]
the,rolls,would,be,cold,by,now,the,chicken,might,even,be,gone,with,aunt,eulalie's,appetite,being,what,it,was,[END]
god's,nightgown,grandfather,i'm,not,one,of,your,soldiers,[END]

if,you,want,to,starve,yourself,to,death,that's,up,to,you,[END]
i'm,hungry,and,i'm,going,to,go,have,whatever,dinner,is,left,[END]
she,was,halfway,out,the,door,when,a,strange,choking,sound,made,her,turn,back,[END]
dear,god,have,i,given,him,apoplexy,[END]
don't,let,him,die,on,me,[END]
pierre,robillard,was,laughing,[END]
scarlett,put,her,hands,on,her,hips,and,glared,at,him,[END]
he'd,scared,her,half,to,death,[END]
he,waved,her,away,with,a,long-fingered,bony,hand,[END]
eat,he,said,eat,[END]
then,he,began,laughing,again,[END]
what,happened,[END]
asked,pauline,[END]
i,didn't,hear,shouting,did,i,scarlett,[END]
said,eulalie,[END]
they,were,sitting,at,table,waiting,for,dessert,[END]
the,dinner,was,gone,[END]
nothing,happened,scarlett,said,through,her,teeth,[END]
she,picked,up,the,small,silver,bell,on,the,table,and,shook,it,furiously,[END]
when,the,stout,black,maid,appeared,carrying,two,small,dishes,of,pudding,scarlett,stalked,over,to,her,[END]
she,put,her,hands,on,the,woman's,shoulders,and,turned,her,around,[END]
now,you,march,and,i,mean,march,not,amble,along,[END]
you,go,down,to,the,kitchen,and,bring,me,my,dinner,[END]
hot,and,plenty,of,it,and,in,a,hurry,[END]
i,don't,care,which,one,of,you,was,planning,to,eat,it,but,you'll,have,to,make,do,with,the,back,and,the,wings,[END]
i,want,a,thigh,and,a,breast,and,plenty,of,gravy,on,my,potatoes,and,a,bowl,of,butter,with,the,rolls,nice,and,hot,[END]
go,on,[END]
she,sat,down,with,a,flounce,ready,to,do,battle,with,her,aunts,if,they,said,so,much,as,one,word,[END]
silence,filled,the,room,until,her,dinner,was,served,[END]
pauline,contained,herself,until,scarlett's,food,was,half-eaten,[END]
then,what,did,père,say,to,you,[END]
she,asked,politely,[END]
scarlett,wiped,her,mouth,with,her,napkin,[END]
he,just,tried,to,bully,me,the,way,he,does,you,and,aunt,'lalie,so,i,gave,him,a,piece,of,my,mind,[END]
it,made,him,laugh,[END]
the,two,sisters,exchanged,shocked,looks,[END]
scarlett,smiled,and,ladled,more,gravy,onto,the,potatoes,left,on,her,plate,[END]
what,geese,her,aunts,were,[END]
didn't,they,know,that,you,had,to,stand,up,to,bullies,like,their,father,or,else,they'd,trample,right,over,you,[END]
it,never,occurred,to,scarlett,that,she,was,able,to,resist,being,bullied,because,she,was,a,bully,herself,or,that,her,grandfather's,laughter,was,caused,by,his,recognition,of,her,resemblance,to,him,[END]
when,dessert,was,served,the,bowls,of,tapioca,had,somehow,become,larger,[END]
eulalie,smiled,gratefully,at,her,niece,[END]
sister,and,i,were,just,saying,how,much,we,enjoyed,having,you,with,us,in,our,old,home,scarlett,[END]
don't,you,find,savannah,a,lovely,little,city,[END]
did,you,see,the,fountain,in,chippewa,square,[END]
and,the,theater,[END]
it's,nearly,as,old,as,charleston's,[END]
i,remember,how,sister,and,i,used,to,look,out,of,the,windows,of,our,schoolroom,at,the,thespians,coming,and,going,[END]
don't,you,remember,sister,[END]
pauline,remembered,[END]
she,also,remembered,that,scarlett,had,not,told,them,she,was,going,out,that,morning,nor,where,she,had,been,[END]
when,scarlett,reported,that,she'd,been,to,the,cathedral,pauline,put,her,finger,to,her,lips,[END]
père,she,said,was,unfortunately,extremely,opposed,to,roman,catholicism,[END]
it,had,something,to,do,with,french,history,she,wasn't,sure,what,but,he,got,very,angry,about,the,church,[END]
that,was,the,reason,she,and,eulalie,always,left,charleston,after,mass,to,come,to,savannah,and,left,savannah,on,saturday,to,return,to,charleston,[END]
this,year,there,was,a,particular,difficulty,because,easter,was,so,early,they,would,be,in,savannah,for,ash,wednesday,[END]
naturally,they,had,to,attend,mass,and,they,could,leave,the,house,early,and,unobserved,[END]
but,how,could,they,keep,their,father,from,seeing,the,smudges,of,ash,on,their,foreheads,when,they,returned,to,the,house,[END]
wash,your,face,said,scarlett,impatiently,thereby,revealing,her,ignorance,and,the,recent,date,of,her,return,to,religion,[END]
she,dropped,her,napkin,on,the,table,[END]
i've,got,to,be,off,she,said,briskly,[END]
i,[END]
i'm,going,to,visit,my,o'hara,uncles,and,aunts,[END]
she,didn't,want,anyone,to,know,that,she,was,trying,to,buy,the,convent's,share,of,tara,[END]
especially,not,her,aunts,they,gossiped,too,much,[END]
why,they,might,even,write,to,suellen,[END]
she,smiled,sweetly,[END]
what,time,do,we,leave,in,the,morning,for,mass,[END]
she'd,be,sure,to,mention,it,to,the,mother,superior,[END]
no,need,to,let,on,that,she'd,forgotten,all,about,ash,wednesday,[END]
what,a,bother,it,was,that,she'd,left,her,rosary,in,charleston,[END]
oh,well,she,could,buy,a,new,one,at,her,o'hara,uncles',store,[END]
if,she,remembered,correctly,they,had,everything,in,there,from,bonnets,to,plows,[END]
miss,scarlett,when,are,we,going,home,to,atlanta,[END]
i,don't,feel,comfortable,with,the,folks,in,your,grandpa's,kitchen,[END]
they,is,all,so,old,[END]
and,my,shoes,is,just,about,wore,out,from,all,this,walking,[END]
when,are,we,going,home,where,you,got,all,the,fine,carriages,[END]
stop,that,everlasting,complaining,pansy,[END]
we'll,go,when,i,say,go,and,where,i,say,go,[END]
scarlett's,response,had,no,real,heat,in,it,she,was,trying,to,remember,where,her,uncles',store,was,and,having,no,luck,[END]
i,must,be,catching,old,folks',forgetfulness,[END]
pansy's,right,about,that,part,[END]
everybody,i,know,in,savannah,is,old,[END]
grandfather,aunt,eulalie,aunt,pauline,all,their,friends,[END]
and,pa's,brothers,are,the,oldest,of,all,[END]
i'll,just,say,hello,and,let,them,give,me,a,nasty,dry,old,man's,kiss,on,the,cheek,and,buy,my,rosary,and,leave,[END]
there's,no,real,call,to,see,their,wives,[END]
if,they,cared,about,seeing,me,they,would,have,done,something,about,keeping,up,all,these,years,[END]
why,for,all,they,know,i,could,be,dead,and,buried,and,not,so,much,as,a,condolence,note,to,my,husband,and,children,[END]
a,mighty,tacky,way,to,treat,a,blood,relative,i,call,it,[END]
maybe,i'll,just,forget,about,going,to,see,any,of,them,at,all,[END]
they,don't,deserve,any,visits,from,me,after,the,way,they,neglected,me,she,thought,ignoring,the,letters,from,savannah,that,she'd,never,answered,until,finally,they,stopped,coming,[END]
she,was,ready,to,consign,her,father's,brothers,and,their,wives,permanently,to,oblivion,in,the,recesses,of,her,mind,now,[END]
she,was,fixed,on,two,things,getting,control,of,tara,and,getting,the,upper,hand,with,rhett,[END]
never,mind,that,the,two,were,contradictory,goals,she'd,find,a,way,to,have,both,[END]
and,they,demanded,all,the,thinking,she,had,time,for,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,go,trailing,around,looking,for,that,musty,old,store,scarlett,decided,[END]
i've,got,to,track,down,the,mother,superior,and,the,bishop,[END]
oh,i,do,wish,i,hadn't,left,those,beads,in,charleston,[END]
she,looked,quickly,along,the,storefronts,on,the,other,side,of,broughton,street,savannah's,place,to,shop,[END]
surely,there,must,be,a,jeweler,somewhere,close,by,[END]
the,bold,gilt,letters,that,spelled,out,o'hara,stretched,across,the,wall,above,five,gleaming,windows,almost,directly,opposite,[END]
my,they've,come,up,in,the,world,since,i,was,here,last,scarlett,thought,[END]
that,doesn't,look,musty,at,all,[END]
come,on,she,said,to,pansy,and,she,plunged,into,the,tangled,traffic,of,wagons,buggies,and,pushcarts,that,filled,the,busy,street,[END]
the,o'hara,store,smelled,of,fresh,paint,not,long-settled,dust,[END]
a,green,tarlatan,banner,draped,across,the,front,of,the,counter,in,the,rear,gave,the,reason,in,gold,letters,grand,opening,[END]
scarlett,looked,around,enviously,[END]
the,store,was,more,than,twice,the,size,of,her,store,in,atlanta,and,she,could,see,that,the,stock,was,fresher,and,more,varied,[END]
neatly,labelled,boxes,and,bolts,of,bright,fabrics,filled,shelves,to,the,ceiling,barrels,of,meals,and,flours,were,lined,up,along,the,floor,not,far,from,the,big,potbellied,stove,in,the,center,and,huge,glass,jars,of,candy,stood,temptingly,on,the,tall,counter,[END]
her,uncles,were,moving,up,in,the,world,for,sure,[END]
the,store,she'd,visited,in,1861,wasn't,in,the,central,fashionable,part,of,broughton,street,and,it,was,dark,cluttered,even,more,so,than,hers,in,atlanta,[END]
it,would,be,interesting,to,find,out,what,this,handsome,expansion,had,cost,her,uncles,[END]
she,might,just,consider,a,few,of,their,ideas,for,her,own,business,[END]
she,walked,quickly,to,the,counter,[END]
i'd,like,to,see,mr,o'hara,if,you,please,she,said,to,the,tall,aproned,man,who,was,measuring,out,some,lamp,oil,into,a,customer's,glass,jug,[END]
in,a,moment,if,you'll,be,so,kind,as,to,wait,ma'am,the,man,said,without,looking,up,[END]
his,voice,had,just,a,hint,of,brogue,in,it,[END]
that,makes,sense,thought,scarlett,[END]
hire,irish,for,a,shop,run,by,irishmen,[END]
she,looked,at,the,labels,on,the,shelved,boxes,in,front,of,her,while,the,man,wrapped,the,oil,in,brown,paper,and,made,change,[END]
hmmm,she,should,be,keeping,gloves,that,way,too,by,size,not,by,color,[END]
you,could,see,the,colors,quick,enough,when,you,opened,the,box,but,it,was,a,real,bother,to,search,for,the,right,size,in,a,box,of,gloves,that,were,all,of,them,black,[END]
why,hadn't,she,thought,of,it,before,[END]
the,man,behind,the,counter,had,to,speak,again,before,scarlett,heard,him,[END]
i'm,mr,o'hara,he,repeated,[END]
how,might,i,be,of,service,to,you,[END]
oh,no,this,wasn't,the,uncles',store,after,all,[END]
they,must,still,be,where,they'd,always,been,[END]
scarlett,explained,hurriedly,that,she'd,made,a,mistake,[END]
she,was,looking,for,an,elderly,mr,o'hara,mr,andrew,or,mr,james,[END]
can,you,direct,me,to,their,store,[END]
but,this,is,their,store,[END]
i'm,their,nephew,[END]
oh,[END]
oh,my,goodness,[END]
then,you,must,be,my,cousin,[END]
i'm,katie,scarlett,gerald's,daughter,[END]
from,atlanta,[END]
scarlett,held,out,both,her,hands,[END]
a,cousin,[END]
a,big,strong,not-an-old-man,cousin,of,her,own,[END]
she,felt,as,if,she'd,just,been,given,a,surprise,present,[END]
jamie,that's,me,said,her,cousin,with,a,laugh,taking,her,hands,in,his,[END]
jamie,o'hara,at,your,service,scarlett,o'hara,[END]
and,what,a,gift,you,are,to,a,weary,businessman,to,be,sure,[END]
pretty,as,a,sunrise,and,dropping,from,out,of,the,blue,like,a,falling,star,[END]
tell,me,now,how,do,you,come,to,be,here,for,the,grand,opening,of,the,new,store,[END]
come,let,me,get,you,a,chair,[END]
scarlett,forgot,all,about,the,rosary,she'd,meant,to,buy,[END]
she,forgot,about,the,mother,superior,too,[END]
and,about,pansy,who,settled,herself,on,a,low,stool,in,a,corner,and,went,to,sleep,at,once,with,her,head,resting,on,a,neat,pile,of,horse,blankets,[END]
jamie,o'hara,mumbled,something,under,his,breath,when,he,returned,from,the,back,room,with,a,chair,for,scarlett,[END]
there,were,four,customers,waiting,to,be,served,[END]
in,the,next,half,hour,more,and,more,came,in,so,that,there,was,no,chance,for,him,to,say,a,word,to,scarlett,[END]
he,looked,at,her,from,time,to,time,with,apology,in,his,eyes,but,she,smiled,and,shook,her,head,[END]
there,was,no,need,to,apologize,[END]
she,was,pleased,just,to,be,there,in,a,warm,well-run,store,that,was,doing,a,good,business,with,a,new-found,cousin,whose,competence,and,skillful,treatment,of,his,customers,was,a,delight,to,observe,[END]
at,last,there,was,a,brief,moment,when,the,only,customers,were,a,mother,and,her,three,daughters,who,were,looking,through,four,boxes,of,laces,[END]
i'll,talk,like,a,rushing,river,then,while,i,can,said,jamie,[END]
uncle,james,will,be,longing,to,see,you,katie,scarlett,[END]
he's,an,old,gentleman,but,still,active,enough,[END]
he's,here,every,day,until,dinnertime,[END]
you,may,not,know,it,but,his,wife,died,god,rest,her,soul,and,uncle,andrew's,wife,as,well,[END]
it,took,the,heart,out,of,uncle,andrew,and,he,followed,her,within,a,month,[END]
may,they,all,be,resting,in,the,arms,of,the,angels,[END]
uncle,james,lives,in,the,house,with,me,and,my,wife,and,children,[END]
it's,not,far,from,here,[END]
will,you,come,to,tea,this,afternoon,and,see,them,all,[END]
my,boy,daniel,will,be,back,soon,from,making,deliveries,and,i'll,walk,you,to,the,house,[END]
we're,celebrating,my,daughter,patricia's,birthday,today,[END]
all,the,family,will,be,there,[END]
scarlett,said,she'd,love,to,go,to,tea,[END]
then,she,took,off,her,hat,and,cape,and,walked,over,to,the,ladies,at,the,laces,[END]
there,was,more,than,one,o'hara,who,knew,how,to,run,a,store,[END]
besides,she,was,too,excited,to,sit,still,[END]
a,birthday,for,her,cousin's,daughter,[END]
let's,see,she'll,be,my,first,cousin,once,removed,[END]
although,scarlett,had,grown,up,without,the,usual,many-generation,family,network,of,the,south,she,was,still,a,southerner,and,could,name,the,exact,relationship,of,cousins,to,the,tenth,remove,[END]
she,had,revelled,in,watching,jamie,while,he,worked,because,he,was,the,living,confirmation,of,everything,gerald,o'hara,had,told,her,[END]
he,had,the,dark,curly,hair,and,blue,eyes,of,the,o'haras,[END]
and,the,wide,mouth,and,short,nose,in,the,round,florid,face,[END]
most,of,all,he,was,a,big,man,tall,and,broad,through,the,chest,with,strong,thick,legs,like,the,trunks,of,trees,that,could,withstand,any,storm,[END]
he,was,an,impressive,figure,[END]
your,pa,is,the,runt,of,the,litter,gerald,had,said,without,shame,for,himself,but,with,enormous,pride,in,his,brothers,[END]
eight,children,my,mother,had,and,all,boys,and,me,the,last,and,the,only,one,not,as,big,as,a,house,[END]
scarlett,wondered,which,of,the,brothers,was,jamie's,father,[END]
no,matter,she'd,find,out,at,the,tea,[END]
no,not,tea,the,birthday,party,[END]
for,her,first,cousin,once,removed,[END]
35,[END]
scarlett,looked,up,at,her,cousin,jamie,with,carefully,concealed,curiosity,[END]
in,the,daylight,of,the,open,street,the,lines,and,pouches,beneath,his,eyes,weren't,blended,away,by,shadows,the,way,they,were,inside,the,store,[END]
he,was,a,middle-aged,man,running,to,weight,and,softness,[END]
she'd,assumed,somehow,that,because,he,was,her,cousin,he,must,be,her,age,[END]
when,his,son,came,in,she,was,shocked,to,be,introduced,to,a,grown,man,not,a,boy,who,delivered,packages,[END]
and,a,grown,man,with,flaming,red,hair,to,boot,[END]
it,took,some,getting,used,to,[END]
so,did,the,sight,of,jamie,in,daylight,[END]
he,[END]
he,wasn't,a,gentleman,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,specify,how,she,knew,that,but,it,was,as,clear,as,glass,[END]
there,was,something,wrong,with,his,clothes,his,suit,was,dark,blue,but,not,dark,enough,and,it,fit,him,too,closely,through,the,chest,and,shoulders,and,too,loosely,everywhere,else,[END]
rhett's,clothing,was,she,knew,the,result,of,superlative,tailoring,and,on,his,part,demanding,perfectionism,[END]
she,wouldn't,expect,jamie,to,dress,like,rhett,she'd,never,known,man,who,dressed,like,rhett,[END]
but,any,still,he,could,do,something,whatever,it,was,that,men,did,so,that,he,wouldn't,look,so,[END]
so,common,[END]
gerald,o'hara,had,always,looked,like,a,gentleman,no,matter,how,worn,or,rumpled,his,coat,might,be,[END]
it,didn't,occur,to,scarlett,that,her,mother's,quiet,authority,and,influence,might,have,been,at,work,on,her,father's,transformation,to,gentleman,landowner,[END]
scarlett,only,knew,that,she'd,lost,most,of,her,joy,in,discovering,the,existence,of,her,cousin,[END]
well,i,only,have,to,have,a,cup,of,tea,and,a,piece,of,cake,and,then,i,can,leave,[END]
she,smiled,brilliantly,at,jamie,[END]
i'm,so,thrilled,to,be,meeting,your,family,that,i've,taken,leave,of,my,senses,jamie,[END]
i,should,have,bought,a,present,for,your,daughter's,birthday,[END]
aren't,i,bringing,her,the,best,gift,of,all,when,i,walk,in,with,you,on,my,arm,katie,scarlett,[END]
he,does,have,a,twinkle,in,his,eye,just,like,pa,scarlett,told,herself,[END]
and,pa's,teasing,brogue,[END]
if,only,he,wasn't,wearing,a,derby,hat,[END]
nobody,wears,derby,hats,[END]
we'll,be,walking,past,your,grandfather's,house,jamie,said,striking,horror,to,scarlett's,heart,[END]
what,if,her,aunts,saw,them,suppose,she,had,to,introduce,them,[END]
they,always,thought,mother,married,beneath,her,jamie,would,be,all,the,proof,they,could,ever,want,[END]

she,had,to,pay,attention,[END]

we,don't,have,any,servants,[END]
no,servants,[END]
good,lord,[END]
everybody,has,servants,everybody,[END]
what,kind,of,place,do,they,live,in,a,tenement,[END]
scarlett,squared,her,jaw,[END]
this,is,pa's,own,brother's,son,and,uncle,james,is,pa's,own,brother,[END]
i,won't,disgrace,his,memory,by,being,too,cowardly,to,take,a,cup,of,tea,with,them,even,if,there,are,rats,running,across,the,floor,[END]
pansy,she,said,when,we,get,to,the,house,you,go,on,in,[END]
i'll,be,back,directly,you,tell,them,[END]
you,will,walk,me,home,won't,you,jamie,[END]
she,was,brave,enough,to,face,a,rat,running,across,her,foot,but,she,wasn't,willing,to,ruin,her,reputation,for,all,time,by,walking,alone,on,the,street,[END]
ladies,just,didn't,do,that,[END]
to,scarlett's,relief,they,walked,along,the,street,behind,her,grandfather's,house,not,by,the,square,in,front,of,it,where,her,aunts,liked,to,promenade,under,the,trees,for,their,constitutionals,[END]
pansy,went,willingly,through,the,gate,into,the,garden,already,yawning,anticipation,of,going,back,to,sleep,[END]
scarlett,tried,not,to,look,anxious,[END]
she'd,heard,jerome,complaining,to,her,aunts,about,the,deterioration,of,the,neighborhood,[END]
only,a,few,blocks,to,the,east,the,fine,old,homes,had,degenerated,into,ramshackle,boardinghouses,for,the,sailors,who,manned,the,ships,in,and,out,of,savannah's,busy,port,[END]
and,for,the,waves,of,immigrants,who,arrived,on,some,of,the,ships,[END]
most,of,them,according,to,the,snobbish,elegant,old,black,man,were,unwashed,irish,[END]
james,escorted,her,straight,ahead,and,she,sighed,silently,with,relief,[END]
then,very,soon,he,turned,onto,the,handsome,well-kept,avenue,called,south,broad,and,announced,here,we,are,in,front,of,a,tall,substantial,brick,house,[END]
how,nice,[END]
scarlett,said,with,all,her,heart,[END]
it,was,almost,the,last,thing,she,got,to,say,for,some,time,[END]
instead,of,climbing,the,stairs,to,the,big,door,on,the,high,stoop,jamie,opened,a,smaller,door,at,street,level,and,ushered,her,into,the,kitchen,and,an,overwhelming,onslaught,of,people,all,of,them,redheaded,and,all,of,them,noisily,welcoming,when,he,shouted,out,above,the,hubbub,of,greetings,this,is,scarlett,my,uncle,gerald,o'hara's,beautiful,daughter,come,all,the,way,from,atlanta,to,see,uncle,james,[END]
there,are,so,many,of,them,scarlett,thought,when,they,rushed,toward,her,[END]
jamie's,laughter,when,the,youngest,girl,and,a,little,boy,grabbed,him,around,the,knees,made,it,impossible,to,understand,what,he,was,saying,[END]
then,a,large,stout,woman,with,hair,redder,than,any,of,them,held,out,a,roughened,hand,to,scarlett,[END]
welcome,to,the,house,she,said,placidly,[END]
i'm,jamie's,wife,maureen,[END]
pay,no,attention,to,these,savages,come,sit,by,the,fire,and,have,a,cup,of,tea,[END]
she,took,scarlett's,arm,in,a,firm,grip,and,drew,her,into,the,room,[END]
quiet,you,heathens,let,your,pa,catch,his,breath,can't,you,[END]
then,wash,your,faces,and,come,meet,scarlett,one,by,one,[END]
she,plucked,scarlett's,fur,cape,from,her,shoulders,[END]
put,this,in,a,safe,place,mary,kate,else,the,baby,will,think,it's,a,kitten,to,pull,the,tail,on,so,soft,is,it,[END]
the,larger,of,the,girls,bobbed,a,curtsey,in,scarlett's,direction,and,held,out,eager,hands,for,the,fur,[END]
her,blue,eyes,were,huge,with,admiration,[END]
scarlett,smiled,at,her,[END]
and,at,maureen,even,though,jamie's,wife,was,pushing,her,down,onto,a,windsor,chair,as,if,she,thought,scarlett,was,one,of,her,children,to,be,ordered,around,[END]
in,an,instant,scarlett,found,herself,holding,the,biggest,cup,she,had,ever,seen,in,one,hand,while,with,the,other,she,was,shaking,hands,with,a,startlingly,beautiful,young,girl,who,whispered,she,looks,like,a,princess,to,her,mother,and,i'm,helen,to,scarlett,[END]
you,should,touch,the,furs,helen,said,mary,kate,importantly,[END]
is,helen,the,guest,here,then,that,you're,addressing,yourself,to,her,[END]
maureen,said,[END]
what,a,disgrace,for,a,mother,to,have,such,an,eejit,child,[END]
her,voice,was,warm,with,affection,and,suppressed,laughter,[END]
mary,kate's,cheeks,stained,with,embarrassment,[END]
she,curtseyed,again,and,held,out,her,hand,[END]
cousin,scarlett,i,ask,your,pardon,[END]
i,forgot,myself,in,looking,at,your,elegances,[END]
i'm,mary,kate,and,it's,proud,i,am,to,be,cousin,to,such,a,grand,lady,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,say,no,pardon,was,needed,but,she,had,no,chance,[END]
jamie,had,taken,off,his,hat,and,his,suit,coat,and,unbuttoned,his,vest,[END]
under,his,right,arm,he,was,holding,a,child,a,kicking,squealing,chubby,redheaded,bundle,of,delighted,struggle,[END]

say,hello,to,your,cousin,jacky,if,you've,got,a,tongue,in,your,head,[END]
hello,[END]
shouted,the,little,boy,then,shrieked,with,excitement,when,his,father,turned,him,upside,down,[END]
what's,all,this,now,[END]
the,noise,except,for,jacky's,giggles,died,down,at,once,when,the,thin,querulous,tones,cut,through,the,racket,[END]
scarlett,looked,across,the,kitchen,and,saw,a,tall,old,man,who,must,be,her,uncle,james,[END]
there,was,a,pretty,girl,with,dark,curly,hair,at,his,side,[END]
she,looked,alarmed,and,timid,[END]
jacky,woke,uncle,james,from,his,rest,she,said,[END]
is,he,hurt,then,to,be,howling,so,and,to,bring,jamie,home,early,[END]

last,time,i,saw,you,you,were,mourning,your,husband,[END]

scarlett's,mind,raced,backwards,[END]

there,are,too,many,unmarried,women,in,this,house,already,[END]
the,girl,beside,him,let,out,a,tiny,cry,then,turned,and,ran,out,of,the,room,[END]
uncle,james,you,shouldn't,be,tormenting,her,so,said,jamie,severely,[END]
the,old,man,walked,to,the,fire,and,rubbed,his,hands,before,its,warmth,[END]
she,shouldn't,be,such,a,weeper,he,said,[END]
the,o'haras,don't,weep,over,their,troubles,[END]
maureen,i'll,have,my,tea,now,while,i,talk,to,gerald's,girl,[END]
he,sat,in,the,chair,next,to,scarlett's,[END]
tell,me,about,the,funeral,[END]
did,you,bury,your,father,in,fine,style,[END]
my,brother,andrew,had,the,finest,burial,this,city,has,seen,in,many,a,year,[END]
in,her,mind's,eye,scarlett,saw,the,pitiful,band,of,mourners,around,gerald's,grave,at,tara,[END]
so,few,of,them,[END]
so,many,who,should,have,been,there,were,dead,before,her,father,dead,before,their,time,[END]
scarlett,fixed,her,green,eyes,on,the,old,man's,faded,blue,ones,[END]
he,had,a,glass-sided,hearse,with,four,black,horses,and,black,plumes,on,their,heads,a,blanket,of,flowers,on,his,coffin,and,more,on,the,roof,and,two,hundred,mourners,following,the,hearse,in,their,rigs,[END]
he's,in,a,marble,tomb,not,a,grave,and,the,tomb,has,a,carved,angel,on,top,seven,feet,high,[END]
her,voice,was,cold,and,harsh,[END]
take,that,old,man,she,thought,and,leave,pa,alone,[END]
james,rubbed,his,dry,hands,together,[END]
god,rest,his,soul,he,said,happily,[END]
i,always,said,gerald,had,the,most,style,of,any,of,us,didn't,i,tell,you,that,jamie,[END]
the,runt,of,the,litter,and,the,quickest,to,fly,off,at,an,insult,[END]
he,was,a,fine,small,man,was,gerald,[END]
do,you,know,how,he,came,by,that,plantation,of,his,[END]
playing,poker,with,my,money,that's,how,[END]
and,not,a,penny,of,the,profit,did,he,offer,to,me,[END]
james',laughter,was,full,and,strong,the,laughter,of,a,young,man,[END]
it,was,warm,with,life,and,rich,amusement,[END]
tell,about,how,he,came,to,leave,ireland,uncle,james,said,maureen,refilling,the,old,man's,cup,[END]
perhaps,scarlett,never,heard,the,tale,[END]
great,balls,of,fire,[END]
are,we,going,to,have,a,wake,[END]
scarlett,stirred,angrily,in,her,chair,[END]
i,heard,it,a,hundred,times,she,said,[END]
gerald,o'hara,loved,to,boast,about,fleeing,ireland,with,a,price,on,his,head,after,he,killed,an,english,landlord's,rent,agent,with,one,blow,of,his,fist,[END]
everyone,in,clayton,county,had,heard,it,a,hundred,times,and,no,one,believed,it,[END]
gerald,was,noisy,in,his,rages,but,the,whole,world,could,see,the,gentleness,underneath,[END]
maureen,smiled,[END]
a,mighty,man,for,all,his,small,size,so,i've,always,been,told,[END]
a,father,to,make,a,woman,proud,[END]
scarlett,felt,her,throat,clog,with,tears,[END]
he,was,that,said,james,[END]
when,do,we,have,the,birthday,cake,maureen,[END]
and,where,is,patricia,[END]
scarlett,looked,around,the,circle,of,crimson-topped,faces,[END]
no,she,was,sure,she,hadn't,heard,the,name,patricia,[END]
maybe,it,was,the,dark-haired,girl,who,had,run,away,[END]
she's,fixing,her,own,feast,uncle,james,said,maureen,[END]
you,know,how,particular,she,is,[END]
we're,to,go,next,door,as,soon,as,stephen,comes,to,tell,us,she's,ready,[END]
stephen,[END]
patricia,[END]
next,door,[END]
maureen,saw,the,questions,on,scarlett's,face,[END]
did,jamie,not,tell,you,scarlett,[END]
there,are,three,households,of,o'haras,here,now,[END]
you've,only,just,begun,to,meet,your,people,[END]
i'll,never,get,them,all,straight,thought,scarlett,desperately,[END]
if,only,they'd,stay,in,one,place,[END]
but,there,was,no,hope,of,that,[END]
patricia,was,holding,her,birthday,party,in,the,double,parlors,of,her,house,with,the,sliding,doors,between,them,open,as,wide,as,they,would,go,[END]
the,children,and,there,were,many,of,them,were,playing,games,that,required,a,great,deal,of,running,and,hiding,and,popping,out,from,behind,chairs,and,draperies,[END]
the,adults,darted,from,time,to,time,after,a,child,who,was,getting,too,boisterous,or,swooped,to,pick,up,one,of,the,small,ones,who,had,fallen,and,needed,comforting,[END]
it,didn't,seem,to,matter,whose,child,it,was,[END]
all,the,adults,played,parent,to,all,the,children,[END]
scarlett,was,grateful,for,maureen's,red,hair,[END]
all,her,children,the,ones,scarlett,had,met,next,door,plus,patricia,plus,daniel,the,son,at,the,store,plus,another,grown,boy,whose,name,she,couldn't,remember,were,at,least,recognizable,[END]
the,others,were,a,hopeless,muddle,[END]
so,were,their,parents,[END]
scarlett,knew,that,one,of,the,men,was,named,gerald,but,which,one,[END]
they,were,all,big,men,with,curly,dark,hair,and,blue,eyes,and,winning,smiles,[END]
isn't,it,confusing,[END]
said,a,voice,beside,her,[END]
it,was,maureen,[END]
don't,let,it,bother,you,scarlett,you'll,puzzle,them,out,in,time,[END]
scarlett,smiled,and,nodded,politely,[END]
but,she,had,no,intention,of,puzzling,them,out,[END]
she,was,going,to,ask,jamie,to,walk,her,home,just,as,soon,as,she,could,[END]
it,was,too,noisy,here,with,all,those,brats,running,around,[END]
the,silent,pink,house,on,the,square,seemed,like,a,refuge,[END]
at,least,there,she,had,her,aunts,to,talk,to,[END]
here,she,couldn't,say,a,word,to,a,soul,[END]
they,were,all,too,busy,chasing,children,or,hugging,and,kissing,patricia,[END]
asking,her,about,her,baby,for,heaven's,sake,[END]
as,if,they,didn't,know,that,the,only,decent,thing,to,do,was,pretend,that,you,didn't,notice,when,a,woman,was,pregnant,[END]
she,felt,like,a,stranger,[END]
left,out,[END]
unimportant,[END]
just,like,atlanta,[END]
just,like,charleston,[END]
and,these,were,her,own,kin,[END]
it,made,things,a,hundred,times,worse,[END]
we'll,be,cutting,the,cake,now,maureen,said,[END]
she,slipped,her,arm,through,scarlett's,[END]
then,we'll,have,a,bit,of,music,[END]
scarlett,clenched,her,teeth,[END]
my,grief,i've,sat,through,one,musicale,already,in,savannah,[END]
can't,these,people,do,anything,else,[END]
she,walked,with,maureen,to,a,settee,covered,in,red,plush,and,settled,herself,stiffly,on,the,edge,of,the,seat,[END]
a,knife,clattering,against,a,glass,demanded,everyone's,attention,[END]
something,that,was,almost,silence,came,into,the,crowd,[END]
i,thank,you,for,as,long,as,it,lasts,jamie,said,[END]
he,waved,his,knife,menacingly,at,the,laughter,[END]
we've,come,to,celebrate,patricia's,birthday,even,though,it,will,not,arrive,until,next,week,[END]
today,is,shrove,tuesday,a,better,time,for,feasting,than,the,middle,of,lent,[END]
he,threatened,the,laughter,again,[END]
and,we,have,a,further,cause,for,celebration,[END]
a,beautiful,long,lost,o'hara,has,been,found,again,[END]
i,lift,this,glass,for,all,the,o'haras,in,a,toast,to,cousin,scarlett,and,bid,her,welcome,to,our,hearts,and,our,homes,[END]
jamie,threw,back,his,head,and,poured,the,dark,contents,of,his,glass,down,his,throat,[END]
bring,on,the,feast,[END]
he,commanded,with,a,sweeping,gesture,[END]
and,the,fiddle,[END]
there,was,an,outburst,of,giggles,from,the,doorway,and,the,sound,of,his,sing,calls,for,silence,[END]
patricia,came,over,and,seated,herself,next,to,scarlett,[END]
then,from,a,corner,a,fiddle,began,to,play,[END]
jamie's,beautiful,daughter,helen,walked,in,carrying,a,platter,of,steaming,small,meat,pies,[END]
she,bent,over,to,show,them,to,patricia,and,scarlett,then,carefully,carried,them,to,the,heavy,round,parlor,table,in,the,center,of,the,room,and,set,the,platter,on,the,velvet,cloth,that,covered,it,[END]
helen,was,followed,by,mary,kate,then,the,pretty,girl,who,had,been,with,uncle,james,then,the,youngest,of,the,o'hara,wives,[END]
all,of,them,presented,the,platters,they,were,carrying,to,scarlett,and,patricia,before,adding,them,to,the,food,on,the,table,[END]
a,roast,of,beef,a,clove-studded,ham,a,bulging,turkey,[END]
then,helen,appeared,again,with,a,huge,bowl,of,steaming,potatoes,followed,more,quickly,now,by,the,others,with,creamed,carrots,roast,onions,whipped,sweet,potatoes,[END]
again,and,again,the,procession,came,until,the,table,was,covered,with,food,and,relishes,of,every,kind,[END]
the,fiddle,scarlett,saw,that,daniel,from,the,store,was,playing,played,a,flourishing,arpeggio,and,maureen,entered,carrying,a,tower,of,a,cake,liberally,trimmed,with,huge,vividly,pink,icing,roses,[END]
bakery,cake,[END]
screamed,timothy,[END]
jamie,was,immediately,behind,his,wife,[END]
he,held,his,two,arms,over,his,head,[END]
he,was,carrying,three,bottles,of,whiskey,in,each,hand,[END]
the,fiddle,began,to,play,an,exuberant,rapid,tune,and,everyone,laughed,and,clapped,[END]
even,scarlett,[END]
the,drama,of,the,procession,was,irresistible,[END]
now,brian,said,jamie,[END]
you,and,billy,[END]
the,queens,on,their,throne,to,the,hearth,[END]
before,scarlett,knew,what,was,happening,the,settee,was,lifted,and,she,was,holding,on,to,patricia,while,they,were,swung,back,and,forth,and,moved,to,a,place,near,the,glowing,coals,in,the,fireplace,[END]
uncle,james,jamie,ordered,and,the,old,man,was,carried,laughing,in,his,shy-backed,chair,to,the,other,side,of,the,mantel,[END]
the,girl,who,had,been,with,james,began,to,shoo,the,children,as,if,they,were,chickens,into,the,other,parlor,where,mary,kate,laid,a,tablecloth,on,the,floor,for,them,to,sit,on,in,front,of,the,second,fireplace,[END]
in,a,surprisingly,short,time,there,was,calm,where,there,had,been,chaos,[END]
and,while,they,ate,and,talked,scarlett,tried,to,puzzle,out,the,adults,[END]
jamie's,two,sons,were,so,much,alike,that,she,could,hardly,believe,that,daniel,at,twenty-one,was,almost,three,years,older,than,brian,[END]
when,she,smiled,at,brian,and,said,as,much,he,blushed,as,only,a,redhead,can,[END]
the,only,other,young,man,began,to,tease,him,unmercifully,but,he,stopped,when,the,pink-cheeked,girl,next,to,him,put,her,hand,on,his,and,said,stop,it,gerald,[END]
so,that,was,gerald,[END]
pa,would,be,so,pleased,to,know,that,big,handsome,fellow,was,named,after,him,[END]
he,called,the,girl,polly,and,they're,so,shiny,with,love,they,must,be,fresh-married,[END]
and,patricia's,being,mighty,bossy,to,the,one,jamie,called,billy,so,they,must,be,husband,and,wife,too,[END]
but,scarlett,had,little,time,to,listen,for,the,names,of,the,others,[END]
everyone,it,seemed,wanted,to,talk,to,her,[END]
and,everything,she,said,was,cause,for,exclamation,repetition,admiration,[END]
she,found,herself,telling,daniel,and,jamie,all,about,her,store,polly,and,patricia,about,her,dressmaker,uncle,james,about,the,yankees,setting,tara,on,fire,[END]
she,talked,mostly,about,her,lumber,business,and,how,she'd,built,it,from,one,small,mill,into,two,mills,lumberyards,and,now,a,whole,village,of,new,houses,on,the,edge,of,atlanta,[END]
everyone,was,loudly,approving,[END]
at,last,scarlett,had,found,people,who,didn't,think,that,talking,about,money,was,taboo,[END]
they,were,like,she,was,willing,to,work,hard,and,determined,to,make,money,from,it,[END]
she,had,already,made,hers,and,they,told,her,she,was,wonderful,[END]
she,couldn't,imagine,why,she,had,ever,wanted,to,leave,this,marvelous,party,and,go,back,to,the,deadly,quiet,at,her,grandfather's,house,[END]
will,you,give,us,some,music,then,daniel,if,you've,finished,eating,most,of,your,sister's,cake,[END]
said,maureen,when,jamie,uncorked,a,bottle,of,whiskey,and,suddenly,everyone,except,uncle,james,was,up,and,moving,around,in,what,seemed,to,be,a,practiced,routine,[END]
daniel,began,playing,a,rapid,squeaking,tune,on,the,fiddle,and,the,others,shouted,criticism,while,the,women,quickly,cleared,the,table,and,the,men,moved,the,furniture,back,against,the,walls,leaving,scarlett,and,her,uncle,sitting,as,if,on,an,island,[END]
jamie,presented,james,with,a,glass,of,whiskey,and,waited,half,bent,for,the,old,man's,opinion,[END]
it'll,do,was,the,judgment,[END]
jamie,laughed,[END]
indeed,i,hope,so,old,man,for,we,have,no,other,kind,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,catch,jamie's,eye,failed,finally,called,out,to,get,his,attention,[END]
she,had,to,go,now,[END]
everyone,was,pulling,chairs,into,a,circle,around,the,fire,and,the,smaller,children,were,taking,places,on,the,floor,at,the,adults',feet,[END]
obviously,they,were,getting,ready,for,the,musicale,and,once,it,started,it,would,be,terribly,rude,to,get,up,and,go,[END]
jamie,stepped,over,a,small,boy,to,get,to,scarlett,[END]
here,you,are,then,he,said,[END]
to,her,horror,he,handed,her,a,glass,with,several,fingers,of,whiskey,in,it,[END]
what,kind,of,person,did,he,think,she,was,[END]
a,lady,didn't,drink,whiskey,[END]
she,didn't,drink,anything,stronger,than,tea,except,champagne,or,a,party,punch,or,perhaps,a,very,small,glass,of,sherry,[END]
he,couldn't,possibly,know,about,the,brandy,she,used,to,drink,[END]
why,he,was,insulting,her,[END]
no,he,wouldn't,do,that,it,must,be,a,joke,[END]
she,forced,a,brittle,laugh,[END]
it's,time,for,me,to,go,jamie,[END]
i've,had,a,delightful,time,but,it's,getting,late,[END]

jamie,grinned,[END]
i,can't,hear,you,he,shouted,over,the,din,[END]
i'm,deaf,as,a,stone,to,anyone,asking,to,go,[END]
scarlett,felt,her,temper,rising,[END]
when,jamie,offered,her,the,whiskey,again,she,stood,up,in,a,rage,[END]
then,before,she,could,knock,the,glass,from,his,hand,she,realized,what,daniel,had,begun,to,play,[END]
it,was,peg,in,a,low,back'd,car,[END]
pa's,favorite,[END]
she,looked,at,jamie's,ruddy,irish,face,and,saw,her,father's,image,[END]
oh,if,only,he,could,be,here,he'd,love,this,so,[END]
scarlett,sat,down,[END]
she,shook,her,head,at,the,proffered,drink,smiled,weakly,at,jamie,[END]
she,was,close,to,tears,[END]
the,music,wouldn't,allow,sadness,[END]
the,rhythm,was,too,infectious,too,merry,and,everyone,was,singing,now,and,clapping,their,hands,[END]
scarlett's,foot,began,involuntarily,to,tap,the,beat,under,cover,of,her,skirts,[END]
come,on,billy,said,daniel,singing,it,really,to,the,tune,[END]

billy,opened,the,lid,of,a,window,seat,and,took,out,a,concertina,[END]
the,pleated,leather,bellows,opened,with,a,wheeze,[END]
then,he,walked,up,behind,scarlett,reached,over,her,head,and,picked,up,something,shiny,from,the,mantel,[END]
let's,have,some,real,music,[END]
stephen,he,tossed,a,thin,glinting,tube,to,the,dark,silent,man,[END]

a,young,boy,clapped,wildly,[END]
the,bones,[END]
cousin,maureen's,going,to,play,the,bones,[END]
scarlett,stared,[END]
daniel,had,stopped,playing,and,with,the,music,gone,she,felt,sad,again,[END]
but,she,no,longer,wanted,to,leave,[END]
this,party,had,nothing,to,do,with,the,telfairs',musicale,[END]
there,was,easiness,here,warmth,laughter,[END]
the,parlors,that,had,been,so,neatly,arranged,before,were,all,hodge-podge,now,furniture,moved,chairs,from,both,rooms,crowded,in,a,straggling,half,circle,around,the,fire,[END]
maureen,lifted,her,hand,with,a,clacking,noise,and,scarlett,saw,that,the,bones,were,really,thick,pieces,of,smooth,wood,[END]
jamie,was,still,pouring,and,passing,whiskey,[END]
why,the,women,are,drinking,too,[END]
not,in,secret,not,ashamed,[END]
they're,having,as,much,fun,as,the,men,[END]
i'll,have,a,drink,too,[END]

no,matter,[END]
i,feel,as,warm,inside,as,if,i,had,just,had,a,drink,[END]
i,don't,need,it,[END]
daniel,pulled,the,bow,over,the,strings,[END]
the,maid,behind,the,bar,he,said,[END]
everyone,laughed,[END]
including,scarlett,though,she,didn't,know,why,[END]
in,an,instant,the,big,room,rang,with,the,music,of,an,irish,reel,[END]
billy's,concertina,whined,vigorously,brian,piped,the,tune,on,his,tin,whistle,stephen,played,his,tin,whistle,in,rippling,counterpoint,that,wove,in,and,out,of,brian's,melody,[END]
jamie,beat,time,with,his,foot,the,children,clapped,scarlett,clapped,everyone,clapped,[END]
except,maureen,[END]
she,threw,up,the,hand,holding,the,bones,and,the,sharp,staccato,clacking,made,an,insistent,rhythm,that,held,everything,together,[END]
faster,the,bones,demanded,and,the,others,obeyed,[END]
the,whistles,soared,higher,the,fiddle,scraped,louder,the,concertina,puffed,to,keep,up,[END]
a,half,dozen,children,got,up,and,began,to,leap,and,hop,across,the,bare,floor,in,the,center,of,the,room,[END]
scarlett's,hands,grew,hot,from,clapping,and,her,feet,were,moving,as,if,she,wanted,to,leap,about,with,the,children,[END]
when,the,reel,came,to,an,end,she,fell,back,against,the,settee,exhausted,[END]
come,along,matt,show,the,babies,how,to,dance,cried,maureen,with,a,tempting,rattle,of,the,bones,[END]
the,older,man,near,scarlett,stood,up,[END]
god,save,us,wait,a,bit,billy,begged,[END]
i,need,a,bit,of,a,rest,[END]
give,us,a,song,instead,katie,[END]
he,squeezed,a,few,notes,out,of,the,concertina,[END]
scarlett,started,to,protest,[END]
she,couldn't,sing,not,here,[END]
she,didn't,know,any,irish,songs,except,peg,and,her,father's,other,favorite,the,wearing,o',the,green,[END]
but,she,saw,billy,didn't,mean,her,[END]
a,plain,dark,woman,with,big,teeth,was,handing,her,glass,to,jamie,and,standing,[END]
there,was,a,wild,colonial,boy,she,sang,in,a,pure,sweet,high,voice,[END]
before,the,line,was,finished,daniel,and,brian,and,billy,were,accompanying,her,[END]
jack,duggan,was,his,name,sang,katie,[END]
he,was,born,and,raised,in,ireland,[END]
and,stephen's,whistle,entered,an,octave,higher,with,a,strange,heartbreaking,silvery,plaintiveness,[END]
in,a,house,called,castlemaine,[END]
everyone,began,to,sing,except,scarlett,[END]
but,she,didn't,mind,not,knowing,the,words,[END]
she,was,still,part,of,the,music,[END]
it,was,all,around,her,[END]
and,when,the,sad,brave,song,was,over,she,saw,that,everyone,else,had,glistening,eyes,just,like,hers,[END]
there,was,a,happy,song,next,started,by,jamie,then,one,that,made,scarlett,laugh,and,blush,at,the,same,time,when,she,understood,the,double,meaning,of,the,words,[END]
now,me,gerald,said,[END]
i'll,sing,my,sweet,polly,the,londonderry,air,',[END]
oh,gerald,[END]
polly,hid,her,blushing,face,in,her,hands,[END]
brian,played,the,first,few,notes,[END]
then,gerald,began,to,sing,and,scarlett,caught,her,breath,[END]
she'd,heard,talk,of,the,irish,tenor,but,she,wasn't,prepared,for,the,reality,[END]
and,that,voice,like,an,angel's,was,coming,from,her,pa's,namesake,[END]
gerald's,loving,young,heart,was,exposed,for,all,to,see,on,his,face,and,for,all,to,hear,in,the,high,pure,notes,from,his,vibrating,strong,throat,[END]
scarlett's,own,throat,felt,choked,by,the,beauty,of,it,and,the,sharp,painful,longing,to,know,love,like,that,so,fresh,and,open,[END]
rhett,[END]
her,heart,cried,even,as,her,mind,mocked,the,notion,of,simple,directness,from,his,dark,complex,nature,[END]
at,the,end,of,the,song,polly,threw,her,arms,around,gerald's,neck,and,hid,her,face,in,his,shoulder,[END]
maureen,lifted,the,bones,above,her,shoulder,[END]
we'll,have,a,reel,now,she,announced,firmly,[END]
my,toes,are,fairly,twitching,[END]
daniel,laughed,and,began,to,play,[END]
scarlett,had,danced,the,virginia,reel,a,hundred,times,or,more,but,she'd,never,seen,dancing,like,what,happened,next,at,patricia's,birthday,party,[END]
matt,o'hara,began,it,[END]
with,his,shoulders,straight,and,his,arms,stiff,at,his,side,he,looked,like,a,soldier,when,he,stepped,away,from,the,circle,of,chairs,[END]
then,his,feet,began,to,pound,and,flash,and,twist,and,move,so,quickly,that,they,blurred,in,scarlett's,vision,[END]
the,floor,became,a,resounding,drum,under,his,heels,became,like,polished,ice,under,his,intricate,impossible,steps,forward,and,back,[END]
he,must,be,the,best,dancer,in,the,whole,world,scarlett,thought,[END]
and,then,katie,danced,out,to,face,him,her,skirts,held,up,in,her,two,hands,so,that,her,feet,were,free,to,match,his,steps,[END]
mary,kate,was,next,then,jamie,joined,his,daughter,[END]
and,beautiful,helen,with,a,cousin,a,little,boy,who,couldn't,be,older,than,eight,[END]
i,don't,believe,it,scarlett,thought,[END]
they're,magic,all,of,them,[END]
the,music's,magic,too,[END]
her,feet,moved,faster,than,they'd,ever,moved,before,trying,to,mimic,what,she,was,seeing,trying,to,express,the,excitement,of,the,music,[END]
i've,got,to,learn,to,dance,like,that,i've,just,got,to,[END]
it's,like,[END]
like,you,spin,right,up,to,the,sun,[END]
a,sleeping,child,under,the,settee,woke,at,the,sounds,of,the,dancing,feet,and,began,to,cry,[END]
like,a,contagion,crying,spread,to,the,other,smallest,children,[END]
the,dancing,and,the,music,stopped,[END]
make,some,mattresses,from,folded,blankets,in,the,other,parlor,maureen,said,placidly,and,give,them,dry,bottoms,[END]
then,we'll,close,the,doors,most,shut,and,they'll,sleep,right,along,[END]
jamie,the,bone-woman,has,a,terrible,thirst,[END]
mary,kate,hand,your,pa,my,glass,[END]
patricia,asked,billy,to,carry,their,three-year-old,son,[END]
i'll,get,betty,she,said,reaching,beneath,the,settee,[END]
hush,hush,[END]
she,cradled,the,crying,child,to,her,[END]
helen,close,the,curtains,in,the,back,darling,[END]
there'll,be,a,strong,moon,tonight,[END]
scarlett,was,still,half,in,a,trance,from,the,spell,of,the,music,[END]
she,looked,vaguely,at,the,windows,and,was,jolted,back,to,reality,[END]
it,was,getting,dark,[END]
the,cup,of,tea,she'd,come,for,had,stretched,into,hours,[END]
oh,maureen,i'm,going,to,be,late,for,supper,she,gasped,[END]
i've,got,to,go,home,[END]
my,grandfather,will,be,furious,[END]
let,him,be,the,old,loo-la,[END]
stay,for,the,party,[END]
it's,only,beginning,[END]
i,wish,i,could,said,scarlett,fervently,[END]
it's,the,best,party,i've,ever,been,to,in,my,life,[END]
but,i,promised,i'd,be,back,[END]
ah,well,then,[END]
a,promise,is,a,promise,[END]
you'll,come,again,[END]
i'd,love,to,[END]
will,you,invite,me,[END]
maureen,laughed,comfortably,[END]
will,you,listen,to,the,girl,[END]
she,said,to,the,room,at,large,[END]
there's,no,inviting,done,here,[END]
we're,all,a,family,and,you're,a,part,of,it,[END]
come,anytime,you,like,[END]
my,kitchen,door,has,no,lock,and,there's,always,a,fire,on,the,hearth,[END]
jamie's,a,fine,hand,with,the,fiddle,himself,too,[END]
jamie,[END]
scarlett's,got,to,go,[END]
put,your,coat,on,man,and,give,her,your,arm,[END]
just,before,they,turned,the,corner,scarlett,heard,the,music,begin,again,[END]
it,was,faint,because,of,the,thick,brick,walls,of,the,house,and,the,windows,closed,against,the,winter,night,[END]
but,she,recognized,what,the,o'haras,were,singing,[END]
it,was,the,wearing,o',the,green,[END]
i,know,all,the,words,to,that,one,oh,i,wish,i,hadn't,had,to,leave,[END]
her,feet,made,little,dance,steps,[END]
jamie,laughed,and,matched,her,[END]
i'll,teach,you,the,reel,next,time,he,promised,[END]
36,[END]
scarlett,bore,her,aunts',tight-lipped,disapproval,with,easy,disregard,[END]
even,being,called,on,the,carpet,by,her,grandfather,failed,to,upset,her,[END]
she,remembered,maureen,o'hara's,off-handed,dismissal,of,him,[END]
old,loo-la,she,thought,and,giggled,internally,[END]
it,made,her,brave,and,impertinent,enough,to,sashay,over,to,his,bed,and,kiss,his,cheek,after,he,dismissed,her,[END]
good,night,grandfather,she,said,cheerfully,[END]
old,loo-la,she,whispered,when,she,was,safely,in,the,hall,[END]
she,was,laughing,when,she,joined,her,aunts,at,table,[END]
her,supper,was,brought,promptly,[END]
the,plate,was,covered,with,a,brightly,shining,silver,dish,cover,to,keep,the,food,hot,[END]
scarlett,was,sure,it,was,newly,polished,[END]
this,house,could,run,really,properly,she,thought,if,it,just,had,someone,to,keep,the,servants,in,line,[END]
grandfather,lets,them,get,away,with,murder,[END]
old,loo-la,[END]
what,do,you,find,so,amusing,scarlett,[END]
pauline's,tone,was,icy,[END]
nothing,aunt,pauline,[END]
scarlett,looked,down,at,the,mountain,of,food,revealed,when,jerome,ceremoniously,lifted,the,silver,cover,[END]
she,laughed,aloud,[END]
for,once,in,her,life,she,wasn't,hungry,not,after,the,feast,at,the,o'haras',[END]
and,there,was,enough,food,in,front,of,her,to,feed,a,half,dozen,people,[END]
she,must,have,put,the,fear,of,god,into,the,kitchen,[END]
the,following,morning,at,ash,wednesday,mass,scarlett,took,her,place,beside,eulalie,in,the,pew,favored,by,the,aunts,[END]
it,was,genteelly,unobtrusive,entered,from,a,side,aisle,and,located,well,towards,the,back,[END]
her,knees,had,just,begun,to,hurt,from,kneeling,on,the,cold,floor,when,she,saw,her,cousins,enter,the,church,[END]
they,walked,of,course,thought,scarlett,straight,up,the,center,aisle,to,almost,the,front,where,they,took,up,two,full,pews,[END]
what,very,large,people,they,are,and,so,full,of,life,[END]
and,color,[END]
jamie's,sons',heads,look,like,warm,fires,in,the,light,from,the,red,stained,glass,and,not,even,their,hats,can,hide,the,bright,hair,on,maureen,and,the,girls,[END]
scarlett,was,so,engrossed,in,admiration,and,memories,of,the,birthday,party,that,she,almost,missed,the,arrival,of,the,nuns,from,the,convent,[END]
after,she'd,hurried,her,aunts,to,get,to,church,early,too,[END]
she,wanted,to,make,sure,that,the,mother,superior,from,charleston,was,still,at,hand,in,savannah,[END]
yes,there,she,was,[END]
scarlett,ignored,eulalie's,frantic,whispers,ordering,her,to,turn,back,around,and,face,the,altar,[END]
she,studied,the,nun's,serene,expression,as,she,walked,past,[END]
today,the,mother,superior,would,see,her,[END]
scarlett,was,determined,[END]
she,spent,her,time,during,mass,daydreaming,about,the,party,she'd,give,after,she,restored,tara,to,all,its,former,beauty,[END]
there'd,be,music,and,dancing,just,like,last,night,and,it,would,go,on,and,on,for,days,and,days,[END]
scarlett,[END]
eulalie,his,sed,[END]
stop,humming,like,that,[END]
scarlett,smiled,into,her,missal,[END]
she,hadn't,realized,she,was,humming,[END]
she,had,to,admit,that,peg,in,a,low,back'd,car,wasn't,exactly,church,music,[END]
i,don't,believe,it,[END]
scarlett,said,[END]
her,pale,eyes,were,bewildered,and,hurt,beneath,her,smudged,forehead,and,her,fingers,were,closed,like,claws,on,the,rosary,she'd,borrowed,from,eulalie,[END]
the,elderly,nun,repeated,her,message,with,emotion-free,patience,[END]
the,mother,superior,will,be,in,retreat,all,day,in,prayer,and,fasting,[END]
she,took,pity,on,scarlett,and,added,an,explanation,[END]
this,is,ash,wednesday,[END]
i,know,it's,ash,wednesday,scarlett,almost,shouted,[END]
then,she,curbed,her,tongue,[END]
please,say,that,i,am,very,disappointed,she,said,softly,and,i'll,come,back,tomorrow,[END]
as,soon,as,she,reached,the,robillard,house,she,washed,her,face,[END]
eulalie,and,pauline,were,visibly,shocked,when,she,came,downstairs,and,joined,them,in,the,drawing,room,but,neither,of,them,said,anything,[END]
silence,was,the,only,weapon,they,felt,it,safe,to,use,when,scarlett,was,in,a,temper,[END]
but,when,she,announced,that,she,was,going,to,order,breakfast,pauline,spoke,up,[END]
you'll,regret,that,before,the,day,is,out,scarlett,[END]
i,can't,imagine,why,scarlett,answered,[END]
her,jaw,was,set,[END]
it,sagged,when,pauline,explained,[END]
scarlett's,reintroduction,to,religion,was,so,recent,that,she,thought,fasting,meant,simply,having,fish,on,fridays,instead,of,meat,[END]
she,liked,fish,and,had,never,objected,to,the,rule,[END]
but,what,pauline,told,her,was,objectionable,in,the,extreme,[END]
only,one,meal,a,day,during,the,forty,days,of,lent,and,no,meat,at,that,meal,[END]
sundays,were,the,exception,[END]
still,no,meat,but,three,meals,were,allowed,[END]
i,don't,believe,it,[END]
scarlett,exclaimed,for,the,second,time,within,an,hour,[END]
we,never,did,that,at,home,[END]
you,were,children,said,pauline,but,i'm,sure,your,mother,fasted,as,she,should,[END]
i,cannot,understand,why,she,didn't,introduce,you,to,lenten,observance,when,you,passed,childhood,but,then,she,was,isolated,out,in,the,country,without,a,priest's,guidance,and,there,was,mr,o'hara's,influence,to,offset,[END]
her,voice,trailed,off,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,lit,for,battle,[END]
and,just,what,do,you,mean,by,mr,[END]
o'hara's,influence,',i'd,like,to,know,[END]
pauline,dropped,her,gaze,[END]
everyone,knows,that,the,irish,take,certain,freedoms,with,the,laws,of,the,church,[END]
you,can't,really,blame,them,poor,illiterate,nation,that,they,are,[END]
she,crossed,herself,piously,[END]
scarlett,stamped,her,foot,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,stand,here,and,listen,to,such,high,and,mighty,french,snobbery,[END]
my,pa,was,never,anything,but,a,good,man,and,his,influence',was,kindness,and,generosity,something,you,don't,know,anything,about,[END]
furthermore,i'll,have,you,know,i,spent,all,afternoon,yesterday,with,his,kin,and,they're,fine,people,every,one,of,them,[END]
i'd,a,sight,rather,be,influenced,by,them,than,by,your,whey-faced,religious,prissiness,[END]
eulalie,burst,into,tears,[END]
scarlett,scowled,at,her,[END]
now,she'll,sniff,that,sniff,of,hers,for,hours,i,reckon,[END]
i,can't,bear,it,[END]
pauline,sobbed,loudly,[END]
scarlett,turned,staring,[END]
pauline,never,wept,[END]
scarlett,looked,helplessly,at,the,two,bent,gray,heads,and,hunched,shoulders,pauline's,so,thin,and,fragile,looking,[END]
my,grief,[END]
she,walked,over,to,pauline,and,touched,her,aunt's,knobby,back,[END]
i'm,sorry,auntie,[END]
i,didn't,mean,what,i,said,[END]
when,peace,had,been,restored,eulalie,suggested,that,scarlett,join,her,and,pauline,for,their,walk,around,the,square,[END]
sister,and,i,always,find,that,a,constitutional,is,a,great,restorative,she,said,brightly,[END]
then,her,mouth,quivered,pathetically,[END]
it,keeps,one's,mind,off,food,too,[END]
scarlett,agreed,at,once,[END]
she,had,to,get,out,of,the,house,[END]
she,was,convinced,she,could,smell,bacon,frying,in,the,kitchen,[END]
she,walked,with,her,aunts,around,the,square,of,green,in,front,of,the,house,then,the,short,distance,to,the,next,square,around,it,then,to,the,next,square,and,the,next,and,the,next,[END]
by,the,time,they,returned,to,the,house,she,was,dragging,her,feet,almost,as,much,as,eulalie,was,and,she,was,positive,that,she'd,walked,through,or,around,every,single,one,of,the,twenty-some,squares,that,dotted,savannah,and,gave,it,its,claim,to,unique,charm,[END]
she,was,also,positive,that,she,was,half-starved,to,death,and,bored,to,screaming-point,[END]
but,at,least,it,was,time,for,dinner,[END]
she,couldn't,remember,ever,tasting,fish,that,was,quite,so,delicious,[END]
what,a,relief,[END]
scarlett,thought,when,eulalie,and,pauline,went,upstairs,for,their,after-dinner,naps,[END]
a,little,of,their,reminiscences,of,savannah,goes,a,long,way,[END]
a,lot,of,it,could,drive,a,person,to,murder,[END]
she,wandered,restlessly,through,the,big,house,picking,up,bits,of,china,and,silver,from,tables,and,putting,them,back,without,really,seeing,them,[END]
why,was,the,mother,superior,being,so,difficult,[END]
why,wouldn't,she,talk,to,her,at,least,[END]
why,on,earth,would,a,woman,like,that,have,to,spend,a,whole,day,in,retreat,even,a,holy,day,like,ash,wednesday,[END]
surely,a,mother,superior,was,already,as,good,as,a,person,could,be,[END]
why,did,she,need,to,spend,a,day,in,prayer,and,fasting,[END]
fasting,[END]
scarlett,ran,back,to,the,drawing,room,to,look,at,the,tall,clock,[END]
it,couldn't,be,only,four,o'clock,[END]
not,even,[END]
it,was,seven,minutes,to,four,[END]
and,there'd,be,nothing,at,all,to,eat,until,dinnertime,tomorrow,[END]
no,it,wasn't,possible,[END]
it,didn't,make,sense,[END]
scarlett,walked,to,the,bell,pull,and,jerked,it,four,times,[END]
go,put,your,coat,on,she,told,pansy,when,the,girl,came,running,[END]

she,carried,two,sacks,of,baked,goods,home,and,up,to,her,room,hiding,them,under,her,cape,[END]
a,telegram,had,been,placed,neatly,in,the,center,of,her,bureau,[END]
scarlett,dropped,the,sacks,of,breads,and,cookies,on,the,floor,and,ran,to,get,it,[END]
henry,hamilton,it,said,as,signature,[END]
damn,[END]
she'd,thought,it,was,from,rhett,begging,her,to,come,home,or,telling,her,that,he,was,on,his,way,to,fetch,her,[END]
she,crumpled,the,flimsy,paper,angrily,in,her,fist,[END]
then,she,smoothed,it,out,[END]
better,see,what,uncle,henry,had,to,say,[END]
as,she,read,the,message,scarlett,began,to,smile,[END]

so,rhett,was,looking,for,her,[END]
just,what,she'd,expected,[END]
hah,[END]

why,he,might,be,reading,his,right,this,minute,just,like,she,was,reading,hers,[END]
scarlett,hummed,a,waltz,tune,and,danced,around,the,room,holding,the,telegram,against,her,heart,[END]
he,might,even,be,on,his,way,now,[END]
the,train,from,charleston,arrived,just,about,this,time,of,day,[END]
she,ran,to,the,mirror,to,smooth,her,hair,and,pinch,color,into,her,cheeks,[END]
should,she,change,her,dress,[END]
no,rhett,would,notice,and,it,would,make,him,think,she,wasn't,doing,anything,except,wait,for,him,[END]
she,rubbed,toilet,water,on,her,throat,and,temples,[END]
there,[END]
she,was,ready,[END]
her,eyes,she,saw,were,glowing,green,like,a,prowling,cat's,[END]
she'd,have,to,remember,to,drop,her,lashes,over,them,[END]
she,took,a,stool,to,the,window,seated,herself,where,she'd,be,hidden,by,the,curtain,but,still,able,to,see,out,[END]
an,hour,later,rhett,hadn't,come,[END]
scarlett's,small,white,teeth,tore,at,a,roll,from,the,bakery,bag,[END]
what,a,bother,this,lent,business,was,[END]
imagine,having,to,hide,in,her,room,and,eat,rolls,without,even,any,butter,to,put,on,them,[END]
she,was,in,a,very,bad,mood,when,she,went,downstairs,[END]
and,there,was,jerome,with,her,grandfather's,supper,tray,[END]
it,was,almost,enough,to,make,her,turn,huguenot,or,presbyterian,like,the,old,man,[END]
scarlett,stopped,him,in,the,hall,[END]
this,food,looks,terrible,she,said,[END]
take,it,back,and,put,big,lumps,of,butter,on,the,mashed,potatoes,[END]
put,a,thick,slice,of,ham,on,the,plate,too,i,know,you've,got,a,ham,down,there,i,saw,it,hanging,in,the,larder,[END]
and,add,a,pitcher,of,cream,to,pour,on,that,pudding,[END]
a,little,bowl,of,strawberry,jam,too,[END]
mr,robillard,he,can't,chew,no,ham,[END]
and,his,doctor,say,he's,not,supposed,to,eat,sweets,nor,cream,and,butter,neither,[END]
the,doctor,doesn't,want,him,to,starve,to,death,either,[END]
now,do,what,i,say,[END]
scarlett,looked,angrily,at,jerome's,stiff,back,until,he,disappeared,down,the,stairs,[END]
nobody,should,have,to,go,hungry,she,said,[END]
not,ever,[END]
her,mood,changed,abruptly,and,she,giggled,[END]
not,even,an,old,loo-la,[END]
37,[END]
fortified,by,her,rolls,scarlett,was,cheerfully,singing,under,her,breath,when,she,went,downstairs,thursday,[END]
she,found,her,aunts,in,a,nervous,frenzy,of,preparation,for,her,grandfather's,birthday,dinner,[END]
while,eulalie,wrestled,with,branches,of,dark,green,magnolia,leaves,for,arrangements,on,the,sideboard,and,mantel,pauline,was,going,through,stacks,of,heavy,linen,tablecloths,and,napkins,trying,to,find,the,ones,she,remembered,as,her,father's,favorite,[END]
what,difference,does,it,make,[END]
scarlett,asked,impatiently,[END]
talk,about,a,tempest,in,a,teapot,[END]
grandfather,wouldn't,even,see,the,dining,room,table,from,his,room,[END]
just,pick,the,one,that,shows,the,darning,least,[END]
eulalie,dropped,an,armload,of,rattling,leaves,[END]
i,didn't,hear,you,come,in,scarlett,[END]
good,morning,[END]
pauline,nodded,coldly,[END]
she,had,forgiven,scarlett,for,her,insults,as,a,good,christian,woman,should,but,in,all,likelihood,she'd,never,forget,them,[END]
there,are,no,darns,in,mere's,linens,scarlett,she,said,[END]
they're,all,in,perfect,condition,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,stacks,that,covered,the,long,table,and,remembered,the,worn,mended,cloths,that,her,aunts,had,in,charleston,[END]
if,it,was,up,to,her,she'd,pack,up,all,this,stuff,and,take,it,back,to,charleston,when,they,left,on,saturday,[END]
grandfather,wouldn't,miss,it,and,the,aunts,could,use,it,[END]
i'll,never,in,my,life,be,as,afraid,of,anybody,as,they,are,of,that,old,tyrant,[END]
but,if,i,said,what,i,think,aunt,eulalie,would,start,to,sniffle,and,aunt,pauline,would,lecture,me,for,an,hour,about,duty,to,my,elders,[END]
i,have,to,go,buy,a,present,for,him,she,said,aloud,[END]
is,there,any,shopping,you,want,me,to,do,for,you,[END]
and,don't,dare,she,said,silently,offer,to,come,with,me,[END]
i've,got,to,go,to,the,convent,to,see,the,mother,superior,[END]
she,can't,still,be,in,retreat,[END]
if,i,have,to,i'll,stand,by,the,gate,and,grab,her,when,she,comes,out,[END]
i'm,almighty,tired,of,being,turned,away,[END]
they,were,much,too,busy,her,aunts,said,to,go,shopping,and,they,were,astonished,that,scarlett,had,not,yet,selected,and,wrapped,a,gift,for,her,grandfather,[END]
scarlett,left,before,they,could,describe,the,extent,of,their,busyness,and,depth,of,their,astonishment,[END]
old,loo-las,she,said,under,her,breath,[END]
she,wasn't,at,all,sure,what,the,irish,phrase,meant,but,the,sound,of,it,was,enough,to,make,her,smile,[END]
the,trees,in,the,square,looked,somehow,thicker,the,grass,greener,than,the,day,before,[END]
the,sun,was,warmer,too,[END]
scarlett,felt,the,quickened,optimism,that,always,accompanied,the,first,hint,of,spring,[END]
today,would,be,a,good,day,she,was,sure,of,it,in,spite,of,her,grandfather's,birthday,party,[END]
walk,up,pansy,she,said,automatically,don't,drag,along,like,a,turtle,and,she,set,off,at,a,brisk,pace,along,the,packed,sand-and-shell,sidewalk,[END]
the,sound,of,hammering,and,men's,voices,shouting,at,the,cathedral,building,carried,clearly,through,the,still,sunlit,air,[END]
scarlett,wished,for,a,moment,that,the,priest,would,take,her,on,another,tour,of,the,site,[END]
but,that,wasn't,what,she,was,here,for,[END]
she,turned,into,the,gate,of,the,convent,[END]
the,same,elderly,nun,answered,the,doorbell,[END]
scarlett,readied,herself,for,combat,[END]
but,the,mother,superior,is,expecting,you,said,the,nun,[END]
if,you'll,follow,me,[END]
scarlett,was,almost,dazed,when,she,left,the,convent,ten,minutes,later,[END]
it,had,been,so,easy,[END]
the,mother,superior,agreed,at,once,to,talk,to,the,bishop,[END]
she'd,send,word,she,said,very,soon,[END]
no,she,couldn't,say,just,when,that,would,be,but,certainly,within,a,short,time,[END]
she,herself,would,be,returning,to,charleston,the,following,week,[END]
scarlett,was,euphoric,[END]
her,smile,and,her,eyes,were,so,bright,that,the,grocer,in,the,small,shop,on,abercorn,street,nearly,forgot,to,charge,her,for,the,bow-bedecked,box,of,chocolate,candies,she,selected,for,her,grandfather's,birthday,present,[END]
her,high,spirits,carried,her,through,the,final,preparations,for,the,birthday,dinner,that,engulfed,her,when,she,got,back,to,the,robillard,house,[END]
they,began,to,dim,slightly,when,she,learned,that,her,grandfather,would,actually,come,to,table,for,the,six,courses,of,his,particularly,favorite,foods,[END]
her,spirits,plummeted,when,the,aunts,informed,her,that,she,wasn't,allowed,to,eat,many,of,the,delicacies,that,would,be,served,[END]
flesh,is,forbidden,during,lent,said,pauline,sternly,[END]
be,certain,that,no,gravy,touches,the,rice,or,vegetables,you,eat,[END]
but,be,careful,scarlett,[END]
don't,let,père,notice,added,eulalie,in,a,whisper,[END]
he,doesn't,approve,of,fasting,[END]
her,eyes,were,rheumy,with,sorrow,[END]
brooding,about,missing,out,on,the,food,thought,scarlett,unkindly,[END]
then,i,don't,blame,her,[END]
the,aromas,from,the,kitchen,were,making,her,mouth,water,[END]
there'll,be,soup,for,us,[END]
and,fish,eulalie,said,with,sudden,cheerfulness,[END]
cake,too,a,beautiful,beautiful,cake,[END]
a,true,feast,scarlett,[END]
remember,sister,warned,pauline,gluttony,is,a,sin,[END]
scarlett,left,them,she,could,feel,herself,losing,control,of,her,temper,[END]
it's,only,a,dinner,she,reminded,herself,just,calm,down,[END]
even,with,grandfather,at,table,with,us,it,can't,be,all,that,bad,[END]
after,all,what,could,one,old,man,do,[END]
he,could,scarlett,learned,at,once,refuse,to,allow,anything,other,than,french,to,be,spoken,[END]
her,happy,birthday,grandfather,was,ignored,as,if,she,hadn't,said,it,[END]
her,aunts',greetings,were,acknowledged,by,a,cold,nod,and,he,sat,down,in,the,huge,throne-like,chair,at,the,head,of,the,table,[END]
pierre,auguste,robillard,was,no,longer,a,night-shirted,frail,elderly,man,[END]
impeccably,clothed,in,an,old-fashioned,frock,coat,and,starched,linen,his,thin,body,looked,larger,and,his,erect,military,bearing,was,impressive,even,when,he,was,seated,[END]
his,white,hair,was,like,an,old,lion's,ruff,his,eyes,were,hawk-like,under,his,big,white,brows,and,his,big,bony,nose,looked,like,a,predator's,beak,[END]
the,certainty,that,it,was,a,good,day,began,to,ooze,out,of,scarlett,[END]
she,unfolded,the,huge,starched,linen,napkin,over,her,lap,and,knees,and,braced,herself,for,she,knew,not,what,[END]
jerome,entered,bearing,a,big,silver,tureen,on,a,silver,tray,the,size,of,a,small,tabletop,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,widened,[END]
she'd,never,seen,silver,like,that,in,her,life,[END]
it,was,encrusted,with,ornamentation,[END]
an,entire,forest,of,trees,circled,the,base,of,the,tureen,their,branches,and,leaves,curving,upward,to,surround,the,rim,[END]
within,the,forest,there,were,birds,and,animals,bears,deer,wild,boar,hares,pheasant,even,owls,and,squirrels,on,the,limbs,of,the,trees,[END]
the,lid,of,the,tureen,was,shaped,like,a,tree,stump,covered,with,thick,vines,each,vine,bearing,clusters,of,miniature,perfect,ripe,grapes,[END]
jerome,placed,the,tureen,in,front,of,his,master,and,lifted,the,lid,with,a,white-gloved,hand,[END]
steam,poured,out,clouding,the,silver,and,spreading,the,delicious,aroma,of,shrimp,bisque,throughout,the,room,[END]
pauline,and,eulalie,leaned,forward,smiling,anxiously,[END]
jerome,took,a,soup,plate,from,the,sideboard,and,held,it,next,to,the,tureen,[END]
pierre,robillard,lifted,a,silver,ladle,and,silently,filled,the,bowl,[END]
then,he,watched,with,half-hooded,eyes,while,jerome,carried,the,bowl,and,deposited,it,in,front,of,pauline,[END]
the,ceremony,was,repeated,for,eulalie,then,for,scarlett,[END]
her,fingers,itched,to,grab,her,spoon,[END]
but,she,kept,her,hands,in,her,lap,while,her,grandfather,served,himself,and,tasted,the,soup,[END]
he,shrugged,eloquent,dissatisfaction,and,dropped,his,spoon,into,his,bowl,[END]
eulalie,let,out,a,strangled,sob,[END]
you,old,monster,[END]
scarlett,thought,[END]
she,began,to,eat,her,soup,[END]
it,was,a,velvety,richness,of,flavor,[END]
she,tried,to,catch,eulalie's,eyes,so,that,she,could,show,her,aunt,that,she,was,enjoying,the,soup,but,eulalie,was,downcast,[END]
pauline's,spoon,was,in,the,bowl,like,her,father's,[END]
scarlett,lost,all,sympathy,for,her,aunts,[END]
if,they,were,going,to,be,terrorized,this,easily,they,deserved,to,go,hungry,[END]
she,wasn't,going,to,let,the,old,man,keep,her,from,her,dinner,[END]
pauline,asked,her,father,something,but,because,she,was,speaking,french,scarlett,had,no,idea,what,her,aunt,had,said,[END]
her,grandfather's,reply,was,so,brief,and,pauline's,face,so,white,that,he,must,have,said,something,very,insulting,[END]
scarlett,began,to,get,angry,[END]
he's,going,to,ruin,everything,and,on,purpose,too,[END]
oh,i,wish,i,could,speak,french,[END]
i,wouldn't,just,sit,and,take,his,nastiness,[END]
she,kept,silent,while,jerome,removed,the,soup,plates,and,the,silver,place,plates,and,set,down,dinner,plates,and,fish,knives,and,forks,[END]
it,seemed,to,take,forever,[END]
but,the,planked,shad,when,it,came,was,worth,the,wait,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,her,grandfather,[END]
he,wouldn't,dare,pretend,that,he,didn't,like,this,[END]
he,ate,two,small,bites,[END]
the,sound,of,knives,and,forks,was,terribly,loud,when,they,touched,the,plates,[END]
pauline,first,then,eulalie,gave,up,with,most,of,their,fish,still,on,their,plates,[END]
scarlett,looked,defiantly,at,her,grandfather,over,each,forkful,that,she,carried,to,her,mouth,[END]
but,even,she,was,beginning,to,lose,her,appetite,[END]
the,old,man's,displeasure,was,souring,[END]
the,next,dish,revived,her,appetite,[END]
the,potted,doves,looked,as,tender,as,dumplings,and,their,gravy,was,a,rich,brown,river,over,pureed,potatoes,and,turnips,molded,into,light-as-air,nests,for,the,meat,of,the,tiny,birds,[END]
pierre,robillard,dipped,the,tines,of,his,fork,into,the,gravy,then,touched,them,to,his,tongue,[END]
that,was,all,[END]
scarlett,thought,she,would,explode,[END]
only,the,desperate,entreaty,in,her,aunts',eyes,kept,her,silent,[END]
how,could,anyone,be,as,hateful,as,her,grandfather,[END]
it,was,just,plain,impossible,that,he,didn't,like,the,food,[END]
it,wasn't,too,hard,for,him,to,eat,even,if,he,did,have,bad,teeth,[END]
or,none,at,all,for,that,matter,[END]
she,knew,he,liked,tasty,food,too,[END]
after,she'd,buttered,and,gravied,the,pap,he,was,usually,served,his,plate,had,gone,back,to,the,kitchen,as,clean,as,if,a,dog,had,licked,it,[END]
no,there,must,be,some,other,reason,he,wasn't,eating,[END]
and,she,could,see,it,in,his,eyes,[END]
they,gleamed,when,he,looked,at,her,aunts',pitiful,disappointment,[END]
he'd,rather,make,them,suffer,than,enjoy,eating,his,dinner,[END]
his,birthday,dinner,too,[END]
what,a,difference,between,this,birthday,feast,and,the,one,for,her,cousin,patricia,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,her,grandfather's,skeletal,ramrod,body,and,his,self-satisfied,impassive,face,and,she,despised,him,for,the,way,he,was,tormenting,her,aunts,[END]
but,even,more,she,despised,them,for,tolerating,his,tortures,[END]
they,don't,have,a,shred,of,gumption,[END]
how,can,they,just,sit,there,like,that,and,take,it,[END]
sitting,silently,at,her,grandfather's,table,in,the,gracious,pink,room,in,the,handsome,pink,house,she,seethed,with,loathing,for,everything,and,everyone,[END]
even,herself,[END]
i'm,as,bad,as,they,are,[END]
why,on,earth,can't,i,just,speak,up,and,tell,him,how,nasty,he's,acting,[END]
i,don't,have,to,talk,french,to,do,it,he,understands,english,as,well,as,i,do,[END]
i'm,a,grown,woman,not,a,child,who,mustn't,speak,until,spoken,to,[END]
what's,wrong,with,me,[END]
this,is,downright,silly,[END]
but,she,continued,to,sit,quietly,her,back,not,touching,the,chair,her,left,hand,in,her,lap,at,all,times,[END]
just,as,if,she,were,a,child,on,her,best,company,behavior,[END]
her,mother's,presence,was,unseen,not,even,imagined,but,ellen,robillard,o'hara,was,there,in,the,house,where,she'd,grown,up,at,the,table,where,she,had,so,often,sat,as,scarlett,was,sitting,with,her,left,hand,resting,on,the,starched,linen,napkin,across,her,lap,[END]
and,for,love,of,her,for,need,of,her,approval,scarlett,was,incapable,of,defying,the,tyranny,of,pierre,robillard,[END]
she,sat,for,what,seemed,an,eternity,watching,jerome's,stately,slow,service,[END]
plates,were,replaced,again,and,again,by,new,plates,knives,and,forks,by,fresh,knives,and,forks,it,seemed,to,scarlett,that,the,feast,would,never,end,[END]
pierre,robillard,consistently,tasted,and,rejected,each,carefully,selected,and,prepared,dish,that,was,offered,him,[END]
by,the,time,jerome,brought,in,the,birthday,cake,the,tension,and,misery,of,scarlett's,aunts,was,palpable,and,scarlett,herself,was,barely,able,to,sit,still,in,her,chair,so,urgent,was,her,longing,to,escape,[END]
the,cake,was,coated,in,glossy,swirled,meringue,that,had,been,sprinkled,liberally,with,silver,dragees,[END]
a,silver,filigreed,bud,vase,on,top,held,curling,fronds,of,angel,hair,ferns,and,miniature,silk,flags,of,france,the,emperor,napoleon's,army,and,the,regiment,in,which,pierre,robillard,had,served,[END]
the,old,man,grunted,perhaps,with,pleasure,when,it,was,placed,before,him,[END]
he,turned,his,hooded,eyes,on,scarlett,[END]
cut,it,he,said,in,english,[END]
he,hopes,i'll,knock,over,the,flags,she,thought,but,i'm,not,going,to,give,him,that,pleasure,[END]
as,she,accepted,the,cake,knife,from,jerome,with,her,right,hand,with,her,left,she,quickly,lifted,the,shining,bud,vase,from,the,cake,and,put,it,on,the,table,[END]
she,looked,directly,into,her,grandfather's,eyes,and,smiled,her,sweetest,smile,[END]
his,lips,twitched,[END]
and,did,he,eat,it,[END]
scarlett,asked,dramatically,[END]
he,did,not,[END]
the,old,horror,managed,to,get,no,more,than,two,crumbs,on,the,tip,of,his,fork,after,he,scraped,off,that,beautiful,meringue,as,if,it,was,mold,or,something,else,horrible,and,put,them,in,his,mouth,like,he,was,doing,the,biggest,favor,in,the,world,[END]
then,he,said,he,was,too,tired,to,open,his,presents,and,he,went,back,to,his,room,[END]
i,wanted,to,wring,his,scrawny,neck,[END]
maureen,o'hara,rocked,back,and,forth,laughing,with,delight,[END]
i,don't,see,what's,so,funny,scarlett,said,[END]
he,was,mean,and,rude,[END]
she,was,disappointed,in,jamie's,wife,[END]
she'd,expected,sympathy,not,amusement,[END]
but,of,course,you,see,scarlett,[END]
it's,the,roguishness,of,it,all,[END]
your,poor,old,aunts,plotting,their,hearts,out,to,please,him,and,himself,sitting,in,his,nightshirt,like,a,wee,toothless,babe,plotting,against,them,[END]
the,old,villain,[END]
i've,always,had,a,weak,spot,in,my,heart,for,the,deviltry,of,a,rascal,[END]
i,can,see,him,now,sniffing,the,dinner,to,come,and,making,his,plans,[END]
and,don't,you,know,he's,got,that,man,of,his,sneaking,in,all,those,wonderful,dishes,for,him,to,eat,his,fill,behind,his,closed,door,[END]
the,old,rascal,[END]
it,does,make,me,laugh,the,clever,wickedness,of,him,[END]
maureen's,laughter,was,so,contagious,that,scarlett,finally,joined,in,[END]
she'd,done,the,right,thing,coming,to,maureen's,neverlocked,kitchen,door,after,the,disastrous,birthday,dinner,[END]
let's,have,our,own,piece,of,cake,then,said,maureen,comfortably,[END]
you're,in,practice,scarlett,cut,it,for,us,it's,under,that,towel,there,on,the,dresser,[END]
cut,some,extra,slices,too,the,young,ones,will,be,home,from,school,before,long,[END]
i'll,be,brewing,some,fresh,tea,[END]
scarlett,had,just,seated,herself,near,the,fire,with,cup,and,plate,when,the,door,flew,open,with,a,bang,and,five,young,o'haras,invaded,the,quiet,kitchen,[END]
she,recognized,maureen's,redhaired,daughters,mary,kate,and,helen,[END]
the,little,boy,she,soon,learned,was,michael,o'hara,the,two,younger,girls,were,his,sisters,clare,and,peg,[END]
all,of,them,had,dark,curly,hair,that,needed,combing,darklashed,blue,eyes,and,grubby,little,hands,that,maureen,told,them,to,wash,at,once,[END]
but,we,don't,need,clean,hands,michael,argued,we're,going,to,the,cowshed,to,play,with,the,pigs,[END]
pigs,live,in,the,pigpen,said,tiny,peg,with,a,self-important,air,[END]
don't,they,maureen,[END]
scarlett,was,shocked,[END]
in,her,world,children,never,called,adults,by,their,first,name,[END]
but,maureen,seemed,to,find,it,nothing,out,of,the,ordinary,[END]
they,live,in,the,pigpen,if,no,one,lets,them,out,she,said,with,a,wink,[END]
you,weren't,thinking,of,taking,the,piglets,out,of,the,pen,to,play,with,now,were,you,[END]
michael,and,his,sisters,laughed,as,if,maureen's,joke,was,the,funniest,thing,they'd,ever,heard,[END]
then,they,ran,through,the,kitchen,to,the,back,door,that,led,into,a,large,yard,shared,by,all,the,houses,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,took,in,the,glowing,coals,on,the,hearth,the,shiny,copper,of,the,tea,kettle,on,the,crane,and,the,pans,hanging,above,the,mantel,[END]
funny,she'd,thought,she,would,never,set,foot,in,a,kitchen,again,once,the,bad,days,at,tara,were,over,[END]
but,this,was,different,[END]
it,was,a,place,to,live,a,happy,place,to,be,not,just,the,room,where,food,was,prepared,and,dishes,washed,[END]
she,wished,she,could,stay,[END]
the,static,beauty,of,her,grandfather's,drawing,room,made,her,shiver,inside,when,she,thought,of,it,[END]
but,she,belonged,in,a,drawing,room,not,a,kitchen,[END]
she,was,a,lady,accustomed,to,servants,and,luxury,[END]
she,drained,her,cup,hurriedly,and,put,it,down,in,its,saucer,[END]
you've,saved,my,life,maureen,i,thought,i'd,go,crazy,if,i,had,to,stay,with,my,aunts,[END]
but,i've,really,got,to,go,back,now,[END]
what,a,pity,[END]
you,haven't,even,had,your,cake,[END]
i'm,told,my,cakes,are,worth,eating,[END]
helen,and,mary,kate,edged,up,to,their,mother's,chair,empty,plates,in,hand,[END]
take,a,piece,then,but,not,all,of,it,[END]
the,little,ones,will,be,in,soon,[END]
scarlett,began,to,pull,on,her,gloves,[END]
i've,got,to,go,she,repeated,[END]
if,you,must,then,you,must,[END]
i'll,hope,you'll,stay,longer,for,the,dancing,on,saturday,scarlett,[END]
jamie,told,me,he's,going,to,teach,you,the,reel,[END]
maybe,colum,will,be,back,by,then,too,[END]
oh,maureen,[END]
are,you,having,another,party,on,saturday,[END]
not,to,say,a,party,[END]
but,there's,always,the,music,and,the,dancing,when,the,week's,work,is,done,and,the,men,bring,home,their,pay,packets,[END]
you'll,be,here,[END]
scarlett,shook,her,head,[END]
i,can't,[END]
i'd,love,to,but,i,won't,still,be,in,savannah,[END]
her,aunts,expected,her,to,go,back,to,charleston,with,them,on,saturday,morning's,train,[END]
she,didn't,think,she,would,she'd,never,thought,so,[END]
surely,rhett,would,come,for,her,long,before,then,[END]
maybe,he,was,at,her,grandfather's,right,now,[END]
she,shouldn't,have,left,the,house,[END]
she,jumped,to,her,feet,[END]
i've,got,to,run,[END]
thank,you,maureen,[END]
i'll,stop,by,again,before,i,leave,[END]
maybe,she'd,bring,rhett,to,meet,the,o'haras,[END]
he'd,fit,right,in,another,big,dark-haired,man,with,all,the,big,dark-haired,o'haras,[END]
but,he,might,slouch,against,the,wall,in,that,infuriating,elegant,way,he,had,and,laugh,at,all,of,them,[END]
he'd,always,laughed,at,her,half,irishness,mocked,her,when,she,repeated,what,pa,told,her,a,hundred,times,[END]
the,o'haras,were,great,and,powerful,landowners,for,centuries,[END]
until,the,battle,of,the,boyne,[END]
i,don't,know,why,he,found,that,so,funny,[END]
just,about,everybody,we,know,lost,their,land,to,the,yankees,it,makes,sense,that,pa's,folks,lost,theirs,the,same,way,to,whoever,the,english,i,think,[END]
i'll,ask,jamie,or,maureen,about,it,if,i,get,a,chance,[END]
if,rhett,doesn't,take,me,away,first,[END]
38,[END]
hamilton's,promised,letter,was,delivered,to,the,robillard,house,just,as,dark,was,setting,in,[END]
scarlett,grabbed,it,like,a,line,thrown,to,the,drowning,[END]
she'd,been,listening,to,her,aunts,quarrelling,for,more,than,an,hour,about,who,was,to,blame,for,their,father's,reaction,to,his,birthday,[END]
this,is,about,my,atlanta,property,scarlett,said,[END]
please,excuse,me,i'll,take,it,up,to,my,room,[END]
she,didn't,wait,for,them,to,agree,[END]
she,locked,the,door,to,her,room,[END]
she,wanted,to,savor,every,word,in,private,[END]
what,mess,have,you,made,this,time,[END]
the,letter,began,without,salutation,[END]
the,old,lawyer's,handwriting,was,so,agitated,that,it,was,difficult,to,read,[END]
scarlett,made,a,face,and,held,it,closer,to,the,lamp,[END]
what,mess,have,you,made,this,time,[END]
on,monday,i,was,visited,ly,a,pompous,old,fool,i,generally,go,out,of,my,way,to,avoid,[END]
he,presented,me,with,an,astonishing,draft,drawn,on,his,bank,and,payable,to,you,[END]
the,amount,was,one,half,million,dollars,and,it,was,paid,by,rhett,[END]
tuesday,i,was,badgered,by,another,old,fool,this,one,a,layer,asking,me,where,you,were,[END]
his,client,your,husband,wanted,to,know,[END]
i,did,not,tell,him,you,were,in,savannah,[END]
scarlett,groaned,[END]
who,was,uncle,henry,calling,an,old,fool,when,he,was,such,an,old,fool,himself,[END]
no,wonder,rhett,hadn't,come,for,her,[END]
she,peered,again,at,henry's,spidery,script,[END]
because,your,telegram,arrived,after,he,left,and,at,the,time,he,called,on,me,i,didn't,know,where,you,were,[END]
i,have,not,told,him,yet,because,i,do,not,know,what,you're,up,to,and,i,have,a,pretty,good,idea,that,i,want,no,part,of,it,[END]
this,courthouse,lawyer,had,two,questions,from,rhett,[END]
the,first,was,your,whereabouts,[END]
the,second,was,do,you,want,a,divorce,[END]
now,scarlett,i,don't,know,what,you're,holding,over,rhett's,head,to,get,that,kind,of,money,from,him,and,i,don't,want,to,know,[END]
whatever,he,might,have,done,to,give,you,grounds,to,divorce,him,is,none,of,my,business,either,[END]
i've,never,dirtied,my,hand,with,a,divorce,action,and,i'm,not,going,to,start,now,[END]
you,would,be,wasting,your,time,and,money,besides,[END]
there,is,no,divorce,in,south,carolina,and,that,is,rhett's,legal,residence,now,[END]
if,you,persist,in,this,tomfoolery,i,will,give,you,the,name,of,a,lawyer,in,atlanta,who,is,almost,respectable,even,though,he,has,done,two,divorces,that,i've,heard,of,[END]
but,i,warn,you,that,you'll,have,to,give,him,or,someone,else,all,your,legal,business,[END]
i,won't,handle,anything,for,you,any,more,[END]
if,you're,thinking,of,divorcing,rhett,so,you'll,be,free,to,mary,ashley,wilkes,let,me,say,that,you'd,do,well,to,think,again,[END]
ashley,is,doing,much,better,than,anyone,expected,he,would,[END]
miss,india,and,my,silly,sister,keep,a,comfortable,house,for,him,and,his,boy,[END]
if,you,push,yourself,into,his,life,you'll,ruin,everything,[END]
leave,the,poor,man,alone,scarlett,[END]
leave,ashley,alone,indeed,[END]
i'd,like,to,know,how,comfortable,and,prosperous,he'd,be,if,i,had,left,him,alone,[END]
uncle,henry,of,all,people,should,have,better,sense,than,to,fuss,at,me,like,a,prissy,old,maid,and,jump,to,all,kinds,of,nasty,conclusions,[END]
he,knows,all,about,building,the,houses,on,the,edge,of,town,[END]
scarlett's,feelings,were,deeply,wounded,[END]
uncle,henry,hamilton,was,the,closest,thing,she,had,to,a,father,or,a,friend,in,atlanta,and,his,accusations,cut,deep,[END]
she,scanned,the,few,remaining,lines,quickly,then,scrawled,a,response,for,pansy,to,take,to,the,telegraph,office,[END]
savannah,address,no,secret,stop,divorce,not,wanted,stop,money,in,gold,question,mark,[END]
if,uncle,henry,hadn't,sounded,so,much,like,an,old,clucking,hen,she,would,have,trusted,him,to,have,bought,gold,and,put,it,in,her,safe,box,[END]
but,anyone,who,didn't,have,sense,enough,to,give,rhett,her,address,might,not,have,sense,about,other,things,too,[END]
scarlett,chewed,on,the,knuckle,of,her,left,thumb,worried,about,her,money,[END]
maybe,she,should,go,to,atlanta,and,talk,to,henry,and,her,bankers,and,joe,colleton,[END]
maybe,she,should,buy,some,more,land,out,there,on,the,edge,of,town,put,up,some,more,houses,[END]
things,would,never,be,cheaper,than,they,were,now,with,the,aftereffects,of,the,panic,still,depressing,business,[END]
no,[END]
she,had,to,put,first,things,first,[END]
rhett,was,trying,to,find,her,[END]
she,smiled,to,herself,and,the,fingers,of,her,right,hand,smoothed,the,reddened,skin,over,her,thumb,knuckle,[END]
he,doesn't,fool,me,with,that,divorce,talk,[END]
or,by,transferring,the,money,as,if,our,deal,was,being,carried,out,[END]
what,counts,the,only,thing,that,counts,is,that,he,wants,to,know,where,i,am,[END]
he,won't,stay,away,long,once,uncle,henry,tells,him,[END]
don't,be,ridiculous,scarlett,said,pauline,in,a,cold,tone,of,course,you'll,be,going,home,tomorrow,[END]
we,always,go,back,to,charleston,on,saturday,[END]
that,doesn't,mean,i,have,to,[END]
i,told,you,i've,decided,to,stay,in,savannah,for,a,while,[END]
scarlett,wouldn't,let,pauline,bother,her,nothing,could,bother,her,now,that,she,knew,rhett,was,looking,for,her,[END]
she'd,receive,him,right,here,in,this,elegant,pink,and,gold,room,and,she'd,make,him,beg,her,to,come,back,[END]
after,he'd,been,adequately,humbled,she'd,agree,and,then,he'd,take,her,in,his,arms,and,kiss,her,[END]
scarlett,[END]
will,you,have,the,kindness,to,answer,me,when,i,address,a,question,to,you,[END]
what,is,it,aunt,pauline,[END]
what,do,you,propose,to,do,with,yourself,[END]
where,are,you,going,to,stay,[END]
why,here,of,course,[END]
it,had,not,entered,scarlett's,head,that,she,might,not,be,welcome,to,stay,as,long,as,she,liked,at,her,grandfather's,house,[END]
the,tradition,of,hospitality,was,still,fiercely,cherished,in,the,south,and,it,was,unheard,of,for,a,guest,to,be,asked,to,leave,until,he,or,she,decided,it,was,time,[END]
père,doesn't,like,surprises,eulalie,offered,sadly,[END]
i,believe,that,i,can,instruct,scarlett,in,the,habits,of,this,household,without,your,help,sister,[END]
of,course,you,can,sister,i'm,sure,i,never,suggested,otherwise,[END]
i'll,just,go,ask,grandfather,scarlett,said,standing,up,[END]
do,you,want,to,come,along,[END]
twittering,she,thought,that's,what,they're,doing,[END]
terrified,that,visiting,him,without,an,express,invitation,might,make,grandfather,mad,[END]
great,balls,of,fire,[END]
what,meanness,can,he,do,them,that,he,hasn't,already,done,[END]
she,strode,along,the,hallway,followed,by,her,whispering,anxious,aunts,and,knocked,on,the,old,man's,door,[END]
entrez,jerome,[END]
it's,not,jerome,grandfather,it's,me,scarlett,[END]
may,i,come,in,[END]
there,was,a,moment's,silence,[END]
then,pierre,robillard's,deep,strong,voice,called,come,in,[END]
scarlett,tossed,her,head,and,smiled,triumphantly,at,her,aunts,before,she,opened,the,door,[END]
her,boldness,flagged,a,bit,when,she,looked,at,the,stern,hawklike,face,of,the,old,man,[END]
but,she,couldn't,stop,now,[END]
she,advanced,halfway,across,the,thick,carpet,with,a,confident,air,[END]
i,just,wanted,to,tell,you,grandfather,that,i'm,going,to,stay,for,a,while,after,aunt,eulalie,and,aunt,pauline,leave,[END]
why,[END]
scarlett,was,nonplussed,[END]
she,wasn't,about,to,explain,her,reasons,[END]
she,didn't,see,why,she,should,have,to,[END]
because,i,want,to,she,said,[END]
why,[END]
the,old,man,asked,again,[END]
scarlett's,determined,green,eyes,met,his,suspicious,faded,blue,ones,[END]
i,have,my,reasons,she,said,[END]
do,you,object,[END]
what,if,i,do,[END]
this,was,intolerable,[END]
she,could,not,would,not,go,back,to,charleston,[END]
it,would,be,equivalent,to,surrender,[END]
she,had,to,stay,in,savannah,[END]
if,you,don't,want,me,here,i'll,go,to,my,cousins,[END]
the,o'haras,have,already,invited,me,[END]
pierre,robillard'south,jerked,a,travesty,of,a,smile,[END]
you,don't,mind,sleeping,in,the,parlor,with,the,pig,i,take,it,[END]
scarlett's,cheeks,reddened,[END]
she'd,always,known,her,grandfather,disapproved,of,her,mother's,marriage,[END]
he'd,never,accepted,gerald,o'hara,in,his,house,[END]
she,wanted,to,defend,her,father,and,her,cousins,from,his,prejudice,against,the,irish,[END]
if,only,she,didn't,have,this,terrible,suspicion,that,the,children,brought,the,baby,pigs,into,the,house,to,play,with,[END]
never,mind,said,her,grandfather,[END]
stay,if,you,like,[END]
it's,a,matter,of,supreme,indifference,to,me,[END]
he,closed,his,eyes,dismissing,her,from,his,sight,and,his,attention,[END]
scarlett,refrained,with,difficulty,from,slamming,the,door,when,she,left,the,room,[END]
what,a,horrid,old,man,[END]
still,she,had,gotten,what,she,wanted,[END]
she,smiled,at,her,aunts,[END]
everything's,all,right,she,said,[END]
for,the,remainder,of,the,morning,and,all,afternoon,scarlett,cheerfully,went,along,with,her,aunts,to,leave,their,cards,at,the,houses,of,all,their,friends,and,acquaintances,in,savannah,[END]
p,p,c,[END]
they,hand-lettered,in,the,lower,left,corner,[END]
pour,prendre,congé,to,take,leave,[END]
the,custom,had,never,been,observed,in,atlanta,but,in,the,older,cities,of,coastal,georgia,and,south,carolina,it,was,a,required,ritual,[END]
scarlett,thought,it,a,great,waste,of,time,to,inform,people,you,were,leaving,[END]
especially,when,only,a,handful,of,days,earlier,her,aunts,had,worn,themselves,out,leaving,cards,at,the,same,houses,to,inform,the,same,people,that,they,had,arrived,[END]
she,was,sure,that,most,of,those,people,hadn't,bothered,to,leave,cards,at,the,robillard,house,[END]
certainly,there,had,been,no,callers,[END]
on,saturday,she,insisted,on,going,to,the,train,depot,with,them,and,she,saw,to,it,that,pansy,put,their,valises,exactly,where,they,wanted,them,in,full,view,so,that,no,one,could,steal,them,[END]
she,kissed,their,papery,wrinkled,cheeks,returned,to,the,busy,platform,and,waved,goodbye,while,the,train,chugged,out,of,the,station,[END]
we'll,stop,at,the,bakery,on,broughton,street,before,we,go,back,to,the,house,she,told,the,driver,of,the,rented,carriage,[END]
it,was,still,a,long,time,until,dinner,[END]
she,sent,pansy,to,the,kitchen,to,order,a,pot,of,coffee,and,then,took,off,her,hat,and,gloves,[END]
how,lovely,and,quiet,the,house,was,with,the,aunts,gone,[END]
but,that,was,definitely,a,film,of,dust,on,the,hall,table,[END]
she'd,have,to,have,a,few,words,with,jerome,[END]
the,other,servants,too,if,necessary,[END]
she,wasn't,going,to,have,things,looking,shabby,when,rhett,arrived,[END]
as,if,he'd,read,her,mind,jerome,appeared,behind,her,[END]
scarlett,jumped,[END]
why,on,earth,couldn't,the,man,make,a,decent,amount,of,noise,when,he,walked,[END]
this,message,come,for,you,miss,scarlett,[END]
he,held,out,a,silver,tray,with,a,telegram,on,it,[END]
rhett,[END]
scarlett,grabbed,the,thin,paper,with,too-eager,clumsy,fingers,[END]
thank,you,jerome,[END]
see,to,my,coffee,please,[END]
the,butler,was,too,curious,by,half,in,her,opinion,[END]
she,didn't,want,him,reading,over,her,shoulder,[END]
as,soon,as,he,was,gone,she,ripped,open,the,message,[END]
damn,[END]
she,said,[END]
it,was,from,uncle,henry,[END]
the,normally,thrifty,old,lawyer,must,have,been,deeply,agitated,because,the,telegram,was,wastefully,wordy,[END]
i,have,not,and,will,not,have,anything,whatsoever,to,do,with,investing,or,otherwise,involving,myself,with,the,money,that,was,transferred,by,your,husband,stop,it,is,in,your,account,at,your,bank,stop,i,have,expressed,my,repugnance,for,the,circumstances,surrounding,this,transaction,stop,do,not,expect,any,help,from,me,stop,[END]
scarlett,sank,onto,a,chair,when,she,read,it,[END]
her,knees,were,like,water,and,her,heart,was,racing,[END]
the,old,fool,[END]
a,half,million,dollars,that,was,probably,more,money,than,the,bank,had,seen,since,before,the,war,[END]
what,was,to,stop,the,officers,from,just,pocketing,it,and,closing,the,bank,[END]
banks,were,still,closing,all,over,the,country,it,was,in,the,paper,all,the,time,[END]
she'd,have,to,go,to,atlanta,at,once,change,the,money,to,gold,add,it,to,her,safe,box,[END]
but,that,would,take,days,[END]
even,if,there,was,a,train,today,she,wouldn't,get,to,the,bank,before,monday,[END]
plenty,of,time,for,her,money,to,disappear,[END]
a,half,million,dollars,[END]
more,money,than,she'd,have,if,she,sold,everything,she,owned,twice,over,[END]
more,money,than,her,store,and,her,saloon,and,her,new,houses,would,make,in,thirty,years,[END]
she,had,to,protect,it,but,how,[END]
oh,she,could,kill,uncle,henry,[END]
when,pansy,came,upstairs,proudly,carrying,the,heavy,silver,tray,with,the,gleaming,coffee,service,on,it,she,was,met,by,a,pale,wild-eyed,scarlett,[END]
put,that,thing,down,and,get,your,coat,on,said,scarlett,[END]
we're,going,out,[END]
she,had,herself,under,control,there,was,even,a,little,color,in,her,cheeks,from,the,walk,when,she,hurried,into,the,o'hara,store,[END]
cousin,or,not,she,didn't,want,jamie,to,know,too,much,about,her,business,[END]
so,her,voice,was,charmingly,girlish,when,she,asked,him,to,recommend,a,banker,[END]
i've,been,so,giddy,that,i,just,haven't,paid,any,attention,to,my,spending,money,and,now,that,i've,decided,to,stay,a,while,longer,i,need,to,have,a,few,dollars,transferred,from,my,bank,at,home,but,i,don't,know,a,soul,here,in,savannah,[END]
i,figured,you'd,be,able,to,put,in,a,good,word,for,me,being,a,prosperous,businessman,and,all,[END]
jamie,grinned,[END]
i'll,be,proud,to,escort,you,to,the,president,of,the,bank,and,i'll,vouch,for,him,because,uncle,james,has,done,business,with,him,for,fifty,years,and,more,[END]
but,you'll,do,better,scarlett,to,tell,him,you're,old,robillard's,granddaughter,than,that,you're,o'hara's,cousin,[END]
the,word,is,he's,a,very,warm,old,gentleman,[END]
wasn't,he,the,smart,one,who,sent,his,brass,to,france,when,georgia,decided,to,follow,south,carolina,out,of,the,union,[END]
but,that,meant,her,grandfather,was,a,traitor,to,the,south,[END]
no,wonder,he,still,had,all,that,heavy,silver,and,that,undamaged,house,[END]
why,hadn't,he,been,lynched,[END]
and,how,could,jamie,laugh,about,it,[END]
scarlett,remembered,maureen,laughing,about,her,grandfather,too,when,she,should,by,rights,have,been,shocked,[END]
it,was,all,very,complicated,[END]
she,didn't,know,what,to,think,[END]
in,any,case,she,didn't,have,time,to,think,about,it,now,she,had,to,get,to,the,bank,and,arrange,about,her,money,[END]
you'll,watch,the,store,then,daniel,while,i,walk,out,with,cousin,scarlett,[END]
jamie,was,beside,her,offering,his,arm,[END]
scarlett,put,her,hand,in,the,bend,of,his,elbow,and,waved,goodbye,to,daniel,[END]
she,hoped,it,wasn't,far,to,the,bank,[END]
it,was,nearly,noon,[END]
maureen,will,be,delighted,that,you'll,be,with,us,for,a,bit,said,jamie,as,they,walked,along,broughton,street,with,pansy,trailing,behind,[END]

i,could,call,for,you,on,my,way,home,to,walk,you,there,[END]
i'd,like,that,very,much,jamie,she,said,[END]
she'd,go,crazy,in,that,big,house,with,no,one,to,talk,to,but,her,grandfather,and,him,only,for,ten,minutes,[END]
if,rhett,came,she,could,always,send,pansy,to,the,store,with,a,note,saying,she'd,changed,her,mind,[END]
as,it,turned,out,she,was,waiting,impatiently,in,the,front,hall,for,jamie,when,he,arrived,[END]
her,grandfather,had,been,exceptionally,nasty,when,she,told,him,she,was,going,out,for,the,evening,[END]
this,is,not,a,hotel,where,you,can,come,and,go,as,you,please,miss,[END]
you'll,match,your,schedule,to,the,routine,of,my,house,and,that,means,in,your,bed,by,nine,o'clock,[END]
of,course,grandfather,she,had,said,meekly,[END]
she,was,sure,she'd,be,home,long,before,then,[END]
and,besides,she,was,regarding,him,with,increased,respect,ever,since,her,visit,to,the,bank,president,[END]
her,grandfather,must,be,much,much,richer,than,she'd,imagined,[END]
when,jamie,introduced,her,as,pierre,robillard's,granddaughter,the,man,nearly,split,his,britches,bowing,and,scraping,[END]
scarlett,smiled,remembering,[END]
then,after,jamie,left,when,i,told,him,i,wanted,to,rent,a,safe,box,and,transfer,a,half,million,to,it,i,thought,he'd,swoon,at,my,feet,[END]
i,don't,care,what,anybody,says,having,lots,of,money,is,the,best,thing,in,the,world,[END]
i,can't,stay,late,she,told,jamie,when,he,arrived,[END]
i,hope,that's,all,right,[END]
you,won't,mind,walking,me,back,by,eight-thirty,[END]
i'll,be,honored,to,walk,you,anywhere,at,any,time,at,all,jamie,vowed,[END]
scarlett,truly,had,no,idea,that,she,wouldn't,be,back,until,almost,dawn,[END]
39,[END]
the,evening,started,quietly,enough,[END]
so,quietly,in,fact,that,scarlett,was,disappointed,[END]
she'd,been,expecting,music,and,dancing,and,some,kind,of,celebration,but,jamie,escorted,her,to,the,now,familiar,kitchen,of,his,house,[END]
maureen,greeted,her,with,a,kiss,on,each,cheek,and,a,cup,of,tea,in,her,hand,then,returned,to,the,preparation,of,supper,[END]
scarlett,sat,down,next,to,uncle,james,who,was,dozing,[END]
jamie,took,off,his,coat,unbuttoned,his,vest,and,lit,a,pipe,then,settled,down,in,a,rocking,chair,for,a,quiet,smoke,[END]
mary,kate,and,helen,were,setting,the,table,in,the,adjoining,dining,room,chattering,to,one,another,over,the,rattle,of,knives,and,forks,[END]
it,was,a,comfortable,family,scene,but,not,very,exciting,[END]
still,thought,scarlett,at,least,there's,going,to,be,supper,[END]
i,knew,aunt,pauline,and,aunt,eulalie,must,be,wrong,about,the,whole,fasting,nonsense,[END]
nobody,would,live,on,only,one,meal,a,day,for,weeks,and,weeks,on,purpose,[END]
after,a,few,minutes,the,shy,girl,with,the,cloud,of,beautiful,dark,hair,came,in,from,the,hall,with,little,jacky,by,the,hand,[END]
oh,there,you,are,kathleen,said,jamie,[END]
scarlett,made,a,mental,note,of,the,name,[END]
it,suited,the,girl,so,soft,and,youthful,[END]
bring,the,little,man,to,his,old,pa,jacky,pulled,his,hand,away,and,ran,to,his,father,and,the,brief,tranquillity,was,over,[END]
scarlett,winced,at,the,little,boy's,shouts,of,joy,[END]
uncle,james,snorted,in,sudden,waking,[END]
the,street,door,opened,and,daniel,came,in,with,his,younger,brother,brian,[END]
look,what,i,found,sniffing,at,the,door,ma,said,daniel,[END]
oh,so,you've,decided,to,grace,us,with,your,presence,then,brian,maureen,said,[END]
i'll,have,to,tell,the,newspaper,so,they,can,put,it,on,the,front,page,[END]
brian,grabbed,his,mother,around,the,waist,in,a,bear,hug,[END]
you,wouldn't,turn,a,man,out,to,starve,now,would,you,[END]
maureen,made,a,pretense,of,anger,but,she,was,smiling,[END]
brian,kissed,the,coiled,masses,of,red,hair,on,top,of,her,head,and,released,her,[END]
now,look,what,you've,done,to,my,hair,you,wild,indian,maureen,complained,[END]
and,shaming,me,in,the,bargain,by,not,greeting,your,cousin,scarlett,[END]
you,too,daniel,[END]
brian,leaned,down,from,his,great,height,and,grinned,at,scarlett,[END]
will,you,forgive,me,[END]
he,said,[END]
you,were,so,small,and,elegantly,silent,there,that,i,missed,you,altogether,cousin,scarlett,[END]
his,thick,red,hair,was,bright,in,the,glow,from,the,fire,and,his,blue,eyes,were,infectiously,merry,[END]
will,you,plead,for,me,with,my,cruel,mother,that,i,can,have,a,few,scraps,from,her,table,[END]
go,on,with,you,savage,and,wash,the,dust,off,your,hands,maureen,ordered,[END]
daniel,took,his,brother's,place,when,brian,headed,for,the,sink,[END]
we're,all,glad,you're,here,with,us,cousin,scarlett,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
even,with,the,racket,from,jacky,bouncing,on,jamie's,knee,she,was,glad,to,be,there,too,[END]
there,was,so,much,life,in,these,big,redheaded,cousins,of,hers,[END]
it,made,the,cold,perfection,of,her,grandfather's,house,seem,like,a,tomb,[END]
while,they,ate,at,the,big,table,in,the,dining,room,scarlett,learned,the,story,behind,maureen's,mock,anger,at,her,son,[END]
brian,had,moved,a,few,weeks,earlier,from,the,room,he,had,shared,with,daniel,and,maureen,was,only,semi-reconciled,to,his,burst,of,independence,[END]
granted,he,was,only,a,few,steps,away,at,his,sister,patricia's,house,still,he,was,gone,[END]
it,gave,maureen,immense,satisfaction,that,brian,still,preferred,her,cooking,to,patricia's,fancier,menus,[END]
ah,well,what,can,you,expect,she,said,complacently,when,patricia,won't,allow,the,smell,of,fish,to,get,into,her,fine,lace,curtains,[END]
and,she,piled,four,glistening,butter-coated,fried,fish,on,her,son's,plate,[END]
it's,a,hardship,to,be,such,a,lady,during,lent,i'm,sure,[END]
bite,your,tongue,woman,said,jamie,that's,your,own,daughter,you're,maligning,[END]
and,who,has,a,better,right,than,her,own,mother,[END]
old,james,spoke,up,then,[END]
maureen,has,a,point,[END]
i,well,remember,my,own,mother's,sharp,tongue,[END]
he,rambled,fondly,through,a,series,of,memories,of,his,youth,[END]
scarlett,listened,intently,for,mention,of,her,father,[END]
now,gerald,said,old,james,and,she,leaned,toward,him,gerald,was,always,the,apple,of,her,eye,being,the,baby,and,all,[END]
he,always,got,off,with,no,more,than,a,small,scolding,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
it,was,just,like,pa,to,be,his,mother's,favorite,[END]
who,could,resist,the,soft,heart,he,tried,to,hide,under,all,his,blustering,[END]
oh,how,she,wished,he,could,be,here,now,with,all,his,family,[END]
are,we,going,to,matthew's,after,supper,[END]
old,james,asked,[END]
or,is,everyone,coming,here,[END]
we're,going,to,matt's,jamie,replied,[END]
matt,was,the,one,who'd,started,the,dancing,at,patricia's,birthday,scarlett,remembered,[END]
her,feet,began,to,tap,[END]
maureen,smiled,at,her,[END]
i,believe,there's,a,readiness,for,a,reel,she,said,[END]
she,picked,up,the,spoon,by,her,plate,reached,across,daniel,and,took,his,then,placing,their,bowls,back,to,back,she,held,the,tips,of,the,handles,loosely,together,and,tapped,the,spoons,against,her,palm,against,her,wrist,her,forearm,daniel's,forehead,[END]
the,rhythm,of,the,beating,was,like,playing,the,bones,but,lighter,and,the,sheer,silliness,of,making,music,with,a,pair,of,mismatched,tablespoons,was,cause,for,delighted,spontaneous,laughter,from,scarlett,[END]
without,thinking,about,it,she,began,to,pound,on,the,table,with,her,open,hands,matching,the,beat,of,the,spoons,[END]
it's,time,we,were,going,jamie,laughed,[END]
i'll,get,my,fiddle,[END]
we'll,bring,the,chairs,said,mary,kate,[END]
matt,and,katie,only,have,two,daniel,explained,to,scarlett,[END]
they're,the,newest,o'haras,to,come,to,savannah,[END]
it,didn't,matter,at,all,that,matt,and,katie,o'hara's,double,parlors,held,almost,no,furniture,[END]
they,had,fireplaces,for,warmth,gaslit,ceiling,globes,for,light,and,a,broad,polished,wood,floor,for,dancing,[END]
the,hours,scarlett,passed,in,those,bare,rooms,that,saturday,were,among,the,happiest,she'd,ever,known,[END]
within,the,family,the,o'haras,shared,love,and,happiness,as,freely,and,unconsciously,as,they,shared,the,air,they,breathed,[END]
scarlett,felt,within,her,the,growth,of,something,she,had,lost,too,long,ago,to,remember,[END]
she,became,like,them,unaffected,and,spontaneous,and,open,to,carefree,joy,[END]
she,could,shed,the,artifice,and,calculation,that,she'd,learned,to,use,in,the,battles,for,conquest,and,dominance,that,were,part,of,being,a,belle,in,southern,society,[END]
she,had,no,need,to,charm,or,conquer,she,was,welcome,as,she,was,one,of,the,family,[END]
for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,was,willing,to,relinquish,the,spotlight,to,let,someone,else,be,the,center,of,attention,[END]
the,others,were,fascinating,to,her,primarily,because,they,were,her,new-found,family,but,also,because,she'd,never,known,anyone,like,them,in,her,life,[END]
or,almost,never,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,maureen,with,brian,and,daniel,making,music,behind,her,helen,and,mary,kate,clapping,in,time,with,the,rhythm,she,was,setting,with,the,bones,and,for,a,moment,it,was,as,if,the,vivid,redheads,were,the,youthful,tarletons,come,back,to,life,[END]
the,twins,tall,and,handsome,the,girls,squirming,with,juvenile,impatience,to,move,on,to,the,next,adventure,life,held,for,them,[END]
scarlett,had,always,envied,the,tarleton,girls,their,free-and-easy,ways,with,their,mother,[END]
now,she,saw,the,same,easiness,between,maureen,and,her,children,[END]
and,she,knew,that,she,too,was,welcome,to,laugh,with,maureen,to,tease,and,be,teased,to,share,in,the,bounteous,affection,that,jamie's,wife,showered,on,everyone,around,her,[END]
at,that,moment,scarlett's,near-worship,of,her,serene,self-contained,mother,shivered,and,suffered,a,tiny,crack,and,she,began,to,free,herself,of,the,guilt,she'd,always,felt,because,she,couldn't,live,up,to,her,mother's,teachings,[END]
perhaps,it,was,all,right,if,she,wasn't,a,perfect,lady,[END]
the,idea,was,too,rich,too,complicated,[END]
she'd,think,about,it,later,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,think,about,anything,now,[END]
not,yesterday,not,tomorrow,[END]
the,only,thing,that,mattered,was,this,moment,and,the,happiness,it,held,the,music,and,singing,and,clapping,and,dancing,[END]
after,the,formal,rituals,of,charleston's,balls,the,spontaneous,home-made,pleasures,were,intoxicating,[END]
scarlett,breathed,deep,of,the,joy,and,laughter,around,her,and,it,giddied,her,[END]
matt's,daughter,peggy,showed,her,the,simplest,steps,of,the,reel,and,there,was,in,some,strange,way,a,rightness,to,learning,from,a,seven-year-old,child,[END]
and,a,rightness,to,the,outspoken,encouragement,and,even,the,teasing,of,the,others,adults,and,children,alike,because,it,was,the,same,for,peggy,as,it,was,for,her,[END]
she,danced,until,her,knees,were,wobbly,then,she,collapsed,laughing,in,a,heap,on,the,floor,at,old,james',feet,and,he,patted,her,head,as,if,she,were,a,puppy,and,that,made,her,laugh,all,the,more,until,she,was,gasping,for,breath,when,she,cried,out,i'm,having,so,much,fun,[END]
there,had,been,very,little,fun,in,scarlett's,life,and,she,wanted,it,to,last,forever,this,clean,uncomplicated,joyfulness,[END]
she,looked,at,her,big,happy,cousins,and,she,was,proud,of,their,strength,and,vigor,and,talent,for,music,and,for,life,[END]
we're,a,fine,lot,we,o'haras,[END]
there's,none,can,touch,us,[END]
scarlett,heard,her,father's,voice,boasting,saying,the,words,he,had,so,often,said,to,her,and,she,knew,for,the,first,time,what,he,had,meant,[END]
ah,jamie,what,a,wonderful,night,this,was,she,said,when,he,was,walking,her,home,[END]
scarlett,was,so,tired,she,was,practically,stumbling,but,she,was,chattering,like,a,magpie,too,exhilarated,to,accept,the,peaceful,silence,of,the,sleeping,city,[END]
we're,a,fine,lot,we,o'haras,[END]
jamie,laughed,[END]
his,strong,hands,caught,her,around,the,waist,and,he,lifted,her,up,and,swung,her,in,a,giddy,circle,[END]
there's,none,can,touch,us,he,said,when,he,set,her,down,[END]
miss,scarlett,[END]
miss,scarlett,[END]
pansy,woke,her,at,seven,with,a,message,from,her,grandfather,[END]
he,wants,you,right,this,minute,[END]
the,old,soldier,was,formally,dressed,and,fresh-shaven,[END]
he,looked,disapprovingly,at,scarlett's,hastily,combed,hair,and,dressing,gown,from,his,imperial,position,in,the,great,armchair,at,the,head,of,the,dining,room,table,[END]
my,breakfast,is,unsatisfactory,he,announced,[END]
scarlett,stared,at,him,slack-jawed,[END]
what,did,his,breakfast,have,to,do,with,her,[END]
did,he,think,she'd,cooked,it,[END]
maybe,he,had,lost,his,mind,[END]
like,pa,no,not,like,pa,pa,had,had,more,than,he,could,bear,that's,all,and,so,he,retreated,to,a,time,and,a,world,where,the,terrible',things,hadn't,happened,[END]
he,was,like,a,confused,child,[END]
but,there's,nothing,confused,or,child-like,about,grandfather,[END]
he,knows,exactly,where,and,who,he,is,and,what,he's,doing,[END]
what,does,he,mean,by,waking,me,up,after,only,a,couple,of,hours',sleep,and,complaining,to,me,about,his,breakfast,[END]
her,voice,was,carefully,calm,when,she,spoke,[END]
what's,wrong,with,your,breakfast,grandfather,[END]
it's,tasteless,and,it's,cold,[END]
why,don't,you,send,it,back,to,the,kitchen,then,[END]
tell,them,to,bring,what,you,want,and,make,sure,it's,hot,[END]
you,do,it,[END]
kitchens,are,women's,business,[END]
scarlett,put,her,hands,on,her,hips,[END]
she,looked,at,her,grandfather,with,eyes,as,steely,as,his,[END]
do,you,mean,to,tell,me,that,you,got,me,out,of,bed,to,send,a,message,to,your,cook,[END]
what,do,you,take,me,for,some,kind,of,servant,[END]
order,your,own,breakfast,or,starve,it's,all,the,same,to,me,[END]
i'm,going,back,to,bed,[END]
scarlett,turned,with,a,flounce,[END]
that,bed,belongs,to,me,young,woman,and,you,occupy,it,by,my,grace,and,favor,[END]
i,expect,you,to,obey,my,orders,as,long,as,you're,under,my,roof,[END]
she,was,in,a,fine,rage,now,all,hope,of,sleep,gone,[END]
i'll,pack,my,things,this,minute,she,thought,[END]
i,don't,have,to,put,up,with,this,[END]
the,seductive,aroma,of,fresh,coffee,stopped,her,before,she,spoke,[END]
she'd,have,coffee,first,then,tell,the,old,man,off,[END]
and,she'd,better,think,a,minute,[END]
she,wasn't,ready,to,leave,savannah,yet,[END]
rhett,must,know,by,now,that,she,was,here,[END]
and,she,should,get,a,message,about,tara,from,the,mother,superior,any,minute,[END]
scarlett,walked,to,the,bell,pull,by,the,door,[END]
then,she,took,a,chair,at,her,grandfather's,right,[END]
when,jerome,came,in,she,glared,at,him,[END]
give,me,a,cup,for,my,coffee,[END]
then,take,this,plate,away,[END]
what,is,it,grandfather,cornmeal,mush,[END]
whatever,it,is,jerome,tell,the,cook,to,eat,it,herself,[END]
after,she,fixes,some,scrambled,eggs,and,ham,and,bacon,and,grits,and,biscuits,[END]
with,plenty,of,butter,[END]
and,i'll,have,a,pitcher,of,thick,cream,for,my,coffee,right,this,minute,[END]
jerome,looked,at,the,erect,old,man,silently,urging,him,to,put,scarlett,in,her,place,[END]
pierre,robillard,looked,straight,ahead,not,meeting,his,butler's,eyes,[END]
don't,stand,there,like,a,statue,scarlett,snapped,[END]
do,as,you're,told,[END]
she,was,hungry,[END]
so,was,her,grandfather,[END]
although,the,meal,was,as,silent,as,his,birthday,dinner,had,been,this,time,he,ate,everything,that,was,brought,to,him,[END]
scarlett,watched,him,suspiciously,from,the,corner,of,her,eye,[END]
what,was,he,up,to,the,old,fox,[END]
she,couldn't,believe,that,there,wasn't,something,behind,this,charade,[END]
in,her,experience,getting,what,you,wanted,from,servants,was,the,easiest,thing,in,the,world,[END]
all,you,had,to,do,was,shout,at,them,[END]
and,lord,knows,grandfather's,good,at,terrifying,people,[END]
look,at,aunt,pauline,and,aunt,eulalie,[END]
look,at,me,for,that,matter,[END]
i,hopped,out,of,bed,quick,enough,when,he,sent,for,me,[END]
i'll,not,do,that,again,[END]
the,old,man,dropped,his,napkin,by,his,empty,plate,[END]
i'll,expect,you,to,be,suitably,dressed,for,future,meals,he,said,to,scarlett,[END]
we,shall,leave,the,house,in,precisely,one,hour,and,seven,minutes,to,go,to,church,[END]
that,should,provide,adequate,time,for,your,grooming,[END]
scarlett,hadn't,intended,to,go,to,church,at,all,now,that,her,aunts,weren't,there,to,expect,it,and,she'd,gotten,what,she,wanted,from,the,mother,superior,[END]
but,her,grandfather's,high-handedness,had,to,be,stopped,[END]
he,was,violently,anti-catholic,according,to,her,aunts,[END]
i,didn't,know,you,attended,mass,grandfather,she,said,[END]
sweetness,dripped,from,the,words,[END]
pierre,robillard's,thick,white,brows,met,in,a,beetling,frown,[END]
you,do,not,subscribe,to,that,papist,idiocy,like,your,aunts,i,hope,[END]
i'm,a,good,catholic,if,that's,what,you,mean,[END]
and,i'm,going,to,mass,with,my,cousins,the,o'haras,[END]
who,by,the,way,have,invited,me,to,come,stay,with,them,any,time,i,want,for,as,long,as,i,like,[END]
scarlett,stood,and,marched,in,triumph,from,the,room,[END]
she,was,halfway,up,the,stairs,before,she,remembered,that,she,shouldn't,have,eaten,anything,before,mass,[END]
no,matter,[END]
she,didn't,have,to,take,communion,if,she,didn't,want,to,[END]
and,she'd,certainly,showed,grandfather,[END]
when,she,reached,her,room,she,did,a,few,steps,of,the,reel,that,she'd,learned,the,night,before,[END]
she,didn't,for,a,minute,believe,that,the,old,man,would,call,her,bluff,about,staying,with,her,cousins,[END]
much,as,she,loved,going,to,the,o'haras',for,music,and,dancing,there,were,far,too,many,children,there,to,make,a,visit,possible,[END]
besides,they,didn't,have,any,servants,[END]
she,couldn't,get,dressed,without,pansy,to,lace,her,stays,and,fix,her,hair,[END]
i,wonder,what,he's,really,up,to,she,thought,again,[END]
then,she,shrugged,[END]
she'd,probably,find,out,soon,enough,[END]
it,wasn't,really,important,[END]
before,he,came,out,with,it,rhett,would,probably,have,come,for,her,anyhow,[END]
40,[END]
one,hour,and,four,minutes,after,scarlett,went,up,to,her,room,pierre,auguste,robillard,soldier,of,napoleon,left,his,beautiful,shrine,of,a,house,to,go,to,church,[END]
he,wore,a,heavy,overcoat,and,a,wool,scarf,and,his,thin,white,hair,was,covered,with,a,tall,hat,made,of,sable,that,had,once,belonged,to,a,russian,officer,who,died,at,borodino,[END]
despite,the,bright,sun,and,the,promise,of,spring,in,the,air,the,old,man's,thin,body,was,cold,[END]
still,he,walked,stiffly,erect,seldom,using,the,malacca,cane,he,carried,[END]
he,nodded,in,a,correct,abbreviated,bow,to,the,people,who,greeted,him,on,the,street,[END]
he,was,very,well,known,in,savannah,[END]
at,the,independent,presbyterian,church,on,chippewa,square,he,took,his,place,in,the,fifth,pew,from,the,front,the,place,that,had,been,his,ever,since,the,gala,dedication,of,the,church,nearly,sixty,years,earlier,[END]
james,monroe,then,president,of,the,united,states,had,been,at,the,dedication,and,had,asked,to,be,introduced,to,the,man,who,had,been,with,napoleon,from,austerlitz,to,waterloo,[END]
pierre,robillard,had,been,gracious,to,the,older,man,even,though,a,president,was,nothing,impressive,to,a,man,who,had,fought,alongside,an,emperor,[END]
when,the,service,ended,he,had,a,few,words,with,several,men,who,responded,to,his,gesture,and,hurried,to,join,him,on,the,steps,of,the,church,[END]
he,asked,a,few,questions,listened,to,a,great,many,answers,[END]
then,he,went,home,his,stern,face,almost,smiling,to,nap,until,dinner,was,served,to,him,on,a,tray,[END]
the,weekly,outing,to,church,grew,more,tiring,all,the,time,[END]
he,slept,lightly,as,the,very,old,do,and,woke,before,jerome,brought,his,tray,[END]
while,he,waited,for,it,he,thought,about,scarlett,[END]
he,had,no,curiosity,about,her,life,or,her,nature,[END]
he,hadn't,given,her,a,thought,for,many,years,and,when,she,appeared,in,his,room,with,his,daughters,he,was,neither,pleased,nor,displeased,to,see,her,[END]
she,caught,his,attention,only,when,jerome,complained,to,him,about,her,[END]
she,was,causing,disruption,in,the,kitchen,with,her,demands,jerome,said,[END]
and,she,would,cause,monsieur,robillard's,death,if,she,continued,to,insist,on,adding,butter,and,gravy,and,sweets,to,his,bills,[END]
she,was,the,answer,to,the,old,man's,prayer,[END]
he,had,nothing,to,look,forward,to,in,his,life,except,more,months,or,years,of,the,unchanging,routine,of,sleep,and,meals,and,the,weekly,excursion,to,church,[END]
it,did,not,disturb,him,that,his,life,was,so,featureless,he,had,his,beloved,wife's,likeness,before,his,eyes,and,the,certainty,that,in,due,time,he,would,be,reunited,with,her,after,death,[END]
he,spent,the,days,and,nights,dreaming,of,her,when,he,slept,and,turning,memories,of,her,in,his,mind,when,he,was,awake,[END]
it,was,enough,for,him,[END]
almost,[END]
he,did,miss,having,good,food,to,eat,and,in,recent,years,it,had,been,tasteless,cold,when,it,wasn't,burnt,and,of,a,deadly,monotony,[END]
he,wanted,scarlett,to,change,that,[END]
her,suspicions,of,the,old,man's,motives,were,unfounded,[END]
pierre,robillard,had,recognized,the,bully,in,her,at,once,[END]
he,wanted,it,to,function,in,his,behalf,now,that,he,no,longer,had,the,strength,to,get,what,he,wanted,for,himself,[END]
the,servants,knew,that,he,was,too,old,and,tired,to,dominate,them,[END]
but,scarlett,was,young,and,strong,[END]
he,didn't,seek,her,companionship,or,her,love,[END]
he,wanted,her,to,run,his,house,the,way,he,had,once,run,it,himself,which,meant,in,accordance,with,his,standards,and,subject,to,his,dominance,[END]
he,needed,to,find,a,way,to,accomplish,that,and,so,he,thought,about,her,[END]
tell,my,granddaughter,to,come,here,he,said,when,jerome,came,in,[END]
she,ain't,home,yet,said,the,old,butler,with,a,smile,[END]
he,anticipated,the,old,man's,anger,with,delight,[END]
jerome,hated,scarlett,[END]
scarlett,was,at,the,big,city,market,with,the,o'haras,[END]
after,the,confrontation,with,her,grandfather,she,had,dressed,dismissed,pansy,and,escaped,through,the,garden,to,hurry,unaccompanied,the,two,short,blocks,to,jamie's,house,[END]
i've,come,to,have,company,going,to,mass,she,told,maureen,but,her,real,reason,was,to,be,someplace,where,people,were,nice,to,one,another,[END]
after,mass,the,men,went,in,one,direction,the,women,and,children,in,another,[END]
they'll,have,a,haircut,and,a,gossip,in,the,barber,shop,at,the,pulaski,house,hotel,maureen,told,scarlett,[END]
and,most,likely,a,pint,or,two,in,the,saloon,[END]
it's,better,than,a,newspaper,for,hearing,what's,going,on,[END]
we'll,get,our,own,news,at,the,market,while,i,buy,some,oysters,for,a,nice,pie,[END]
savannah's,city,market,had,the,same,purpose,and,the,same,excitement,as,the,market,in,charleston,[END]
until,she,was,back,in,the,familiar,hubbub,of,bargaining,and,buying,and,friends,greeting,friends,scarlett,hadn't,realized,how,much,she'd,missed,it,when,the,season,took,precedence,for,women's,time,[END]
she,wished,now,that,she'd,taken,pansy,with,her,after,all,she,could,have,filled,a,basket,with,the,exotic,fruits,that,came,in,through,savannah's,busy,seaport,if,only,she'd,had,her,maid,to,carry,it,[END]
mary,kate,and,helen,were,doing,that,chore,for,the,o'hara,women,[END]
scarlett,let,them,carry,some,oranges,for,her,[END]
and,she,insisted,on,paying,for,the,coffee,and,caramel,rolls,they,all,had,at,one,of,the,stands,[END]
still,she,refused,when,maureen,invited,her,to,come,home,for,dinner,with,them,[END]
she,hadn't,told,her,grandfather's,cook,that,she,wouldn't,be,at,the,house,[END]
and,she,wanted,to,catch,up,on,the,sleep,she'd,missed,[END]
it,wouldn't,do,to,look,like,death,warmed,over,if,rhett,came,in,on,the,afternoon,train,[END]
she,kissed,maureen,goodbye,at,the,robillard,doorstep,called,goodbye,to,the,others,[END]
they,were,almost,a,block,behind,slowed,down,by,the,unsteady,steps,of,the,little,children,and,patricia's,burdened,by,pregnancy,pace,[END]
helen,ran,up,with,a,bulging,paper,sack,[END]
don't,forget,your,oranges,cousin,scarlett,[END]
i'll,take,that,miss,scarlett,[END]
it,was,jerome,[END]
oh,[END]
all,right,[END]
here,[END]
you,shouldn't,be,so,quiet,jerome,you,gave,me,a,shock,[END]
i,didn't,hear,the,door,open,[END]
i've,been,looking,out,for,you,[END]
mr,robillard,he,wants,you,[END]
jerome,looked,at,the,straggle,of,o'haras,with,unconcealed,disdain,[END]
scarlett's,chin,stiffened,[END]
something,was,going,to,have,to,be,done,about,the,butler's,impertinence,[END]
she,sailed,into,her,grandfather's,room,with,an,angry,complaint,on,her,lips,[END]
pierre,robillard,gave,her,no,time,to,speak,[END]
you,are,dishevelled,he,said,coldly,and,you,have,ruptured,the,schedule,of,my,house,[END]
while,you,were,consorting,with,those,irish,peasants,the,dinner,hour,has,passed,[END]
scarlett,leapt,hotly,to,the,bait,[END]
i'll,thank,you,to,keep,a,civil,tongue,when,you,refer,to,my,cousins,[END]
the,old,man's,eyelids,half,hid,the,gleam,in,his,eyes,[END]
what,do,you,call,a,man,who's,in,trade,[END]
he,said,quietly,[END]
if,you're,talking,about,jamie,o'hara,i,call,him,a,successful,hard-working,businessman,and,i,respect,him,for,what,he's,accomplished,[END]
her,grandfather,set,the,hook,[END]
and,no,doubt,you,admire,his,garish,wife,too,[END]
indeed,i,do,[END]
she's,a,kind,and,generous,woman,[END]
i,believe,that's,the,impression,her,trade,tries,to,make,[END]
you,are,aware,are,you,not,that,she,was,a,barmaid,in,an,irish,saloon,[END]
scarlett,gasped,like,a,landed,fish,[END]
it,couldn't,be,true,[END]
unwelcome,pictures,filled,her,mind,[END]
maureen,holding,up,her,glass,for,another,whiskey,[END]
playing,the,bones,and,singing,lustily,all,the,verses,of,bawdy,songs,[END]
brushing,her,tousled,bright,hair,off,her,red,face,without,trying,to,pin,it,back,up,[END]
lifting,her,skirts,to,her,knees,to,dance,the,reel,[END]
common,[END]
maureen,was,common,[END]
they,were,all,kind,of,common,[END]
scarlett,felt,like,crying,[END]
she'd,been,so,happy,with,the,o'haras,she,didn't,want,to,lose,them,[END]
but,[END]
here,in,this,house,where,her,mother,had,grown,up,the,gulf,between,robillard,and,o'hara,was,too,broad,to,ignore,[END]
no,wonder,grandfather's,ashamed,of,me,[END]
mother,would,be,heartbroken,if,she,could,see,me,walking,on,the,street,with,a,bunch,like,i,just,came,home,with,[END]
a,woman,in,public,without,so,much,as,a,shawl,over,her,pregnant,belly,and,a,million,children,running,all,over,the,place,like,wild,indians,and,not,even,a,maid,to,carry,the,shopping,[END]
i,must,have,looked,as,trashy,as,the,rest,of,them,[END]
and,mother,tried,so,hard,to,teach,me,to,be,a,lady,[END]
she'd,be,happy,she,was,dead,if,she,knew,that,her,daughter,was,friends,with,a,woman,who,worked,in,a,saloon,[END]
scarlett,looked,anxiously,at,the,old,man,[END]
could,he,possibly,know,about,the,building,she,owned,in,atlanta,and,rented,to,a,saloonkeeper,[END]
pierre,robillard's,eyes,were,closed,[END]
he,seemed,to,have,slipped,into,the,sudden,sleep,of,old,age,[END]
scarlett,tiptoed,out,of,the,room,[END]
when,she,closed,the,door,behind,her,the,old,soldier,smiled,then,went,to,sleep,[END]
jerome,brought,her,the,mail,on,a,silver,tray,[END]
he,was,wearing,white,gloves,[END]
scarlett,took,the,envelopes,from,the,tray,a,short,nod,her,only,thank,you,[END]
it,wouldn't,do,to,show,her,gratification,not,if,she,was,going,to,keep,jerome,in,his,place,[END]
the,previous,evening,after,waiting,for,an,eternity,in,the,drawing,room,for,rhett,who,never,showed,up,she,had,given,the,servants,a,tongue-lashing,they'd,never,forget,[END]
jerome,in,particular,[END]
it,was,a,godsend,that,the,butler,was,so,nearly,impertinent,she,needed,someone,to,unload,her,anger,and,disappointment,on,[END]
uncle,henry,hamilton,was,furious,that,she'd,transferred,the,money,to,the,savannah,bank,[END]
too,bad,[END]
scarlett,crumpled,up,his,brief,letter,and,dropped,it,on,the,floor,[END]
the,fat,envelope,was,from,aunt,pauline,[END]
her,meandering,complaints,could,wait,and,they,were,sure,to,be,complaints,[END]
scarlett,opened,the,stiff,square,envelope,next,[END]
she,didn't,recognize,the,handwriting,on,the,front,[END]
it,was,an,invitation,[END]
the,name,was,unfamiliar,and,she,had,to,think,hard,before,she,remembered,[END]
of,course,[END]
hodgson,was,the,married,name,of,one,of,those,old,ladies,the,telfair,sisters,[END]
the,invitation,was,for,a,ceremony,of,dedication,for,hodgson,hall,with,a,reception,to,follow,[END]
new,home,of,the,georgia,historical,society,[END]
it,sounded,even,deadlier,than,that,awful,musicale,[END]
scarlett,made,a,face,and,put,the,invitation,aside,[END]
she'd,have,to,find,some,letter,paper,and,send,her,regrets,[END]
the,aunts,liked,to,be,bored,to,death,but,not,she,[END]
the,aunts,[END]
might,as,well,get,it,over,with,[END]
she,tore,open,pauline's,letter,[END]
profoundly,ashamed,of,your,outrageous,behavior,[END]
if,we,had,known,that,you,were,coming,with,us,to,savannah,without,so,much,as,a,word,of,explanation,to,eleanor,butler,we,would,have,insisted,that,you,leave,the,train,and,go,back,[END]
what,the,devil,was,aunt,pauline,saying,[END]
was,it,possible,that,miss,eleanor,didn't,mention,the,note,i,left,for,her,[END]
or,that,she,didn't,get,it,[END]
no,it,wasn't,possible,[END]
aunt,pauline,was,just,making,trouble,[END]
scarlet's,eyes,moved,quickly,over,pauline's,complaints,about,the,folly,of,scarlett's,travelling,after,her,ordeal,when,the,boat,capsized,and,about,scarlett's,unnatural,reticence,in,not,telling,her,aunts,that,she'd,been,in,the,accident,[END]
why,couldn't,pauline,tell,her,what,she,wanted,to,know,[END]
there,wasn't,a,word,about,rhett,[END]
she,went,through,page,after,page,of,pauline's,spiky,handwriting,looking,for,his,name,[END]
god's,nightgown,[END]
her,aunt,could,lecture,longer,than,a,hellfire,preacher,[END]
there,[END]
at,last,[END]
dear,eleanor,is,understandably,concerned,that,rhett,felt,it,necessary,to,travel,all,the,way,to,boston,for,the,meeting,about,his,fertilizer,shipments,[END]
he,should,not,have,gone,to,the,chill,of,the,northern,climate,immeolately,after,the,ordeal,of,his,long,immersion,in,cold,waterfrllowing,the,capsing,of,his,boat,[END]
scarlett,let,the,pages,fall,into,her,lap,[END]
of,course,[END]
oh,thank,god,[END]
that's,why,rhett,hadn't,come,after,her,yet,[END]
why,didn't,uncle,henry,tell,me,rhett's,telegram,came,from,boston,[END]
then,i,wouldn't,have,driven,myself,crazy,expecting,him,to,show,up,on,the,doorstep,any,minute,[END]
does,aunt,pauline,say,when,he's,coming,back,[END]
scarlett,pawed,through,the,jumble,of,letter,sheets,[END]
where,had,she,stopped,[END]
she,found,her,place,and,read,eagerly,to,the,end,[END]
but,there,was,no,mention,of,what,she,wanted,to,know,[END]
now,what,am,i,going,to,do,[END]
rhett,might,be,gone,for,weeks,[END]
or,he,might,be,on,his,way,back,right,this,very,minute,[END]
scarlett,picked,up,the,invitation,from,mrs,hodgson,again,[END]
at,least,it,would,be,someplace,to,go,[END]
she'd,have,a,screaming,fit,if,she,had,to,stay,in,this,house,day,after,day,[END]
if,only,she,could,run,over,to,jamie's,every,now,and,then,just,for,a,cup,of,tea,[END]
but,no,that,was,unthinkable,[END]
and,yet,she,couldn't,not,think,of,the,o'haras,[END]
the,next,morning,she,went,with,the,sullen,cook,to,the,city,market,to,supervise,what,she,bought,and,how,much,she,paid,for,it,[END]
with,nothing,else,to,occupy,her,scarlett,was,determined,to,see,her,grandfather's,house,in,order,[END]
while,she,was,having,coffee,she,heard,a,soft,hesitant,voice,speak,her,name,[END]
it,was,lovely,shy,young,kathleen,[END]
i'm,not,familiar,with,all,the,american,fishes,she,said,[END]
will,you,help,me,choose,the,best,prawns,[END]
scarlett,was,bewildered,until,the,girl,gestured,toward,the,shrimp,[END]
the,angels,must,have,sent,you,scarlett,kathleen,said,when,her,purchase,was,made,[END]
i'd,be,lost,for,sure,without,you,[END]
maureen,wants,only,the,best,[END]
we're,expecting,colum,you,see,[END]
colum,am,i,supposed,to,know,him,[END]
maureen,or,somebody,mentioned,that,name,once,too,[END]
why's,colum,so,important,[END]
kathleen's,blue,eyes,widened,in,amazement,that,the,question,could,be,asked,[END]
why,[END]
well,[END]
because,colum's,colum,that's,all,[END]
he's,[END]
she,couldn't,find,the,words,she,was,looking,for,[END]
he's,just,colum,that's,all,[END]
he,brought,me,here,don't,you,know,[END]
he's,my,brother,like,stephen,[END]
stephen,[END]
the,quiet,dark,one,[END]
scarlett,hadn't,realized,he,was,kathleen's,brother,[END]
maybe,that's,why,he's,so,quiet,[END]
maybe,they're,all,shy,as,mice,in,that,family,[END]
which,one,of,uncle,james',brothers,is,your,father,[END]
she,asked,kathleen,[END]
ah,but,my,father's,dead,god,rest,his,soul,[END]
was,the,girl,simple,[END]
what,was,his,name,kathleen,[END]
oh,it's,his,name,you're,wanting,to,know,[END]
patrick,that,was,his,name,patrick,o'hara,[END]
patricia's,called,after,him,being,jamie's,firstborn,and,patrick,his,own,father's,name,[END]
scarlett's,forehead,creased,in,concentration,[END]
so,jamie,was,kathleen's,brother,too,[END]
so,much,for,thinking,the,whole,family,was,shy,[END]
do,you,have,any,other,brothers,[END]
she,asked,[END]
oh,yes,kathleen,said,with,a,happy,smile,brothers,and,sisters,too,[END]
fourteen,of,us,all,told,[END]
still,living,i,mean,[END]
and,she,crossed,herself,[END]
scarlett,drew,away,from,the,girl,[END]
oh,lord,more,than,likely,the,cook's,been,listening,and,it'll,get,back,to,grandfather,[END]
i,can,hear,him,now,[END]
talking,about,catholics,breeding,like,rabbits,[END]
but,in,fact,pierre,robillard,made,no,mention,at,all,of,scarlett's,cousins,[END]
he,summoned,her,for,a,presupper,visit,announced,that,his,bills,were,proving,satisfactory,then,dismissed,her,[END]
she,stopped,jerome,to,check,over,the,supper,tray,examined,the,silver,to,see,that,it,was,gleaming,and,free,of,fingerprints,[END]
when,she,put,the,coffee,spoon,down,it,tapped,against,the,soup,spoon,[END]
i,wonder,if,maureen,would,teach,me,to,play,the,spoons,[END]
the,thought,caught,her,off,guard,[END]
that,night,she,dreamed,about,her,father,[END]
she,woke,in,the,morning,with,a,smile,still,on,her,lips,but,her,cheeks,stiff,with,the,dried,streaks,of,tears,[END]
at,the,city,market,she,heard,maureen,o'hara's,distinctive,gusty,laughter,just,in,time,to,dart,behind,one,of,the,thick,brick,piers,and,miss,being,seen,[END]
but,she,could,see,maureen,and,patricia,looking,as,big,as,a,house,and,a,straggle,of,children,behind,them,[END]
your,father's,the,only,one,of,us,not,in,a,fever,for,your,uncle,to,arrive,she,heard,maureen,say,[END]
he's,enjoying,the,special,treats,i,fix,for,supper,every,night,in,hopes,of,colum,[END]
i'd,like,a,special,treat,myself,scarlett,thought,rebelliously,[END]
i'm,getting,mighty,tired,of,food,soft,enough,for,grandfather,[END]
she,turned,on,the,cook,[END]
get,some,chicken,too,she,ordered,and,fry,up,a,couple,of,pieces,for,my,dinner,[END]
her,bad,mood,cleared,up,long,before,dinner,however,[END]
when,she,got,back,to,the,house,there,was,a,note,from,the,mother,superior,[END]
the,bishop,was,going,to,consider,scarlett's,request,to,allow,her,to,buy,back,carreen's,dowry,[END]
tara,[END]
i'm,going,to,get,tara,[END]
so,busy,was,her,mind,with,planning,tara's,rebirth,that,she,didn't,notice,the,time,passing,at,all,nor,was,she,conscious,of,what,was,on,her,plate,at,mealtime,[END]
she,could,see,it,so,clearly,in,her,mind,[END]
the,house,gleaming,fresh,white,on,top,of,the,hill,the,clipped,lawn,green,so,green,and,thick,with,clover,the,pasture,shimmering,green,with,its,deep,satiny,grass,bending,before,the,breeze,unrolling,like,a,carpet,down,the,hill,and,into,the,mysterious,shadowy,dark,green,of,the,pines,that,bordered,the,river,and,hid,it,from,view,[END]
spring,with,clouds,of,tender,dogwood,blossoms,and,the,heady,scent,of,wisteria,then,summer,the,crisp,starched,white,curtains,billowing,from,the,open,windows,the,thick,sweetness,of,honeysuckle,flowing,through,them,into,all,the,rooms,all,restored,to,their,dreaming,polished,quiet,perfection,[END]
yes,summer,was,the,best,[END]
the,long,lazy,georgia,summer,when,twilight,lasted,for,hours,and,lightning,bugs,signalled,in,the,slow,thickening,darkness,[END]
then,the,stars,fat,and,close,in,the,velvet,sky,or,a,moon,round,and,white,as,white,as,the,sleeping,house,it,lit,on,the,dark,gently,rising,hill,[END]
summer,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,widened,[END]
that,was,it,[END]
why,hadn't,she,realized,it,before,[END]
of,course,[END]
summer,when,she,loved,tara,most,summer,was,when,rhett,couldn't,go,to,dunmore,landing,because,of,the,fever,[END]
it,was,perfect,[END]
they'd,spend,october,to,june,in,charleston,with,the,season,to,break,the,monotony,of,all,those,stuffy,boring,tea,parties,and,the,promise,of,summer,at,tara,to,break,the,monotony,of,the,season,[END]
she,could,bear,it,she,knew,she,could,[END]
as,long,as,there,was,the,long,summer,at,tara,[END]
oh,if,only,the,bishop,would,hurry,[END]
41,[END]
pierre,robillard,escorted,scarlett,to,the,dedication,ceremonies,at,hodgson,hall,[END]
he,was,an,imposing,figure,in,his,old-fashioned,dress,suit,with,its,satin,knee,breeches,and,velvet,tailcoat,the,tiny,red,rosette,of,the,legion,of,honor,in,his,buttonhole,and,a,broad,diagonal,red,sash,across,his,chest,[END]
scarlett,had,never,seen,anyone,look,quite,so,distinguished,and,aristocratic,as,her,grandfather,[END]
he,could,be,proud,of,her,too,she,thought,[END]
her,pearls,and,diamonds,were,of,the,first,water,and,her,gown,was,magnificent,a,shining,column,of,gold,brocaded,silk,trimmed,with,gold,lace,and,a,gold,brocaded,train,that,was,a,full,four,feet,long,[END]
she'd,never,had,a,chance,to,wear,it,because,she'd,had,to,dress,so,dowdy,in,charleston,[END]
how,lucky,after,all,that,she'd,had,all,those,clothes,made,before,she,went,to,charleston,[END]
why,there,were,a,half,dozen,dresses,that,had,hardly,been,on,her,back,[END]
even,without,the,trim,that,rhett,had,taunted,her,into,removing,they,were,much,prettier,than,anything,she'd,seen,on,anybody,in,savannah,[END]
scarlett,was,preening,as,jerome,handed,her,up,into,the,hired,carriage,to,sit,across,from,her,grandfather,[END]
the,ride,to,the,south,end,of,town,was,silent,[END]
pierre,robillard's,white-crowned,head,nodded,half-sleeping,[END]
it,jerked,upright,when,scarlett,exclaimed,oh,look,[END]
there,were,crowds,of,people,on,the,street,outside,the,iron-fenced,classical,building,there,to,watch,the,arrival,of,savannah's,elite,society,[END]
just,like,the,saint,cecilia,[END]

she,could,hear,murmurs,of,admiration,from,the,crowds,[END]
while,her,grandfather,slowly,stepped,down,to,join,her,she,bobbed,her,head,to,set,her,earbobs,flashing,in,the,lamplight,and,cast,her,train,from,over,her,arm,to,spread,out,behind,her,for,her,entrance,up,the,tall,red-carpeted,steps,to,the,hall's,door,[END]
ooooh,she,heard,from,the,crowd,and,aaah,beautiful,who,is,she,[END]
as,she,extended,her,white-gloved,hand,to,rest,on,her,grandfather's,velvet,sleeve,a,familiar,voice,called,out,clearly,katie,scarlett,darling,you're,as,dazzling,as,the,queen,of,sheba,[END]
she,looked,quickly,in,a,panic,to,her,left,then,even,more,quickly,turned,away,from,jamie,and,his,brood,as,if,she,didn't,know,them,and,proceeded,at,pierre,robillard's,slow,stately,pace,to,mount,the,stairs,[END]
but,the,picture,was,seared,into,her,mind,[END]

another,man,stood,at,his,right,side,illuminated,by,the,street,lamp,[END]
he,was,only,as,tall,as,jamie's,shoulder,and,his,overcoated,figure,was,thick,stocky,a,dark,block,[END]
his,florid,round,face,was,bright,his,eyes,flashing,blue,and,his,uncovered,head,a,halo,of,silver,curls,[END]
he,was,the,very,image,of,gerald,o'hara,scarlett's,pa,[END]

scarlett,sought,instinctively,for,some,shadow,[END]
old,[END]
they,all,look,so,old,[END]
she,felt,panicky,as,if,somehow,she,was,aging,rapidly,as,if,old,age,were,a,contagion,[END]
her,thirtieth,birthday,had,come,and,gone,unnoticed,while,she,was,in,charleston,but,now,she,was,acutely,aware,of,it,[END]
everyone,knew,that,once,a,woman,was,thirty,she,just,as,well,be,dead,[END]
thirty,was,so,old,that,she'd,never,believed,it,could,happen,to,her,[END]
it,couldn't,be,true,[END]
scarlett,said,her,grandfather,[END]
he,held,her,arm,above,the,elbow,and,propelled,her,toward,the,receiving,line,[END]
his,fingers,were,cold,as,death,she,could,feel,the,cold,through,the,thin,leather,of,the,glove,that,covered,her,arm,almost,to,her,shoulder,[END]

i,can't,shake,all,those,dead,cold,hands,and,smile,and,say,i'm,happy,to,be,here,[END]
i've,got,to,get,away,[END]

you,are,not,permitted,to,feel,ill,he,said,[END]
stand,straight,and,do,what's,expected,of,you,[END]
you,may,leave,after,the,ceremony,of,dedication,not,before,[END]
scarlett,stiffened,her,spine,and,stepped,forward,[END]
what,a,monster,her,grandfather,was,[END]
no,wonder,that,she'd,never,heard,her,mother,say,much,about,him,there,was,nothing,nice,to,say,[END]
good,evening,mrs,hodgson,she,said,[END]
i'm,so,happy,to,be,here,[END]
pierre,robillard's,progress,along,the,lengthy,receiving,line,was,much,slower,than,scarlett's,[END]
he,was,still,bowing,stiffly,over,the,hand,of,a,lady,halfway,along,when,scarlett,was,finished,[END]
she,pushed,her,way,through,a,group,of,people,and,hurried,to,the,door,[END]
outside,she,gulped,the,crisp,air,with,desperation,[END]
then,she,ran,[END]
her,train,glittered,in,the,lamplight,on,the,stairs,on,the,gala,red,carpet,stretching,up,behind,her,as,if,it,were,floating,free,in,the,air,[END]
the,robillard,carriage,[END]
quickly,[END]
she,begged,the,attendant,[END]
responding,to,her,urgency,he,ran,to,the,corner,[END]
scarlett,ran,after,him,heedless,of,her,train,on,the,rough,bricks,of,the,sidewalk,[END]
she,had,to,get,away,before,anyone,could,stop,her,[END]
when,she,was,safely,inside,the,carriage,she,breathed,in,short,gasps,[END]

i'll,show,you,which,house,[END]

she,could,hear,the,music,and,laughter,through,the,door,to,maureen's,kitchen,[END]
her,two,fists,beat,on,it,until,jamie,opened,it,[END]
it's,scarlett,[END]
he,said,with,pleased,surprise,[END]
come,in,scarlett,darling,and,meet,colum,[END]
he's,here,at,last,the,best,of,all,the,o'haras,saving,only,yourself,[END]
now,that,he,was,close,to,her,scarlett,could,see,that,colum,was,years,younger,than,jamie,and,not,really,all,that,much,like,her,father,except,for,his,round,face,and,short,stature,among,his,taller,cousins,and,nephews,[END]
colum's,blue,eyes,were,darker,more,serious,and,his,round,chin,had,a,firmness,that,scarlett,had,seen,on,her,father's,face,only,when,he,was,on,horseback,commanding,his,mount,to,take,a,jump,higher,than,sanity,allowed,[END]
colum,smiled,when,jamie,introduced,them,and,his,eyes,were,almost,lost,in,a,network,of,creases,[END]
yet,the,warmth,gleaming,from,them,made,scarlett,feel,that,meeting,her,was,the,happiest,experience,of,his,entire,life,[END]
and,are,we,not,the,luckiest,family,on,the,face,of,the,earth,to,have,such,a,creature,one,of,us,[END]
he,said,[END]
it,only,wants,a,tiara,to,complete,your,gold,splendor,scarlett,darling,[END]
if,the,queen,of,the,fairies,could,see,you,wouldn't,she,tear,her,spangled,wings,to,ribbons,in,envy,[END]
let,the,little,girls,have,a,look,maureen,it,will,give,them,something,to,aspire,to,to,grow,up,as,breathtaking,as,their,cousin,[END]
scarlett,dimpled,with,pleasure,[END]
i,believe,i'm,hearing,the,famous,irish,blarney,she,said,[END]
not,a,bit,of,it,[END]
i,wish,only,that,i,had,the,gift,of,poetry,to,say,all,i'm,thinking,[END]
jamie,hit,his,brother,on,the,shoulder,[END]
you're,not,doing,too,badly,for,all,that,you,rogue,[END]

i'll,fetch,her,a,glass,[END]
colum,found,us,a,keg,of,real,irish,ale,on,his,travels,scarlett,darling,[END]
you,must,have,a,taste,[END]
jamie,spoke,name,and,endearment,the,way,colum,did,as,if,they,made,one,word,scarlettdarling,[END]
oh,no,thank,you,she,said,automatically,[END]
then,why,not,[END]
i've,never,tasted,ale,[END]
she,would,have,had,champagne,without,thinking,anything,of,it,[END]
the,dark,foamy,brew,was,bitter,and,she,made,a,face,[END]
colum,took,the,mug,from,her,[END]
she,adds,to,her,perfection,with,every,second,that,passes,he,said,even,to,leaving,all,the,drink,for,those,with,the,bigger,thirst,[END]
his,eyes,smiled,at,her,over,the,rim,when,he,drank,[END]
scarlett,returned,the,smile,[END]
it,was,impossible,not,to,[END]
as,the,evening,wore,on,she,noticed,that,everyone,smiled,at,colum,a,lot,as,if,reflecting,his,pleasure,[END]
he,was,clearly,enjoying,himself,so,much,[END]
he,was,leaning,back,in,a,straight,chair,tipped,to,rest,against,the,wall,near,the,fire,waving,his,hand,to,direct,and,encourage,jamie's,fiddling,and,maureen's,rat-tat-tat,with,the,bones,[END]
his,boots,were,off,and,his,stockinged,feet,fairly,danced,on,the,rungs,of,the,chair,[END]
he,was,the,picture,of,a,man,at,his,ease,even,his,collar,was,off,and,the,neck,of,his,shirt,was,open,so,that,his,laughter,could,vibrate,in,his,throat,[END]
tell,us,colum,about,your,travels,someone,would,urge,from,time,to,time,but,colum,always,put,them,off,[END]
he,needed,music,he,said,and,a,glass,to,refresh,his,shirt,and,his,dusty,throat,[END]
tomorrow,was,time,enough,for,talking,[END]
scarlett's,heart,too,was,refreshed,by,the,music,[END]
but,she,couldn't,stay,very,long,[END]
she,had,to,be,home,and,in,bed,before,her,grandfather,returned,[END]
i,hope,the,driver,keeps,his,promise,and,doesn't,tell,him,he,brought,me,here,[END]
grandfather,wouldn't,care,two,pins,how,much,i,needed,to,get,away,from,that,mausoleum,and,have,a,little,fun,[END]
she,barely,made,it,[END]
jamie,was,hardly,out,of,sight,when,the,carriage,rolled,up,to,the,door,[END]
she,ran,up,the,stairs,with,her,slippers,in,her,hand,and,her,train,bunched,up,under,her,arm,[END]
she,pressed,her,lips,together,to,keep,from,giggling,[END]
playing,truant,was,fun,when,you,got,away,with,it,[END]
but,she,didn't,get,away,with,it,[END]
her,grandfather,never,learned,what,she,had,done,but,scarlett,knew,and,the,knowledge,stirred,the,emotions,that,had,warred,within,her,all,her,life,[END]
scarlett's,essential,self,was,as,much,her,heritage,from,her,father,as,was,her,name,[END]
she,was,impetuous,strong-willed,and,had,the,same,coarse,forthright,vitality,and,courage,that,had,carried,him,across,the,dangerous,waters,of,the,atlantic,and,to,the,pinnacle,of,his,dreams-master,of,a,great,plantation,and,husband,to,a,great,lady,[END]
her,mother's,blood,gave,her,the,fine,bones,and,creamy,skin,that,spoke,of,centuries,of,breeding,[END]
ellen,robillard,also,instilled,in,her,daughter,the,rules,and,tenets,of,aristocracy,[END]
now,her,instincts,and,her,training,were,at,war,[END]
the,o'haras,drew,her,like,a,lodestone,[END]
their,earthy,vigor,and,lusty,happiness,spoke,to,the,deepest,and,best,part,of,her,nature,[END]
but,she,wasn't,free,to,respond,[END]
everything,she'd,been,taught,by,the,mother,she,revered,forbid,her,that,freedom,[END]
she,was,torn,by,the,dilemma,and,she,couldn't,understand,what,was,making,her,so,miserable,[END]
she,roamed,restlessly,through,the,silent,rooms,of,her,grandfather's,house,blind,to,their,austere,beauty,imagining,the,music,and,dancing,at,the,o'haras',wishing,with,all,her,heart,that,she,was,with,them,thinking,as,she'd,been,taught,that,such,boisterous,merriment,was,vulgar,and,lower,class,[END]
scarlett,didn't,care,really,that,her,grandfather,looked,down,on,her,cousins,[END]
he,was,a,selfish,old,man,she,thought,accurately,who,looked,down,on,everyone,including,his,own,daughters,[END]
but,her,mother's,gentle,inculcation,had,marked,her,for,life,[END]
ellen,would,have,been,proud,of,her,in,charleston,[END]
in,spite,of,rhett's,jeering,prediction,she,had,been,recognized,and,accepted,as,a,lady,there,[END]
and,she,had,liked,it,[END]
hadn't,she,[END]
of,course,she,had,[END]
it,was,also,what,she,wanted,what,she,was,meant,to,be,[END]
why,then,was,it,so,hard,to,stop,herself,from,envying,her,irish,kin,[END]
i,won't,think,about,that,now,she,decided,[END]
i'll,think,about,it,later,[END]
i'll,think,about,tara,instead,[END]
and,she,retreated,into,the,idyll,of,her,tara,as,it,had,been,and,as,she'd,make,it,again,[END]
then,a,note,came,from,the,bishop's,secretary,and,her,idyll,exploded,in,her,face,[END]
he,wouldn't,grant,her,request,[END]
scarlett,didn't,think,at,all,[END]
she,clutched,the,note,to,her,breast,and,ran,heedless,and,hatless,and,alone,to,the,unlocked,door,into,jamie,o'hara's,house,[END]
they'd,understand,how,she,felt,the,o'haras,would,[END]
pa,told,me,so,again,and,again,[END]
to,anyone,with,a,drop,of,irish,blood,in,them,the,land,they,live,on,is,like,their,mother,[END]
it's,the,only,thing,that,lasts,that's,worth,working,for,worth,fighting,for,[END]
she,burst,through,the,door,with,gerald,o'hara's,voice,in,her,ear,and,ahead,of,her,she,saw,the,compact,stock,body,and,silver,head,of,colum,o'hara,so,like,her,father's,[END]
it,seemed,right,that,he,should,be,the,one,certain,that,he'd,feel,what,she,felt,[END]
colum,was,standing,in,the,doorway,looking,into,the,dining,room,[END]
when,the,outside,door,crashed,open,and,scarlett,stumbled,into,the,kitchen,he,turned,[END]
he,was,dressed,in,a,dark,suit,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,him,through,the,daze,of,her,pain,[END]
she,stared,at,the,unexpected,white,line,across,his,throat,that,was,his,woman,collar,[END]
a,priest,[END]
no,one,had,told,her,colum,was,a,priest,[END]
thank,god,[END]
you,could,tell,a,priest,anything,even,the,deepest,secrets,of,your,heart,[END]
help,me,father,she,cried,[END]
i,need,someone,to,help,me,[END]
42,[END]
so,there,you,have,it,colum,concluded,[END]
now,what,can,be,done,to,remedy,it,[END]
that's,what,we,must,find,[END]
he,sat,at,the,head,of,the,long,table,in,jamie's,dining,room,[END]
all,the,adults,from,the,three,o'hara,houses,were,in,chairs,around,the,table,[END]
mary,kate,and,helen's,voices,could,be,heard,through,the,closed,door,to,the,kitchen,where,they,were,feeding,the,children,[END]
scarlett,was,seated,at,colum's,side,her,face,swollen,and,blotched,from,earlier,storms,of,weeping,[END]
you,mean,to,say,colum,that,the,farm,doesn't,go,intact,to,the,eldest,child,in,america,[END]
matt,asked,[END]
so,it,would,seem,matthew,[END]
well,then,uncle,gerald,was,foolish,not,to,leave,a,will,and,testament,[END]
scarlett,roused,herself,to,glare,at,him,[END]
before,she,could,speak,colum,intervened,[END]
the,poor,man,wasn't,granted,his,old,age,he,had,no,time,to,think,about,his,death,and,after,god,rest,his,soul,[END]
god,rest,his,soul,echoed,the,others,making,the,sign,of,the,cross,[END]
scarlett,looked,without,hope,at,their,solemn,faces,[END]
what,can,they,do,[END]
they're,just,irish,immigrants,[END]
but,she,soon,learned,that,she,was,wrong,[END]
as,the,talking,went,on,scarlett,felt,more,and,more,hopeful,[END]
for,there,was,quite,a,lot,these,irish,immigrants,could,do,[END]
patricia's,husband,billy,carmody,was,foreman,of,all,the,bricklayers,working,on,the,cathedral,[END]
he,had,come,to,know,the,bishop,very,well,[END]
to,my,sorrow,he,complained,[END]
the,man,interrupts,the,work,three,times,a,day,to,tell,me,it's,not,being,done,fast,enough,[END]
there,was,a,real,urgency,billy,explained,because,a,cardinal,from,rome,itself,would,be,touring,america,in,the,autumn,and,he,might,come,to,savannah,for,the,dedication,[END]
if,it,was,done,to,suit,his,schedule,[END]
jamie,nodded,[END]
an,ambitious,man,our,bishop,gross,would,you,say,[END]
not,unwilling,to,be,noticed,by,the,curia,[END]
he,looked,at,gerald,[END]
so,did,billy,matt,brian,daniel,and,old,james,[END]
and,the,women,maureen,patricia,and,katie,[END]
scarlett,did,too,although,she,didn't,know,why,they,were,all,looking,[END]
gerald,took,his,young,bride's,hand,in,his,[END]
don't,be,shy,sweet,polly,he,said,you're,an,o'hara,now,same,as,the,rest,of,us,[END]
tell,us,which,of,us,you,would,choose,to,talk,to,your,pa,[END]
tom,macmahon's,contractor,for,the,whole,job,maureen,murmured,to,scarlett,[END]
a,mention,from,tom,that,the,work,might,be,slowed,would,make,bishop,gross,promise,anything,[END]
doubtless,he's,scared,to,trembling,of,macmahon,[END]
everyone,else,in,the,world,is,[END]
scarlett,spoke,up,[END]
let,colum,do,it,[END]
she,had,no,doubt,that,he,was,the,best,to,do,anything,that,needed,doing,[END]
for,all,his,small,size,and,disarming,smile,there,was,strength,and,power,in,colum,o'hara,[END]
a,chorus,of,agreement,sounded,from,all,the,o'haras,[END]
colum,was,the,one,to,do,what,needed,doing,[END]
he,smiled,around,the,table,then,at,scarlett,alone,[END]
we'll,help,you,then,[END]
isn't,it,a,grand,thing,to,have,a,family,scarlett,o'hara,[END]
especially,one,with,in-laws,that,can,help,too,[END]
you'll,have,your,tara,wait,and,see,[END]
tara,[END]
what's,this,about,tara,[END]
old,james,demanded,[END]
'tis,the,name,gerald,gave,his,plantation,uncle,james,[END]
the,old,man,laughed,until,it,made,him,cough,[END]
that,gerald,he,said,when,he,could,speak,again,for,a,small,bit,of,a,man,he,always,did,have,a,high,opinion,of,himself,[END]
scarlett,stiffened,[END]
no,one,was,going,to,make,fun,of,her,pa,not,even,his,brother,[END]
colum,spoke,very,softly,to,her,[END]
whist,now,he,means,no,insult,[END]
i'll,explain,it,all,later,[END]
and,so,he,did,when,he,was,escorting,her,to,her,grandfather's,house,[END]
tara,is,a,magical,word,to,all,us,irish,scarlett,and,a,magical,place,[END]
it,was,the,center,of,all,ireland,the,home,of,the,high,kings,[END]
before,there,was,a,rome,or,an,athens,far,far,back,when,the,world,was,young,and,hopeful,there,ruled,in,ireland,great,kings,who,were,as,fair,and,beauteous,as,the,sun,[END]
they,passed,laws,of,great,wisdom,and,gave,shelter,and,riches,to,poets,[END]
and,they,were,brave,giants,of,men,who,punished,wrong,with,fearful,wrath,and,fought,the,enemies,of,truth,and,beauty,and,ireland,with,blood-gouted,swords,and,stainless,hearts,[END]
for,hundreds,and,thousands,of,years,they,ruled,their,sweet,green,island,and,there,was,music,throughout,the,land,[END]
five,roads,led,to,the,hill,of,tara,from,every,corner,of,the,country,and,every,third,year,did,all,the,people,come,to,feast,in,the,banquet,hall,and,hear,the,poets,sing,[END]
this,is,not,a,story,only,but,a,great,truth,for,all,the,histories,of,other,lands,record,it,and,the,sad,words,of,the,end,are,written,in,the,great,books,of,the,monasteries,[END]
in,the,year,of,our,lord,five,hundred,fifty,and,four,was,held,the,last,feast,of,tara,',[END]
colum's,voice,faded,slowly,on,the,last,word,and,scarlett,felt,her,eyes,sting,[END]
she,was,spellbound,by,his,story,and,his,voice,[END]
they,walked,on,in,silence,for,a,while,[END]
then,colum,said,it,was,a,noble,dream,your,father,had,to,build,a,new,tara,in,this,new,world,of,america,[END]
he,must,have,been,a,fine,man,indeed,[END]
oh,he,was,colum,[END]

it's,not,far,from,the,village,where,i,live,where,your,father,and,mine,were,born,in,county,meath,[END]
scarlett,was,thunderstruck,[END]
pa,must,have,gone,there,too,must,have,stood,where,the,high,kings,stood,[END]
she,could,picture,him,sticking,out,his,chest,and,strutting,the,way,he,did,when,he,was,pleased,with,himself,[END]
it,made,her,laugh,softly,[END]
when,they,reached,the,robillard,house,she,stopped,reluctantly,[END]
she,would,have,liked,to,walk,for,hours,listening,to,colum's,lilting,voice,[END]

scarlett,smiled,brightly,[END]
he,would,if,he,could,but,he,had,to,go,up,north,on,business,[END]
he's,a,very,successful,businessman,[END]
i,understand,[END]
well,i'm,happy,to,stand,in,as,your,helper,as,best,i,can,[END]
she,felt,like,hugging,him,the,way,she,used,to,hug,her,father,when,he,gave,her,what,she,wanted,[END]
but,she,had,an,idea,you,shouldn't,go,around,hugging,priests,even,if,they,were,your,cousin,[END]
so,she,simply,said,good,night,and,went,into,the,house,[END]
colum,walked,away,whistling,wearing,o',the,green,[END]
where,have,you,been,[END]
pierre,robillard,demanded,[END]
my,supper,was,quite,unsatisfactory,[END]
i've,been,at,my,cousin,jamie's,house,[END]
i'll,order,you,another,tray,[END]
you've,been,seeing,those,people,[END]
the,old,man,quivered,with,outrage,[END]
scarlett's,anger,swelled,to,meet,his,[END]
yes,i,have,and,i,intend,to,see,them,again,[END]
i,like,them,very,much,[END]
she,stalked,out,of,the,room,[END]
but,she,did,see,to,a,fresh,supper,tray,for,her,grandfather,before,she,went,up,to,her,room,[END]
what,about,your,supper,miss,scarlett,[END]
pansy,asked,[END]
you,wants,i,should,fetch,you,a,tray,upstairs,[END]
no,just,come,up,now,and,get,me,out,of,these,clothes,[END]
i,don't,want,any,supper,[END]
funny,i,don't,feel,hungry,at,all,and,i,only,had,a,cup,of,tea,[END]
all,i,want,now,is,some,sleep,[END]
all,that,crying,wore,me,out,[END]
i,could,hardly,get,out,the,words,to,tell,colum,about,the,bishop,i,was,crying,so,hard,[END]
i,believe,i,could,sleep,for,a,week,i've,never,felt,so,washed,out,in,my,life,[END]
her,head,felt,light,her,whole,body,heavy,and,relaxed,[END]
she,sank,into,the,soft,bed,and,plunged,at,once,into,a,deep,refreshing,sleep,[END]
in,all,scarlett's,life,she,had,faced,her,crises,alone,[END]
sometimes,she,had,refused,to,admit,she,needed,help,more,often,there,had,been,nowhere,she,could,turn,[END]
it,was,different,now,and,her,body,recognized,the,difference,before,her,mind,did,[END]
there,were,people,to,help,her,[END]
her,family,had,willingly,lifted,her,burden,from,her,shoulders,[END]
she,wasn't,alone,any,more,[END]
she,could,allow,herself,to,let,go,[END]
pierre,robillard,slept,little,that,night,[END]
he,was,disturbed,by,scarlett's,defiance,[END]
just,so,had,her,mother,defied,him,so,many,years,before,and,he,had,lost,her,forever,[END]
his,heart,had,broken,then,ellen,was,his,favorite,child,the,daughter,most,like,her,mother,[END]
he,didn't,love,scarlett,[END]
all,the,love,he,had,was,in,the,grave,with,his,wife,[END]
but,he,wouldn't,let,scarlett,go,without,a,fight,[END]
he,wanted,his,last,days,to,be,comfortable,and,she,could,see,to,it,[END]
he,sat,erect,in,bed,his,lamp,finally,fading,when,the,oil,was,gone,and,he,planned,his,strategy,as,if,he,were,a,general,facing,superior,numbers,[END]
after,a,fitful,hour,of,rest,shortly,before,dawn,he,woke,with,his,decision,made,[END]
when,jerome,brought,his,breakfast,the,old,man,was,signing,a,letter,he,had,written,[END]
he,folded,and,sealed,it,before,he,made,room,across,his,knees,for,the,tray,[END]
deliver,this,he,said,handing,the,letter,to,his,butler,[END]
and,wait,for,a,reply,[END]
scarlett,opened,the,door,a,crack,and,stuck,her,head,through,[END]
you,sent,for,me,grandfather,[END]
come,in,scarlett,[END]
she,was,surprised,to,see,that,there,was,someone,in,the,room,[END]
her,grandfather,never,had,guests,[END]
the,man,bowed,and,she,inclined,her,head,[END]
this,is,my,lawyer,mr,jones,[END]
ring,for,jerome,scarlett,[END]
he'll,show,you,to,the,drawing,room,jones,[END]
wait,there,until,i,send,for,you,[END]
scarlett,had,hardly,touched,the,bell,pull,before,jerome,opened,the,door,[END]
pull,that,chair,up,closer,scarlett,[END]
i,have,a,great,deal,to,say,to,you,and,i,don't,want,to,strain,my,voice,[END]
scarlett,was,mystified,[END]
the,old,man,had,all,but,said,please,[END]
he,sounded,kind,of,feeble,too,[END]
lord,i,hope,he's,not,getting,ready,to,die,on,me,[END]
i,don't,want,to,have,to,deal,with,eulalie,and,pauline,at,his,funeral,[END]
she,moved,a,chair,to,a,spot,near,the,head,of,the,bed,[END]
pierre,robillard,studied,her,from,under,lowered,eyelids,[END]
scarlett,he,said,quietly,when,she,was,seated,i,am,almost,ninety-four,years,old,[END]
i,am,in,good,health,considering,my,age,but,it,is,not,likely,in,simple,mathematics,that,i,will,live,much,longer,[END]
i,am,asking,you,my,grandchild,to,stay,with,me,for,the,time,i,have,left,[END]
scarlett,started,to,speak,but,the,old,man,raised,one,thin,hand,to,stop,her,[END]
i,haven't,finished,he,said,[END]
i,do,not,appeal,to,your,sense,of,family,duty,even,though,i,know,that,you,have,acted,responsibly,toward,the,needs,of,your,aunts,for,many,years,[END]
i,am,prepared,to,make,you,a,fair,offer,even,a,generous,one,[END]
if,you,will,remain,in,this,house,as,its,chatelaine,and,see,to,my,comforts,and,conform,with,my,wishes,you,will,inherit,my,entire,estate,when,i,die,[END]
it,is,not,inconsiderable,[END]
scarlett,was,dumbfounded,[END]
he,was,offering,her,a,fortune,[END]
she,thought,about,the,obsequiousness,of,the,bank,manager,wondered,just,how,much,her,grandfather,was,worth,[END]
pierre,robillard,misunderstood,scarlett's,hesitation,while,her,mind,worked,[END]
he,thought,she,was,overcome,with,gratitude,[END]
his,information,did,not,include,a,report,from,the,same,bank,manager,and,he,was,unaware,of,her,gold,in,the,vaults,[END]
satisfaction,glimmered,in,his,faded,eyes,[END]
i,do,not,know,he,said,nor,do,i,wish,to,know,what,circumstances,have,led,you,to,consider,dissolving,your,marriage,[END]
his,posture,and,voice,were,stronger,now,that,he,believed,he,had,the,winning,position,[END]
but,you,will,abandon,any,idea,of,divorce,[END]
you've,been,reading,my,mail,[END]
anything,that,comes,under,this,roof,is,rightfully,my,business,[END]
scarlett,was,so,enraged,she,couldn't,find,words,to,express,it,[END]
her,grandfather,continued,to,speak,[END]
precisely,[END]
coldly,[END]
his,words,like,icy,needles,[END]
i,despise,rashness,and,stupidity,and,you,have,been,stupidly,rash,leaving,your,husband,without,thought,for,your,position,[END]
if,you,had,had,the,intelligence,to,consult,a,lawyer,as,i,have,done,you,would,have,learned,that,south,carolina,law,does,not,encompass,divorce,for,any,reason,[END]
it,is,unique,among,the,united,states,in,this,respect,[END]
you,have,fled,to,georgia,it,is,true,but,your,husband,is,legally,resident,in,south,carolina,[END]
there,can,be,no,divorce,[END]
scarlett,was,still,concentrating,on,the,indignity,of,strangers,pawing,over,her,private,letters,[END]
it,must,have,been,that,sneak,jerome,[END]
he,put,his,hands,on,my,things,went,through,my,bureau,[END]
and,my,own,blood,kin,my,grandfather,put,him,up,to,it,[END]
she,stood,up,and,leaned,forward,her,fists,pressed,on,the,bed,beside,pierre,robillard's,skeletal,hand,[END]
how,dare,you,send,that,man,into,my,room,[END]
she,shouted,at,him,and,she,pounded,on,the,thick,layers,of,quilts,[END]
her,grandfather's,hand,darted,upward,as,quickly,as,a,snake's,striking,[END]
he,caught,her,two,wrists,in,the,bony,grip,of,his,long,fingers,[END]
you,will,not,raise,your,voice,in,this,house,young,woman,[END]
i,detest,noise,[END]
and,you,will,conduct,yourself,with,suitable,decorum,as,my,granddaughter,should,[END]
i,am,not,one,of,your,shanty,irish,relations,[END]
scarlett,was,shocked,at,his,strength,and,a,little,frightened,[END]
what,had,become,of,the,feeble,old,man,she'd,almost,felt,sorry,for,[END]
his,fingers,were,like,iron,bands,[END]
she,burst,out,of,his,grip,then,backed,away,until,the,chair,stopped,her,[END]
no,wonder,my,mother,left,this,house,and,never,came,back,she,said,[END]
she,hated,her,voice,for,its,fearful,quaver,[END]
stop,being,melodramatic,girl,[END]
it,tires,me,[END]
your,mother,left,this,house,because,she,was,headstrong,and,too,young,to,listen,to,reason,[END]
she'd,been,disappointed,in,love,and,she,took,the,first,man,who,asked,her,[END]
she,lived,to,regret,it,but,what,was,done,was,done,[END]
you're,not,a,girl,as,she,was,you're,old,enough,to,use,your,head,[END]
the,contract,is,drawn,up,[END]
bring,jones,in,here,we,will,sign,it,and,proceed,as,though,your,unseemly,outburst,had,never,occurred,[END]
scarlett,turned,her,back,on,him,[END]
i,don't,believe,him,[END]
i,won't,listen,to,that,kind,of,talk,[END]
she,lifted,the,chair,and,carried,it,back,to,its,usual,place,[END]
with,great,care,she,set,it,down,so,that,the,feet,fit,the,indentations,they,had,made,in,the,carpet,over,the,years,[END]
she,no,longer,felt,afraid,of,him,or,sorry,for,him,or,even,angry,with,him,[END]
when,she,turned,to,face,him,again,it,was,as,if,she'd,never,seen,him,before,[END]
he,was,a,stranger,[END]
a,tyrannical,sneaky,boring,old,man,whom,she,didn't,know,and,didn't,care,to,know,[END]
there's,not,enough,money,ever,been,minted,to,keep,me,here,she,said,and,she,was,talking,to,herself,more,than,to,him,[END]
money,can't,make,living,in,a,tomb,bearable,[END]
she,looked,at,pierre,robillard,with,blazing,green,eyes,in,a,deathly,pale,face,[END]
you,belong,here,you're,dead,already,except,you,won't,admit,it,[END]
i'll,leave,first,thing,in,the,morning,[END]
she,walked,quickly,to,the,door,and,pulled,it,open,[END]
i,figured,you'd,be,there,listening,jerome,[END]
go,on,in,[END]
43,[END]
don't,be,a,cry-baby,pansy,nothing's,going,to,happen,to,you,[END]
the,train,goes,straight,through,to,atlanta,then,it,stops,[END]
just,don't,get,off,it,before,it,gets,there,[END]
i've,pinned,some,money,in,a,handkerchief,and,pinned,the,handkerchief,in,your,coat,pocket,[END]
the,conductor,already,has,your,ticket,and,he's,promised,to,look,out,for,you,[END]
great,balls,of,fire,[END]
you've,been,snivelling,about,how,much,you,wanted,to,go,home,and,now,you're,going,so,stop,carrying,on,like,that,[END]
but,miss,scarlett,i,never,been,on,a,train,by,myself,[END]
fiddle-dee-dee,[END]
you're,not,by,yourself,at,all,[END]
there,are,plenty,of,folks,on,the,train,[END]
you,just,look,out,the,window,and,eat,that,basket,full,of,food,mrs,o'hara,fixed,you,and,you'll,be,home,before,you,know,it,[END]
i've,sent,a,telegram,to,tell,them,to,come,meet,you,at,the,depot,[END]
but,miss,scarlett,what,am,i,to,do,without,you,to,do,for,[END]
i'm,a,lady's,maid,[END]
when,are,you,going,to,be,home,[END]
when,i,get,there,[END]
it,all,depends,[END]
now,climb,up,in,that,car,the,train's,ready,to,leave,[END]
it,all,depends,on,rhett,scarlett,thought,and,rhett,better,come,pretty,soon,[END]
i,don't,know,if,i'm,going,to,manage,with,my,cousins,or,not,[END]
she,turned,and,smiled,at,jamie's,wife,[END]
i,don't,know,how,i'm,ever,going,to,thank,you,for,taking,me,in,maureen,[END]
i'm,thrilled,to,death,at,the,idea,but,it's,caused,you,so,much,trouble,[END]
it,was,her,bright,girlish,social,voice,[END]
maureen,took,scarlett's,arm,and,walked,her,away,from,the,train,and,pansy's,forlorn,face,in,the,dust-streaked,window,of,the,coach,[END]
everything,is,grand,scarlett,she,said,[END]
daniel,is,delighted,to,give,you,his,room,because,he,gets,to,move,to,patricia's,with,brian,[END]
he's,been,wanting,to,do,it,but,he,didn't,dare,say,so,[END]
and,kathleen,is,near,floating,with,joy,that,she'll,be,your,lady's,maid,[END]
it's,what,she,wants,to,train,for,anyhow,and,she,worships,the,ground,under,your,feet,[END]
it's,the,first,time,the,silly,girl's,been,happy,since,she,came,here,[END]
you,belong,with,us,not,at,the,beck,and,call,of,that,old,loo-la,[END]
the,brass,of,him,expecting,that,you'd,stay,there,to,housekeep,for,him,[END]
we,want,you,for,the,love,of,you,[END]
scarlett,felt,better,[END]
it,was,impossible,to,resist,maureen's,warmth,[END]
still,she,hoped,it,wouldn't,be,long,[END]
all,those,children,[END]
just,like,a,colt,about,to,shy,maureen,thought,[END]
under,the,light,pressure,of,her,hand,she,could,feel,the,tension,in,scarlett's,arm,[END]
what,she,needs,maureen,decided,is,to,open,her,heart,and,likely,have,a,good,old-fashioned,bawling,[END]
it's,not,natural,for,a,woman,to,never,tell,nothing,about,herself,and,this,one,hasn't,mentioned,her,husband,at,all,[END]
it,makes,a,person,wonder,[END]
but,maureen,didn't,waste,any,time,wondering,[END]
she'd,observed,when,she,was,a,girl,washing,glasses,in,her,father's,bar,that,given,enough,time,everyone,came,around,to,airing,his,troubles,sooner,or,later,[END]
she,couldn't,imagine,that,scarlett,would,be,any,different,[END]
the,o'hara,houses,were,three,tall,brick,houses,in,a,row,with,windows,front,and,rear,and,shared,interior,walls,[END]
inside,the,layouts,were,identical,[END]
each,floor,had,two,rooms,kitchen,and,dining,room,on,the,street,level,double,parlors,on,the,first,floor,and,two,bedrooms,on,each,of,the,top,two,floors,[END]
a,narrow,hall,with,a,handsome,staircase,ran,the,length,of,each,house,and,behind,each,one,was,an,ample,yard,and,a,carriage,house,[END]
scarlett's,bedroom,was,on,the,third,floor,of,jamie's,house,[END]
it,had,two,single,beds,in,it,daniel,and,brian,had,shared,it,until,brian,moved,to,patricia's,and,it,was,very,plain,as,befitted,two,young,men,with,only,a,wardrobe,and,a,writing,table,and,chair,for,furniture,in,addition,to,the,beds,[END]
but,there,were,brightly,colored,patchwork,quilts,on,the,beds,and,a,big,red,and,white,rag,rug,on,the,polished,floor,[END]
maureen,had,hung,a,mirror,over,the,writing,table,and,covered,it,with,a,lace,cloth,so,scarlett,had,a,dressing,table,[END]
kathleen,was,surprisingly,good,with,her,hair,and,she,was,eager,to,learn,how,to,please,and,she,was,right,at,hand,[END]
she,slept,with,mary,kate,and,helen,in,the,other,third-floor,bedroom,[END]
the,only,little,child,in,jamie's,house,was,four-year-old,jacky,and,he,was,usually,over,at,one,of,the,other,houses,playing,with,cousins,near,his,age,[END]
during,the,day,with,the,men,at,work,and,the,older,children,in,school,the,row,of,houses,was,a,world,of,women,[END]
scarlett,expected,to,hate,it,[END]
but,nothing,in,scarlett's,life,had,prepared,her,for,the,o'hara,women,[END]
there,were,no,secrets,among,them,and,no,reticences,[END]
they,said,whatever,they,thought,confided,intimacies,that,made,her,blush,quarrelled,when,they,disagreed,and,hugged,one,another,weeping,when,they,made,up,[END]
they,treated,all,the,houses,as,one,were,in,and,out,of,the,others',kitchens,at,any,hour,for,a,cup,of,tea,shared,the,duties,of,shopping,and,baking,and,tending,the,animals,in,the,yard,and,the,carriage,houses,that,had,been,converted,into,sheds,[END]
most,of,all,they,enjoyed,themselves,with,laughter,and,gossip,and,confidences,and,harmless,intricate,conspiracies,against,their,men,[END]
they,included,scarlett,from,the,moment,she,arrived,assuming,that,she,was,one,of,them,[END]
within,days,she,felt,she,was,[END]
she,went,to,the,city,market,with,maureen,or,katie,every,day,to,search,for,the,best,foods,at,the,best,prices,and,she,giggled,with,young,polly,and,kathleen,about,tricks,with,curling,iron,and,ribbons,and,she,looked,through,swatches,of,upholstery,fabric,with,house-proud,patricia,long,after,maureen,and,katie,threw,up,their,hands,at,her,finickiness,[END]
she,drank,innumerable,cups,of,tea,and,listened,to,accounts,of,triumphs,and,worries,and,although,she,shared,none,of,her,own,secrets,no,one,pressured,her,or,held,back,the,frank,confession,of,their,own,[END]
i,never,knew,that,so,many,interesting,things,happened,to,people,scarlett,told,maureen,with,genuine,surprise,[END]
the,evenings,had,a,different,pattern,[END]
the,men,worked,hard,and,were,tired,when,they,got,home,[END]
they,wanted,a,good,meal,and,a,pipe,and,a,drink,[END]
and,they,always,got,it,[END]
after,that,the,evening,evolved,by,itself,[END]
often,the,whole,family,ended,up,at,matt's,house,because,he,had,five,young,children,asleep,upstairs,[END]
maureen,and,jamie,could,leave,jacky,and,helen,in,mary,kate's,care,and,patricia,could,bring,her,sleeping,two-year-old,and,three-year-old,without,waking,them,[END]
before,too,long,the,music,would,begin,[END]
later,when,colum,came,in,he,would,be,the,leader,[END]
the,first,time,scarlett,saw,the,bodhran,she,thought,it,was,an,outsize,tambourine,[END]
the,metal-framed,circle,of,stretched,leather,was,more,than,two,feet,across,but,it,was,shallow,like,a,tambourine,and,gerald,was,holding,it,in,his,hand,like,a,tambourine,[END]
then,he,sat,down,braced,it,on,his,knee,and,tapped,on,it,with,a,wooden,stick,that,he,held,in,the,middle,rocking,it,to,strike,one,end,then,the,other,against,the,skin,and,she,saw,that,it,was,really,a,drum,[END]
not,much,of,a,drum,she,thought,[END]
until,colum,picked,it,up,[END]
his,left,hand,spread,against,the,underside,of,the,taut,leather,as,if,caressing,it,and,his,right,wrist,was,suddenly,as,fluid,as,water,[END]
his,arm,moved,from,top,to,bottom,to,top,to,center,of,the,drum,while,his,right,hand,made,a,curious,careless-looking,motion,that,pounded,the,stick,with,a,steady,blood-stirring,rhythm,[END]
the,tone,and,volume,differed,but,the,hypnotic,demanding,beat,never,varied,as,fiddle,then,whistle,then,concertina,joined,in,[END]
maureen,held,the,bones,lifeless,in,her,hand,too,caught,up,in,the,music,to,remember,them,[END]
scarlett,gave,herself,over,to,the,drumbeat,[END]
it,made,her,laugh,it,made,her,cry,it,made,her,dance,as,she'd,never,dreamed,she,could,dance,[END]
it,was,only,when,colum,laid,the,bodhran,down,on,the,floor,beside,him,and,demanded,a,drink,saying,i've,drummed,myself,dry,that,she,saw,that,everyone,else,was,as,transported,as,she,was,[END]
she,looked,at,the,short,smiling,pug-nosed,figure,with,a,shiver,of,awestruck,wonder,[END]
this,man,was,not,like,other,men,[END]
scarlett,darling,you,understand,oysters,better,than,i,do,said,maureen,when,they,entered,the,city,market,[END]
will,you,find,us,the,best,of,them,[END]
i,want,to,make,a,grand,oyster,stew,for,colum's,tea,today,[END]
for,tea,[END]
oyster,stew's,rich,enough,for,a,meal,[END]
and,isn't,that,the,reason,for,it,[END]
he's,speaking,at,a,meeting,tonight,and,he'll,need,the,strength,of,it,[END]
what,kind,of,meeting,maureen,[END]
will,we,all,go,[END]
it's,at,the,jasper,greens,the,american,irish,volunteer,soldiering,group,so,there'll,be,no,women,[END]
we,wouldn't,be,welcome,[END]
what,does,colum,do,[END]
ah,well,first,he,reminds,them,they're,irish,no,matter,how,long,they've,been,americans,then,he,brings,them,to,tears,with,longing,and,love,for,the,old,country,then,he,gets,them,to,empty,their,pockets,for,the,aid,of,the,poor,in,ireland,[END]
he's,a,mighty,speechmaker,says,jamie,[END]
i,can,imagine,[END]
there's,something,magic,about,colum,[END]
so,you'll,find,us,some,magical,oysters,then,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
they'll,not,have,pearls,she,said,mimicking,maureen's,brogue,but,they'll,make,a,glory,of,a,broth,[END]
colum,looked,down,at,the,steaming,brimming,bowl,and,his,eyebrows,rose,[END]
maureen,this,is,a,hearty,tea,you,serve,[END]
the,oysters,looked,particularly,fat,today,at,market,she,said,with,a,grin,[END]
do,they,not,print,calendars,in,the,united,states,of,america,[END]
whist,colum,eat,your,stew,before,it's,cold,[END]
it's,lent,maureen,you,know,the,rules,for,fasting,[END]
one,meal,a,day,and,that,one,we,took,at,midday,[END]
so,her,aunts,had,been,right,[END]
scarlett,slowly,put,her,spoon,down,on,the,table,[END]
she,looked,at,maureen,with,sympathy,[END]
this,good,meal,wasted,[END]
she'd,have,to,do,a,terrible,penance,and,she,must,feel,miserably,guilty,[END]
why,did,colum,have,to,be,a,priest,[END]
she,was,astonished,to,see,maureen,smiling,and,dipping,in,her,spoon,to,capture,an,oyster,[END]
i'm,not,worried,about,hell,colum,she,said,[END]
i,have,the,o'hara,dispensation,[END]
you're,an,o'hara,too,so,eat,your,oysters,and,enjoy,them,[END]
scarlett,was,bewildered,[END]
what's,the,o'hara,dispensation,[END]
she,asked,maureen,[END]
colum,answered,her,but,without,maureen's,good,humor,[END]
thirty,years,or,so,gone,by,he,said,ireland,was,struck,with,famine,[END]
one,year,and,again,the,next,people,starved,[END]
there,was,no,food,so,they,ate,grass,and,then,there,was,not,even,grass,[END]
it,was,a,terrible,thing,terrible,[END]
so,many,died,and,there,was,no,way,to,help,them,[END]
those,that,lived,through,it,were,granted,dispensation,from,future,hungers,by,priests,in,some,parishes,[END]
the,o'haras,lived,in,such,a,parish,[END]
they,need,not,fast,save,for,forsaking,meat,[END]
he,was,staring,down,into,the,thick,butter-flecked,liquid,in,his,bowl,[END]
maureen,caught,scarlett's,eye,[END]
she,put,her,finger,to,her,lips,for,silence,then,gestured,with,her,spoon,urging,scarlett,to,eat,[END]
after,a,long,while,colum,picked,up,his,spoon,[END]
he,did,not,look,up,while,he,ate,the,succulent,oysters,and,his,thanks,were,perfunctory,[END]
then,he,left,to,go,to,patricia's,where,he,shared,a,room,with,stephen,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,maureen,with,curiosity,[END]
were,you,there,in,the,famine,[END]
she,asked,cautiously,[END]
maureen,nodded,[END]
i,was,there,[END]
my,father,owned,a,bar,so,we,didn't,fare,as,bad,as,some,[END]
people,will,always,find,money,for,drink,and,we,could,buy,bread,and,milk,[END]
it,was,the,poor,farmers,got,the,worst,of,it,[END]
ah,it,was,terrible,[END]
she,put,her,arms,across,her,breasts,and,shuddered,[END]
her,eyes,were,full,of,tears,and,her,voice,broke,when,she,tried,to,talk,[END]
they,only,had,potatoes,you,see,how,it,was,[END]
the,corn,they,grew,and,the,cows,they,raised,and,the,milk,and,butter,they,got,from,them,were,always,sold,so,they,could,pay,the,rent,for,their,farms,[END]
for,themselves,they,had,a,bit,of,butter,and,the,skimmed,milk,and,maybe,a,few,chickens,so,that,there,was,sometimes,an,egg,for,sunday,[END]
but,mostly,they,had,potatoes,to,eat,only,potatoes,and,they,made,that,enough,[END]
then,the,potatoes,turned,to,rot,under,the,earth,and,they,had,nothing,[END]
she,was,silent,rocking,back,and,forth,holding,herself,[END]
her,mouth,was,trembling,[END]
it,became,a,shaking,circle,and,she,gave,a,harsh,tormented,cry,remembering,[END]
scarlett,jumped,up,and,put,her,arms,around,maureen's,heaving,shoulders,[END]
maureen,wept,against,scarlett's,breast,[END]
you,cannot,imagine,what,it,is,to,have,no,food,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,smouldering,coals,on,the,hearth,[END]
i,know,what,it's,like,she,said,[END]
she,held,maureen,close,and,she,told,about,going,home,to,tara,from,burning,atlanta,[END]
there,were,no,tears,in,scarlett's,eyes,or,in,her,voice,when,she,talked,about,the,desolation,and,the,long,months,of,relentless,gnawing,hunger,and,near,starvation,[END]
but,when,she,spoke,about,finding,her,mother,dead,when,she,reached,tara,and,her,father's,pitiful,broken,mind,scarlett,broke,down,[END]
then,maureen,held,her,while,she,wept,[END]
44,[END]
it,seemed,that,the,dogwood,trees,came,into,bloom,overnight,[END]
suddenly,one,morning,when,scarlett,and,maureen,were,walking,to,the,market,there,were,clouds,of,blossoms,above,the,grassy,median,in,the,avenue,outside,the,house,[END]
ah,isn't,it,a,lovely,sight,[END]
maureen,sighed,gustily,[END]
the,morning,light,shining,through,the,tender,petals,making,them,almost,pink,[END]
by,noon,they'll,be,white,as,a,swan's,breast,[END]
it's,a,grand,thing,this,city,that,plants,flowering,beauty,for,all,to,see,[END]
she,drew,in,a,deep,breath,[END]
we'll,have,a,picnic,in,the,park,scarlett,[END]
to,taste,the,spring,green,in,the,air,[END]
come,quickly,there's,a,grand,shopping,to,do,[END]
i'll,bake,this,afternoon,and,after,mass,tomorrow,we'll,spend,the,day,at,the,park,[END]
was,it,saturday,already,[END]
scarlett's,mind,raced,calculating,and,remembering,[END]
why,she'd,been,in,savannah,almost,a,full,month,[END]
a,vise,squeezed,her,heart,[END]
why,hadn't,rhett,come,[END]
where,was,he,[END]
his,business,in,boston,couldn't,have,taken,this,long,[END]
boston,said,maureen,and,scarlett,stopped,short,[END]
she,grabbed,maureen's,arm,and,glared,at,her,suspiciously,[END]
how,could,maureen,have,known,rhett,was,in,boston,[END]
how,could,she,know,anything,about,him,[END]
i,haven't,said,a,word,to,her,[END]
what's,the,matter,scarlett,darling,[END]
have,you,turned,your,ankle,[END]
what,were,you,saying,about,boston,[END]
i,said,'tis,a,shame,stephen,won't,be,with,us,for,the,picnic,[END]
he's,leaving,today,for,boston,[END]
there'll,be,no,trees,flowering,there,i'm,bound,[END]
still,he'll,have,a,chance,to,see,thomas,and,his,family,and,bring,back,news,of,them,[END]
that'll,please,old,james,[END]
to,think,of,all,the,brothers,scattering,through,america,it's,a,wonderful,thing,[END]
scarlett,walked,quietly,at,maureen's,side,[END]
she,was,ashamed,of,herself,[END]
how,could,i,have,been,so,horrid,[END]
maureen's,my,friend,the,closest,friend,i,ever,had,[END]
she,wouldn't,spy,on,me,pry,into,my,private,life,[END]
it's,just,that,it's,been,so,long,and,i,hadn't,even,noticed,[END]
that's,why,i'm,so,jumpy,probably,why,i,barked,at,maureen,like,that,[END]
because,it's,been,so,long,and,rhett,hasn't,come,[END]
she,murmured,unthinking,agreement,to,maureen's,suggestions,about,food,for,the,picnic,while,questions,battered,against,the,walls,of,her,mind,like,birds,trapped,in,a,cage,[END]
had,she,made,a,mistake,not,going,back,to,charleston,with,her,aunts,[END]
had,she,been,wrong,to,leave,in,the,first,place,[END]
this,is,driving,me,crazy,[END]
i,can't,think,about,it,or,i'll,scream,[END]
but,her,mind,would,not,stop,questioning,[END]
maybe,she,should,talk,to,maureen,about,it,[END]
maureen,was,so,comforting,and,she,was,smart,really,about,so,many,things,[END]
she'd,understand,[END]
maybe,she,could,help,[END]
no,i'll,talk,to,colum,[END]
tomorrow,at,the,picnic,there'll,be,lots,of,time,[END]
i'll,tell,him,i,want,to,talk,ask,him,to,go,for,a,walk,[END]
colum,will,know,what,to,do,[END]
in,his,own,way,colum,was,like,rhett,[END]
he,was,complete,in,himself,like,rhett,and,everyone,else,looked,unimportant,next,to,him,just,the,way,men,seem,somehow,to,become,only,boys,and,rhett,the,only,man,in,the,room,[END]
colum,got,things,done,too,just,like,rhett,and,laughed,about,the,doing,just,like,rhett,[END]
scarlett,laughed,to,herself,at,the,memory,of,colum,talking,about,polly's,father,[END]
aye,he's,a,grand,bold,man,the,mighty,builder,macmahon,[END]
arms,like,sledgehammers,he,has,fairly,popping,the,seams,of,his,costly,coat,doubtless,chosen,by,mrs,macmahon,to,match,her,parlor,suite,else,why,would,it,be,such,a,plushy,object,[END]
a,godly,man,too,with,proper,reverence,for,the,shine,it,gives,his,soul,to,build,god's,own,house,here,in,savannah,america,[END]
i,blessed,him,for,it,in,my,own,humble,way,[END]
faith,',[END]
i,said,[END]
it's,my,belief,you're,such,a,religious,that,you're,not,taking,a,penny,more,than,forty,percent,profit,from,the,parish,',[END]
then,didn't,his,eyes,flash,and,his,muscles,swell,like,a,bull's,and,his,plushy,sleeves,make,pretty,little,popping,sounds,along,their,silk-sewn,seams,[END]
sure,it,is,master,builder,',says,i,that,any,other,man,would,have,made,it,fifty,seeing,that,the,bishop's,not,an,irishman,',[END]
and,then,the,good,man,showed,his,merit,[END]
gross,',[END]
he,roared,till,i,feared,the,windows,would,fly,out,into,the,street,[END]
what,manner,of,name,is,that,for,a,catholic,',[END]
then,he,told,me,stories,about,the,iniquities,of,the,bishop,that,my,collar,forbids,me,to,credit,[END]
i,shared,his,sorrows,and,a,glass,or,two,with,him,then,i,told,him,about,the,suffering,of,my,poor,little,cousin,[END]
righteous,wrath,he,showed,the,good,man,[END]
it,was,all,i,could,do,to,stop,him,tearing,down,the,steeple,with,his,own,strong,hands,[END]
it's,my,belief,he,won't,call,all,the,men,out,on,strike,but,i,cannot,be,altogether,certain,[END]
he,will,he,tells,me,express,to,the,bishop,his,concern,for,scarlett's,easiness,of,mind,in,terms,the,nervous,little,man,cannot,fail,to,understand,and,as,often,as,may,be,necessary,to,convince,him,of,the,gravity,of,the,problem,[END]
maureen,said,and,why,are,you,smiling,at,the,cabbages,i'd,like,to,know,[END]
scarlett,turned,the,smile,onto,her,friend,[END]
because,i'm,happy,that,it's,spring,and,we're,going,to,have,a,picnic,she,said,[END]
and,because,she,was,going,to,have,tara,she,was,sure,[END]
scarlett,had,never,seen,forsyth,park,[END]
hodgson,hall,was,just,across,the,street,from,it,but,it,had,been,dark,when,she,went,to,the,dedication,ceremony,[END]
it,caught,her,unaware,and,it,took,her,breath,away,[END]
a,pair,of,stone,sphinxes,flanked,the,entrance,[END]
the,children,looked,longingly,at,the,beasts,they,were,forbidden,to,climb,then,ran,at,full,speed,along,the,central,path,[END]
they,had,to,run,around,scarlett,[END]
she,was,stopped,in,the,middle,of,the,path,staring,ahead,[END]
the,fountain,was,two,blocks,from,the,entrance,but,it,was,so,enormous,that,it,looked,very,close,[END]
arcs,and,jets,of,water,lifted,and,fell,like,showering,diamonds,from,every,direction,[END]
scarlett,was,spellbound,she'd,never,seen,anything,so,spectacular,[END]
come,along,now,said,jamie,it,gets,better,as,you,get,closer,[END]
and,it,did,[END]
there,was,a,bright,sun,that,made,rainbows,in,the,dancing,waters,they,flashed,vanished,reappeared,with,every,step,scarlett,took,[END]
the,whitewashed,trunks,of,the,trees,that,lined,the,path,glimmered,in,the,dappled,shade,from,their,leaves,leading,to,the,sparkling,dazzle,of,the,fountain,[END]
when,she,reached,the,iron,fence,that,circled,the,fountain's,basin,she,had,to,tilt,her,head,back,to,near,dizziness,to,look,at,the,nymph,atop,its,third,tier,a,statue,bigger,than,she,was,the,arm,held,high,grasping,a,staff,that,threw,a,plume,of,water,high,high,toward,the,brilliant,blue,sky,[END]
i,like,the,serpent-men,myself,maureen,commented,[END]
they,always,look,to,me,like,they're,enjoying,themselves,[END]
scarlett,looked,where,maureen,was,pointing,[END]
the,bronze,mermen,knelt,in,the,huge,basin,on,their,elegantly,coiled,scaly,tails,with,one,hand,on,hip,the,other,holding,a,horn,to,the,lips,[END]
the,men,spread,rugs,under,the,oak,tree,maureen,selected,and,the,women,put,down,their,baskets,[END]
mary,kate,and,kathleen,deposited,patricia's,little,girl,and,katie's,smallest,boy,on,the,grass,to,crawl,[END]

then,she,realized,that,it,would,probably,all,be,gone,inside,an,hour,[END]
big,families,were,like,that,[END]
she,looked,with,real,affection,at,the,women,of,her,family,would,feel,equally,fond,of,the,men,when,they,came,back,carrying,their,coats,and,hats,their,collars,open,and,their,sleeves,rolled,up,[END]
she,had,put,aside,her,class,pretensions,without,noticing,their,departure,[END]
she,no,longer,remembered,her,uneasiness,when,she,learned,that,her,cousins,had,been,servants,on,the,great,estate,near,where,they,lived,in,ireland,[END]
matt,was,a,carpenter,there,gerald,a,worker,under,him,doing,repairs,on,the,dozens,of,buildings,and,miles,of,fence,[END]

patricia,smiled,at,him,[END]
she,smoothed,the,hair,from,timothy's,forehead,then,started,to,sing,the,lullaby,billy,was,playing,[END]

scarlett,drank,her,tea,while,kathleen,arranged,her,hair,in,a,thick,figure-eight,across,the,nape,of,the,neck,[END]
i,look,like,the,wrath,of,god,she,thought,[END]
there,were,faint,shadows,under,her,eyes,[END]
maybe,i,should,wear,the,pink,dress,it's,better,with,my,skin,but,then,kathleen,would,have,to,do,the,laces,again,the,pink,has,a,smaller,waist,and,her,fussing,is,driving,me,crazy,[END]

no,i'm,too,tired,to,walk,up,and,down,up,and,down,looking,at,every,single,thing,[END]
she,powdered,under,her,eyes,and,made,a,face,at,herself,in,the,looking,glass,before,she,went,downstairs,to,rummage,up,some,breakfast,[END]
my,grief,[END]

more,simple,perhaps,than,she,could,even,imagine,[END]

there,was,a,disproportionately,large,hold,compared,to,the,usual,passenger,ship,because,irish-americans,carried,with,them,gifts,for,all,their,relatives,and,returned,with,multiple,souvenirs,of,their,visits,[END]
the,baggage,handlers,treated,every,trunk,and,every,crate,as,if,it,were,full,of,glass,[END]

it,was,not,unknown,for,prosperous,third-generation,american,irish,wives,to,light,every,room,in,their,new,houses,with,waterford,crystal,chandeliers,[END]
a,broad,platform,with,sturdy,railings,was,built,across,the,top,of,the,paddle,wheel,on,which,scarlett,stood,with,colum,and,a,handful,of,adventurous,passengers,to,wave,a,final,goodbye,to,her,cousins,[END]
there'd,been,time,only,for,hasty,farewells,on,the,dock,because,the,brian,boru,had,to,catch,the,outgoing,tide,[END]
she,blew,excited,kisses,to,the,massed,o'haras,[END]
there'd,been,no,school,this,morning,for,the,children,and,jamie,had,even,closed,the,store,for,an,hour,so,that,he,and,daniel,could,come,down,and,see,them,off,[END]

among,the,layers,of,tissue,paper,and,petticoats,and,frocks,and,gowns,were,the,tightly,wrapped,oiled,rifles,and,the,boxes,of,ammunition,he,had,purchased,in,boston,[END]
like,their,fathers,and,grandfathers,and,generations,before,them,stephen,jamie,matt,colum,and,even,uncle,james,were,all,militantly,opposed,to,english,rule,over,ireland,[END]

the,brian,boru,moved,ponderously,between,the,banks,of,the,savannah,river,pulled,by,steamdriven,tugboats,[END]
when,at,last,it,reached,the,atlantic,its,deep,whistle,saluted,the,departing,tugs,and,its,great,sails,were,loosed,[END]
the,passengers,cheered,as,the,ship's,prow,dipped,into,the,gray-green,waves,at,the,river's,mouth,and,the,tremendous,paddle,wheels,began,to,churn,[END]
scarlett,and,kathleen,stood,side,by,side,watching,the,flat,shoreline,recede,quickly,into,a,soft,blur,of,green,then,disappear,[END]
what,have,i,done,[END]
scarlett,thought,and,she,grabbed,the,deck,rail,in,momentary,panic,[END]
then,she,looked,ahead,at,the,limitless,expanse,of,sun-flecked,ocean,and,her,heart,beat,faster,with,the,thrill,of,adventure,[END]
oh,[END]
kathleen,cried,out,[END]
then,oooh,she,moaned,[END]
what's,wrong,kathleen,[END]
oooh,[END]
i'd,forgot,the,seasickness,the,girl,gasped,[END]
scarlett,held,back,her,laughter,[END]
she,put,her,arm,around,kathleen's,waist,and,led,her,to,their,cabin,[END]
that,evening,kathleen's,chair,at,the,captain's,table,was,empty,[END]
scarlett,and,colum,did,full,justice,to,the,gargantuan,meal,that,was,served,[END]
afterwards,scarlett,took,a,bowl,of,broth,to,her,unfortunate,cousin,and,spoon-fed,her,[END]
i'll,be,all,right,in,a,day,or,two,kathleen,promised,in,a,weak,voice,[END]
you,won't,need,to,be,tending,me,forever,[END]
hush,up,and,take,another,sip,said,scarlett,[END]
thank,heavens,i,haven't,got,a,puny,stomach,she,thought,[END]
even,the,food,poisoning,from,saint,patrick's,day,is,over,now,or,i,couldn't,have,enjoyed,my,dinner,so,much,[END]
she,woke,abruptly,when,the,first,red,streaks,of,dawn,were,on,the,horizon,and,ran,with,frantic,clumsiness,into,the,small,convenience,room,that,adjoined,the,cabin,[END]
there,she,fell,to,her,knees,and,vomited,into,the,flower-decorated,china,receptacle,of,the,mahogany,chaise,privée,[END]
she,couldn't,be,seasick,not,her,[END]
not,when,she,loved,sailing,so,much,[END]
why,in,charleston,when,the,tiny,sailboat,was,climbing,the,waves,in,the,storm,she,hadn't,even,felt,queasy,nor,when,it,slid,down,into,the,trough,of,the,wave,[END]
the,brian,boru,was,steady,as,a,rock,compared,to,that,[END]
she,couldn't,imagine,what,was,wrong,with,her,[END]
slowly,slowly,scarlett's,bent,head,rose,from,its,drooping,weakness,[END]
her,mouth,and,eyes,opened,wide,with,discovery,[END]
excitement,raced,through,her,hot,and,strengthening,and,she,laughed,deep,in,her,throat,[END]
i'm,pregnant,[END]
i'm,pregnant,[END]
i,remember,this,is,how,it,feels,[END]
scarlett,leaned,back,against,the,wall,and,threw,her,arms,wide,in,a,luxurious,stretch,[END]
oh,i,feel,wonderful,[END]
i,don't,care,how,awful,my,stomach,feels,i,feel,wonderful,[END]
i've,got,rhett,now,[END]
he,is,mine,[END]
i,can't,wait,to,tell,him,[END]
sudden,tears,of,happiness,poured,down,her,cheeks,and,her,hands,flew,down,to,cover,her,middle,in,a,protective,cradling,of,the,new,life,growing,within,[END]
oh,how,she,wanted,this,baby,[END]
rhett's,baby,[END]
their,baby,[END]
it,would,be,strong,she,knew,it,she,could,feel,its,tiny,strength,already,[END]
a,bold,fearless,little,thing,like,bonnie,[END]
scarlett's,mind,flooded,with,memories,[END]
bonnie's,little,head,had,fit,into,her,palm,hardly,bigger,than,a,kitten's,[END]
she'd,fit,into,rhett's,big,hands,like,a,doll,[END]
how,he,had,loved,her,[END]
his,wide,back,bent,over,the,cradle,his,deep,voice,making,silly,baby-talk,sounds,never,in,all,the,world,was,there,a,man,so,besotted,with,a,baby,[END]
he,was,going,to,be,so,happy,when,she,told,him,[END]
she,could,see,his,dark,eyes,flashing,with,the,joy,of,it,his,white,smile,gleaming,in,his,pirate's,face,[END]
scarlett,smiled,too,thinking,of,it,[END]
i'm,happy,too,she,thought,[END]
this,is,the,way,it's,supposed,to,be,when,you,have,a,baby,melly,always,said,so,[END]
oh,my,god,she,whispered,aloud,[END]
melly,died,trying,to,have,one,and,my,insides,are,all,messed,up,dr,meade,said,after,i,had,the,miscarriage,[END]
that's,why,i,didn't,know,i,was,pregnant,i,didn't,even,notice,i,missed,my,time,of,month,because,it's,been,so,undependable,for,so,long,[END]
suppose,having,this,baby,kills,me,[END]
oh,god,please,please,god,don't,let,me,die,just,when,i,finally,get,what,i,need,to,be,happy,[END]
she,crossed,herself,again,and,again,in,confused,entreaty,propitiation,superstition,[END]
then,she,shook,her,head,angrily,[END]
what,was,she,doing,[END]
just,being,silly,[END]
she,was,strong,and,healthy,[END]
not,like,melly,at,all,[END]
why,mammy,always,said,it,was,downright,shameful,the,way,she,dropped,a,baby,with,hardly,more,fuss,than,an,alley,cat,[END]
she,was,going,to,do,just,fine,and,her,baby,would,be,fine,too,[END]
and,her,life,would,be,fine,with,rhett,loving,her,loving,their,baby,[END]
they'd,be,the,happiest,lovingest,family,in,the,whole,world,[END]
gracious,she,hadn't,even,thought,of,miss,eleanor,[END]
talk,about,baby-loving,[END]
miss,eleanor,was,going,to,pop,her,buttons,with,pride,[END]
i,can,see,her,now,at,the,market,telling,everybody,even,the,bent-up,old,man,who,sweeps,out,the,trash,[END]
this,baby's,going,to,be,the,talk,of,charleston,before,it,even,draws,its,first,breath,[END]
charleston,[END]
that's,where,i,should,be,going,[END]
not,to,ireland,[END]
i,want,to,see,rhett,to,tell,him,[END]
maybe,the,brian,boru,could,put,in,there,[END]
the,captain's,a,friend,of,colum's,colum,could,persuade,him,to,do,it,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,sparkled,[END]
she,got,to,her,feet,and,washed,her,face,then,rinsed,the,sour,taste,out,of,her,mouth,[END]
it,was,too,early,to,talk,to,colum,so,she,went,back,to,bed,and,sat,up,against,the,pillows,making,plans,[END]
when,kathleen,got,up,scarlett,was,sleeping,a,contented,smile,on,her,lips,[END]
there,was,no,need,to,hurry,she,had,decided,[END]
no,need,to,talk,to,the,captain,[END]
she,could,meet,her,grandmother,and,her,irish,kin,[END]
she,could,have,her,adventure,of,crossing,the,ocean,[END]
rhett,had,kept,her,waiting,for,him,in,savannah,[END]
well,he,could,wait,awhile,to,learn,about,the,baby,[END]
there,were,months,and,months,to,go,before,it,was,born,[END]
she,was,entitled,to,have,some,fun,before,she,went,back,to,charleston,[END]
sure,as,fate,she,wouldn't,be,allowed,to,do,so,much,as,stick,her,nose,out,of,the,door,there,[END]
ladies,in,a,delicate,condition,weren't,supposed,to,stir,a,stump,[END]
no,she'd,have,ireland,first,[END]
she'd,never,have,another,chance,[END]
she'd,enjoy,the,brian,boru,too,[END]
her,morning,sickness,had,never,lasted,much,more,than,a,week,with,the,other,babies,[END]
it,must,be,almost,over,now,[END]
like,kathleen,in,a,day,or,two,she'd,be,just,fine,[END]
crossing,the,atlantic,on,the,brian,boru,was,like,a,continuous,saturday,night,at,the,o'haras',in,savannah,only,more,so,[END]
at,first,scarlett,loved,it,[END]
the,ship,soon,had,a,full,complement,of,passengers,who,boarded,at,boston,and,new,york,but,they,didn't,seem,like,yankees,at,all,scarlett,thought,[END]
they,were,irish,and,proud,of,it,[END]
they,had,the,vitality,that,was,so,appealing,in,the,o'haras,and,they,took,advantage,of,everything,the,ship,had,to,offer,[END]
all,day,there,was,something,to,do,checkers,tournaments,heated,competitions,at,quoits,on,deck,excited,participation,in,games,of,chance,such,as,wagering,on,the,number,of,miles,the,ship,would,cover,the,following,day,[END]
in,the,evening,they,sang,along,with,the,professional,musicians,and,danced,energetically,to,all,the,irish,reels,and,viennese,waltzes,[END]
even,when,the,dancing,was,done,the,amusement,continued,[END]
there,was,always,a,game,of,whist,in,the,ladies',card,saloon,and,scarlett,was,always,in,demand,as,a,partner,[END]
except,for,charleston's,rationed,coffee,the,stakes,were,higher,than,any,she'd,known,and,every,turn,of,a,card,was,exciting,[END]
so,were,her,winnings,[END]
the,brian,boru's,passengers,were,living,proof,that,america,was,the,land,of,opportunity,and,they,didn't,mind,spending,their,lately,gained,wealth,[END]
colum,too,benefitted,from,their,opened,pockets,[END]
while,the,women,played,cards,the,men,generally,retired,to,the,ship's,bar,for,whiskey,and,cigars,[END]
there,colum,brought,tears,of,pity,and,pride,to,eyes,that,were,normally,shrewd,and,dry,[END]
he,talked,about,ireland's,oppression,under,english,rule,called,the,roll,of,martyrs,to,the,cause,of,irish,freedom,and,accepted,lavish,donations,for,the,fenian,brotherhood,[END]
a,crossing,on,the,brian,boru,was,always,a,profitable,enterprise,and,colum,made,the,trip,at,least,twice,a,year,even,though,the,excessive,luxury,of,the,staterooms,and,the,gargantuan,meals,secretly,sickened,him,when,he,thought,of,the,poverty,and,need,of,the,irish,in,ireland,[END]
by,the,end,of,the,first,week,scarlett,too,was,looking,at,their,fellow,passengers,with,a,disapproving,eye,[END]
both,men,and,women,changed,clothes,four,times,a,day,the,better,to,show,off,the,extent,of,their,costly,wardrobes,[END]
scarlett,had,never,seen,so,many,jewels,in,her,life,[END]
she,told,herself,she,was,glad,that,she'd,left,hers,in,the,vault,of,the,savannah,bank,they'd,pale,next,to,the,array,in,the,dining,saloon,every,night,[END]
but,in,truth,she,wasn't,glad,at,all,[END]
she,had,grown,accustomed,to,having,more,of,everything,than,anyone,she,knew,a,bigger,house,more,servants,more,luxury,more,things,more,money,[END]
it,put,her,nose,decidedly,out,of,joint,to,see,display,more,conspicuous,than,hers,had,ever,been,[END]
in,savannah,kathleen,mary,kate,and,helen,had,been,ingenuously,blatant,in,their,envy,and,all,the,o'haras,had,fed,her,need,for,admiration,[END]
these,people,on,the,ship,didn't,envy,her,or,even,admire,her,all,that,much,[END]
scarlett,wasn't,at,all,pleased,with,them,[END]
she,couldn't,bear,a,whole,country,full,of,irish,if,this,was,what,they,were,like,[END]
if,she,heard,wearing,o',the,green,one,more,time,she'd,scream,[END]
you're,just,not,taken,with,the,american,new-rich,scarlett,darling,colum,soothed,[END]
you're,a,grand,lady,that's,why,[END]
it,was,exactly,the,right,thing,for,him,to,say,[END]
a,grand,lady,was,what,she,had,to,be,after,this,vacation,was,over,[END]
she'd,have,this,final,fling,of,freedom,and,then,she'd,go,to,charleston,put,on,her,drab,clothes,and,company,manners,and,be,a,lady,for,the,rest,of,her,life,[END]
at,least,now,when,miss,eleanor,and,everybody,else,in,charleston,talked,about,their,trips,to,europe,before,the,war,she'd,not,feel,so,left,out,[END]
she,wouldn't,say,she'd,disliked,it,either,[END]
ladies,didn't,say,things,like,that,[END]
unconsciously,scarlett,sighed,[END]
ach,scarlett,darling,it,can't,be,as,bad,as,all,that,colum,said,[END]
look,at,the,bright,side,[END]
you're,cleaning,out,their,deep,pockets,at,the,card,table,[END]
she,laughed,[END]
it,was,true,[END]
she,was,winning,a,fortune,some,evenings,as,much,as,thirty,dollars,[END]
wait,till,she,told,rhett,[END]
how,he'd,laugh,[END]
he'd,been,a,gambler,on,mississippi,riverboats,for,a,while,after,all,[END]
come,to,think,of,it,it,was,a,good,thing,really,that,there,was,still,a,week,at,sea,[END]
she,wouldn't,have,to,touch,a,penny,of,rhett's,money,[END]
scarlett's,attitude,toward,money,was,a,complex,mixture,of,miserliness,and,generosity,[END]
it,had,been,her,measure,of,safety,for,so,many,years,that,she,guarded,every,penny,of,her,hard-earned,fortune,with,angry,suspicion,of,anyone,who,made,any,real,or,imagined,demands,for,a,dollar,of,it,[END]
and,yet,she,accepted,the,responsibility,to,support,her,aunts,and,melanie's,family,without,question,[END]
she,had,taken,care,of,them,even,when,she,didn't,know,where,she'd,find,the,means,to,take,care,of,herself,[END]
if,some,unforeseen,calamity,befell,she,would,continue,to,take,care,of,them,even,if,it,meant,that,she,had,to,go,hungry,[END]
she,didn't,think,about,it,it,was,simply,the,way,things,were,[END]
her,feelings,about,rhett's,money,were,equally,inconsistent,[END]
as,his,wife,she,spent,profligately,on,the,peachtree,street,house,with,its,prodigious,expenses,and,on,her,wardrobe,and,luxuries,[END]
but,the,half,million,he,had,given,her,was,different,[END]
inviolable,[END]
she,intended,to,give,it,back,to,him,intact,when,they,were,once,again,truly,man,and,wife,[END]
he,had,offered,it,as,payment,for,separation,and,she,could,not,accept,it,because,she,would,not,accept,separation,[END]
it,bothered,her,that,she'd,had,to,take,some,of,it,out,of,the,bank,vaults,to,bring,on,the,trip,[END]
everything,had,happened,so,fast,there'd,been,no,time,to,get,any,of,her,own,money,from,atlanta,[END]
but,she'd,put,an,iou,in,the,box,with,the,remaining,gold,in,savannah,and,she,was,determined,to,spend,as,little,as,possible,of,the,gold,coins,that,were,now,keeping,her,back,straight,and,her,waist,small,filling,the,channels,in,her,corset,where,steel,strips,had,once,been,[END]
it,was,much,better,to,win,at,whist,and,have,her,own,money,to,spend,[END]
why,in,another,week,with,any,luck,she'd,add,at,least,another,150,to,her,purse,[END]
but,still,she'd,be,glad,when,the,voyage,was,over,[END]
even,with,all,the,sails,bellied,taut,with,wind,the,brian,boru,was,too,big,for,her,to,feel,the,thrill,she,remembered,from,racing,ahead,of,the,storm,in,charleston,harbor,[END]
and,she,hadn't,seen,even,one,dolphin,despite,colum's,poetic,promises,[END]
there,they,are,scarlett,darling,[END]
colum's,usually,calm,melodious,voice,rose,in,excitement,he,took,scarlett's,arm,and,drew,her,to,the,ship's,rail,[END]
our,escorts,are,here,[END]
we'll,be,seeing,land,soon,[END]
overhead,the,first,gulls,circled,the,brian,boru,[END]
scarlett,hugged,colum,impulsively,[END]
then,again,when,he,pointed,to,the,sleek,silvery,forms,on,the,nearby,sea,[END]
there,were,dolphins,after,all,[END]
much,later,she,stood,between,colum,and,kathleen,trying,to,hold,her,hat,on,her,head,against,the,attack,of,the,strong,wind,[END]
they,were,entering,harbor,under,steam,[END]
scarlett,stared,in,astonishment,at,the,island,of,rock,to,starboard,[END]
it,seemed,impossible,that,anything,even,the,towering,wall,of,craggy,stone,could,withstand,the,crashing,waves,that,beat,against,it,and,threw,white,foam,high,against,its,face,[END]
she,was,accustomed,to,the,low,rolling,hills,of,clayton,county,[END]
this,soaring,stark,cliff,was,the,most,exotic,sight,she'd,ever,seen,[END]
nobody,tries,to,live,there,do,they,[END]
she,asked,colum,[END]
no,bit,of,earth,is,wasted,in,ireland,he,replied,[END]
but,it,takes,a,hardy,breed,you,call,inishmore,home,[END]
inishmore,[END]
scarlett,repeated,the,beautiful,strange,name,[END]
it,sounded,like,music,[END]
and,like,no,name,she'd,ever,heard,before,[END]
then,she,was,silent,so,were,colum,and,kathleen,each,of,them,looked,at,the,broad,blue,sparkling,waters,of,galway,bay,with,private,thoughts,[END]
colum,saw,ireland,ahead,and,his,shirt,swelled,with,love,for,her,and,pain,for,her,sufferings,[END]
as,he,did,many,times,every,day,he,renewed,his,vow,to,destroy,the,oppressors,of,his,country,and,to,restore,her,to,her,own,people,[END]
he,felt,no,anxiety,about,the,weapons,concealed,in,scarlett's,trunks,[END]
customs,officials,in,galway,concentrated,mainly,on,ships',cargoes,making,sure,that,duty,owed,to,the,british,government,was,paid,[END]
they'd,look,at,the,brian,boru,with,sneers,[END]
they,always,did,[END]
successful,irish-americans,gratified,their,sense,of,superiority,over,both,the,irish,and,the,americans,[END]
even,so,it,was,very,good,fortune,colum,thought,that,he'd,managed,to,convince,scarlett,to,come,[END]
her,petticoats,were,much,better,for,hiding,guns,than,the,dozens,of,american,boots,and,calicoes,he'd,bought,[END]
and,she,might,even,loosen,her,purse,strings,a,bit,when,she,saw,the,poverty,of,her,own,people,[END]
he,didn't,have,high,hopes,colum,was,a,realist,and,he'd,gotten,scarlett's,measure,from,the,first,[END]
he,did,not,like,her,less,because,she,was,so,unthinkingly,self-centered,[END]
he,was,a,priest,and,human,frailty,was,forgivable,so,long,as,the,humans,were,not,english,[END]
in,fact,even,when,he,was,manipulating,scarlett,he,was,fond,of,her,just,as,he,was,fond,of,all,the,o'hara,children,[END]
kathleen,held,tight,to,the,ship's,rail,[END]
i'd,jump,over,and,swim,did,i,not,anchor,myself,she,thought,i'm,that,happy,to,be,nearing,ireland,i,know,i'd,be,faster,than,the,ship,[END]
home,[END]
home,[END]
home,[END]
scarlett,drew,in,her,breath,with,a,tiny,squeaking,noise,[END]
there,was,a,castle,on,that,little,low,island,[END]
a,castle,[END]
it,couldn't,be,anything,else,it,had,tooth-like,things,on,top,[END]
what,matter,that,it,was,half-fallen-down,[END]
it,was,really,truly,a,castle,just,like,pictures,in,a,child's,book,[END]
she,could,hardly,wait,to,discover,what,this,ireland,was,like,[END]
when,colum,escorted,her,down,the,gangplank,she,realized,that,she,had,entered,a,completely,different,world,[END]
the,docks,were,busy,like,the,docks,in,savannah,noisy,crowded,perilous,with,hurrying,wagons,and,laden,men,loading,or,unloading,barrels,and,crates,and,bales,[END]

somebody,owns,the,whole,town,[END]
it's,not,a,town,that's,just,the,english,bragging,[END]
it's,hardly,even,a,village,[END]
it,was,named,for,the,son,of,the,englishman,who,first,built,it,a,small,gift,for,adam,the,estate,was,[END]

the,one,that,has,it,now,never,sees,it,[END]
he,lives,mostly,in,london,[END]
it's,his,agent,who,manages,things,[END]
there,was,a,bite,of,bitterness,in,colum's,words,[END]
scarlett,decided,she'd,better,not,ask,questions,[END]
she,contented,herself,with,looking,for,castles,[END]
just,as,the,train,began,to,slow,for,the,next,station,she,saw,an,enormous,one,that,hadn't,crumbled,at,all,[END]
surely,somebody,lived,there,[END]
a,knight,[END]
a,prince,[END]
far,from,it,said,colum,it,was,a,military,barracks,for,a,regiment,of,the,british,army,[END]
oh,i've,put,my,foot,in,it,this,time,for,sure,thought,scarlett,[END]
kathleen's,cheeks,were,flaming,[END]
i'll,get,us,some,tea,colum,said,when,the,train,stopped,[END]
he,pulled,the,window,down,from,the,top,and,leaned,out,[END]
kathleen,stared,at,the,floor,[END]
scarlett,stood,next,to,colum,[END]
it,felt,good,to,straighten,her,knees,[END]
sit,down,scarlett,he,said,firmly,[END]
she,sat,[END]
but,she,could,still,see,the,groups,of,smartly,uniformed,men,on,the,platform,and,the,shake,of,colum's,head,when,he,was,asked,if,any,seats,were,vacant,in,the,compartment,[END]
what,a,cool,customer,he,was,[END]
no,one,could,see,past,him,because,his,shoulders,filled,the,window,and,there,were,three,large,empty,seats,going,begging,[END]
she'd,have,to,remember,that,next,time,she,rode,an,irish,train,just,in,case,colum,wasn't,with,her,[END]
he,handed,in,mugs,of,tea,and,a,lumpy,folded,cloth,just,as,the,train,began,to,move,[END]
try,an,irish,specially,he,said,smiling,now,it's,called,barm,brack,[END]
the,rough,linen,cloth,held,great,slabs,of,delicious,fruit-filled,light,bread,[END]
scarlett,ate,kathleen's,too,and,asked,colum,if,he,could,get,some,more,for,her,when,they,stopped,at,the,next,station,[END]
can,you,stay,hungry,another,half,hour,or,so,[END]
we'll,be,getting,off,the,train,then,and,we,can,have,a,proper,meal,[END]
scarlett,was,delighted,to,agree,[END]
the,novelty,of,the,train,and,the,castle-peppered,views,had,begun,to,wear,off,[END]
she,was,ready,to,get,wherever,it,was,they,were,going,[END]
but,the,station,sign,said,mullingar,not,adamstown,[END]
poor,lamb,colum,said,hadn't,he,told,her,[END]
they,could,only,go,part,way,on,the,train,[END]
after,they,ate,their,dinner,they'd,make,the,rest,of,the,journey,by,road,[END]
it,was,only,twenty,miles,or,so,they'd,be,home,before,dark,[END]
twenty,miles,[END]
why,that,was,as,far,as,from,atlanta,to,jonesboro,[END]
it,would,take,ages,and,they'd,already,been,on,the,train,for,practically,six,hours,[END]
it,took,all,her,will,to,smile,pleasantly,when,colum,introduced,his,friend,jim,daly,[END]
daly,wasn't,even,good-looking,[END]
his,wagon,was,however,[END]
it,had,tall,wheels,painted,bright,red,and,glossy,blue,sides,with,j,daly,on,them,in,bold,gilt,[END]
whatever,business,he's,in,thought,scarlett,he's,doing,well,at,it,[END]
jim,daly's,business,was,a,bar,and,brewery,[END]
even,though,she,was,landlord,to,a,saloon,scarlett,had,never,been,in,it,it,made,her,feel,pleasantly,wicked,to,be,entering,the,malty-smelling,large,room,[END]
she,looked,curiously,at,the,long,polished,oak,bar,but,she,had,no,time,to,take,in,the,details,before,daly,opened,another,door,and,ushered,her,through,it,into,a,hallway,[END]
the,o'haras,were,having,dinner,with,him,and,his,family,in,their,private,quarters,above,the,public,house,[END]
it,was,a,good,dinner,but,she,might,just,as,well,have,been,in,savannah,[END]
there,was,nothing,strange,or,foreign,about,leg,of,lamb,with,mint,sauce,and,mashed,potatoes,[END]
and,all,the,talk,was,about,the,savannah,o'haras,their,health,and,their,doings,[END]
jim,daly's,mother,it,turned,out,was,another,o'hara,cousin,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,tell,that,she,was,in,ireland,at,all,much,less,right,upstairs,over,a,saloon,[END]
no,one,of,the,dalys,seemed,very,interested,in,her,opinion,about,anything,either,[END]
they,were,all,too,busy,talking,among,themselves,[END]
things,improved,after,dinner,[END]
jim,daly,insisted,on,taking,her,on,his,arm,for,a,walk,to,see,the,sights,of,mullingar,[END]
colum,and,kathleen,followed,them,[END]
not,that,there's,all,that,much,to,see,scarlett,thought,[END]
it's,a,pokey,little,town,just,one,street,and,five,times,as,many,bars,as,shops,but,it,does,feel,good,to,stretch,my,legs,[END]
the,town,square,wasn't,half,the,size,of,galway's,and,nothing,was,happening,in,it,at,all,[END]
a,young,woman,with,a,black,shawl,over,her,head,and,breast,came,up,to,them,with,one,cupped,hand,held,forward,[END]
god,bless,you,sir,and,lady,she,whined,[END]
jim,dropped,a,few,coins,into,her,hand,and,she,repeated,the,blessing,while,she,curtseyed,[END]
scarlett,was,appalled,[END]
why,that,girl,was,begging,bold,as,brass,[END]
she,certainly,wouldn't,have,given,her,anything,there,wasn't,any,reason,the,girl,couldn't,go,out,and,work,for,a,living,she,looked,healthy,enough,[END]
there,was,an,outburst,of,laughter,and,scarlett,turned,to,see,what,caused,it,[END]
a,group,of,soldiers,had,entered,the,square,from,a,side,street,[END]
one,of,them,was,teasing,the,begging,woman,by,holding,a,coin,out,to,her,higher,than,she,could,reach,[END]
brute,[END]
but,what,can,she,expect,if,she's,going,to,make,a,spectacle,of,herself,begging,on,a,public,street,[END]
and,from,soldiers,too,[END]
anybody,would,know,that,they'd,be,coarse,and,rude,[END]
although,she,had,to,admit,you,could,hardly,credit,that,bunch,as,soldiers,[END]
they,looked,more,like,big,toys,for,a,little,boy,in,those,silly,fancy,uniforms,[END]
obviously,they,did,no,more,soldiering,than,marching,in,parades,on,holidays,[END]
thank,heavens,there,weren't,any,real,soldiers,in,ireland,like,the,yankees,[END]
no,snakes,and,no,yankees,[END]
the,soldier,threw,the,coin,into,a,filthy,scum-coated,puddle,and,laughed,again,with,his,friends,[END]
scarlett,saw,kathleen's,two,hands,grab,colum's,arm,[END]
he,pulled,away,and,walked,over,to,the,soldiers,and,the,beggar,[END]
oh,lord,what,if,he,started,lecturing,them,about,being,good,christians,[END]
colum,pushed,up,his,sleeve,and,she,caught,her,breath,[END]
he,looks,so,much,like,pa,[END]
is,he,going,to,wade,in,fighting,[END]
colum,knelt,on,the,cobbled,square,and,fished,the,coin,out,of,the,noisome,puddle,[END]
scarlett,let,her,breath,out,in,a,slow,relieved,hiss,[END]
she,wouldn't,for,a,minute,worry,about,colum,holding,his,own,against,one,of,those,sissy-britches,soldiers,but,five,might,just,be,too,much,even,for,an,o'hara,[END]
what,did,he,have,to,make,such,a,fuss,over,a,beggarwoman's,problems,for,anyhow,[END]
colum,stood,his,back,turned,to,the,soldiers,[END]
they,were,visibly,uncomfortable,at,the,turn,their,joke,had,taken,[END]
when,colum,took,the,woman's,arm,and,led,her,away,they,turned,in,the,opposite,direction,and,walked,quickly,to,the,next,corner,[END]
well,that's,that,and,no,harm,done,thought,scarlett,[END]
except,to,the,knees,of,colum's,breeches,[END]
i,suppose,they,get,plenty,of,wear,and,tear,anyhow,him,being,a,priest,and,all,[END]
funny,i,forget,that,most,of,the,time,[END]
if,kathleen,hadn't,dragged,me,out,of,bed,at,dawn,i,wouldn't,have,remembered,we,had,to,go,to,mass,before,we,took,the,train,[END]
the,balance,of,the,town,tour,was,very,brief,[END]
there,were,no,boats,to,be,seen,on,the,royal,canal,and,scarlett,wasn't,interested,in,the,slightest,by,jim,daly's,enthusiasm,for,travelling,to,dublin,that,way,instead,of,by,train,[END]
why,should,she,care,about,getting,to,dublin,[END]
she,wanted,to,be,on,the,way,to,adamstown,[END]
before,long,she,got,her,wish,[END]
there,was,a,small,shabby,carriage,outside,jim,daly's,bar,when,they,got,back,[END]
an,aproned,man,in,shirtsleeves,was,loading,their,trunks,on,the,top,of,it,the,valises,were,already,strapped,on,the,back,[END]
if,scarlett's,trunk,weighed,much,less,now,than,it,had,at,the,depot,when,jim,daly,and,colum,put,it,in,daly's,wagon,no,one,mentioned,it,[END]
when,the,trunks,were,secure,the,shirtsleeved,man,disappeared,into,the,bar,[END]
he,returned,wearing,a,coachman's,caped,coat,and,top,hat,[END]
name's,jim,too,he,said,briefly,[END]
let's,be,going,[END]
scarlett,stepped,up,and,took,a,seat,on,the,far,side,[END]
kathleen,sat,beside,her,colum,opposite,[END]
may,god,travel,your,road,with,you,called,the,dalys,[END]
scarlett,and,kathleen,waved,their,handkerchiefs,out,the,window,[END]
colum,unbuttoned,his,coat,and,took,off,his,hat,[END]
i,cannot,speak,for,anyone,else,here,but,i'm,going,to,try,to,sleep,a,bit,he,said,[END]
i,hope,you,ladies,will,excuse,my,feet,[END]
he,removed,his,boots,and,stretched,out,his,stockinged,feet,on,the,seat,between,scarlett,and,kathleen,[END]
they,looked,at,each,other,then,bent,to,unlace,their,boots,[END]
within,minutes,they,too,were,settled,with,their,hatless,heads,resting,against,the,corners,of,the,carriage,and,their,feet,flanking,colum,[END]
oh,if,only,i,had,on,my,galway,costume,i'd,be,as,snug,as,a,bug,scarlett,thought,[END]
one,gold-filled,corset,stay,was,stabbing,her,in,the,ribs,no,matter,how,she,arranged,herself,[END]
nevertheless,she,drifted,quickly,and,easily,into,sleep,[END]
she,woke,once,when,rain,began,to,spatter,on,the,window,but,soon,the,soft,sound,of,it,lulled,her,back,to,sleep,[END]
the,next,time,she,woke,the,sun,was,shining,[END]
are,we,there,[END]
she,asked,sleepily,[END]
no,we've,a,way,to,go,yet,colum,replied,[END]
scarlett,looked,out,and,clapped,her,hands,at,what,she,saw,[END]
oh,look,at,all,the,flowers,[END]
i,could,reach,out,and,pick,one,[END]
colum,open,the,window,do,[END]
i'll,get,a,bouquet,[END]
we'll,open,it,when,we,stop,[END]
the,wheels,stir,up,too,much,dust,[END]
but,i,want,some,of,those,flowers,[END]
'tis,only,a,hedgerow,scarlett,darling,[END]

it,was,true,scarlett,saw,[END]
the,unknown,vine,and,its,bright,pink,flowers,were,barely,an,arm's,length,away,from,kathleen,too,[END]
what,a,wonderful,way,to,travel,with,walls,of,flowers,on,both,sides,of,you,[END]
when,colum's,eyes,closed,she,slowly,let,the,window,down,[END]
49,[END]
we'll,be,reaching,ratharney,soon,colum,said,then,a,few,more,miles,and,we're,in,county,meath,[END]
kathleen,sighed,happily,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,sparkled,[END]
county,meath,[END]
pa,talked,like,it,was,paradise,and,i,guess,i,can,see,why,[END]
she,sniffed,the,sweet,afternoon,through,the,open,window,a,blend,of,faint,perfume,from,the,pink,flowers,a,rich,country,smell,of,sun-warmed,grass,from,the,invisible,fields,beyond,the,thick,hedgerows,and,a,pungent,herbal,tang,from,within,the,hedgerows,themselves,[END]
if,only,he,could,be,here,with,me,it,would,be,perfect,[END]
i'll,just,have,to,enjoy,it,twice,as,much,for,him,as,well,as,me,[END]
she,inhaled,deeply,and,caught,a,hint,of,the,freshness,of,water,in,the,air,[END]
i,think,it's,going,to,rain,again,she,said,[END]
it,won't,last,colum,promised,and,everything,will,smell,the,sweeter,when,it's,past,[END]
ratharney,came,and,went,so,quickly,that,scarlett,hardly,saw,anything,[END]
one,minute,there,was,the,hedgerow,then,it,was,gone,and,solid,wall,was,in,its,place,and,she,was,looking,through,the,carriage,window,and,another,open,window,the,same,size,with,a,face,in,it,looking,out,at,her,[END]
she,was,still,trying,to,get,over,the,shock,of,the,stranger's,eyes,appearing,from,nowhere,when,the,carriage,rattled,past,the,last,of,the,row,of,buildings,and,the,hedgerow,was,back,again,[END]
they,had,not,even,slowed,their,pace,[END]
it,slowed,very,soon,[END]
the,road,had,begun,to,wind,in,sharp,short,bends,[END]
scarlett,had,her,head,halfway,through,the,window,trying,to,look,at,the,road,ahead,[END]
are,we,in,county,meath,yet,colum,[END]
very,soon,[END]
they,passed,a,tiny,cottage,moving,at,hardly,more,than,a,walk,so,scarlett,had,a,good,look,[END]
she,smiled,and,waved,at,the,red-haired,little,girl,who,was,standing,inside,the,door,[END]
the,child,smiled,in,return,[END]
her,front,milk,teeth,were,gone,and,the,gap,gave,her,smile,a,special,charm,[END]
everything,about,the,cottage,charmed,scarlett,[END]
it,was,made,of,stone,and,the,walls,were,bright,white,with,small,square,windows,their,frames,painted,red,[END]
the,door,was,red,also,and,divided,in,half,with,the,top,half,open,into,the,house,[END]
the,child's,head,reached,barely,above,the,half,door,beyond,it,scarlett,could,see,a,brightly,burning,fire,in,a,shadowy,room,[END]
best,of,all,the,cottage,was,topped,by,a,straw,roof,and,the,roof,made,scallops,where,it,met,the,house,[END]
it,was,like,a,picture,from,a,fairy,tale,[END]
she,turned,to,smile,at,colum,[END]
if,that,little,girl,had,blond,hair,i'd,expect,to,see,the,three,bears,any,minute,[END]
she,could,tell,from,colum's,expression,that,he,didn't,know,what,she,was,talking,about,[END]

the,carriage,had,stopped,suddenly,[END]
colum,put,his,head,out,the,window,[END]
when,he,was,back,inside,he,was,no,longer,smiling,[END]

there,was,a,dull,reverberating,thudding,sound,and,the,leather,walls,of,the,carriage,vibrated,[END]
even,through,the,closed,windows,scarlett,and,kathleen,could,hear,the,loud,clipped,words,shouted,by,a,man,somewhere,in,front,of,them,[END]

kathleen's,hand,closed,around,scarlett's,[END]
the,carriage,rocked,on,its,springs,and,moved,slowly,toward,the,right,side,of,the,narrow,road,[END]
the,stiff,branches,and,thorns,of,the,hedgerow,tore,at,the,thick,leather,[END]
kathleen,moved,away,from,the,rasp,on,the,window,and,closer,to,scarlett,[END]
there,was,another,thud,and,both,of,them,jerked,[END]
scarlett's,hand,tightened,on,kathleen's,[END]
what,was,going,on,[END]
as,the,carriage,edged,along,they,came,upon,another,cottage,identical,to,the,one,scarlett,had,thought,idyllic,for,goldilocks,[END]
standing,in,the,fully,open,door,was,a,black-uniformed,gold-braid-trimmed,soldier,who,was,placing,two,small,three-legged,stools,atop,a,table,outside,the,door,[END]
to,the,left,of,the,door,there,was,a,uniformed,officer,on,a,skittish,bay,horse,and,to,the,right,of,it,was,colum,[END]
he,was,talking,quietly,to,a,small,weeping,woman,[END]
her,black,shawl,had,slipped,from,her,head,and,her,red,hair,was,straggling,over,her,shoulders,and,cheeks,[END]
she,held,a,baby,in,her,arms,scarlett,could,see,its,blue,eyes,and,the,russet,down,on,its,round,head,[END]
a,little,girl,who,might,have,been,the,twin,of,the,smiling,child,at,the,half-door,was,sobbing,into,the,mother's,apron,[END]
both,mother,and,child,were,bare-footed,[END]
a,straggle,of,soldiers,stood,in,the,center,of,the,road,near,a,huge,tripod,of,tree,trunks,[END]

for,the,love,of,god,quiet,[END]
the,desperate,urgency,in,kathleen's,whisper,made,scarlett,stop,[END]
what,on,earth,[END]
scarlett,watched,disbelieving,her,own,eyes,[END]
the,weeping,mother,was,clutching,colum's,hand,kissing,it,[END]
above,her,head,he,made,the,sign,of,the,cross,[END]
then,he,raised,her,to,her,feet,[END]
he,touched,the,head,of,the,baby,and,of,the,little,girl,and,with,his,two,hands,on,her,shoulders,he,turned,the,mother,to,face,away,from,her,cottage,[END]
the,carriage,moved,on,slowly,and,the,dull,heavy,thudding,began,again,behind,them,[END]
they,began,to,move,away,from,the,hedgerow,into,the,road,then,into,the,center,of,it,[END]

she,scrambled,down,to,the,road,and,ran,back,toward,the,noise,oblivious,of,her,fashionable,trailing,skirts,dragging,through,the,thin,mud,[END]
the,sight,and,sound,that,met,her,eyes,and,ears,halted,her,and,she,cried,out,in,shocked,protest,[END]
the,swinging,tree,trunk,battered,the,cottage,walls,again,and,its,front,collapsed,inward,shattering,windows,showering,bright,bits,of,clean,polished,glass,[END]
red,window,frames,fell,into,the,dust,raised,by,the,tumbling,white,stones,and,the,two-part,red,door,folded,upon,itself,[END]

crashing,[END]
shrieking,like,a,live,thing,[END]
for,a,moment,then,silence,followed,and,then,another,sound,a,crackling,that,became,a,roar,and,the,thick,smothering,smell,of,smoke,[END]
scarlett,saw,the,torches,in,the,hands,of,three,soldiers,the,flames,that,were,eating,hungrily,into,the,straw,thatch,of,the,roof,[END]

the,original,katie,scarlett,was,small,and,brown,her,skin,darkened,by,nearly,a,century,of,open,air,and,sun,and,rain,[END]
her,face,was,round,like,an,apple,and,withered,like,an,apple,kept,too,long,[END]

a,thick,wool,shawl,of,bright,blue,lay,across,her,shoulders,across,her,breast,the,fringed,ends,in,her,lap,[END]

kathleen,ran,out,through,the,open,red,door,of,the,cottage,nearby,sending,the,hens,in,the,yards,scattering,and,complaining,[END]
welcome,to,the,house,scarlett,she,cried,joyfully,[END]
tea's,in,the,pot,stewing,and,there's,a,fresh,loaf,of,barm,brack,for,your,pleasure,[END]
scarlett,was,amazed,again,at,the,change,in,kathleen,[END]
she,looked,so,happy,[END]
and,so,strong,[END]
she,was,wearing,what,scarlett,still,thought,of,as,a,costume,an,ankle-high,brown,skirt,over,blue,and,yellow,petticoats,[END]
her,skirt,was,pulled,up,on,one,side,and,tucked,into,the,top,of,the,homespun,apron,that,was,tied,around,her,waist,showing,the,bright,petticoats,[END]
scarlett,owned,no,gown,as,becoming,[END]
but,why,she,wondered,was,kathleen,bare-legged,and,barefooted,when,striped,stockings,would,have,finished,off,the,outfit,[END]
she,had,thought,about,asking,kathleen,to,come,over,to,molly's,to,stay,[END]
even,if,kathleen,made,no,bones,about,her,dislike,for,her,half,sister,she,should,be,able,to,put,up,with,her,for,ten,days,and,scarlett,really,needed,her,[END]
molly,had,a,parlor,maid,who,acted,as,lady's,maid,as,well,but,the,girl,was,hopeless,at,arranging,hair,[END]
but,this,kathleen,happy,at,home,and,sure,of,herself,was,not,someone,who'd,jump,to,do,her,bidding,scarlett,could,tell,[END]
there,was,no,point,in,even,hinting,at,the,move,she'd,just,have,to,make,do,with,a,clumsy,chignon,or,wear,a,snood,[END]
she,swallowed,a,sigh,and,went,into,the,house,[END]
it,was,so,small,[END]
bigger,than,grandmother's,cottage,but,still,too,small,for,a,family,[END]
where,did,they,all,sleep,[END]
the,outside,door,led,directly,to,the,kitchen,a,room,twice,the,size,of,the,kitchen,in,the,small,cottage,but,only,half,the,size,of,scarlett's,bedroom,in,atlanta,[END]
the,most,noticeable,thing,in,the,room,was,the,big,stone,fireplace,in,the,center,of,the,right-hand,wall,[END]
perilously,steep,stairs,rose,up,to,an,opening,high,in,the,wall,to,the,left,of,the,chimney,a,door,to,its,right,led,to,another,room,[END]
take,a,chair,by,the,fire,kathleen,urged,[END]
there,was,a,low,turf,fire,directly,on,the,stone,floor,inside,the,chimney,[END]
the,same,worked,stone,extended,outward,flooring,the,kitchen,[END]
it,gleamed,pale,from,scrubbing,and,the,smell,of,soap,mingled,with,the,sharp,aroma,of,the,burning,peat,[END]
my,soul,scarlett,thought,my,family's,really,very,poor,[END]
why,on,earth,did,kathleen,cry,her,eyes,out,to,come,back,to,this,[END]
she,forced,a,smile,and,sat,down,in,the,windsor,chair,kathleen,had,pushed,forward,to,the,hearth,[END]
in,the,hours,that,followed,scarlett,saw,for,herself,why,kathleen,had,found,the,space,and,relative,luxury,of,life,in,savannah,an,inadequate,replacement,for,life,in,the,small,whitewashed,thatched,cottage,in,county,meath,[END]
the,o'haras,in,savannah,had,created,a,sort,of,island,of,happiness,populated,by,themselves,reproducing,the,life,they'd,known,in,ireland,[END]
here,was,the,original,[END]
a,steady,succession,of,heads,and,voices,appeared,in,the,open,top,half,of,the,door,calling,out,god,bless,all,here,followed,by,the,invitation,to,come,in,and,sit,by,the,fire,and,then,by,the,entrance,of,the,owners,of,the,voices,[END]
women,girls,children,boys,men,babies,came,and,went,in,overlapping,ones,twos,threes,[END]
the,musical,irish,voices,greeted,scarlett,and,welcomed,her,greeted,kathleen,and,welcomed,her,home,again,all,with,a,warmth,so,heartfelt,that,scarlett,could,all,but,hold,it,in,her,hand,[END]
it,was,as,different,from,the,formal,world,of,paying,and,receiving,calls,as,day,differs,from,night,[END]
people,told,her,they,were,related,and,how,[END]
men,and,women,told,her,stories,about,her,father,reminiscences,from,older,ones,events,told,them,by,their,parents,or,grandparents,repeated,by,younger,ones,[END]
she,could,see,gerald,o'hara's,face,in,so,many,of,the,faces,around,the,hearth,hear,his,voice,in,their,voices,[END]
it's,like,pa,was,here,himself,she,thought,i,can,see,how,he,must,have,been,when,he,was,young,when,he,was,here,[END]
there,was,the,gossip,of,the,village,and,town,to,catch,kathleen,up,on,told,and,retold,as,people,came,and,went,so,that,before,long,scarlett,felt,that,she,knew,the,blacksmith,and,the,priest,and,the,man,who,kept,the,bar,and,the,woman,whose,hen,was,laying,a,double-yolk,egg,almost,every,day,[END]
when,father,danaher's,bald,head,appeared,in,the,doorway,it,seemed,the,most,natural,thing,in,the,world,and,when,he,came,in,she,looked,automatically,with,everyone,else,to,see,if,his,cassock,had,been,mended,yet,where,the,rough,corner,on,the,gate,to,the,churchyard,had,torn,it,[END]
it's,like,the,county,used,to,be,she,thought,everybody,knows,everybody,and,knows,everybody's,business,[END]
but,smaller,closer,more,comfortable,somehow,[END]
what,she,was,hearing,and,sensing,without,recognizing,it,was,that,the,tiny,world,she,was,seeing,was,kinder,than,any,she,had,ever,known,[END]
she,knew,only,that,she,was,enjoying,being,in,it,very,much,[END]
this,is,the,best,vacation,a,person,could,possibly,have,[END]
i'll,have,so,much,to,tell,rhett,[END]
maybe,we'll,come,back,together,sometime,he's,always,thought,nothing,of,going,off,to,paris,or,london,at,the,drop,of,a,hat,[END]
of,course,we,couldn't,live,like,this,it's,too,[END]

colum,looked,so,astonishingly,short,even,seated,at,table,in,the,midst,of,the,big,o'hara,men,[END]
the,missing,bridie,ran,through,the,door,just,as,kathleen,was,ladling,stew,into,blue,and,white,bowls,[END]
bridie,was,wet,[END]
her,shirt,clung,to,her,arms,and,her,hair,dripped,down,her,back,[END]
scarlett,looked,through,the,door,but,the,sun,was,shining,[END]

asked,the,youngest,brother,the,one,named,timothy,[END]
he,was,glad,to,deflect,attention,away,from,himself,[END]
his,brothers,had,been,teasing,him,about,his,weakness,for,an,unnamed,girl,they,referred,to,only,as,golden,hair,[END]
i,was,washing,myself,in,the,river,bridie,said,[END]
then,she,began,to,eat,ignoring,the,uproar,caused,by,her,statement,[END]
even,colum,who,rarely,criticized,raised,his,voice,and,banged,the,table,[END]

scarlett,asked,[END]
the,whole,table,fell,silent,[END]
pa,must,have,told,me,about,that,a,hundred,times,[END]

your,father,was,greatly,loved,and,his,absence,has,been,a,stone,in,my,breast,for,all,these,fifty,years,and,more,[END]

one,of,these,days,she,might,just,mention,it,not,saying,that,it,was,her,uncle,or,that,he,was,old,as,the,hills,[END]
oh,she,was,going,to,have,a,fine,time,when,she,had,rhett,where,she,wanted,him,[END]

and,where,did,she,come,up,with,that,idea,that,a,plantation,is,the,same,thing,as,what,did,she,call,it,an,english,manor,[END]
i,might,have,to,have,a,few,words,with,colum,myself,[END]
their,faces,were,a,treat,though,when,i,told,them,all,our,servants,and,field,hands,were,always,black,[END]
i,don't,think,they've,ever,heard,of,dark,skin,much,less,seen,any,[END]
this,is,a,strange,place,all,around,[END]
what,a,lovely,party,molly,said,scarlett,[END]
i,declare,i,ate,till,i,could,fairly,pop,[END]
i,think,i,might,just,take,a,little,rest,up,in,my,room,for,a,while,[END]
you,must,naturally,do,whatever,you,like,scarlett,[END]
i,had,the,boy,bring,around,the,trap,so,we,could,have,a,drive,but,if,you'd,prefer,to,sleep,[END]
oh,no,i'd,love,to,go,out,[END]
can,we,go,to,the,river,do,you,think,[END]
she'd,planned,to,get,away,from,molly,but,it,was,too,good,a,chance,to,miss,[END]
the,truth,was,she'd,rather,ride,to,see,the,boyne,than,walk,there,[END]
she,didn't,trust,colum,one,bit,when,he,said,it,wasn't,far,[END]
rightly,so,as,it,turned,out,[END]
wearing,yellow,gloves,to,match,the,yellow,spokes,of,the,trap's,tall,wheels,molly,drove,all,the,way,back,to,the,main,road,then,through,the,village,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,row,of,dispirited-looking,buildings,with,interest,[END]
the,trap,rolled,through,the,biggest,gates,scarlett,had,ever,seen,tremendous,creations,of,wrought,iron,topped,with,gold,spear,points,each,side,centered,by,a,gold-surrounded,brightly,colored,plaque,of,intricate,design,[END]
the,earl's,coat,of,arms,said,molly,lovingly,[END]
we'll,drive,to,the,big,house,and,see,the,river,from,the,garden,[END]
it's,all,right,he's,not,there,and,robert,got,permission,from,mr,[END]
alder-son,[END]
who's,that,[END]
the,earl's,land,agent,[END]
he,manages,the,entire,manor,[END]
robert,knows,him,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,look,impressed,[END]
clearly,she,was,supposed,to,be,bowled,over,though,she,couldn't,think,why,[END]
what,could,be,so,important,about,an,overseer,[END]
they,were,only,hired,help,[END]
her,question,was,answered,after,a,long,drive,on,a,perfectly,straight,wide,gravelled,road,through,spreading,expanses,of,clipped,lawn,that,reminded,her,for,a,moment,of,the,great,sweeping,terraces,of,dunmore,landing,[END]
the,thought,was,pushed,aside,by,her,first,sight,of,the,big,house,[END]
it,was,immense,not,one,building,it,seemed,but,a,cluster,of,crenellated,roofs,and,towers,and,walls,[END]
it,was,more,like,a,small,city,than,like,any,house,scarlett,had,ever,seen,or,even,heard,of,[END]
she,understood,why,molly,was,so,respectful,of,the,agent,[END]
managing,a,place,like,this,would,take,more,people,and,more,work,than,the,biggest,plantation,that,had,ever,been,[END]
she,craned,her,neck,to,look,up,at,the,stone,walls,and,marble-framed,tracery,windows,[END]
the,mansion,rhett,had,built,for,her,was,the,largest,and,to,scarlett's,mind,most,impressive,residence,in,atlanta,yet,it,could,be,put,down,in,one,corner,of,this,place,and,hardly,take,up,enough,room,to,be,noticed,[END]
i'd,love,to,see,the,inside,[END]
molly,was,horrified,that,scarlett,would,even,ask,[END]
we,have,permission,to,walk,in,the,garden,[END]
i'll,tie,the,pony,to,that,hitching,post,and,we'll,go,through,the,gate,there,[END]
she,pointed,to,a,steeply,pointed,arched,entry,[END]
the,iron,gate,was,ajar,[END]
scarlett,jumped,down,from,the,trap,[END]
the,archway,led,through,to,a,gravelled,terrace,[END]
it,was,the,first,time,scarlett,had,ever,seen,gravel,raked,into,a,pattern,[END]
she,was,almost,timid,about,walking,on,it,[END]
her,footprints,would,ruin,the,perfection,of,the,s-curves,formed,by,the,raking,[END]
she,looked,apprehensively,at,the,garden,beyond,the,terrace,[END]
yes,the,paths,were,gravel,[END]
and,raked,[END]
not,in,curves,thank,heaven,but,still,there,wasn't,a,footprint,to,be,seen,[END]
i,wonder,how,they,do,that,[END]
the,man,with,the,rake,has,to,have,feet,[END]
she,took,a,deep,breath,and,crunched,boldly,onto,the,terrace,and,across,it,to,the,marble,steps,into,the,garden,[END]
the,sound,of,her,boots,on,the,gravel,was,as,loud,as,gunfire,to,her,ears,[END]
she,was,sorry,she'd,come,[END]
where,was,molly,anyway,[END]
scarlett,turned,around,as,quietly,as,she,could,[END]
molly,was,walking,carefully,fitting,her,steps,into,the,prints,scarlett,had,left,[END]
it,made,her,feel,much,better,that,her,cousin,for,all,her,airs,was,even,more,intimidated,than,she,was,[END]
she,looked,up,at,the,house,waiting,for,molly,to,catch,up,[END]
it,seemed,much,more,human,from,this,side,[END]
there,were,french,windows,from,the,terrace,to,the,rooms,[END]
closed,and,curtained,but,not,too,big,to,walk,in,and,out,of,not,overwhelming,like,the,doors,on,the,front,of,the,house,[END]
it,was,possible,to,believe,that,people,might,live,here,not,giants,[END]
which,way,is,the,river,[END]
scarlett,called,to,her,cousin,[END]
she,wasn't,going,to,let,an,empty,house,make,her,whisper,[END]
but,she,didn't,care,to,linger,either,[END]
she,refused,molly's,suggestion,that,they,walk,through,all,the,paths,and,all,the,gardens,[END]
i,just,want,to,see,the,river,[END]
i'm,bored,sick,of,gardens,my,husband,makes,too,much,fuss,about,them,[END]
she,fended,off,molly's,transparent,curiosity,about,her,marriage,while,they,followed,the,center,path,toward,the,trees,that,marked,the,end,of,the,garden,[END]
and,then,suddenly,it,was,there,through,an,artfully,natural-looking,gap,between,two,clumps,of,trees,[END]
brown,and,gold,like,no,water,scarlett,had,ever,seen,[END]
the,sunlight,lay,on,top,of,the,river,like,molten,gold,swirling,in,slow,eddies,of,water,as,dark,as,brandy,[END]
it's,beautiful,she,said,aloud,her,voice,soft,[END]
she,hadn't,expected,beauty,[END]
to,hear,pa,talk,it,should,be,red,from,all,the,blood,that,was,spilled,and,rushing,and,wild,[END]
but,it,hardly,looks,like,it's,moving,at,all,[END]
so,this,is,the,boyne,[END]
she'd,heard,about,it,all,her,life,and,now,she,was,close,enough,to,reach,down,and,touch,it,[END]
scarlett,felt,an,emotion,unknown,to,her,something,she,couldn't,name,[END]
she,searched,for,some,definition,some,understanding,it,was,important,if,she,could,just,find,it,[END]
that's,the,view,molly,said,in,her,cramped,most,refined,diction,[END]
all,the,best,houses,have,a,view,from,their,gardens,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,hit,her,[END]
she'd,never,find,it,now,whatever,she'd,been,looking,for,[END]
she,looked,where,molly,indicated,and,saw,a,tower,on,the,other,side,of,the,river,[END]
it,was,like,the,ones,she'd,seen,from,the,train,made,of,stone,and,part,crumbled,away,[END]
moss,stained,the,base,of,it,and,vines,clung,to,its,sides,[END]
it,was,much,bigger,than,she'd,thought,they,would,be,when,she,saw,them,at,a,distance,it,looked,like,it,might,be,as,much,as,thirty,feet,across,and,twice,that,high,[END]
she,had,to,agree,with,molly,that,it,was,a,romantic,view,[END]
let's,go,she,said,after,one,more,look,at,the,river,[END]
all,of,a,sudden,she,felt,very,tired,[END]
colum,i,think,i'm,going,to,kill,dear,cousin,molly,[END]
if,you,could,have,heard,that,horrible,robert,last,night,at,dinner,telling,us,how,privileged,we,were,to,walk,on,the,earl's,dumb,garden,paths,[END]
he,must,have,said,it,about,seven,hundred,times,and,every,single,time,molly,chirped,away,for,ten,minutes,about,what,a,thrill,it,was,[END]
and,then,this,morning,she,practically,swooned,when,she,saw,me,in,these,galway,clothes,[END]
no,chirpy,little,lady,voice,then,let,me,tell,you,[END]
she,lectured,me,about,ruining,her,position,and,being,an,embarrassment,to,robert,[END]
to,robert,[END]
he,should,be,embarrassed,every,time,he,sees,his,dumb,fat,face,in,a,looking,glass,[END]
how,dare,molly,lecture,me,about,disgracing,him,[END]
colum,patted,scarlett's,hand,[END]
she's,not,the,best,companion,i'd,wish,for,you,scarlett,darling,but,molly,has,her,virtues,[END]
she,did,lend,us,the,trap,for,the,day,and,we'll,have,a,grand,outing,with,no,thought,of,her,to,cloud,it,[END]
look,at,the,blackthorn,flowers,in,the,hedges,and,the,wild,cherries,blooming,their,hearts,out,in,that,farmyard,[END]
it's,too,fine,a,day,to,waste,on,rancor,[END]
and,you,look,like,a,lovely,irish,lass,in,your,striped,stockings,and,red,petticoat,[END]
scarlett,stretched,out,her,feet,and,laughed,[END]
colum,was,right,[END]
why,should,she,let,molly,ruin,her,day,[END]
they,went,to,trim,an,ancient,town,with,a,rich,history,that,colum,knew,would,interest,scarlett,not,at,all,[END]
so,he,told,her,instead,about,market,day,every,saturday,just,like,galway,only,he,had,to,acknowledge,considerably,smaller,[END]
but,with,a,fortune-teller,most,saturdays,something,you,seldom,found,in,galway,and,a,glorious,fortune,promised,if,you,paid,tuppence,reasonable,happiness,for,a,penny,and,tribulation,foretold,only,if,your,pocket,could,produce,merely,a,ha'penny,[END]
scarlett,laughed,colum,could,always,make,her,laugh,and,touched,the,drawstring,bag,hanging,between,her,breasts,[END]
it,was,hidden,by,her,shirt,and,her,galway,blue,cloak,[END]
no,one,would,ever,know,she,was,wearing,two,hundred,dollars,in,gold,instead,of,a,corset,[END]
the,freedom,was,almost,indecent,[END]
she,had,not,been,out,of,the,house,without,stays,since,she,was,eleven,years,old,[END]
he,showed,her,trim's,famous,castle,and,scarlett,pretended,interest,in,the,ruins,[END]
then,he,showed,her,the,store,where,jamie,had,worked,from,the,time,he,was,sixteen,until,he,went,to,savannah,at,the,age,of,forty-two,and,scarlett's,interest,was,real,[END]
they,talked,with,the,shopkeeper,and,of,course,nothing,would,do,but,to,close,the,shop,and,accompany,the,owner,upstairs,to,meet,his,wife,who,would,surely,die,from,the,sorrow,of,it,if,she,couldn't,hear,the,news,from,savannah,straight,from,colum's,own,lips,and,meet,the,visiting,o'hara,who,was,already,the,talk,of,the,countryside,for,her,beauty,and,her,american,charm,[END]
then,neighbors,had,to,be,told,what,a,special,day,it,was,and,who,was,there,and,they,hurried,to,the,rooms,above,the,shop,until,scarlett,was,sure,the,walls,must,be,bulging,[END]
then,the,mahoneys,will,be,wounded,by,the,slight,if,we,come,to,trim,without,seeing,them,colum,said,when,at,last,they,left,jamie's,former,employer,[END]
who,[END]
they're,maureen's,family,to,be,sure,with,the,grandest,bar,in,all,trim,and,had,scarlett,ever,tried,a,bit,of,porter,[END]
the,number,of,people,was,even,larger,this,time,with,more,arriving,every,minute,and,soon,there,were,fiddlers,and,food,[END]
the,hours,sped,by,and,the,long,twilight,was,setting,in,when,they,started,the,short,journey,to,adamstown,[END]
the,first,shower,of,the,day,a,phenomenon,to,have,so,much,sun,said,colum,intensified,the,scent,of,the,blossoms,in,the,hedgerows,[END]
scarlett,pulled,up,the,hood,of,her,cloak,and,they,sang,all,the,way,to,the,village,[END]
i'll,stop,in,here,in,the,bar,and,learn,if,there's,a,letter,for,me,colum,said,[END]
he,looped,the,pony's,reins,around,the,village,pump,[END]
in,an,instant,heads,thrust,through,the,open,half,doors,of,all,the,buildings,[END]
scarlett,cried,mary,helen,the,baby's,got,another,tooth,come,have,a,cup,of,tea,and,admire,it,[END]
no,mary,helen,you,come,along,here,with,babe,and,tooth,and,husband,and,all,said,clare,o'gorman,née,o'hara,[END]
isn't,she,my,own,first,cousin,and,my,jim,dying,to,meet,her,[END]
and,my,cousin,too,clare,shouted,peggy,monaghan,[END]
and,me,with,a,barm,brack,on,my,hearth,because,i,learned,her,partiality,for,it,[END]
scarlett,didn't,know,what,to,do,[END]
colum,[END]
she,called,[END]
it,was,easy,enough,he,said,[END]
they'd,just,go,to,each,house,in,turn,starting,with,the,closest,gathering,friends,as,they,went,[END]
when,the,entire,village,was,in,one,of,the,houses,that's,where,they'd,stay,for,a,while,[END]
not,too,long,mind,you,because,you'll,have,to,get,into,your,finery,for,molly's,dinner,table,[END]
she,has,her,imperfections,as,do,we,all,but,you,cannot,thumb,your,nose,at,her,under,her,own,roof,[END]
she's,tried,too,hard,to,shed,those,kinds,of,petticoats,to,be,able,to,support,seeing,them,in,her,dining,room,[END]
scarlett,put,her,hand,on,colum's,arm,[END]
do,you,think,i,can,stay,at,daniel's,[END]
she,asked,[END]
i,truly,hate,being,at,molly's,[END]
what,are,you,laughing,about,colum,[END]
i've,been,wondering,how,i,could,persuade,molly,to,let,us,have,the,trap,one,more,day,[END]
now,i,think,she,can,be,convinced,to,make,it,available,for,the,rest,of,your,visit,[END]
you,take,yourself,in,there,to,see,the,new,tooth,and,i'll,go,have,a,small,talk,with,molly,[END]
don't,take,this,wrong,scarlett,darling,but,she'll,likely,promise,anything,if,i,promise,to,take,you,elsewhere,[END]
she'll,never,live,down,what,you,said,about,robert's,elegant,kid,gloves,for,cow,tending,[END]
it's,the,most,cherished,story,in,every,kitchen,from,here,to,mullingar,[END]
scarlett,was,installed,in,the,room,above,the,kitchen,by,suppertime,[END]
uncle,daniel,even,smiled,when,colum,told,the,tale,of,robert's,gloves,[END]
this,remarkable,occurrence,was,added,to,the,tale,making,it,an,even,better,story,for,the,next,telling,[END]
scarlett,adjusted,with,astonishing,ease,to,the,simplicity,of,daniel's,two-room,cottage,[END]
with,a,room,of,her,own,a,comfortable,bed,and,kathleen's,tireless,unobtrusive,cleaning,and,cooking,scarlett,had,only,to,enjoy,herself,on,her,holiday,[END]
and,she,did,enormously,[END]
52,[END]
during,the,following,week,scarlett,was,busier,and,in,some,ways,happier,than,she,had,ever,been,[END]
she,felt,stronger,physically,than,she,could,remember,ever,feeling,[END]
freed,from,the,constriction,of,fashionable,tight,lacing,and,the,metal,cage,of,corset,stays,she,could,move,more,quickly,and,breathe,deeply,for,the,first,time,in,many,years,[END]
in,addition,she,was,one,of,those,women,whose,vitality,increased,in,pregnancy,as,if,in,response,to,the,needs,of,the,life,growing,within,her,[END]
she,slept,deeply,and,woke,at,cockcrow,with,a,raging,appetite,for,breakfast,and,for,the,day,ahead,[END]
which,always,produced,both,the,comfortable,delight,of,familiar,pleasures,and,the,stimulation,of,new,experience,[END]
colum,was,eager,to,take,her,out,adventuring,as,he,called,it,in,molly's,pony,trap,[END]
but,first,he,had,to,tear,her,away,from,her,new,friends,[END]
they,poked,their,heads,in,at,daniel's,door,immediately,after,breakfast,[END]
for,a,visit,to,invite,her,to,visit,them,with,a,story,she,might,not,have,heard,yet,or,a,letter,from,america,that,could,use,some,explanation,of,the,meaning,of,some,words,or,phrases,[END]
she,was,the,expert,on,america,and,was,begged,to,tell,what,it,was,like,over,and,over,again,[END]
she,was,also,irish,though,she'd,suffered,poor,dear,from,the,lack,of,knowing,it,and,there,were,dozens,of,things,to,tell,her,and,teach,her,and,show,her,[END]
there,was,an,artlessness,about,the,irish,women,that,disarmed,her,it,was,as,if,they,were,from,another,world,as,foreign,as,the,world,they,all,believed,in,where,fairies,of,all,kinds,did,magical,and,enchanting,things,[END]
she,laughed,openly,when,kathleen,put,a,saucer,of,milk,and,a,plate,of,crumbled,bread,on,the,doorstep,every,evening,in,case,any,little,people,passing,by,were,hungry,[END]
and,when,both,saucer,and,plate,were,empty,and,clean,in,the,morning,scarlett,said,sensibly,that,one,of,the,barn,cats,must,have,been,at,them,[END]
her,skepticism,bothered,kathleen,not,at,all,and,kathleen's,fairy,supper,became,for,scarlett,one,of,the,most,charming,things,about,living,with,the,o'haras,[END]
another,was,the,time,she,spent,with,her,grandmother,[END]
she's,tough,as,shoe,leather,scarlett,thought,with,pride,and,she,fancied,that,her,grandmother's,blood,in,her,veins,was,what,had,gotten,her,through,the,desperate,times,in,her,life,[END]
she,ran,over,to,the,little,cottage,often,and,if,old,katie,scarlett,was,awake,and,willing,to,talk,she'd,sit,on,a,stool,and,ask,for,stories,about,her,pa,growing,up,[END]
eventually,she'd,give,in,to,colum's,urgings,and,climb,up,into,the,trap,for,the,day's,adventure,[END]
warm,in,her,wool,skirts,protected,by,cloak,and,hood,she,learned,within,a,few,days,to,pay,no,attention,to,the,gusting,wind,from,the,west,or,the,brief,light,rains,that,so,often,rode,on,it,[END]
just,such,a,rain,was,falling,when,colum,took,her,to,the,real,tara,[END]
scarlett's,cloak,billowed,around,her,when,she,reached,the,top,of,the,uneven,stone,steps,up,the,side,of,the,low,hill,where,ireland's,high,kings,had,ruled,and,made,music,and,loved,and,hated,and,feasted,and,battled,and,in,the,end,been,defeated,[END]
there's,not,even,a,castle,[END]
scarlett,looked,around,her,and,saw,nothing,except,a,scattering,of,grazing,sheep,[END]
their,fleece,looked,gray,under,the,gray,sky,in,the,gray,light,[END]
she,shivered,surprising,herself,[END]
a,goose,walked,over,my,grave,[END]
the,childhood,explanation,flickered,in,her,mind,making,her,smile,[END]
it,pleases,you,[END]
asked,colum,[END]
um,yes,it's,very,pretty,[END]
don't,lie,scarlett,darling,and,don't,search,for,prettiness,at,tara,[END]
come,with,me,[END]
he,held,out,his,hand,and,scarlett,put,hers,in,it,[END]
together,they,walked,slowly,across,the,rich,grass,to,an,uneven,area,of,what,looked,to,her,like,grassy,lumps,in,the,earth,[END]
colum,walked,over,some,of,them,and,stopped,[END]
saint,patrick,himself,stood,where,we,are,standing,now,[END]
he,was,a,man,then,a,simple,missionary,no,bigger,likely,than,i,am,[END]
sainthood,came,later,and,he,grew,in,people's,minds,to,a,giant,of,a,man,invincible,armed,with,god's,holy,word,[END]
it's,better,i,believe,to,remember,that,he,was,a,man,first,[END]
he,must,have,been,frightened,alone,in,his,sandals,and,frieze,cloak,facing,the,power,of,the,high,king,and,his,magicians,[END]
patrick,had,only,his,faith,and,his,mission,of,truth,and,the,need,to,tell,it,[END]
the,wind,must,have,been,cold,[END]
his,need,must,have,been,like,a,consuming,flame,[END]
he,had,already,broken,the,high,king's,law,lighting,a,great,bonfire,on,a,night,when,it,was,the,law,that,all,fires,should,be,put,out,[END]
he,could,have,been,killed,for,the,trespass,he,knew,that,[END]
he,had,purposed,the,great,risk,to,draw,the,eye,of,the,king,and,prove,to,him,the,magnitude,of,the,message,he,patrick,bore,[END]
he,did,not,fear,death,he,feared,only,that,he,would,fail,god,[END]
that,he,did,not,do,[END]
king,laoghaire,from,his,ancient,jewelled,throne,gave,the,bold,missionary,the,right,to,preach,without,hindrance,[END]
and,ireland,became,christian,[END]
there,was,in,colum's,quiet,voice,something,that,compelled,scarlett,to,listen,and,to,try,to,understand,what,he,was,saying,and,something,more,besides,[END]
she'd,never,thought,about,saints,as,people,as,able,to,be,afraid,[END]
she'd,never,really,thought,about,saints,at,all,they,were,just,names,of,holy,days,[END]
now,looking,at,colum's,short,stocky,figure,and,ordinary,face,and,graying,hair,tousled,by,the,wind,she,could,imagine,the,face,and,figure,of,another,ordinary-looking,man,in,the,same,stance,of,readiness,[END]
he,wasn't,afraid,to,die,[END]
how,could,anyone,not,be,afraid,to,die,[END]
what,must,it,be,like,[END]

i've,left,some,tonic,with,the,girl,for,when,she,comes,out,of,it,[END]
these,ladies,[END]

nothing,to,worry,about,though,[END]
she'll,be,fine,[END]
colum,thanked,him,paid,him,saw,him,out,[END]
then,he,sat,heavily,on,a,chair,by,the,lamplit,table,put,his,head,in,his,hands,[END]
there,was,a,great,deal,to,worry,about,and,he,questioned,whether,scarlett,o'hara,would,ever,be,fine,again,[END]
the,crumpled,water-spotted,pages,of,the,letter,were,strewn,on,the,table,beside,him,[END]
in,their,midst,was,a,neatly,trimmed,clipping,from,a,newspaper,[END]
yesterday,evening,it,read,in,a,private,ceremony,at,the,confederate,home,for,widows,and,orphans,miss,anne,hampton,was,joined,in,matrimony,to,mr,rhett,butler,[END]
56,[END]
scarlett's,mind,spiralled,up,up,spinning,swirling,up,up,out,of,the,black,toward,consciousness,but,some,instinct,forced,it,downward,again,sliding,slipping,back,into,darkness,away,from,the,unbearable,truth,lying,in,wait,for,her,[END]
again,and,again,it,happened,the,struggle,tiring,her,so,much,that,she,lay,exhausted,motionless,and,pale,in,the,big,bed,as,if,dead,[END]
she,dreamed,a,dream,full,of,movement,and,urgency,[END]
she,was,at,twelve,oaks,and,it,was,whole,again,and,beautiful,as,it,had,been,before,sherman's,torches,[END]
the,gracious,curving,staircase,turned,through,space,as,if,magically,suspended,and,her,feet,were,lightly,nimble,on,its,treads,[END]
ashley,was,ahead,of,her,climbing,unaware,of,her,cries,to,stop,[END]
ashley,she,called,ashley,wait,for,me,and,she,ran,after,him,[END]
how,long,the,staircase,was,[END]
she,didn't,remember,it,being,so,tall,it,seemed,to,be,growing,ever,higher,as,she,ran,and,ashley,was,so,far,above,her,[END]
she,had,to,reach,him,[END]
she,didn't,know,why,but,she,knew,she,must,and,she,ran,faster,always,faster,until,her,heart,was,pounding,in,her,breast,[END]
ashley,[END]
she,cried,[END]
ashley,[END]
he,paused,and,she,found,strength,she,didn't,know,she,possessed,she,climbed,running,even,faster,[END]
relief,flooded,her,body,and,her,soul,when,her,hand,touched,his,sleeve,[END]
then,he,turned,toward,her,and,she,screamed,without,sound,[END]
he,had,no,face,only,a,pale,featureless,blur,[END]
then,she,was,falling,tumbling,through,space,her,eyes,fixed,in,terror,on,the,figure,above,her,her,throat,straining,to,scream,[END]
but,the,only,sound,was,laughter,from,below,rising,like,a,cloud,to,surround,her,and,mock,her,muteness,[END]
i'm,going,to,die,she,thought,[END]
terrible,pain,will,crush,me,and,i'll,die,[END]
but,suddenly,strong,arms,closed,around,her,and,drew,her,gently,from,the,falling,[END]
she,knew,them,she,knew,the,shoulder,that,pillowed,her,head,[END]
it,was,rhett,[END]
rhett,had,saved,her,[END]
she,was,safe,in,his,embrace,[END]
she,turned,her,head,lifted,it,to,look,into,his,eyes,[END]
icy,terror,paralyzed,her,whole,body,[END]
his,face,was,formless,like,mist,or,smoke,like,ashley's,[END]
then,the,laughter,began,again,from,the,blankness,that,should,be,rhett's,face,[END]
scarlett's,mind,jolted,into,consciousness,fleeing,from,horror,and,she,opened,her,eyes,[END]
darkness,surrounded,her,and,the,unknown,[END]
the,lamp,had,burned,out,and,bridie,was,asleep,in,her,chair,unseen,in,a,corner,of,the,huge,room,[END]
scarlett,stretched,out,her,arms,over,the,expanse,of,the,big,unfamiliar,bed,[END]
her,fingers,touched,soft,linen,nothing,else,[END]
the,sides,of,the,mattress,were,too,distant,to,reach,[END]
she,seemed,to,be,marooned,on,a,strange,vastness,of,softness,without,definition,[END]
perhaps,it,went,on,forever,into,the,silent,darkness,her,throat,constricted,with,fear,[END]
she,was,alone,and,lost,in,the,dark,[END]
stop,it,[END]
her,mind,forced,panic,away,demanded,that,she,take,hold,of,herself,[END]
scarlett,carefully,pulled,her,legs,up,turned,over,into,a,kneeling,crouch,[END]
her,movements,were,slow,so,as,to,make,no,sound,[END]
anything,might,be,out,there,in,the,darkness,listening,[END]
she,crawled,with,agonized,caution,until,her,hands,felt,the,edge,of,the,bed,then,down,to,the,hard,solidity,of,the,wooden,frame,[END]
what,a,ninnyhammer,you,are,scarlett,o'hara,she,told,herself,when,tears,of,relief,ran,over,her,cheeks,[END]
of,course,the,bed,is,strange,and,the,room,[END]
you,fainted,like,some,silly,weak,vaporish,girl,and,colum,and,bridie,brought,you,to,the,hotel,[END]
stop,this,scaredy-cat,nonsense,[END]
then,like,a,physical,blow,memory,attacked,her,[END]
rhett,was,lost,to,her,[END]
divorced,from,her,[END]
married,to,anne,hampton,[END]
she,couldn't,believe,it,but,she,had,to,it,was,true,[END]
why,[END]
why,had,he,done,such,a,thing,[END]
she'd,been,so,sure,he,loved,her,[END]
he,couldn't,have,done,it,he,couldn't,[END]
but,he,had,[END]
i,never,knew,him,[END]

who,was,it,that,i,loved,[END]
whose,child,am,i,carrying,[END]
what's,going,to,become,of,me,[END]
that,night,in,the,frightening,darkness,of,an,unseen,hotel,room,in,a,country,thousands,of,miles,from,her,homeland,scarlett,o'hara,did,the,most,courageous,thing,she,had,ever,been,called,on,to,do,[END]
she,faced,up,to,failure,[END]
it's,all,my,fault,[END]
i,should,have,gone,back,to,charleston,as,soon,as,i,knew,i,was,pregnant,[END]
i,chose,to,have,fun,and,those,weeks,of,fun,have,cost,me,the,only,happiness,i,really,care,about,[END]
i,just,didn't,think,about,what,rhett,might,believe,when,i,ran,away,i,didn't,think,past,the,next,day,the,next,reel,[END]
i,didn't,think,at,all,[END]
i,never,have,[END]
all,the,impetuous,unconsidered,errors,of,her,life,crowded,around,scarlett,in,the,black,silence,of,the,night,and,she,forced,herself,to,look,at,them,[END]
charles,hamilton,she,had,married,him,to,spite,ashley,she,hadn't,cared,for,him,at,all,[END]
frank,kennedy,she'd,been,horrid,to,him,lied,to,him,about,suellen,so,that,frank,would,marry,her,and,give,her,money,to,save,tara,[END]
rhett,oh,she'd,made,too,many,mistakes,to,count,[END]
she'd,married,him,when,she,didn't,love,him,and,she'd,made,no,effort,to,make,him,happy,she'd,never,even,cared,that,he,wasn't,happy,not,until,it,was,too,late,[END]
oh,god,forgive,me,i,never,thought,once,about,what,i,was,doing,to,them,about,what,they,were,feeling,[END]
i,hurt,and,hurt,and,hurt,all,of,them,because,i,didn't,stop,to,think,[END]
melanie,too,especially,melly,[END]
i,can't,bear,to,remember,how,nasty,i,was,to,her,[END]
i,never,once,felt,grateful,for,the,way,she,loved,me,and,stood,up,for,me,[END]

despair,and,shame,gripped,scarlett's,heart,[END]
how,could,she,have,been,such,a,fool,[END]
she,despised,fools,[END]
then,her,hands,clenched,and,her,jaw,hardened,and,she,stiffened,her,spine,[END]
she,would,not,wallow,in,picking,at,the,past,and,feeling,sorry,for,herself,[END]
she,would,not,whine,not,to,anyone,else,and,not,to,herself,[END]
she,stared,at,the,darkness,above,her,through,dry,eyes,[END]
she,wouldn't,cry,not,now,[END]
she'd,have,the,rest,of,her,life,to,cry,[END]
now,she,had,to,think,and,think,carefully,before,she,decided,what,to,do,[END]
she,had,to,think,about,the,baby,[END]
for,a,moment,she,hated,it,hated,her,thickening,waist,and,the,clumsy,heavy,body,that,lay,ahead,[END]
it,was,supposed,to,have,given,rhett,back,to,her,and,it,hadn't,[END]
there,were,things,a,woman,could,do,she'd,heard,of,women,who,had,rid,themselves,of,unwanted,babies,[END]
rhett,would,never,forgive,her,if,she,did,that,[END]
and,what,difference,did,that,make,[END]
rhett,was,gone,forever,[END]
a,forbidden,sob,broke,from,scarlett's,lips,despite,all,her,willpower,[END]
lost,[END]
i,lost,him,[END]
i'm,beaten,[END]
rhett,won,[END]
then,sudden,anger,coursed,through,her,cauterizing,her,pain,energizing,her,exhausted,body,and,spirit,[END]
i'm,beaten,but,i'll,get,even,with,you,rhett,butler,she,thought,with,bitter,triumph,[END]
i'll,hit,you,harder,than,you've,hit,me,[END]
scarlett,laid,her,hands,gently,on,her,belly,[END]
oh,no,she,wasn't,going,to,get,rid,of,this,baby,[END]
she'd,take,care,of,it,better,than,any,baby,in,the,history,of,the,whole,world,[END]
her,mind,filled,with,images,of,rhett,and,bonnie,[END]
he,always,loved,bonnie,more,than,he,loved,me,[END]
he'd,give,anything,he'd,give,his,life,to,have,her,back,[END]
i'll,have,a,new,bonnie,all,my,own,[END]
and,when,she's,old,enough,when,she,loves,me,and,only,me,more,than,anything,or,anyone,on,earth,then,i'll,let,rhett,see,her,see,what,he's,missed,[END]
what,am,i,thinking,[END]
i,must,be,crazy,[END]
only,a,minute,ago,i,realized,how,much,i,hurt,him,and,i,hated,myself,[END]
now,i'm,hating,him,and,planning,to,hurt,him,worse,[END]
i,won't,be,like,that,i,won't,let,myself,imagine,such,things,i,won't,[END]
rhett's,gone,i've,admitted,it,[END]
i,can't,give,in,to,regrets,or,revenge,that's,a,waste,when,what,i,have,to,do,is,make,a,new,life,from,scratch,[END]
i've,got,to,find,something,fresh,something,important,something,to,live,for,[END]
i,can,do,it,if,i,put,my,mind,to,it,[END]
throughout,the,remainder,of,the,night,scarlett's,mind,moved,methodically,along,the,avenues,of,possibility,[END]
she,found,dead,ends,she,found,and,overcame,obstacles,she,found,surprising,corners,of,memory,and,of,imagination,and,of,maturity,[END]
she,remembered,her,youth,and,the,county,and,the,days,before,the,war,[END]
the,memories,were,somehow,painless,distant,and,she,inderstood,that,she,was,no,longer,that,scarlett,that,she,could,let,go,of,her,permit,the,old,days,and,their,dead,to,rest,[END]
she,concentrated,on,the,future,on,realities,on,consequences,ler,temples,began,to,throb,then,to,pound,then,her,whole,head,ached,abominably,but,she,continued,to,think,[END]
just,when,the,first,sounds,began,in,the,street,outside,all,the,pieces,fell,into,place,inside,her,mind,and,scarlett,knew,what,she,was,going,to,do,[END]
as,soon,as,enough,light,filtered,through,the,drawn,curtains,into,the,room,scarlett,called,out,bridie,[END]
the,girl,jumped,up,from,the,chair,blinking,sleep,from,her,eyes,[END]
thanks,be,to,god,you're,restored,[END]
she,exclaimed,[END]
the,doctor,left,lis,tonic,[END]
i'll,just,find,the,spoon,it's,on,this,table,somewhere,[END]
scarlett,opened,her,mouth,meekly,for,the,bitter,medicine,[END]
there,she,said,firmly,i'll,have,no,more,of,being,sick,[END]
open,the,curtains,it,must,be,day,by,now,[END]
i,need,some,breakfast,my,head,is,aching,and,i've,got,to,get,my,strength,back,[END]
it,was,raining,[END]
a,real,rain,not,the,misty,showers,that,were,customary,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,dark,satisfaction,[END]
colum,will,want,to,know,you're,better,he's,been,that,worried,[END]
can,i,tell,him,to,come,in,[END]
not,now,[END]
tell,him,i'll,want,to,see,him,later,i,want,to,talk,to,him,[END]
but,not,yet,[END]
go,on,[END]
tell,him,[END]
and,ask,him,to,show,you,how,to,order,up,my,breakfast,[END]
57,[END]
scarlett,forced,herself,to,swallow,bite,after,bite,of,food,even,though,she,wasn't,even,aware,of,what,she,was,eating,[END]
as,she'd,said,to,bridie,she,needed,her,strength,[END]
after,breakfast,she,sent,bridie,away,with,instructions,to,return,after,two,hours,[END]
then,she,sat,down,at,the,writing,table,near,the,window,and,with,a,small,frown,of,concentration,rapidly,filled,sheet,after,sheet,of,thick,creamy,unmarked,letter,paper,[END]
after,she,had,written,folded,and,sealed,two,letters,she,stared,at,the,blank,paper,in,front,of,her,for,a,long,time,[END]
she,had,planned,it,all,out,in,the,dark,hours,of,the,night,she,knew,what,she,was,going,to,write,but,she,couldn't,bring,herself,to,pick,up,the,pen,and,begin,[END]
her,very,marrow,shrank,from,what,she,had,to,do,[END]
scarlett,shivered,and,looked,away,from,the,page,[END]
her,eyes,fell,on,a,pretty,little,porcelain,clock,on,a,nearby,table,and,she,drew,in,her,breath,shocked,[END]
so,late,[END]
bridie,would,be,back,in,only,forty-five,minutes,[END]
i,can't,put,it,off,any,longer,it,won't,change,things,no,matter,how,long,i,do,[END]
there's,no,other,way,[END]
i've,got,to,write,to,uncle,henry,eat,humble,pie,and,ask,him,sweetly,to,help,me,[END]
he's,the,only,one,i,can,trust,[END]
scarlett,gritted,her,teeth,and,reached,for,the,pen,[END]
her,usually,neat,handwriting,was,cramped,and,uneven,from,strained,determination,when,she,put,the,words,on,paper,that,would,turn,over,control,of,her,atlanta,businesses,and,her,precious,hoard,of,gold,in,the,atlanta,bank,to,henry,hamilton,[END]
it,was,like,cutting,the,ground,out,from,under,her,feet,[END]
she,felt,physically,ill,almost,dizzy,[END]
there,was,no,fear,that,the,old,lawyer,would,cheat,her,but,there,was,no,chance,that,he,would,watch,every,penny,the,way,she,always,had,[END]
it,was,one,thing,to,have,him,collect,and,bank,the,receipts,from,the,store,and,the,rent,from,the,saloon,[END]
it,was,another,thing,altogether,to,give,him,control,of,store,inventory,and,prices,and,the,amount,of,rent,to,charge,the,saloonkeeper,[END]
control,[END]
she,was,giving,up,control,of,her,money,her,safety,her,success,[END]
just,when,control,was,most,needed,[END]
buying,carreen's,share,of,tara,was,going,to,dig,a,deep,hole,in,her,accumulated,gold,but,it,was,too,late,now,to,stop,the,deal,with,the,bishop,and,scarlett,wouldn't,stop,it,even,if,she,could,[END]
her,dream,of,spending,summers,at,tara,with,rhett,was,dead,now,but,tara,was,still,tara,and,she,as,determined,to,make,it,hers,[END]
building,the,houses,on,the,edge,of,town,was,another,drain,on,her,resources,but,it,had,to,be,done,[END]
if,only,she,wasn't,certain,that,uncle,henry,would,agree,with,everything,sam,colleton,suggested,without,asking,the,cost,[END]
worst,of,all,she,wouldn't,know,what,was,going,on,for,good,or,for,ill,anything,might,happen,[END]
i,can't,do,it,[END]
scarlett,groaned,aloud,[END]
but,she,continued,to,write,[END]
she,had,to,do,it,[END]
she,was,going,to,take,a,long,vacation,she,wrote,do,some,travelling,[END]
she,would,be,out,of,touch,with,no,address,where,mail,could,reach,her,[END]
she,looked,at,the,words,[END]
they,blurred,and,she,blinked,the,tears,away,[END]
none,of,that,she,told,herself,[END]
it,was,absolutely,essential,to,cut,all,ties,or,rhett,would,be,able,to,track,her,down,[END]
and,he,must,not,know,about,the,baby,until,she,chose,to,tell,him,[END]
but,how,could,she,bear,not,knowing,what,uncle,henry,was,doing,with,her,money,[END]
or,if,the,panic,was,getting,worse,threatening,her,savings,[END]
or,if,her,house,burned,down,[END]
or,worse,her,store,[END]
she,had,to,bear,it,so,she,would,[END]
the,pen,scratched,hurriedly,across,the,pages,detailing,instructions,and,advice,that,henry,hamilton,would,probably,disregard,[END]
when,bridie,returned,all,the,letters,were,on,the,blotter,folded,and,sealed,[END]
scarlett,was,sitting,in,an,armchair,her,ruined,corset,in,her,lap,[END]
oh,i,forgot,bridie,moaned,[END]
we,had,to,cut,you,out,to,let,the,breath,into,you,[END]
what,will,you,have,me,do,[END]
there,might,be,a,shop,nearby,i,could,go,to,[END]
never,mind,it's,not,important,scarlett,said,[END]
you,can,baste,me,into,a,frock,and,i'll,wear,a,cloak,to,hide,the,stitches,in,the,back,[END]
come,on,now,it's,getting,late,and,i've,got,a,lot,to,do,[END]
bridie,looked,at,the,window,[END]
late,was,it,[END]
her,country-accustomed,eyes,could,tell,it,wasn't,yet,nine,in,the,morning,[END]
she,went,obediently,to,unpack,the,sewing,kit,kathleen,had,helped,her,put,together,for,her,new,role,as,lady's,maid,[END]
thirty,minutes,later,scarlett,knocked,on,the,door,of,colum's,room,[END]
she,was,hollow-eyed,from,lack,of,sleep,but,immaculately,groomed,and,perfectly,composed,[END]
she,didn't,feel,at,all,tired,[END]
the,worst,was,over,now,she,had,things,to,do,[END]
it,restored,her,strength,[END]
she,smiled,at,her,cousin,when,he,opened,his,door,[END]
will,your,collar,protect,your,reputation,if,i,come,in,[END]
she,asked,[END]
i,have,things,to,talk,about,that,are,private,[END]
colum,bowed,and,swung,the,door,wide,[END]
a,thousand,welcomes,he,said,[END]
it's,good,to,see,you,smiling,scarlett,darling,[END]
it,won't,be,long,before,i'll,be,able,to,laugh,i,hope,[END]

no,[END]
i,have,it,[END]
private,[END]
i,understand,what,happened,[END]

scarlett,smiled,again,[END]
then,you're,wiser,than,i,am,[END]
i,know,but,i'll,likely,never,understand,[END]
still,that's,neither,here,nor,there,[END]
she,put,the,three,letters,she'd,written,on,a,table,[END]
i'll,tell,you,about,these,in,a,minute,[END]
first,i,have,to,tell,you,that,i'm,not,going,with,you,and,bridie,[END]
i'm,going,to,stay,in,ireland,[END]
she,held,up,her,hand,[END]
no,don't,say,anything,[END]
i've,thought,it,all,through,[END]
there's,nothing,for,me,in,america,any,more,[END]
ah,no,scarlett,darling,you're,being,too,hasty,[END]
didn't,i,tell,you,there's,nothing,done,that,can't,be,undone,[END]
your,husband,got,a,divorce,once,hell,do,it,again,when,you,go,back,and,tell,him,about,the,baby,[END]
you're,wrong,colum,[END]
rhett,will,never,divorce,anne,[END]
she's,his,kind,from,his,people,from,charleston,[END]
and,besides,she's,like,melanie,[END]
that,doesn't,mean,anything,to,you,you,never,knew,melly,[END]
but,rhett,did,[END]
he,knew,how,rare,she,was,long,before,i,did,[END]
he,respected,melly,[END]
she,was,the,only,woman,he,ever,did,respect,except,maybe,his,mother,and,he,admired,her,the,way,she,deserved,[END]
this,girl,he's,married,is,worth,ten,of,me,the,same,as,melly,was,and,rhett,knows,it,[END]
she's,worth,ten,of,rhett,too,but,she,loves,him,[END]
let,him,carry,that,cross,[END]
there,was,a,savage,bitterness,in,the,words,[END]
ach,the,suffering,he,thought,[END]
there,must,be,a,way,to,help,her,[END]
you've,got,your,tara,now,katie,scarlett,and,you've,such,dreams,for,it,[END]

what,scarlett,didn't,say,was,that,the,work,had,become,just,that,work,after,the,cousins,said,they,wouldn't,move,[END]
it,had,taken,the,joy,out,of,rebuilding,the,o'hara,lands,when,the,o'haras,wouldn't,be,enjoying,them,[END]
she'd,tried,and,tried,to,figure,out,why,they'd,turned,her,down,[END]
the,only,answer,that,made,sense,to,her,was,that,they,didn't,want,to,be,too,close,to,her,that,they,didn't,really,love,her,despite,all,their,kindnesses,and,warmth,[END]
she,felt,alone,now,even,when,she,was,with,them,even,when,she,was,with,colum,[END]
she'd,believed,he,was,her,friend,but,he'd,told,her,they'd,never,come,[END]
he,knew,them,was,one,of,them,[END]
her,back,hurt,all,the,time,now,[END]
her,legs,too,and,her,feet,and,ankles,were,so,swollen,that,walking,was,agony,[END]
she,wished,she,wasn't,having,the,baby,[END]
it,was,making,her,ill,and,it,had,given,her,the,idea,of,buying,ballyhara,in,the,first,place,[END]
and,she,had,six,no,six,and,a,half,more,weeks,of,this,[END]
if,i,had,the,energy,i'd,bawl,she,thought,despondently,[END]
but,she,found,another,weak,smile,for,colum,[END]
he,looks,like,he,wants,to,say,something,and,doesn't,know,what,to,say,[END]
well,i,can't,help,him,[END]
i'm,clean,out,of,conversation,[END]
there,was,a,knock,on,the,street,door,[END]
i'll,go,colum,said,[END]
that's,right,run,like,a,rabbit,[END]
he,came,back,to,the,kitchen,with,a,package,in,his,hand,and,an,unconvincing,smile,on,his,face,[END]
that,was,mrs,flanagan,from,the,store,[END]
the,tobacco,you,ordered,for,grandmother,came,in,she,brought,it,over,[END]
i'll,take,it,to,her,for,you,[END]
no,[END]
scarlett,heaved,herself,to,her,feet,[END]
she,asked,me,to,get,it,[END]
it's,the,only,thing,she's,ever,asked,for,[END]
you,hitch,up,the,pony,and,help,me,into,the,trap,[END]

and,how,i'll,get,out,of,it,god,only,knows,[END]
scarlett,wasn't,very,happy,when,her,cousin,sean,came,out,from,her,grandmother's,cottage,at,the,sound,of,her,arrival,[END]
spooky,sean,she,called,him,to,herself,just,as,she,always,thought,of,her,cousin,stephen,in,savannah,as,spooky,stephen,[END]
they,gave,her,the,shivers,because,they,always,watched,silently,while,the,other,o'haras,were,talking,and,laughing,[END]
she,didn't,care,much,for,people,who,didn't,talk,and,laugh,[END]
or,for,people,who,seemed,to,be,thinking,secret,thoughts,[END]
when,sean,offered,his,arm,to,help,her,walk,into,the,house,she,sidestepped,clumsily,to,avoid,him,[END]
no,need,she,said,gaily,i,can,manage,just,fine,[END]
even,more,than,stephen,sean,made,her,nervous,[END]
all,failure,made,scarlett,nervous,and,sean,was,the,o'hara,who,had,failed,[END]
he,was,patrick's,third,son,[END]
the,eldest,died,jamie,worked,in,trim,instead,of,farming,so,when,patrick,died,in,1861,sean,inherited,the,farm,[END]
he,was,only,thirty-two,at,the,time,and,the,only,was,an,excuse,he,thought,adequate,for,all,his,troubles,[END]
he,mismanaged,everything,so,badly,that,there,was,a,real,chance,the,lease,would,be,lost,[END]
daniel,as,the,eldest,called,patrick's,children,together,[END]
although,he,was,sixty-seven,daniel,had,more,faith,in,himself,than,in,sean,or,in,his,own,son,seamus,who,was,also,only,thirty-two,[END]
he'd,worked,beside,his,brother,all,his,life,now,that,patrick,was,gone,he,wouldn't,hold,his,tongue,and,watch,their,life's,work,go,too,[END]
sean,would,have,to,go,instead,[END]
sean,went,[END]
but,not,away,[END]
he,had,lived,with,his,grandmother,for,twelve,years,now,letting,her,take,care,of,him,[END]
he,refused,to,do,any,work,on,daniel's,farm,[END]
he,made,scarlett's,hackles,rise,[END]
she,walked,away,from,him,as,fast,as,her,bare,swollen,feet,would,carry,her,[END]
gerald's,girl,[END]
said,her,grandmother,[END]
it's,glad,i,am,to,see,you,young,katie,scarlett,[END]
scarlett,believed,her,[END]
she,always,believed,her,grandmother,[END]
i've,brought,your,tobacco,old,katie,scarlett,she,said,with,genuine,cheerfulness,[END]
what,a,grand,thing,to,do,[END]

no,thank,you,grandmother,[END]
i'm,not,quite,that,irish,yet,[END]
ach,that's,a,shame,[END]
well,i'm,as,irish,as,god,makes,them,[END]
fill,a,pipe,for,me,then,[END]
the,tiny,cottage,was,quiet,except,for,the,sound,of,her,grandmother's,soft,sucking,pulls,on,the,stem,of,her,pipe,[END]
scarlett,put,her,feet,up,on,a,stool,and,closed,her,eyes,[END]
the,peacefulness,was,balm,[END]
when,she,heard,shouting,outside,she,was,furious,[END]
couldn't,she,have,a,half,hour's,quiet,[END]
she,hurried,as,best,she,could,into,the,farmyard,ready,to,scream,at,whoever,was,making,the,racket,[END]
what,she,saw,was,so,terrifying,that,she,forgot,her,anger,the,pain,in,her,back,the,agony,in,her,feet,everything,except,her,fear,[END]
there,were,soldiers,in,daniel's,farmyard,and,constables,and,an,officer,on,a,curvetting,horse,with,a,naked,saber,in,his,hand,[END]
the,soldiers,were,setting,up,a,tripod,of,tree,trunks,[END]
she,hobbled,across,to,join,kathleen,who,was,weeping,in,the,doorway,[END]
here's,another,one,of,them,said,one,of,the,soldiers,[END]
look,at,her,[END]
these,miserable,irish,breed,like,rabbits,[END]
why,don't,they,learn,to,wear,shoes,instead,[END]
you,don't,need,shoes,in,bed,another,said,or,under,a,bush,[END]
the,englishman,laughed,[END]
the,constables,looked,down,at,the,ground,[END]
you,[END]
scarlett,called,loudly,[END]
you,on,the,horse,[END]
what,are,you,and,those,common,creatures,doing,at,this,farm,[END]
are,you,addressing,me,girl,[END]
the,officer,looked,down,his,long,nose,[END]
she,lifted,her,chin,and,stared,at,him,with,cold,green,eyes,[END]
i,am,not,a,girl,sir,and,you,are,not,a,gentleman,even,if,you,pretend,to,be,an,officer,[END]
his,mouth,dropped,open,[END]
now,his,nose,is,hardly,noticeable,at,all,[END]
i,guess,that's,because,fish,don't,have,noses,and,he,looks,like,a,landed,fish,[END]
the,hot,joy,of,combat,filled,her,with,energy,[END]
but,you're,not,irish,said,the,officer,[END]
are,you,that,american,[END]
what,i,am,is,none,of,your,concern,[END]
what,you're,doing,here,is,my,concern,[END]
explain,yourself,[END]
the,officer,remembered,who,he,was,[END]
his,mouth,closed,and,his,back,stiffened,[END]
scarlett,noticed,that,the,soldiers,were,stiff,all,over,and,staring,first,at,her,then,at,their,officer,[END]
the,constables,were,looking,from,the,corners,of,their,eyes,[END]
i,am,executing,an,order,of,her,majesty's,government,to,evict,the,people,resident,on,this,farm,for,nonpayment,of,rent,[END]
he,waved,a,scrolled,paper,[END]
scarlett's,heart,was,in,her,throat,[END]
she,lifted,her,chin,higher,[END]
beyond,the,soldiers,she,could,see,daniel,and,his,sons,running,from,the,fields,with,pitchforks,and,cudgels,ready,to,fight,[END]
there's,obviously,been,a,mistake,scarlett,said,[END]
what,amount,is,supposed,to,be,unpaid,[END]
hurry,she,thought,for,god's,sake,hurry,you,long-nosed,fool,[END]
if,any,o'hara,man,or,men,hit,a,soldier,they'd,be,sent,to,prison,or,worse,[END]
everything,seemed,to,slow,down,[END]
the,officer,took,forever,to,open,the,scroll,[END]
daniel,and,seamus,and,thomas,and,patrick,and,timothy,moved,as,if,they,were,under,water,[END]
scarlett,unbuttoned,her,shirt,[END]
her,fingers,felt,like,sausages,the,buttons,like,uncontrollable,lumps,of,suet,[END]
thirty-one,pounds,eight,shillings,and,nine,pence,said,the,officer,[END]
it,was,taking,him,an,hour,to,say,every,word,scarlett,was,sure,[END]
then,she,heard,the,shouting,from,the,field,saw,the,big,o'hara,men,running,waving,fists,and,weapons,[END]
she,clawed,frantically,at,the,string,around,her,neck,at,the,pouch,of,money,when,it,appeared,at,its,tightly,closed,neck,[END]
her,fingers,felt,the,coins,the,folded,bank,notes,and,she,breathed,a,silent,prayer,of,thanks,[END]
she,was,carrying,the,wages,of,all,the,workers,at,ballyhara,[END]
more,than,fifty,pounds,[END]
now,she,was,as,cool,and,unhurried,as,melting,ice,cream,[END]
she,lifted,the,cord,from,her,neck,over,her,head,and,she,jingled,the,pouch,in,her,hand,[END]
there's,extra,for,your,trouble,you,ill-bred,cad,she,said,[END]
her,arm,was,strong,and,her,aim,true,[END]
the,pouch,struck,the,officer,in,the,mouth,[END]
shillings,and,pence,scattered,down,the,front,of,his,tunic,and,onto,the,ground,[END]
clean,up,the,mess,you've,made,said,scarlett,and,take,away,that,trash,you,brought,with,you,[END]
she,turned,her,back,on,the,soldiers,[END]
for,the,love,of,god,kathleen,she,whispered,get,over,in,the,field,and,stop,the,men,before,there's,real,trouble,[END]
later,scarlett,confronted,old,daniel,[END]
she,was,livid,[END]
suppose,she,hadn't,brought,the,tobacco,[END]
suppose,it,hadn't,come,in,today,[END]
she,glared,at,her,uncle,then,burst,out,why,didn't,you,tell,me,you,needed,money,[END]
i'd,have,been,glad,to,give,it,to,you,[END]
the,o'haras,don't,take,charity,said,daniel,[END]
charity',[END]
it's,not,charity,when,it's,your,own,family,uncle,daniel,[END]
daniel,looked,at,her,with,old,old,eyes,[END]
what,isn't,earned,by,your,own,hands,is,charity,he,said,[END]
we've,heard,your,history,young,scarlett,o'hara,[END]
when,my,brother,gerald,lost,his,wits,why,did,you,not,call,upon,his,brothers,in,savannah,[END]
they're,all,your,own,family,[END]
scarlett's,lips,trembled,[END]
he,was,right,[END]
she,hadn't,asked,or,accepted,help,from,anyone,[END]
she,had,had,to,carry,the,burden,alone,[END]
her,pride,wouldn't,permit,any,yielding,any,weakness,[END]
and,in,the,famine,[END]
she,had,to,know,[END]
pa,would,have,sent,you,all,he,had,[END]
uncle,james,and,uncle,andrew,too,[END]
we,were,wrong,[END]
we,thought,it,would,end,[END]
when,we,learned,what,it,was,we'd,left,it,too,late,[END]
she,looked,at,her,uncle's,thin,straight,shoulders,the,proud,tilt,of,his,head,[END]
and,she,understood,[END]
she,would,have,done,the,same,[END]
she,understood,too,why,she'd,been,wrong,to,offer,ballyhara,as,a,substitute,for,land,he'd,farmed,all,his,life,[END]
it,made,all,his,work,meaningless,and,the,work,of,his,sons,his,brothers,his,father,his,father's,father,[END]
robert,raised,the,rent,didn't,he,[END]
because,i,made,that,smart,remark,about,his,gloves,[END]
he,was,going,to,pay,me,back,through,you,[END]
robert's,a,greedy,man,[END]
there's,no,saying,that,it's,anything,to,do,with,you,[END]
will,you,allow,me,to,help,[END]
it,would,be,an,honor,[END]
scarlett,saw,approval,in,old,daniel's,eyes,[END]
then,a,glint,of,humor,[END]
there's,patrick's,boy,michael,[END]
he,works,in,the,stables,at,the,big,house,[END]
he,has,grand,ideas,about,breeding,horses,[END]

i'm,a,truly,terrible,cook,you,should,know,[END]

mrs,fitzpatrick,looked,at,her,[END]
i,don't,cook,well,either,scarlett,said,hastily,[END]
she,didn't,think,she,was,going,to,like,this,woman,no,matter,what,colum,said,[END]
right,off,the,bat,when,i,asked,her,what,her,name,was,she,answered,mrs,[END]
fitzpatrick,[END]
she,knew,i,meant,her,first,name,[END]
i've,never,called,a,servant,mrs,or,mr,or,miss,[END]
but,then,i've,never,had,a,white,servant,[END]
kathleen,as,lady's,maid,doesn't,count,or,bridie,[END]
they're,my,cousins,[END]
i'm,glad,mrs,fitzpatrick,is,no,kin,of,mine,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,was,a,tall,woman,at,least,half,a,head,taller,than,scarlett,[END]
she,was,not,thin,but,there,was,no,fat,on,her,she,looked,solid,as,a,tree,[END]
it,was,impossible,to,tell,how,old,she,was,[END]
her,skin,was,flawless,like,the,skin,of,most,irish,women,product,of,the,constant,soft,moisture,in,the,air,[END]
it,had,the,look,of,heavy,cream,[END]
the,color,in,her,cheeks,was,dramatic,a,streak,of,deep,rose,rather,than,an,all-over,blush,[END]
her,nose,was,thick,a,peasant's,nose,but,with,prominent,bone,and,her,lips,were,a,thin,wide,slash,[END]
most,startling,and,distinctive,of,all,were,her,dark,surprisingly,delicate,eyebrows,[END]
they,formed,a,perfect,thin,feathered,arch,above,her,blue,eyes,strange,contrast,to,her,snow-white,hair,[END]
she,was,wearing,a,severe,gray,gown,with,plain,white,linen,collar,and,cuffs,[END]
her,strong,capable,hands,were,folded,in,her,lap,[END]
scarlett,felt,like,sitting,on,her,own,roughened,hands,[END]
mrs,fitzgerald's,were,smooth,her,short,nails,buffed,her,cuticles,perfect,white,half-moons,[END]
there,was,an,english,seasoning,in,her,irish,voice,[END]
still,soft,but,it,had,lost,some,music,to,clipped,consonants,[END]
i,know,what,she,is,scarlett,realized,she's,businesslike,[END]
the,thought,made,her,feel,better,[END]
she,could,deal,with,a,businesswoman,whether,she,liked,her,or,not,[END]
i,am,confident,that,you,will,find,my,services,useful,mrs,o'hara,said,mrs,fitzpatrick,and,there,was,no,possible,doubt,that,mrs,fitzpatrick,was,confident,about,everything,she,did,or,said,[END]
scarlett,felt,irritated,[END]
was,this,woman,challenging,her,[END]
did,she,intend,to,run,things,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,was,still,speaking,i,would,like,to,express,my,pleasure,at,meeting,you,and,in,working,for,you,[END]
i,shall,be,honored,to,be,housekeeper,for,the,o'hara,[END]
what,did,she,mean,[END]
the,dark,brows,arched,[END]
do,you,not,know,[END]
everyone,is,talking,of,nothing,else,[END]
mrs,fitzgerald's,thin,wide,mouth,parted,in,a,gleaming,smile,[END]
no,woman,in,our,lifetime,has,ever,done,it,perhaps,no,woman,in,many,hundreds,of,years,[END]
they're,calling,you,the,o'hara,head,of,the,family,o'hara,in,all,its,branches,and,ramifications,[END]
in,the,days,of,the,high,kings,each,family,had,its,leader,representative,champion,[END]
some,distant,ancestor,of,yours,was,the,o'hara,who,stood,for,all,the,valor,and,pride,of,all,other,o'haras,[END]
today,that,designation,has,been,reborn,for,you,[END]
i,don't,understand,[END]
what,do,i,have,to,do,[END]
you've,already,done,it,[END]
you're,respected,and,admired,trusted,and,honored,[END]
the,title's,awarded,not,inherited,[END]
you,have,only,to,be,what,you,are,[END]
you,are,the,o'hara,[END]
i,think,i'll,have,a,cup,of,tea,said,scarlett,weakly,[END]
she,didn't,know,what,mrs,fitzpatrick,was,talking,about,[END]
was,she,joking,[END]
mocking,[END]
no,she,could,tell,this,was,not,a,woman,who,made,jokes,[END]
what,did,it,mean,the,o'hara,[END]
scarlett,tried,it,silently,on,her,tongue,[END]
the,o'hara,[END]
it,was,like,a,drumbeat,[END]
deep,hidden,buried,primitive,something,within,her,kindled,[END]
the,o'hara,[END]
a,light,grew,in,her,pale,tired,eyes,making,them,glow,green,fire,emerald,[END]
the,o'hara,[END]
i'll,have,to,think,about,that,tomorrow,[END]
and,every,day,for,the,rest,of,my,life,[END]
oh,i,feel,so,different,so,strong,[END]
only,be,what,you,are,[END]
she,said,[END]
what,does,that,mean,[END]
the,o'hara,[END]
your,tea,mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
thank,you,mrs,[END]
fitzpatrick,[END]
somehow,the,intimidating,self-confidence,of,the,older,woman,had,become,admirable,not,irritating,[END]
scarlett,took,the,cup,and,looked,into,the,other,woman's,eyes,[END]
please,have,some,tea,with,me,she,said,[END]
we,need,to,talk,about,a,cook,and,other,things,[END]
we,have,only,six,weeks,and,a,lot,to,do,[END]
scarlett,had,never,been,in,the,big,house,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,hid,her,astonishment,and,her,own,curiosity,about,it,[END]
she'd,been,housekeeper,to,a,prominent,family,directress,of,a,very,big,house,but,it,had,not,approached,the,big,house,at,ballyhara,in,magnificence,[END]
she,helped,scarlett,turn,the,huge,tarnished,brass,key,in,the,great,rusted,lock,and,threw,her,weight,against,the,door,[END]
mildew,she,said,when,the,smell,hit,them,[END]
we'll,need,an,army,of,women,with,pails,and,scrubbing,brushes,[END]
let's,have,a,look,at,the,kitchen,first,[END]
no,cook,worth,having,is,going,to,come,to,a,house,without,a,first-class,kitchen,[END]
this,part,of,the,house,can,be,done,later,[END]
just,ignore,the,paper,falling,off,the,walls,and,the,animal,droppings,on,the,floor,[END]
the,cook,won't,even,see,these,rooms,[END]
curved,colonnades,connected,two,large,wing,buildings,to,the,main,block,of,the,house,[END]
they,followed,the,one,to,the,east,first,and,found,themselves,in,a,large,corner,room,[END]
doors,opened,onto,interior,corridors,that,led,to,more,rooms,and,a,staircase,to,yet,more,rooms,[END]
you'll,put,your,steward,to,work,here,said,mrs,fitzpatrick,when,they,returned,to,the,large,corner,room,[END]
the,other,rooms,will,do,for,servants,and,storerooms,[END]
stewards,do,not,live,in,the,big,house,you'll,have,to,give,him,a,dwelling,in,the,town,a,large,one,in,keeping,with,his,position,as,manager,of,the,estate,[END]
this,is,obviously,the,estate,office,[END]
scarlett,didn't,reply,at,once,[END]
she,was,seeing,another,office,in,her,mind,and,the,wing,of,another,big,house,[END]
bachelor,guests,had,used,the,wing,at,dunmore,landing,rhett,had,said,[END]
well,she,didn't,plan,to,have,a,dozen,rooms',worth,of,bachelor,guests,or,any,other,kind,of,guests,[END]
but,she,could,certainly,use,an,office,just,like,rhett's,[END]
she'd,get,the,carpenter,to,make,her,a,big,desk,twice,as,big,as,rhett's,and,she'd,hang,the,estate,maps,on,the,walls,and,she'd,look,out,the,window,just,the,way,he,did,[END]
but,she,would,see,the,cleancut,stones,of,ballyhara,not,a,pile,of,burnt,bricks,and,she'd,have,fields,of,wheat,not,a,passel,of,flower,bushes,[END]
i'll,be,the,steward,at,ballyhara,mrs,fitzpatrick,[END]
i,don't,intend,to,have,a,stranger,manage,my,place,[END]
i,mean,no,disrespect,mrs,o'hara,but,you,don't,know,what,you're,saying,[END]
it's,a,full-time,occupation,[END]
not,only,maintaining,the,stores,and,supplies,but,also,listening,to,complaints,and,settling,disputes,between,workers,and,farmers,and,the,people,of,the,town,[END]
i'll,do,it,[END]
we'll,put,benches,along,that,hallway,for,people,to,sit,on,and,i'll,see,anyone,with,a,problem,on,the,first,sunday,of,every,month,after,mass,[END]
scarlett's,firm,jaw,told,the,housekeeper,that,there,was,no,point,in,arguing,[END]
and,mrs,fitzpatrick,there,will,be,no,spittoons,is,that,clear,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,nodded,even,though,she,had,never,heard,the,word,before,[END]
in,ireland,tobacco,was,smoked,in,a,pipe,not,chewed,[END]
good,said,scarlett,[END]
now,let's,find,this,kitchen,you're,so,worried,about,[END]
it,must,be,in,the,other,wing,[END]
do,you,feel,up,to,walking,all,that,way,[END]
asked,mrs,fitzpatrick,[END]
it,has,to,be,done,said,scarlett,[END]
walking,was,torture,for,her,feet,and,her,back,but,there,was,no,question,about,doing,it,[END]
she,was,appalled,by,the,condition,of,the,house,[END]
how,would,it,ever,be,done,in,six,weeks,[END]
it,has,to,be,that's,all,[END]
the,baby,must,be,born,in,the,big,house,[END]
magnificent,was,mrs,fitzpatrick's,pronouncement,about,the,kitchen,[END]
the,room,was,cavernous,and,two,stories,high,with,broken,skylights,in,the,roof,[END]
scarlett,was,sure,she'd,never,been,in,a,ballroom,half,as,large,[END]
a,tremendous,stone,chimney,nearly,covered,the,wall,at,the,far,end,of,the,room,[END]
doors,on,each,side,of,it,led,to,a,stonesinked,scullery,on,the,north,side,an,empty,room,on,the,south,[END]
the,cook,can,sleep,here,that's,good,and,that,mrs,[END]
fitzpatrick,pointed,upward,is,the,most,intelligent,arrangement,i've,ever,seen,[END]
a,balustraded,gallery,ran,the,length,of,the,kitchen,wall,at,the,second-story,level,[END]
the,rooms,above,the,cook's,and,the,scullery,will,be,mine,[END]
the,kitchen,maids,and,the,cook,will,never,know,when,i,might,be,watching,them,[END]
that,should,keep,them,alert,[END]
the,gallery,must,connect,to,the,second,floor,of,the,house,itself,[END]
you,can,come,over,too,to,see,what's,going,on,in,the,kitchen,below,[END]
they'll,keep,working,all,the,time,[END]
why,couldn't,i,just,go,in,the,kitchen,and,see,[END]
because,they'd,stop,working,to,curtsey,and,wait,for,orders,while,the,food,scorched,[END]
you,keep,talking,about,they',and,maids,',mrs,fitzpatrick,[END]
what,happened,to,the,cook,[END]
i,thought,we,were,going,to,get,one,woman,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick's,hand,gestured,to,the,expanses,of,floor,and,wall,and,windows,[END]
one,woman,couldn't,manage,all,this,[END]
no,competent,woman,would,try,[END]
i'd,like,to,see,the,storerooms,and,laundry,probably,in,the,basement,[END]
do,you,want,to,come,down,[END]
not,really,[END]
i'll,sit,outside,away,from,the,smell,[END]
she,found,a,door,[END]
it,led,out,into,an,overgrown,walled,garden,[END]
scarlett,backed,into,the,kitchen,[END]
a,second,door,opened,onto,the,colonnade,[END]
she,lowered,herself,to,the,paved,floor,and,leaned,against,a,column,[END]
a,heavy,fatigue,pressed,on,her,[END]
she'd,no,idea,the,house,would,need,so,much,work,[END]
from,the,outside,it,looked,as,if,it,was,almost,intact,[END]
the,baby,kicked,and,she,absentmindedly,pushed,the,foot,or,whatever,back,down,[END]
hey,little,baby,she,murmured,what,do,you,think,of,this,[END]
they're,calling,your,mother,the,o'hara,',[END]
i,hope,you're,impressed,[END]
i,sure,am,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,eyes,to,take,it,all,in,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,came,out,brushing,cobwebs,from,her,clothes,[END]
it,will,do,she,said,succinctly,[END]
now,what,we,both,need,is,a,good,meal,[END]
we'll,go,to,kennedy's,bar,[END]
the,bar,[END]
ladies,don't,go,unescorted,to,bars,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,smiled,[END]
it's,your,bar,mrs,o'hara,[END]
you,can,go,there,whenever,you,please,[END]
you,can,go,anywhere,at,all,whenever,you,like,[END]
you,are,the,o'hara,[END]
scarlett,turned,the,thought,over,in,her,mind,[END]
this,wasn't,charleston,or,atlanta,[END]
why,shouldn't,she,go,to,the,bar,[END]
hadn't,she,nailed,down,half,the,floorboards,herself,[END]
and,didn't,everyone,say,that,mrs,kennedy,the,barkeeper's,wife,made,a,pastry,for,her,meat,pies,that,would,melt,in,your,mouth,[END]
the,weather,turned,rainy,not,the,brief,showers,or,misty,days,that,scarlett,had,gotten,used,to,but,real,torrents,of,rain,that,lasted,sometimes,for,three,to,four,hours,[END]
the,farmers,complained,about,the,soil,compacting,if,they,walked,on,the,newly,cleared,fields,to,spread,the,cartloads,of,manure,scarlett,had,bought,[END]
but,scarlett,forcing,herself,to,walk,daily,to,check,the,progress,at,the,big,house,blessed,the,mud,on,the,ungravelled,drive,because,it,cushioned,her,swollen,feet,[END]
she,gave,up,boots,altogether,and,kept,a,bucket,of,water,inside,her,front,door,to,rinse,her,feet,when,she,came,in,[END]
colum,laughed,when,he,saw,it,[END]
the,irish,in,you,is,strengthening,every,day,scarlett,darling,[END]
did,you,learn,that,from,kathleen,[END]
from,the,cousins,when,they,came,in,from,the,fields,[END]
they,always,washed,the,earth,off,their,feet,[END]
i,figured,it,was,because,kathleen,would,be,mad,if,they,tracked,up,her,clean,floor,[END]
not,a,bit,of,it,[END]
they,did,it,because,irishmen,and,women,too,have,done,it,as,long,as,anyone's,great-grandfather,can,remember,[END]
do,you,shout,seachain',before,you,throw,the,water,out,[END]
don't,be,silly,of,course,not,[END]
i,don't,put,a,bowl,of,milk,on,the,doorstep,every,night,either,[END]
i,don't,believe,i'm,likely,to,drench,any,fairies,or,give,them,supper,[END]
that's,all,childish,superstition,[END]
so,you,say,[END]
but,one,day,a,pooka's,going,to,get,you,for,your,insolence,[END]
he,looked,nervously,under,her,bed,and,pillow,[END]
scarlett,had,to,laugh,[END]
all,right,i'll,bite,colum,[END]
what's,a,pooka,[END]
second,cousin,to,a,leprechaun,i,suppose,[END]
the,leprechauns,would,shudder,at,the,suggestion,[END]
a,pooka,is,a,fearful,creature,malicious,and,sly,[END]
he'll,curdle,your,cream,in,an,instant,or,tangle,your,hair,with,your,own,brush,[END]
or,swell,my,ankles,i,guess,[END]
that's,as,malicious,as,anything,i've,ever,been,through,[END]
poor,lamb,[END]
how,much,longer,[END]
about,three,weeks,[END]
i've,told,mrs,fitzpatrick,to,clean,out,a,room,for,me,and,order,in,a,bed,[END]
are,you,finding,her,helpful,scarlett,[END]
she,had,to,admit,she,was,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,wasn't,so,taken,with,her,position,that,she,minded,working,hard,herself,[END]
plenty,of,times,scarlett,had,found,her,scrubbing,the,stone,floor,and,stone,sinks,in,the,kitchen,herself,to,show,the,maids,how,to,do,it,[END]
but,colum,she's,been,spending,money,like,there's,no,end,to,it,[END]
three,maids,i've,got,up,there,already,just,to,get,things,nice,enough,so,that,a,cook,will,be,willing,to,come,[END]
and,a,stove,the,likes,of,which,i've,never,seen,all,kinds,of,burners,and,ovens,and,a,well,thing,for,hot,water,[END]
it,cost,almost,a,hundred,pounds,and,ten,more,to,haul,it,from,the,railroad,[END]
then,after,all,that,nothing,would,do,but,to,have,the,smith,make,all,kinds,of,cranes,and,spits,and,hooks,for,the,fireplace,[END]
just,in,case,the,cook,doesn't,like,stove,ovens,for,some,things,[END]
cooks,must,be,more,spoiled,than,the,queen,[END]
more,useful,too,[END]
you'll,be,glad,when,you,sit,down,to,your,first,good,meal,in,your,own,dining,room,[END]
so,you,say,[END]
i'm,happy,enough,with,mrs,kennedy's,meat,pies,[END]
i,ate,three,last,night,[END]
one,for,me,and,two,for,this,elephant,inside,me,[END]
oh,i'll,be,so,happy,when,this,is,over,[END]
colum,[END]
he'd,been,away,and,scarlett,didn't,feel,as,easy,with,him,as,she,used,to,but,she,needed,to,ask,him,anyhow,[END]
have,you,heard,about,this,the,o'hara',business,[END]
he,had,and,he,was,proud,of,her,and,he,thought,it,was,deserved,[END]
you're,a,remarkable,woman,scarlett,o'hara,[END]
no,one,who,knows,you,thinks,otherwise,[END]
you've,ridden,over,blows,that,would,fell,a,lesser,woman,or,a,man,as,well,[END]
and,you've,never,moaned,or,asked,pity,[END]
he,smiled,roguishly,[END]
you've,done,what's,near,miraculous,too,getting,all,these,irish,to,work,the,way,they,have,[END]
and,spitting,in,the,eyes,of,the,english,officer,well,they,say,you,put,out,the,sight,in,one,of,them,from,a,hundred,paces,[END]
that's,not,true,[END]
and,why,should,a,grand,tale,be,tarnished,by,the,truth,[END]
old,daniel,himself,was,the,first,who,called,you,the,o'hara,and,he,was,there,[END]
old,daniel,[END]
scarlett,flushed,with,pleasure,[END]
you'll,be,swapping,stories,with,finn,maccool's,ghost,one,day,soon,to,hear,the,talk,[END]
the,whole,countryside's,richer,for,having,you,here,[END]

i,go,to,mass,every,sunday,even,though,father,flynn,looks,like,he,might,fall,asleep,any,minute,[END]
i'm,not,speaking,of,the,church,[END]
i'm,talking,about,the,fairies,and,the,pookas,and,that,[END]
one,of,the,mighty,deeds,you're,praised,for,is,moving,back,to,the,o'hara,land,when,everyone,knows,it's,haunted,by,the,ghost,of,the,young,lord,[END]
you,can't,be,serious,[END]
i,can,and,i,am,[END]
it,matters,not,whether,you,believe,or,not,[END]
the,irish,people,do,[END]
if,you,mock,what,they,believe,in,you're,spitting,in,their,eyes,[END]
scarlett,could,see,that,silly,as,it,all,was,[END]
i'll,hold,my,tongue,and,i,won't,laugh,unless,it's,at,you,but,i'm,not,going,to,holler,before,i,empty,the,bucket,[END]
you,don't,have,to,[END]
they're,saying,you're,so,respectful,you,whisper,real,soft,[END]
scarlett,laughed,until,she,disturbed,the,baby,and,was,kicked,mightily,[END]
now,look,what,you,did,colum,[END]
my,insides,are,black,and,blue,[END]
but,it's,worth,it,[END]

i'm,a,missionary,priest,working,to,ease,the,sufferings,of,the,poor,[END]
i,perform,no,sacraments,[END]
you,could,make,an,exception,[END]
that,i,could,not,and,that's,an,end,of,it,[END]
but,the,grandest,of,godfathers,i'll,be,if,asked,and,see,to,it,that,father,flynn,doesn't,drop,the,babe,in,the,font,or,on,the,floor,and,i'll,teach,him,his,catechism,with,such,eloquence,that,he'll,think,he's,learning,a,limerick,instead,[END]

62,[END]
the,three,country,girls,stood,in,the,wide,doorway,of,the,big,house,bedroom,scarlett,had,chosen,for,her,own,[END]
all,were,wearing,big,homespun,aprons,and,wide-ruffled,mobcaps,but,that,was,the,only,thing,about,them,that,was,the,same,[END]
annie,doyle,was,as,small,and,round,as,a,puppy,mary,moran,as,tall,and,ungainly,as,a,scarecrow,peggy,quinn,as,neat,and,pretty,as,an,expensive,doll,[END]
they,were,holding,hands,and,crowded,together,[END]

at,least,they're,willing,[END]
even,the,rain,wouldn't,have,bothered,them,if,today,wasn't,halloween,[END]
i,suppose,they,think,if,clouds,darken,the,sky,it's,the,same,as,nightfall,[END]
she,looked,at,the,gold,watch,pinned,on,her,bosom,[END]
it's,only,a,little,after,two,[END]
let's,get,back,where,we,were,[END]
i'm,afraid,that,all,this,wet,will,keep,us,from,finishing,mrs,o'hara,[END]
i,wish,it,weren't,so,but,i'm,not,going,to,lie,to,you,[END]
we've,got,all,the,old,paper,off,the,walls,and,everything,scrubbed,and,fresh,[END]

two,weeks,just,isn't,enough,[END]
scarlett's,jaw,hardened,[END]
i,am,going,to,have,my,baby,in,this,house,mrs,fitzpatrick,[END]

scarlett,looked,at,the,gray,waterstained,cracked,plaster,with,gloom,[END]
it,looks,horrible,she,said,[END]
a,rug,and,furniture,will,make,a,great,difference,[END]
i've,got,a,surprise,for,you,[END]
we,found,it,in,the,attic,[END]

she,opened,the,door,to,an,adjoining,room,[END]
scarlett,walked,heavily,to,the,door,then,burst,out,laughing,[END]
god's,nightgown,[END]
what,is,it,[END]
it's,called,a,state,bed,[END]
isn't,it,remarkable,[END]
she,laughed,with,scarlett,while,they,stared,at,the,extraordinary,object,in,the,center,of,the,room,[END]
it,was,immense,at,least,ten,feet,long,and,eight,wide,[END]
four,enormously,thick,dark,oak,posts,carved,to,look,like,greek,goddesses,supported,a,tester,frame,on,their,laurel-wreathed,heads,[END]
the,head,and,footboards,were,carved,in,deep,relief,with,scenes,of,toga-clad,men,in,heroic,postures,beneath,bowers,of,intertwined,grapes,and,flowers,[END]
at,the,rounded,peak,of,the,tall,headboard,there,was,a,flaking,gold-leafed,crown,[END]
what,kind,of,giant,do,you,reckon,slept,in,it,[END]
asked,carlett,[END]
it,was,probably,made,especially,for,a,visit,from,the,viceroy,[END]
who's,that,[END]
the,head,of,the,government,in,ireland,[END]
well,i'll,say,this,for,it,it's,big,enough,for,this,giant,baby,i'm,having,[END]
if,the,doctor,can,reach,far,enough,to,catch,it,when,it,comes,[END]
then,shall,i,order,the,mattress,made,[END]
there's,a,man,in,trim,who,can,do,it,in,two,days,[END]

this,is,all,new,said,scarlett,suspiciously,[END]
she,didn't,like,any,spending,without,her,approval,[END]
and,the,cushioned,chairs,by,the,stove,looked,too,cozy,altogether,for,cooks,and,maids,who,were,supposed,to,be,working,[END]
what,did,this,cost,[END]
she,tapped,the,big,heavy,wood,table,[END]
a,few,bars,of,soap,[END]
it,was,in,the,tack,room,filthy,dirty,[END]
the,chairs,are,from,colum's,house,[END]
he,suggested,we,woo,the,cook,into,comfort,before,she,sees,the,rest,of,the,house,[END]
i've,made,a,list,of,furniture,for,her,room,[END]
it's,on,the,table,there,for,your,approval,[END]
scarlett,felt,guilty,[END]
then,she,suspected,that,she,was,supposed,to,feel,guilty,and,she,felt,cross,[END]
what,about,all,those,lists,i,approved,last,week,[END]
when,are,those,things,coming,[END]
most,of,them,are,here,in,the,scullery,[END]

scarlett,felt,cross,again,[END]
her,back,was,hurting,worse,than,usual,[END]
she,put,her,hands,over,the,pain,[END]
then,a,new,pain,ripped,through,her,side,and,down,her,leg,shoving,the,back,pain,into,insignificance,[END]
she,grabbed,the,side,of,the,table,for,support,and,stared,dumbly,at,the,liquid,streaming,down,her,legs,and,across,her,bare,feet,to,pool,on,the,scrubbed,stone,floor,[END]

the,ripping,pain,was,not,repeated,[END]
with,the,chair,cushions,under,her,head,and,the,small,of,her,back,scarlett,was,quite,comfortable,[END]
she,wished,she,had,something,to,drink,but,she,decided,she'd,better,not,get,off,the,table,[END]
if,the,pain,came,back,she,might,fall,and,hurt,herself,[END]
i,probably,shouldn't,have,sent,mrs,fitzpatrick,off,to,scare,people,to,death,like,that,[END]
i've,only,had,three,pains,since,she,left,and,they,were,hardly,anything,[END]
i'd,really,feel,fine,if,there,wasn't,so,much,blood,[END]
every,pain,and,every,time,the,baby,kicks,it,just,gushes,out,[END]

before,the,sound,was,gone,the,cailleach,was,holding,a,bloodcovered,baby,in,her,two,hands,[END]
she,spit,something,she,was,holding,in,her,mouth,onto,the,floor,then,blew,into,the,baby's,mouth,once,twice,thrice,[END]
the,baby's,arms,jerked,then,its,legs,[END]
colum,whispered,the,hail,mary,[END]
a,whisk,of,the,knife,cut,the,cord,the,baby,was,laid,on,the,folded,sheets,and,the,woman,was,back,beside,scarlett,[END]
hold,the,lamps,closer,she,said,[END]
her,hands,and,fingers,moved,quickly,sometimes,with,a,flash,of,the,knife,and,bloody,bits,of,membrane,fell,to,the,floor,beside,her,feet,[END]
she,poured,more,dark,fluid,between,scarlett's,lips,then,a,colorless,one,into,the,horrible,wound,in,her,belly,[END]
her,cracked,humming,accompanied,the,small,precise,movements,as,she,sewed,the,wound,together,[END]
wrap,her,in,linen,then,in,wool,while,i,wash,the,babe,she,said,[END]
her,knife,slashed,through,the,ropes,binding,scarlett,[END]
when,colum,and,mrs,fitzpatrick,were,finished,the,woman,returned,with,scarlett's,baby,swaddled,in,a,soft,white,blanket,[END]
the,midwife,forgot,this,the,cailleach,said,[END]
her,chuckle,brought,an,answering,throaty,sound,from,the,baby,and,the,infant,girl,opened,her,eyes,[END]
the,blue,irises,looked,like,pale,tinted,rings,around,the,black,unfocused,pupils,[END]
she,had,long,black,lashes,and,two,tiny,lines,for,eyebrows,[END]
she,was,not,red,and,misshapen,like,most,newborns,because,she,had,not,passed,through,the,birth,canal,[END]
her,tiny,nose,and,ears,and,mouth,and,soft,pulsing,skull,were,perfect,[END]
her,olive,skin,was,very,dark,against,the,white,blanket,[END]
63,[END]
scarlett,struggled,towards,the,voices,and,the,light,her,sedated,mind,vaguely,perceived,[END]
there,was,something,[END]
something,important,[END]
a,question,[END]
firm,hands,held,her,head,gentle,fingers,parted,her,lips,a,cooling,sweet,liquid,bathed,her,tongue,trickled,down,her,throat,and,she,slept,again,[END]
the,next,time,she,fought,for,consciousness,she,remembered,what,the,question,was,the,vital,the,all-important,question,[END]
the,baby,[END]
was,it,dead,[END]
her,hands,fumbled,to,her,abdomen,and,burning,pain,leapt,at,her,touch,[END]
her,teeth,bruised,her,lips,her,hands,pressed,harder,fell,away,[END]
there,was,no,kicking,no,firm,rounded,lumpiness,that,was,a,questing,foot,[END]
the,baby,had,died,[END]
scarlett,uttered,a,weak,cry,of,misery,no,louder,than,a,mew,and,the,releasing,sweet,draught,poured,into,her,mouth,[END]
throughout,her,drugged,sleep,slow,weak,tears,seeped,from,her,closed,eyes,[END]
semiconscious,for,the,third,time,she,tried,to,hold,on,to,the,darkness,to,stay,asleep,to,push,the,world,away,[END]
but,the,pain,grew,tore,at,her,made,her,move,to,flee,it,and,the,moving,gave,it,such,strength,that,she,whimpered,helplessly,[END]
the,cool,glass,vial,tipped,and,she,was,freed,[END]
later,when,she,floated,again,to,the,edges,of,consciousness,she,opened,her,mouth,in,readiness,eager,for,the,dreamless,darkness,[END]
instead,there,was,a,cold,wet,cloth,wiping,her,lips,and,a,voice,she,knew,but,couldn't,remember,[END]
scarlett,darling,[END]
katie,scarlett,o'hara,[END]

that's,a,good,girl,scarlett,darling,[END]
open,your,eyes,i've,something,for,you,[END]
his,coaxing,tone,was,insistent,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,opened,[END]
someone,had,moved,the,lamp,and,the,dimness,was,easy,[END]
there's,my,friend,colum,[END]
she,tried,to,smile,but,memory,flooded,her,mind,and,her,lips,crumpled,into,childlike,bubbling,sobs,[END]

she,could,see,colum's,face,colum's,smile,[END]
not,dead,mavourneen,not,dead,[END]
here,[END]
look,[END]
scarlett,turned,her,head,on,the,pillow,[END]
why,was,it,so,hard,just,to,turn,her,head,[END]
a,pale,bundle,in,someone's,hands,was,there,[END]
your,daughter,katie,scarlett,said,colum,[END]
he,parted,the,folds,of,the,blanket,and,she,saw,the,tiny,sleeping,face,[END]
oh,scarlett,breathed,[END]
so,small,and,so,perfect,and,so,helpless,[END]
look,at,the,skin,like,rose,petals,like,cream,no,she's,browner,than,cream,the,rose,is,only,a,hint,of,rose,[END]
she,looks,sun-browned,like,[END]
like,a,baby,pirate,[END]
she,looks,exactly,like,rhett,[END]
rhett,[END]
why,aren't,you,here,to,see,your,baby,[END]
your,beautiful,dark,baby,[END]
my,beautiful,dark,baby,[END]
let,me,look,at,you,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,strange,and,frightening,weakness,a,warmth,that,washed,through,her,body,like,a,strong,low,enveloping,wave,of,painless,burning,[END]
the,baby,opened,her,eyes,[END]
they,stared,directly,into,scarlett's,[END]
and,scarlett,felt,love,[END]
without,conditions,without,demands,without,reasons,without,questions,without,bounds,without,reserve,without,self,[END]
hey,little,baby,she,said,[END]
now,drink,your,medicine,said,colum,[END]
the,tiny,dark,face,was,gone,[END]
no,[END]
no,i,want,my,baby,[END]
where,is,she,[END]
you'll,have,her,next,time,you,wake,up,[END]
open,your,mouth,scarlett,darling,[END]
i,won't,she,tried,to,say,but,the,drops,were,on,her,tongue,and,in,a,moment,the,darkness,closed,over,her,[END]
she,slept,smiling,a,glow,of,life,under,her,deathly,paleness,[END]
perhaps,it,was,because,the,baby,looked,like,rhett,perhaps,it,was,because,scarlett,always,valued,most,what,she,fought,hardest,for,or,perhaps,it,was,because,she'd,had,so,many,months,with,the,irish,who,adored,children,[END]
more,likely,it,was,one,of,the,wonders,that,life,gives,for,no,cause,at,all,[END]
whatever,the,origin,pure,consuming,love,had,come,to,scarlett,o'hara,after,a,lifetime,of,emptiness,not,knowing,what,she,lacked,[END]
scarlett,refused,to,take,any,more,pain-killer,[END]
the,long,red,scar,on,her,body,was,like,a,streak,of,white-hot,steel,but,it,was,forgotten,in,the,overwhelming,joy,she,felt,whenever,she,touched,her,baby,or,even,looked,at,her,[END]
send,her,away,[END]
scarlett,said,when,the,healthy,young,wet,nurse,was,brought,in,[END]
time,after,time,i,had,to,bind,my,breasts,and,suffer,agonies,while,the,milk,dried,up,all,to,be,a,lady,and,keep,my,figure,[END]
i'm,going,to,nurse,this,baby,have,her,close,to,me,[END]
i'll,feed,her,and,make,her,strong,and,see,her,grow,[END]
when,the,baby,found,her,nipple,the,first,time,and,nursed,greedily,with,a,tiny,wrinkle,of,concentration,on,her,brow,scarlett,smiled,down,at,her,with,triumph,[END]
you're,a,momma's,girl,all,right,hungry,as,a,wolf,and,fixed,on,getting,what,you,want,[END]
the,baby,was,baptized,in,scarlett's,bedroom,because,scarlett,was,too,weak,to,walk,[END]
father,flynn,stood,near,the,viceregal,bed,where,she,was,propped,up,against,lace-trimmed,pillows,holding,the,baby,in,her,arms,until,she,had,to,give,her,over,to,colum,who,was,godfather,kathleen,and,mrs,fitzpatrick,were,godmothers,[END]
the,baby,wore,an,embroidered,linen,gown,thin,from,washings,that,had,been,worn,by,hundreds,of,o'hara,babies,for,generation,after,generation,[END]
she,was,named,katie,colum,o'hara,[END]
she,waved,her,arms,and,kicked,her,legs,when,the,water,touched,her,but,she,didn't,cry,[END]
kathleen,wore,her,best,blue,frock,with,a,lace,collar,although,she,should,have,been,in,mourning,[END]
old,katie,scarlett,was,dead,[END]
however,everyone,agreed,that,scarlett,should,not,be,told,until,she,was,stronger,[END]
rosaleen,fitzpatrick,watched,father,flynn,from,hawk-like,eyes,poised,to,snatch,the,baby,if,he,faltered,for,a,second,[END]
she'd,been,speechless,for,a,long,minute,after,scarlett,asked,her,to,serve,as,godmother,[END]
how,did,you,guess,how,i,feel,about,this,baby,[END]
she,asked,when,her,voice,returned,[END]
i,didn't,said,scarlett,but,i,know,i,wouldn't,have,a,baby,if,you,hadn't,stopped,that,monster,woman,from,killing,her,[END]
i,remember,a,good,bit,about,that,night,[END]
colum,took,katie,from,father,flynn,when,the,ceremony,was,over,and,put,her,in,scarlett's,outstretched,hands,[END]
then,he,poured,a,tot,of,whiskey,for,the,priest,and,the,godparents,and,made,a,toast,to,the,health,and,happiness,of,mother,and,child,the,o'hara,and,the,newest,of,the,o'haras,[END]
after,that,he,escorted,the,doddering,saintly,old,man,to,kennedy's,bar,where,he,bought,a,few,rounds,for,all,there,in,honor,of,the,occasion,[END]
he,hoped,against,hope,that,it,would,stop,the,rumors,that,were,already,flying,all,over,county,meath,[END]
joe,o'neill,the,blacksmith,had,cowered,in,a,corner,of,ballyhara's,kitchen,until,daylight,then,scuttled,to,his,smithy,to,drink,himself,brave,[END]
though,saint,patrick,himself,would,have,needed,more,than,all,the,prayers,at,his,beckoning,on,that,night,he,told,anyone,who,would,listen,and,there,were,many,[END]
ready,was,i,to,save,the,life,of,the,o'hara,when,the,witch,come,through,the,stone,wall,and,throws,me,with,terrible,force,onto,the,floor,[END]
then,kicks,me,and,i,could,feel,in,my,flesh,that,the,foot,was,no,human,foot,but,a,cloven,hoof,[END]
she,cast,a,spell,on,the,o'hara,then,and,ripped,the,babe,from,the,womb,[END]
all,bloody,was,the,babe,and,blood,on,the,floors,and,the,walls,and,in,the,air,[END]
a,lesser,man,would,have,sheltered,his,eyes,from,such,a,fearful,sight,[END]
but,joseph,o'neill,saw,the,babe's,fine,strong,form,beneath,the,blood,and,i'm,telling,you,it,was,a,manchild,with,manhood,plain,between,its,limbs,[END]
i'll,wash,the,blood,away,',says,the,demon,and,she,turns,her,back,then,presents,to,father,o'hara,a,spindly,frail,near-lifeless,creature,female,and,brown,as,the,earth,of,the,grave,[END]
now,who,will,tell,me,[END]
if,i,didn't,see,a,changeling,what,was,it,i,saw,that,terrible,night,[END]
there's,no,good,will,come,of,it,not,to,the,o'hara,nor,any,man,who's,touched,by,the,shadow,of,the,fairy,babe,left,in,place,of,the,o'hara's,stolen,boy,[END]
the,story,from,dunshaughlin,got,to,ballyhara,after,a,week,[END]
the,o'hara,was,dying,said,the,midwife,and,could,only,be,saved,by,ridding,her,of,the,dead,babe,in,her,womb,[END]
who,would,know,these,things,pitiful,though,they,were,better,than,a,midwife,who'd,seen,all,there,was,to,see,of,childbirth,[END]
of,a,sudden,the,suffering,mother,sat,up,on,her,bed,of,pain,[END]
i,see,it,says,she,the,banshee,[END]
tall,and,clad,all,in,white,with,the,fairy,beauty,on,its,face,[END]
then,the,devils,drove,a,spear,from,hell,through,the,window,and,the,banshee,flew,out,to,wail,the,call,to,death,[END]
it,was,calling,the,soul,of,the,lost,babe,but,the,dead,babe,was,restored,among,the,living,by,sucking,out,the,soul,of,the,good,old,woman,who,was,grandmother,to,the,o'hara,[END]
it,was,the,devil's,work,and,no,mistaking,and,the,babe,the,o'hara,takes,for,her,own,is,nought,but,a,ghoul,[END]
i,feel,that,i,should,warn,scarlett,colum,said,to,rosaleen,fitzpatrick,but,what,can,i,tell,her,[END]
that,people,are,superstitious,[END]
that,all,hallows',eve,is,a,dangerous,birth,date,for,a,baby,[END]
i,cannot,find,any,advice,to,give,her,there's,no,way,to,protect,the,baby,from,talk,[END]
i'll,see,to,katie's,safety,mrs,fitzpatrick,said,[END]
no,one,and,nothing,enters,this,house,unless,i,say,so,and,no,harm,will,come,near,that,tiny,child,[END]
talk,will,be,forgotten,in,time,colum,you,know,that,[END]
something,else,will,come,along,to,weave,tales,about,and,everyone,will,see,that,katie's,only,a,little,girl,like,any,other,little,girl,[END]
a,week,later,mrs,fitzpatrick,took,a,tray,of,tea,and,sandwiches,to,scarlett's,room,and,stood,patiently,while,scarlett,bombarded,her,with,the,same,plaint,she'd,been,making,for,days,[END]
i,don't,see,why,i,have,to,stay,stuck,up,here,in,this,room,forever,[END]
i,feel,plenty,well,enough,to,be,up,and,about,[END]
look,at,the,lovely,sunshine,today,i,want,to,take,katie,out,for,a,ride,in,the,trap,but,the,best,i,can,do,is,sit,by,the,window,and,look,out,at,the,leaves,falling,[END]
i'm,sure,she's,watching,[END]
her,eyes,look,up,and,then,follow,them,floating,down,oh,look,[END]
come,look,[END]
look,at,katie's,eyes,here,in,the,light,[END]
they're,changing,from,blue,[END]
i,thought,they'd,turn,brown,like,rhett's,because,she's,the,spit,of,him,[END]
but,i,can,see,the,first,little,specks,and,they're,green,[END]
she's,going,to,have,my,eyes,[END]
scarlett,nuzzled,the,baby's,neck,[END]
you're,momma's,girl,aren't,you,katie,o'hara,[END]
no,not,katie,[END]
anybody,can,be,a,katie,[END]
i'm,going,to,call,you,kitty,cat,with,your,green,eyes,[END]
she,lifted,the,solemn,baby,up,to,face,the,housekeeper,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,i'd,like,to,introduce,you,to,cat,o'hara,[END]
scarlett's,smile,was,like,sunlight,[END]
rosaleen,fitzpatrick,felt,more,frightened,than,at,any,time,in,her,life,[END]
64,[END]
the,enforced,idleness,of,her,convalescence,gave,scarlett,many,hours,to,think,since,her,baby,spent,most,of,the,day,and,the,night,sleeping,exactly,like,all,other,infants,[END]
scarlett,tried,reading,but,she,had,never,cared,for,it,and,she,had,not,changed,in,that,way,[END]
what,had,changed,was,what,she,thought,about,[END]
first,and,foremost,there,was,her,love,for,cat,[END]
only,weeks,old,the,baby,was,too,young,to,be,responsive,except,in,reacting,to,her,own,hunger,and,the,satisfaction,of,scarlett's,warm,breast,and,milk,[END]
it's,loving,that's,making,me,so,happy,scarlett,realized,[END]
it,has,nothing,to,do,with,being,loved,[END]
i,like,to,think,cat,loves,me,but,the,truth,is,she,loves,to,eat,[END]
scarlett,was,able,to,laugh,at,the,joke,on,herself,[END]
scarlett,o'hara,who'd,made,men,fall,in,love,with,her,as,a,sport,as,an,amusement,was,nothing,more,than,a,source,of,food,to,the,one,person,she,loved,more,than,she'd,ever,loved,in,her,life,[END]
because,she,hadn't,really,loved,ashley,she'd,known,that,for,a,long,time,[END]
she'd,only,wanted,what,she,couldn't,have,and,called,that,love,[END]
i,threw,away,over,ten,years,on,the,false,love,too,and,i,lost,rhett,the,man,i,really,loved,[END]
or,did,i,[END]
she,searched,her,memory,in,spite,of,the,pain,[END]
it,always,hurt,to,think,about,rhett,about,losing,him,about,her,failure,[END]
it,eased,the,pain,some,when,she,thought,about,the,way,he'd,treated,her,and,hatred,burned,away,the,hurt,[END]
but,for,the,most,part,she,managed,to,keep,him,out,of,her,mind,it,was,less,disturbing,[END]
during,these,long,days,with,nothing,to,do,however,her,mind,kept,going,back,over,her,life,and,she,couldn't,avoid,remembering,him,[END]
had,she,loved,him,[END]
i,must,have,she,thought,i,must,love,him,still,or,my,heart,wouldn't,ache,the,way,it,does,when,i,see,his,smile,in,my,mind,hear,his,voice,[END]
but,for,ten,years,she,had,conjured,up,ashley,in,the,same,way,imagining,his,smile,and,his,voice,[END]
and,i,wanted,rhett,most,after,he,left,me,scarlett's,deep,core,of,honesty,reminded,her,[END]
it,was,too,confusing,[END]
it,made,her,head,ache,even,more,than,her,heart,[END]
she,wouldn't,think,about,it,[END]
it,was,much,better,to,think,about,cat,to,think,about,how,happy,she,was,[END]
to,think,about,happiness,[END]
i,was,happy,even,before,cat,came,[END]
i,was,happy,from,the,day,i,went,to,jamie's,house,[END]
not,like,now,i,didn't,dream,anybody,could,ever,feel,as,happy,as,i,do,every,time,i,look,at,cat,every,time,i,hold,her,or,feed,her,[END]
but,i,was,happy,all,the,same,because,the,o'haras,took,me,just,the,way,i,was,[END]
they,never,expected,me,to,be,just,like,them,they,never,made,me,feel,i,had,to,change,they,never,made,me,feel,i,was,wrong,[END]
even,when,i,was,wrong,[END]
i,had,no,call,to,expect,kathleen,to,do,my,hair,and,mend,my,clothes,and,make,my,bed,[END]
i,was,putting,on,airs,[END]
with,people,who,never,did,anything,so,tacky,as,put,on,airs,themselves,[END]
but,they,never,said,oh,stop,putting,on,airs,scarlett,[END]
no,they,just,let,me,do,what,i,was,doing,and,accepted,me,airs,and,all,[END]
just,like,i,was,[END]
i,was,awful,wrong,about,daniel,and,all,moving,to,ballyhara,[END]
i,was,trying,to,make,them,be,a,credit,to,me,[END]
i,wanted,them,to,live,in,grand,houses,and,be,grand,farmers,with,lots,of,land,and,hired,hands,to,do,most,of,the,work,[END]
i,wanted,to,change,them,[END]
i,never,wondered,what,they,wanted,[END]
i,didn't,take,them,just,the,way,they,were,[END]
oh,i'm,never,going,to,do,that,to,cat,[END]
i'm,never,going,to,make,her,different,from,what,she,is,[END]
i'm,always,going,to,love,her,like,i,do,now,with,my,whole,heart,no,matter,what,[END]
mother,never,loved,me,like,i,love,cat,[END]
or,suellen,or,carreen,either,[END]
she,wanted,me,to,be,different,from,me,she,wanted,me,to,be,just,like,her,[END]
all,of,us,that's,what,she,wanted,from,all,three,of,us,[END]
she,was,wrong,[END]
scarlett,recoiled,from,what,was,in,her,head,[END]
she'd,always,believed,her,mother,was,perfect,[END]
it,was,unthinkable,that,ellen,o'hara,could,ever,be,wrong,about,anything,[END]
but,the,thought,would,not,go,away,[END]
it,returned,again,and,again,when,she,was,unprepared,to,shut,it,out,[END]
it,returned,in,different,guises,with,different,embellishments,[END]
it,would,not,leave,her,alone,[END]
mother,was,wrong,[END]
being,a,lady,like,her,isn't,the,only,way,to,be,[END]
it,isn't,even,always,the,best,way,to,be,[END]
not,if,it,doesn't,make,you,happy,[END]
happy,is,the,best,way,to,be,because,then,you,can,let,other,people,be,happy,too,[END]
their,own,way,[END]
mother,wasn't,happy,[END]
she,was,kind,and,patient,and,caring,for,us,children,for,pa,for,the,darkies,[END]
but,not,loving,[END]
not,happy,[END]
oh,poor,mother,[END]
i,wish,you,could,have,felt,the,way,i,feel,now,i,wish,you,could,have,been,happy,[END]
what,was,it,grandfather,had,said,[END]
that,his,daughter,ellen,had,married,gerald,o'hara,to,run,away,from,a,disappointment,in,love,[END]
was,that,why,she,was,never,happy,[END]
was,she,pining,over,someone,she,couldn't,have,the,way,i,pined,over,ashley,[END]
the,way,i,pine,now,over,rhett,when,i,can't,help,it,[END]
what,a,waste,[END]
what,a,horrible,senseless,waste,[END]
when,happiness,was,so,wonderful,how,could,anyone,cling,to,a,love,that,made,them,unhappy,[END]
scarlett,vowed,that,she,wouldn't,do,it,[END]
she,knew,what,it,was,to,be,happy,and,she,would,not,ruin,it,[END]

cat,woke,and,waved,her,helpless,hands,in,protest,[END]
oh,kitty,cat,i'm,sorry,[END]
i,just,had,to,hug,you,some,[END]
they,were,all,wrong,[END]
the,idea,was,so,explosive,that,it,woke,scarlett,from,a,sound,sleep,[END]
they,were,wrong,[END]
all,of,them,the,people,who,cut,me,dead,in,atlanta,aunt,eulalie,and,aunt,pauline,and,just,about,everybody,in,charleston,[END]
they,wanted,me,to,be,just,like,them,and,because,i'm,not,they,disapproved,of,me,made,me,feel,like,there,was,something,terribly,wrong,with,me,made,me,think,i,was,a,bad,person,that,i,deserved,to,be,looked,down,on,[END]
and,there,was,nothing,i,did,that,was,as,terrible,as,all,that,[END]
what,they,punished,me,for,was,that,i,wasn't,minding,their,rules,[END]
i,worked,harder,than,any,field,hand,at,making,money,and,caring,about,money,isn't,ladylike,[END]
never,mind,that,i,was,keeping,tara,going,and,holding,the,aunts',heads,above,water,and,supporting,ashley,and,his,family,and,paying,for,almost,every,piece,of,food,on,the,table,at,aunt,pitty's,plus,keeping,the,roof,fixed,and,the,coal,bin,filled,[END]
they,all,thought,i,shouldn't,have,dirtied,my,hands,with,the,ledgers,from,the,store,or,put,on,a,smile,when,i,sold,lumber,to,the,yankees,[END]
there,were,plenty,enough,things,i,did,that,i,shouldn't,have,done,but,working,for,money,wasn't,one,of,them,and,that's,what,they,blamed,me,for,most,[END]
no,that's,not,quite,it,[END]
they,blamed,me,for,being,successful,at,it,[END]

hypocrites,[END]
what,gives,people,whose,whole,life,is,a,lie,the,right,to,judge,me,[END]
what's,wrong,with,working,as,hard,as,you,can,and,then,more,besides,[END]
why,is,it,so,terrible,to,push,in,and,stop,disaster,from,happening,to,anyone,especially,a,friend,[END]
they,were,wrong,[END]
here,in,ballyhara,i,worked,as,hard,as,i,could,and,i,was,admired,for,it,[END]
i,kept,uncle,daniel,from,losing,his,farm,and,they,started,calling,me,the,o'hara,[END]
that's,why,being,the,o'hara,makes,me,feel,so,strange,and,so,happy,all,at,the,same,time,[END]
it's,because,the,o'hara,is,honored,for,all,the,same,things,that,i've,been,thinking,were,bad,all,these,years,[END]
the,o'hara,would,have,stayed,up,late,doing,the,books,for,the,store,[END]
the,o'hara,would,have,grabbed,ashley,away,from,the,grave,[END]
what,was,it,mrs,fitzpatrick,said,[END]
you,don't,have,to,do,anything,you,only,have,to,be,what,you,are,[END]
what,i,am,is,scarlett,o'hara,who,makes,mistakes,sometimes,and,does,things,right,sometimes,but,who,never,pretends,any,more,to,be,what,she's,not,[END]
i'm,the,o'hara,and,i'd,never,be,called,that,if,i,was,as,bad,as,they,make,me,out,to,be,in,atlanta,[END]
i'm,not,bad,at,all,[END]
i'm,not,a,saint,either,god,knows,[END]
but,i'm,willing,to,be,different,i'm,willing,to,be,who,i,am,not,pretend,to,be,what,i'm,not,[END]
i'm,the,o'hara,and,i'm,proud,of,it,[END]
it,makes,me,happy,and,whole,[END]
cat,made,a,gurgling,noise,to,indicate,that,she,was,awake,too,and,ready,to,be,fed,[END]
scarlett,lifted,her,from,her,basket,and,settled,the,two,of,them,in,the,bed,[END]
she,cupped,the,tiny,unprotected,head,in,one,hand,and,guided,cat,to,her,breast,[END]
i,promise,you,on,my,word,of,honor,cat,o'hara,[END]
you,can,grow,up,to,be,whatever,you,are,even,if,it's,as,different,from,me,as,day,from,night,[END]

i'm,going,out,and,there's,no,more,to,be,said,about,it,[END]
scarlett,glowered,mulishly,at,mrs,fitzpatrick,[END]
the,housekeeper,stood,in,the,open,doorway,like,an,immovable,mountain,[END]
no,you,are,not,[END]
scarlett,changed,her,tactics,[END]
please,do,let,me,she,coaxed,with,the,sweetest,smile,in,her,arsenal,[END]
the,fresh,air,will,do,me,a,world,of,good,[END]
it'll,perk,up,my,appetite,too,and,you,know,how,you've,been,after,me,about,not,eating,enough,[END]
that,will,improve,[END]
the,cook,has,arrived,[END]
scarlett,forgot,that,she,was,being,beguiling,[END]
and,high,time,too,[END]
is,her,high-and-mightiness,bothering,to,say,what,took,her,so,long,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,smiled,[END]
she,started,out,on,time,but,her,piles,bothered,her,so,badly,she,had,to,stop,overnight,every,ten,miles,on,the,way,here,[END]
it,seems,we,won't,have,to,worry,about,her,lazing,in,a,rocking,chair,when,she,should,be,on,her,feet,working,[END]
scarlett,tried,not,to,laugh,but,she,couldn't,help,it,[END]
and,she,couldn't,really,stay,mad,at,mrs,fitzpatrick,they,had,grown,too,close,for,that,[END]
the,older,woman,had,moved,into,the,housekeeper's,apartment,the,day,after,cat,was,born,[END]
she,was,scarlett's,constant,companion,while,she,was,ill,and,readily,available,afterwards,[END]
many,people,came,to,visit,scarlett,in,the,long,convalescent,weeks,after,cat,was,born,[END]
colum,almost,daily,kathleen,almost,every,other,day,her,big,o'hara,men,cousins,after,mass,each,sunday,molly,more,often,than,scarlett,liked,[END]
but,mrs,fitzpatrick,was,always,there,[END]
she,brought,tea,and,cakes,to,the,visitors,whiskey,and,cakes,to,the,men,and,after,the,visitors,left,she,stayed,with,scarlett,to,hear,the,news,the,visitors,had,brought,and,finish,off,the,refreshments,[END]
she,brought,news,herself,about,the,happenings,in,the,town,of,ballyhara,and,in,trim,and,gossip,she'd,heard,in,the,shops,[END]
she,kept,scarlett,from,being,too,lonely,[END]
scarlett,invited,mrs,fitzpatrick,to,call,her,scarlett,and,asked,what's,your,first,name,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,never,told,her,[END]
it,wouldn't,do,for,any,informality,to,develop,she,said,firmly,and,she,explained,the,strict,hierarchy,of,an,irish,big,house,[END]
her,position,as,housekeeper,would,be,undermined,if,the,respect,accorded,to,it,was,diminished,by,familiarity,on,anyone's,part,even,the,mistress's,[END]
perhaps,especially,the,mistress's,[END]
it,was,all,too,subtle,for,scarlett,but,mrs,fitzpatrick's,pleasant,unyieldingness,made,it,clear,to,her,that,it,was,important,[END]
she,settled,for,the,names,the,housekeeper,suggested,[END]
scarlett,could,call,her,mrs,fitz,and,she,would,call,scarlett,mrs,[END]
o,[END]
but,only,when,they,were,alone,together,[END]
in,front,of,other,people,full,formality,had,to,be,maintained,[END]
even,colum,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,know,[END]
mrs,fitz,considered,then,yielded,[END]
colum,was,a,special,case,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,take,advantage,now,of,mrs,fitz's,partiality,to,him,[END]
i'll,only,walk,down,to,colum's,she,said,[END]
he,hasn't,been,to,see,me,for,ages,and,i,miss,him,[END]
he's,away,on,business,and,you,know,it,[END]
i,heard,him,tell,you,he,was,going,[END]
bother,[END]
scarlett,muttered,[END]
you,win,[END]
she,went,back,to,her,chair,by,the,window,and,sat,down,[END]
go,talk,to,miss,piles,[END]
mrs,fitz,laughed,aloud,[END]
by,the,way,she,said,as,she,left,her,name,is,mrs,keane,[END]
but,you,can,call,her,miss,piles,if,you,like,[END]
you'll,likely,never,meet,her,[END]
that's,my,job,[END]
scarlett,waited,until,she,was,sure,mrs,fitz,wouldn't,catch,her,and,then,she,got,ready,to,go,out,[END]
she'd,been,obedient,long,enough,[END]
it,was,an,accepted,fact,that,after,childbirth,a,woman,recuperated,for,a,month,most,of,the,time,in,bed,and,she'd,done,that,[END]
she,didn't,see,why,she,should,have,to,add,three,more,weeks,to,it,just,because,cat's,birth,hadn't,been,normal,[END]
the,doctor,at,ballyhara,struck,her,as,a,good,man,even,reminded,her,a,little,of,dr,meade,[END]
but,dr,devlin,himself,admitted,that,he,had,no,experience,of,babies,brought,by,knife,[END]
why,should,she,listen,to,him,[END]
particularly,when,there,was,something,she,really,had,to,do,[END]
mrs,fitz,had,told,her,about,the,old,woman,who,had,appeared,as,if,by,magic,to,deliver,cat,in,the,middle,of,the,halloween,tempest,[END]
colum,had,told,her,who,the,woman,was,the,cailleach,from,the,tower,[END]
scarlett,owed,the,wise,woman,her,life,and,cat's,[END]
she,had,to,thank,her,[END]
the,cold,took,scarlett,by,surprise,[END]
october,had,been,warm,enough,how,could,one,month,make,so,much,difference,[END]
she,wrapped,the,folds,of,her,cloak,around,the,well-blanketed,baby,[END]
cat,was,awake,[END]
her,large,eyes,looked,at,scarlett's,face,[END]
you,darling,thing,said,scarlett,softly,[END]
you're,so,good,cat,you,never,cry,do,you,[END]
she,walked,through,the,bricked,stableyard,to,the,route,she'd,used,so,often,in,the,trap,[END]
i,know,you're,there,someplace,scarlett,shouted,at,the,thicket,of,undergrowth,beneath,the,trees,that,bordered,the,tower's,clearing,[END]
you,might,as,well,come,on,out,and,talk,to,me,because,i'm,going,to,stand,right,here,freezing,to,death,until,you,do,[END]
the,baby,too,if,that,matters,to,you,[END]
she,waited,confidently,[END]
the,woman,who,had,brought,cat,into,the,world,would,never,let,her,be,exposed,for,long,to,the,cold,damp,in,the,shadow,of,the,tower,[END]
cat's,eyes,left,scarlett's,face,to,move,from,side,to,side,as,if,she,were,looking,for,something,[END]
a,few,minutes,later,scarlett,heard,a,rustling,in,the,thick,growth,of,holly,bushes,to,her,right,[END]
the,wise,woman,stepped,out,between,two,of,them,[END]
this,way,she,said,and,stepped,back,[END]
there,was,a,path,scarlett,saw,when,she,got,near,[END]
she'd,never,have,found,it,if,the,wise,woman,hadn't,held,back,the,spiny,holly,branches,with,one,of,her,shawls,[END]
scarlett,followed,the,path,until,it,disappeared,in,a,grove,of,low-branched,trees,[END]
i,give,up,she,said,where,to,now,[END]
there,was,a,rusty,laugh,behind,her,[END]
this,way,said,the,wise,woman,[END]
she,walked,around,scarlett,and,bent,low,under,the,branches,[END]
scarlett,did,the,same,[END]
after,a,few,steps,she,could,straighten,[END]
the,clearing,in,the,center,of,the,grove,held,a,small,mud,hut,thatched,with,reeds,[END]
a,thin,plume,of,gray,smoke,curled,upward,from,its,chimney,[END]
come,in,said,the,woman,[END]
she,opened,the,door,[END]
she's,a,fine,child,said,the,wise,woman,[END]
she,had,examined,every,aspect,of,cat's,body,down,to,the,nails,on,her,smallest,toes,[END]
what,have,you,named,her,[END]
katie,colum,o'hara,[END]
it,was,only,the,second,time,scarlett,had,spoken,[END]
once,inside,the,door,she'd,begun,thanking,the,wise,woman,for,what,she'd,done,but,the,woman,had,stopped,her,[END]
let,me,have,the,babe,she'd,said,hands,outstretched,[END]
scarlett,had,passed,cat,over,at,once,then,kept,silent,during,the,detailed,examination,[END]
katie,colum,',the,woman,repeated,[END]
'tis,a,weak,soft,sound,for,this,strong,child,[END]
my,name,is,grainne,[END]
a,strong,name,[END]
her,rough,voice,made,the,gaelic,name,sound,like,a,challenge,[END]
scarlett,shifted,on,her,stool,[END]
she,didn't,know,how,she,should,reply,[END]
the,woman,wrapped,cat,in,her,napkin,and,blankets,[END]
then,she,lifted,her,and,whispered,so,quietly,in,her,little,ear,that,scarlett,couldn't,hear,even,though,she,strained,for,the,words,[END]
cat's,fingers,caught,hold,of,grainne's,hair,[END]
the,wise,woman,held,cat,against,her,shoulder,[END]
you,would,not,have,understood,even,if,you,had,heard,o'hara,[END]
i,spoke,in,the,old,irish,[END]
it,was,a,charm,[END]
you,have,heard,that,i,know,magic,as,well,as,herbs,[END]
scarlett,admitted,she,had,[END]
perhaps,i,do,[END]
i,have,some,knowledge,of,the,old,words,and,the,old,ways,but,i,do,not,say,they,are,magic,[END]
i,look,and,i,listen,and,i,learn,[END]
to,some,it,may,be,like,magic,that,another,sees,where,he,is,blind,or,hears,when,he,is,deaf,[END]
it,lies,largely,in,the,believing,[END]
do,not,hope,that,i,can,do,magic,for,you,[END]
i,never,said,i,came,here,for,that,[END]
only,to,speak,thanks,[END]
is,that,the,all,of,it,[END]
yes,it,is,and,now,i've,done,it,and,i,must,go,before,i'm,missed,at,the,house,[END]
i,ask,your,forgiveness,the,wise,woman,said,[END]
there,are,few,feel,thankful,when,i,enter,their,lives,[END]
i,wonder,you,don't,feel,anger,at,what,i,did,to,your,body,[END]
you,saved,my,life,and,my,baby's,too,[END]
but,i,took,life,away,from,all,other,babes,[END]
a,doctor,might,have,known,how,to,do,more,[END]
well,i,couldn't,get,a,doctor,or,i,would,have,had,one,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,lips,firmly,over,her,quick,tongue,[END]
she'd,come,to,say,thank,you,not,to,insult,the,wise,woman,[END]
but,why,was,she,talking,riddles,in,her,raspy,scary,voice,[END]
it,gave,a,person,gooseflesh,[END]
i'm,sorry,said,scarlett,that,was,rude,of,me,[END]
i'm,sure,no,doctor,could,have,done,any,better,[END]
more,likely,not,even,half,as,well,[END]
and,i,don't,know,what,you,mean,about,other,babies,[END]
are,you,saying,i,was,having,twins,and,the,other,one,died,[END]
it,was,certainly,a,possibility,scarlett,thought,[END]
she'd,been,so,big,when,she,was,pregnant,[END]
but,surely,mrs,fitz,or,colum,would,have,told,her,[END]
maybe,not,[END]
they,hadn't,told,her,about,old,katie,scarlett,dying,until,two,weeks,after,it,happened,[END]
a,feeling,of,unbearable,loss,squeezed,scarlett's,heart,[END]
was,there,another,baby,[END]
you've,got,to,tell,me,[END]
shhh,you're,bothering,katie,colum,said,grainne,the,wise,woman,[END]
there,was,no,second,child,in,the,womb,[END]
i,did,not,know,you,would,mistake,my,words,[END]
the,woman,with,white,hair,looked,knowledgeable,i,believed,she,understood,and,would,tell,you,[END]
i,lifted,the,womb,with,the,baby,and,i,had,not,the,skills,to,restore,it,[END]
you,will,never,have,another,child,[END]
there,was,a,terrible,finality,in,the,woman's,words,and,the,way,she,said,them,and,scarlett,knew,absolutely,that,they,were,true,[END]
but,she,couldn't,believe,them,she,wouldn't,[END]
no,more,babies,[END]
now,when,she'd,finally,discovered,the,encompassing,joy,of,being,a,mother,when,she'd,learned,so,late,what,it,was,to,love,[END]
it,couldn't,be,[END]
it,was,too,cruel,[END]
scarlett,had,never,understood,how,melanie,could,have,knowingly,risked,her,life,to,have,another,baby,but,she,did,now,[END]
she,would,do,the,same,[END]
she'd,go,through,the,pain,and,the,fear,and,the,blood,again,and,again,to,have,that,moment,of,seeing,her,baby's,face,for,the,first,time,[END]
cat,made,a,soft,mewing,sound,[END]
it,was,her,warning,that,she,was,getting,hungry,[END]
scarlett,felt,her,milk,begin,to,flow,in,response,[END]
what,am,i,taking,on,so,for,[END]
don't,i,already,have,the,most,wonderful,baby,in,the,whole,world,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,lose,my,milk,fretting,about,imaginary,babies,when,my,cat,is,real,and,wants,her,mother,[END]
i've,got,to,go,said,scarlett,[END]
it's,close,to,time,to,feed,the,baby,[END]
she,held,out,her,hands,for,cat,[END]
one,more,word,said,grainne,[END]
a,warning,[END]
scarlett,felt,afraid,[END]
she,wished,she,hadn't,brought,cat,[END]
why,didn't,the,woman,give,her,back,[END]
keep,your,babe,close,there,are,those,who,say,she,was,brought,by,a,witch,and,must,be,bewitched,therefrom,[END]
scarlett,shivered,[END]
grainne's,stained,fingers,gently,undid,cat's,grasp,[END]
she,brushed,her,soft,wisp-covered,head,with,a,kiss,and,a,murmur,[END]
go,well,dara,[END]
then,she,gave,the,baby,to,scarlett,[END]
i,will,call,her,dara',in,my,memory,[END]
it,means,oak,tree,[END]
i,am,grateful,for,the,gift,of,seeing,her,and,for,your,thanks,[END]
but,do,not,bring,her,again,[END]
it,is,not,wise,for,her,to,have,aught,to,do,with,me,[END]
go,now,[END]
someone,is,coming,and,you,should,not,be,seen,[END]
no,the,path,the,other,takes,is,not,yours,[END]

go,[END]
guard,the,babe,[END]
scarlett,was,glad,to,obey,[END]
she,plodded,doggedly,through,the,cold,rain,that,had,begun,to,fall,[END]
her,head,and,back,were,bent,to,protect,her,baby,from,harm,[END]
cat,made,sucking,noises,beneath,the,shelter,of,scarlett's,cloak,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,eyed,the,wet,cloak,on,the,floor,by,the,fire,but,she,made,no,comment,[END]
miss,piles,seems,to,have,a,nice,light,hand,with,a,batter,she,said,[END]
i've,brought,scones,with,your,tea,[END]
good,i'm,starving,[END]
she'd,fed,cat,and,had,a,nap,and,the,sun,was,shining,again,[END]
scarlett,was,confident,now,that,the,walk,had,done,her,a,world,of,good,[END]
she,wouldn't,take,no,for,an,answer,the,next,time,she,wanted,to,go,out,[END]
mrs,fitz,didn't,attempt,to,stop,her,[END]

and,advice,[END]
i,want,to,buy,a,small,closed,buggy,colum,[END]
it's,too,cold,to,go,around,in,the,trap,and,i,need,to,do,things,[END]

he'd,be,willing,said,colum,but,she,could,do,her,own,choosing,if,she'd,prefer,[END]
the,buggy,makers,would,bring,their,wares,to,her,[END]
as,would,the,makers,of,anything,else,she,fancied,[END]
she,was,the,lady,of,the,big,house,[END]
now,why,didn't,i,think,of,that,[END]
said,scarlett,[END]
within,a,week,she,was,driving,a,neat,black,buggy,with,a,thin,yellow,stripe,on,its,side,behind,a,neat,gray,horse,that,lived,up,to,the,seller's,promise,that,it,had,good,go,in,it,with,hardly,a,mention,of,the,whip,ever,needed,[END]
she,also,had,a,parlor,suite,of,green-upholstered,shiny,oak,furniture,with,ten,extra,chairs,that,could,be,pulled,near,the,hearth,and,a,marble-topped,round,table,large,enough,to,seat,six,for,a,meal,[END]
all,these,sat,on,a,wilton,carpet,in,the,room,adjoining,her,bedroom,[END]
no,matter,what,outrageous,tales,colum,might,tell,about,french,women,entertaining,crowds,while,they,lounged,in,their,beds,she,was,going,to,have,a,proper,place,to,see,her,visitors,[END]
and,no,matter,what,mrs,fitz,said,she,saw,no,reason,at,all,to,use,the,downstairs,rooms,for,entertaining,when,there,were,plenty,of,empty,rooms,upstairs,and,handy,[END]
she,didn't,have,her,big,desk,and,chair,yet,because,the,carpenter,in,ballyhara,was,making,them,[END]
what,point,was,there,in,having,a,town,of,your,own,if,you,weren't,smart,enough,to,support,the,businesses,in,it,[END]
you,could,be,sure,of,getting,your,rent,if,they,were,earning,money,[END]
cat's,padded,basket,was,beside,her,on,the,buggy,seat,everywhere,scarlett,went,[END]
she,made,baby,noises,and,blew,bubbles,and,scarlett,was,sure,that,they,were,singing,duets,when,she,drove,along,the,road,[END]
she,showed,cat,off,at,every,shop,and,house,in,ballyhara,[END]
people,crossed,themselves,when,they,saw,the,dark-skinned,baby,with,the,green,eyes,and,scarlett,was,pleased,[END]
she,thought,they,were,blessing,the,baby,[END]
as,christmas,came,nearer,scarlett,lost,much,of,the,elation,she'd,felt,when,she,was,freed,from,the,captivity,of,convalescence,[END]
i,wouldn't,be,in,atlanta,for,all,the,tea,in,china,even,if,i,was,invited,to,all,the,parties,or,in,charleston,either,with,their,silly,dance,cards,and,receiving,lines,she,told,cat,but,i'd,like,to,be,somewhere,that's,not,so,damp,all,the,time,[END]
scarlett,thought,it,would,be,nice,to,be,living,in,a,cottage,so,that,she,could,whitewash,it,and,paint,the,trim,the,way,kathleen,and,the,cousins,were,doing,[END]
and,all,the,other,cottagers,too,in,adamstown,and,beside,the,roads,[END]
when,she,walked,over,to,kennedy's,bar,on,december,22,and,saw,the,shops,and,houses,being,limed,and,painted,over,the,almost-new,jobs,done,in,the,autumn,she,pranced,with,delight,[END]
her,pleasure,in,the,neat,prosperity,of,her,town,took,away,the,slight,sadness,that,she,often,felt,when,she,went,to,her,own,bar,for,companionship,[END]
it,sometimes,seemed,as,if,the,conversation,turned,stiff,as,soon,as,she,entered,[END]
we've,got,to,decorate,the,house,for,christmas,she,announced,to,mrs,fitz,[END]
what,do,the,irish,do,[END]
holly,branches,on,mantels,and,over,doors,and,windows,said,the,housekeeper,[END]
and,a,big,candle,usually,red,in,one,window,to,light,the,christ,child's,way,[END]
we'll,have,one,in,every,window,scarlett,declared,but,mrs,fitz,was,firm,[END]
one,window,[END]
scarlett,could,have,all,the,candles,she,wanted,on,tables,or,the,floor,if,it,made,her,happy,but,only,one,window,should,have,a,candle,[END]
and,that,one,could,only,be,lighted,on,christmas,eve,when,the,angelus,rang,[END]
the,housekeeper,smiled,[END]
the,tradition,is,that,the,youngest,child,in,the,house,lights,a,rush,from,the,coals,on,the,hearth,as,soon,as,the,angelus,is,heard,then,lights,the,candle,with,the,flame,from,the,rush,[END]
you,might,have,to,help,her,a,bit,[END]
scarlett,and,cat,spent,christmas,at,daniel's,house,[END]
there,was,nearly,enough,admiration,for,cat,to,satisfy,even,scarlett,[END]
and,enough,people,coming,through,the,open,door,to,keep,her,mind,off,the,christmases,at,tara,in,the,old,days,when,the,family,and,house,servants,went,out,onto,the,wide,porch,after,breakfast,in,response,to,the,cry,christmas,gift,[END]
when,gerald,o'hara,gave,a,drink,of,whiskey,and,a,plug,of,tobacco,to,every,field,hand,as,he,handed,him,his,new,coat,and,new,boots,[END]
when,ellen,o'hara,said,a,brief,prayer,for,each,woman,and,child,as,she,gave,them,lengths,of,calico,and,flannel,together,with,oranges,and,stick,candy,[END]
sometimes,scarlett,missed,the,warm,slurrings,of,black,voices,and,the,flashing,smiles,on,black,faces,almost,more,than,she,could,bear,[END]
i,need,to,go,home,colum,scarlett,said,[END]
and,aren't,you,home,now,on,the,land,of,your,people,that,you,made,o'hara,land,again,[END]
oh,colum,don't,be,irish,at,me,[END]
you,know,what,i,mean,[END]
i'm,homesick,for,southern,voices,and,southern,sunshine,and,southern,food,[END]
i,want,some,corn,bread,and,fried,chicken,and,grits,[END]
nobody,in,ireland,even,knows,what,corn,is,[END]
that's,just,a,word,for,any,kind,of,grain,to,them,[END]
i,do,know,scarlett,and,i'm,sorry,for,the,heartache,you're,feeling,[END]
why,not,go,for,a,visit,when,good,sailing,weather,comes,[END]
you,can,leave,cat,here,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,and,i,will,take,care,of,her,[END]
never,[END]
i'll,never,leave,cat,[END]
there,was,nothing,to,be,said,[END]
but,from,time,to,time,the,thought,popped,up,in,scarlett's,head,it's,only,two,weeks,and,a,day,to,cross,the,ocean,and,sometimes,the,dolphins,play,alongside,for,hours,on,end,[END]
on,new,year's,day,scarlett,got,her,first,hint,of,what,it,really,meant,to,be,the,o'hara,[END]
mrs,fitz,came,to,her,room,with,morning,tea,instead,of,sending,peggy,quinn,with,the,breakfast,tray,[END]
the,blessings,of,all,the,saints,on,mother,and,daughter,in,the,new,year,to,come,she,said,cheerily,[END]
i,must,tell,you,about,the,duty,you,have,to,do,before,your,breakfast,[END]
happy,new,year,to,you,too,mrs,fitz,and,what,on,earth,are,you,talking,about,[END]
a,tradition,a,ritual,a,requirement,said,mrs,fitz,[END]
without,it,there'd,be,no,luck,all,year,[END]
scarlett,might,have,a,taste,of,tea,first,but,that,was,all,[END]
the,first,food,eaten,in,the,house,must,be,the,special,new,year's,harm,brack,on,the,tray,[END]
three,bites,had,to,be,eaten,in,the,name,of,the,trinity,[END]
before,you,start,though,mrs,fitz,said,come,into,the,room,i've,got,ready,[END]
because,after,you,have,the,trinity,bites,you,have,to,throw,the,cake,with,all,your,might,against,a,wall,so,that,it,breaks,into,pieces,[END]
i,had,the,wall,scrubbed,yesterday,and,the,floor,[END]
that's,the,craziest,thing,i,ever,heard,[END]
why,should,i,ruin,a,perfectly,good,cake,[END]
and,why,eat,cake,for,breakfast,anyhow,[END]
because,that's,the,way,it's,done,[END]
come,do,your,duty,the,o'hara,before,the,rest,of,the,people,in,this,house,die,of,hunger,[END]
no,one,can,eat,before,the,harm,brack,is,broken,[END]
scarlett,put,on,her,wool,wrapper,and,obeyed,[END]
she,had,a,swallow,of,tea,to,moisten,her,mouth,then,bit,three,times,into,the,edge,of,the,rich,fruited,cake,as,mrs,fitz,directed,[END]
she,had,to,hold,it,in,both,hands,because,it,was,so,big,[END]
then,she,repeated,the,prayer,against,hunger,during,the,year,that,mrs,fitz,taught,her,and,heaved,with,both,arms,sending,the,cake,flying,and,crashing,against,the,wall,[END]
bits,flew,all,over,the,room,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
what,an,awful,mess,[END]
but,the,throwing,part,was,fun,[END]
i'm,glad,you,liked,it,said,the,housekeeper,[END]
you've,got,five,more,to,do,[END]
every,man,woman,and,child,in,ballyhara,has,to,get,a,little,piece,for,good,luck,[END]
they're,waiting,outside,[END]
the,maids,will,take,the,pieces,down,on,trays,after,you,finish,[END]
my,grief,said,scarlett,[END]
i,should,have,taken,littler,bites,[END]
after,breakfast,colum,accompanied,her,through,the,town,for,her,next,ritual,[END]
it,was,good,luck,for,the,whole,year,if,a,dark-haired,person,visited,a,house,on,new,year's,day,[END]
but,the,tradition,required,that,the,person,enter,then,be,escorted,out,then,be,escorted,back,in,again,[END]
and,don't,you,dare,laugh,colum,ordered,[END]
any,dark-haired,person,is,good,luck,[END]
the,head,of,a,clan,is,ten,times,over,good,luck,[END]
scarlett,was,staggering,when,it,was,over,[END]
thank,goodness,there,are,still,so,many,empty,buildings,she,gasped,[END]
i'm,awash,with,tea,and,foundering,from,all,the,cake,in,my,stomach,[END]
did,we,really,have,to,eat,and,drink,in,every,single,place,[END]
scarlett,darling,how,can,you,call,it,a,visit,if,there's,no,hospitality,offered,and,received,[END]
if,you,were,a,man,it,would,have,been,whiskey,and,not,tea,[END]
scarlett,grinned,[END]
cat,might,have,loved,that,[END]
february,1,was,considered,the,beginning,of,the,farm,year,in,ireland,[END]
accompanied,by,everyone,who,worked,and,lived,in,ballyhara,scarlett,stood,in,the,center,of,a,big,field,and,after,saying,a,prayer,for,the,success,of,the,crops,sank,a,spade,into,the,earth,lifted,and,turned,the,first,sod,[END]
now,the,year,could,begin,[END]
after,the,feast,of,applecake,and,milk,of,course,because,february,1,was,also,the,feast,day,of,saint,brigid,ireland's,other,patron,saint,who,was,also,patron,saint,of,the,dairy,[END]
when,everyone,was,eating,and,talking,after,the,ceremony,scarlett,knelt,by,the,opened,earth,and,took,up,a,handful,of,the,rich,loam,[END]
this,is,for,you,pa,she,murmured,[END]
see,katie,scarlett,hasn't,forgotten,what,you,told,her,that,the,land,of,county,meath,is,the,best,in,the,world,better,even,than,the,land,of,georgia,of,tara,[END]
i'll,do,my,best,to,tend,it,pa,and,love,it,the,way,you,taught,me,[END]
it's,o'hara,soil,and,it's,ours,again,[END]
the,age-old,progression,of,plowing,and,harrowing,planting,and,praying,had,a,simple,hard-working,dignity,that,won,scarlett's,admiration,and,respect,for,all,who,lived,by,the,land,[END]
she,had,felt,it,when,she,lived,in,daniel's,cottage,and,she,felt,it,now,for,the,farmers,at,ballyhara,[END]
for,herself,as,well,because,she,was,in,her,own,way,one,of,them,[END]
she,hadn't,the,strength,to,drive,the,plow,but,she,could,provide,it,[END]
and,the,horses,to,pull,it,[END]
and,the,seed,to,plant,in,the,furrows,it,made,[END]
the,estate,office,was,her,home,even,more,than,her,rooms,in,the,big,house,[END]
there,was,another,cradle,for,cat,by,her,desk,identical,to,the,one,in,her,bedroom,and,she,could,rock,it,with,her,foot,while,she,worked,on,her,record,books,and,her,accounts,[END]
the,disputes,that,mrs,fitzpatrick,had,been,so,gloomy,about,turned,out,to,be,simple,matters,to,settle,[END]
especially,if,you,were,the,o'hara,and,your,word,was,law,[END]
scarlett,had,always,had,to,bully,people,into,doing,what,she,wanted,now,she,had,only,to,speak,quietly,and,there,was,no,argument,[END]
she,enjoyed,the,first,sunday,of,the,month,very,much,[END]
she,even,began,to,realize,that,other,people,occasionally,had,an,opinion,worth,listening,to,[END]
the,farmers,really,did,know,more,about,farming,than,she,did,and,she,could,learn,from,them,[END]
she,needed,to,[END]
three,hundred,acres,of,ballyhara,land,were,set,aside,as,her,own,farm,[END]
the,farmers,worked,it,and,paid,only,half,the,usual,rent,for,the,land,they,leased,from,her,[END]
scarlett,understood,sharecropping,it,was,the,way,things,were,done,in,the,south,[END]
being,an,estate,landlord,was,still,new,to,her,[END]
she,was,determined,to,be,the,best,landlord,in,all,ireland,[END]
the,farmers,learn,from,me,too,she,told,cat,[END]
they'd,never,even,heard,of,fertilizing,with,phosphates,until,i,handed,out,those,sacks,of,it,[END]
might,as,well,let,rhett,get,a,few,pennies,of,his,money,back,if,it'll,mean,a,better,wheat,crop,for,us,[END]
she,never,used,the,word,father,in,cat's,hearing,[END]
who,could,tell,how,much,a,tiny,baby,took,in,and,remembered,[END]
especially,a,baby,who,was,so,clearly,superior,in,every,way,to,every,other,baby,in,the,world,[END]
as,the,days,lengthened,breezes,and,rain,became,softer,and,warmer,[END]
cat,o'hara,was,becoming,more,and,more,fascinating,she,was,developing,individuality,[END]
i,certainly,named,you,right,scarlett,told,her,you're,the,most,independent,little,thing,i,ever,saw,[END]
cat's,big,green,eyes,looked,at,her,mother,attentively,while,she,was,talking,then,returned,to,her,absorbed,contemplation,of,her,own,fingers,[END]
the,baby,never,fussed,she,had,an,infinite,capacity,to,amuse,herself,[END]
weaning,her,was,hard,on,scarlett,but,not,on,cat,[END]
she,enjoyed,examining,her,porridge,with,fingers,and,mouth,[END]
she,seemed,to,find,all,experience,extremely,interesting,[END]
she,was,a,strong,baby,with,a,straight,spine,and,high-held,head,[END]
scarlett,adored,her,[END]
and,in,a,special,way,respected,her,[END]
she,liked,to,scoop,cat,up,and,kiss,her,soft,hair,and,neck,and,cheeks,and,hands,and,feet,she,longed,to,hold,cat,in,her,lap,and,rock,her,[END]
but,the,baby,would,tolerate,only,a,few,minutes,of,cuddling,before,she,pushed,herself,free,with,her,feet,and,fists,[END]
and,cat's,small,dark-skinned,face,could,have,such,an,outraged,expression,that,scarlett,was,forced,to,laugh,even,when,she,was,being,forcefully,rejected,[END]
the,happiest,times,for,both,of,them,were,at,the,end,of,the,day,when,cat,shared,scarlett's,bath,[END]
she,patted,the,water,laughing,at,its,splashes,and,scarlett,held,her,jounced,her,up,and,down,and,sang,to,her,[END]
then,there,was,the,sweetness,of,drying,the,perfect,tiny,limbs,each,finger,and,toe,individually,and,spreading,powder,over,cat's,silky,skin,and,into,each,baby,wrinkle,[END]
when,scarlett,was,twenty,years,old,war,had,forced,her,to,give,up,her,youth,overnight,[END]
her,will,and,endurance,had,hardened,and,so,had,her,face,[END]
in,the,spring,of,1876,when,she,was,thirty-one,the,gentle,softness,of,hope,and,youth,and,tenderness,gradually,returned,[END]
she,was,unaware,of,it,her,preoccupation,with,the,farm,and,the,baby,had,replaced,her,life-long,concentration,on,her,own,vanity,[END]
you,need,some,clothes,mrs,fitz,said,one,day,[END]
i've,heard,there's,a,dressmaker,who,wants,to,rent,the,house,you,lived,in,if,you'll,fresh,paint,the,inside,[END]
she's,a,widow,and,well-fixed,enough,to,pay,a,fair,rent,[END]
the,women,in,the,town,would,like,it,and,you,need,it,unless,you're,willing,to,find,a,woman,in,trim,[END]
what's,wrong,with,the,way,i,look,[END]
i,wear,decent,black,the,way,a,widow,should,[END]
my,petticoats,hardly,ever,peek,out,[END]
you,don't,wear,decent,black,at,all,[END]
you,wear,earth-stained,rolled-sleeves,peasant,women,clothes,and,you're,the,lady,of,the,big,house,[END]
oh,fiddle-dee-dee,mrs,fitz,[END]
how,could,i,ride,out,to,see,the,timothy,grass,is,growing,if,i,had,on,lady-of-the-house,clothes,[END]
besides,i,like,being,comfortable,[END]
as,soon,as,i,can,go,back,into,colored,skirts,and,shirts,i'll,start,worrying,about,whether,they,have,stains,on,them,[END]
i've,always,hated,mourning,i,don't,see,any,reason,to,try,and,make,black,look,fresh,[END]
no,matter,what,you,do,to,it,it's,still,black,[END]
then,you,aren't,interested,in,the,dressmaker,[END]
of,course,i'm,interested,[END]
another,rent,is,always,interesting,[END]
and,one,of,these,days,i'll,order,some,frocks,[END]
after,the,planting,[END]
the,fields,should,be,ready,for,the,wheat,this,week,[END]
there's,another,rent,possible,the,housekeeper,said,carefully,[END]
she'd,been,surprised,more,than,once,by,unexpected,astuteness,on,scarlett's,part,[END]
brendan,kennedy,thinks,he,could,do,well,if,he,added,an,inn,to,his,bar,[END]
there's,the,building,next,to,him,could,be,used,[END]
who,on,earth,would,come,to,ballyhara,to,stay,at,an,inn,[END]
that's,crazy,[END]
besides,if,brendan,kennedy,wants,to,rent,from,me,he,should,carry,his,hat,in,his,hand,and,come,talk,to,me,himself,not,pester,you,to,do,it,[END]
ach,well,[END]
likely,it,was,only,talk,[END]
mrs,fitzgerald,gave,scarlett,the,week's,household,account,book,and,abandoned,talk,of,the,inn,for,the,moment,[END]
colum,would,have,to,work,on,it,he,was,much,more,persuasive,than,she,was,[END]
we're,getting,to,have,more,servants,than,the,queen,of,england,said,scarlett,[END]
she,said,the,same,thing,every,week,[END]
if,you're,going,to,have,cows,you're,going,to,need,hands,to,milk,them,said,the,housekeeper,[END]
scarlett,picked,up,the,refrain,[END]
and,to,separate,the,cream,and,make,the,butter,i,know,[END]
and,the,butter's,selling,[END]
i,just,don't,like,cows,i,guess,[END]
i'll,go,over,this,later,mrs,fitz,[END]
i,want,to,take,cat,down,to,watch,them,cutting,peat,in,the,bog,[END]
you'd,better,go,over,it,now,[END]
we're,out,of,money,in,the,kitchen,and,the,girls,need,paying,tomorrow,[END]
bother,[END]
i'll,have,to,get,some,cash,from,the,bank,[END]
i'll,drive,in,to,trim,[END]
if,i,was,the,banker,i'd,never,give,money,to,a,creature,dressed,like,you,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
nag,nag,nag,[END]
tell,the,dressmaker,i'll,order,the,painting,done,[END]
but,not,the,inn,opened,thought,mrs,fitzpatrick,[END]
she'd,have,to,talk,to,colum,tonight,[END]
the,fenians,had,been,steadily,growing,in,strength,and,numbers,throughout,ireland,[END]
with,ballyhara,they,now,had,what,they,most,needed,a,secure,location,where,leaders,from,every,county,could,meet,to,plan,strategy,and,where,a,man,who,needed,to,flee,the,militia,could,safely,go,except,that,strangers,were,too,noticeable,in,a,town,that,was,hardly,larger,than,a,village,[END]
militia,and,constabulary,patrols,from,trim,were,few,but,one,man,with,sharp,eyes,was,enough,to,destroy,the,best-laid,plans,[END]
we,really,need,the,inn,rosaleen,fitzpatrick,said,urgently,[END]
it,makes,sense,that,a,man,with,business,in,trim,would,take,a,room,this,close,but,cheaper,than,in,town,[END]
you're,right,rosaleen,colum,soothed,and,i'll,talk,to,scarlett,[END]
but,not,right,away,[END]
she's,too,quick-minded,for,that,[END]
give,it,a,rest,for,a,bit,[END]
then,when,i,bring,it,up,she,won't,wonder,why,we're,both,pressing,[END]
but,colum,we,mustn't,waste,time,[END]
we,mustn't,lose,everything,by,hurry,either,[END]
i'll,do,it,when,i,believe,the,moment's,right,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,had,to,settle,for,that,[END]
colum,was,in,charge,[END]
she,consoled,herself,by,remembering,that,at,least,she'd,gotten,margaret,scanlon,in,[END]
and,she,hadn't,even,had,to,make,up,a,tale,to,do,it,[END]
scarlett,did,need,some,clothes,[END]
it,was,a,shocking,disgrace,the,way,she,insisted,on,living-the,cheapest,clothes,two,rooms,lived,in,out,of,twenty,[END]
if,colum,weren't,colum,mrs,fitzpatrick,would,doubt,what,he'd,said,that,not,so,long,ago,scarlett,had,been,a,very,fashionable,woman,[END]
and,that,diamond,ring,turns,brass,momma's,gonna,buy,you,a,looking,glass,',scarlett,sang,[END]
cat,splashed,vigorously,in,the,sudsy,water,of,the,bath,[END]
momma's,gonna,buy,you,some,pretty,frocks,too,said,scarlett,and,buy,momma,some,[END]
then,we'll,go,on,the,great,big,ship,[END]
there,was,no,reason,to,put,it,off,[END]
she,had,to,go,to,america,[END]
if,she,left,soon,after,easter,she,could,be,back,in,plenty,of,time,for,the,harvest,[END]
scarlett,made,up,her,mind,on,the,day,she,saw,the,delicate,haze,of,green,on,the,meadow,where,she'd,turned,the,first,sod,[END]
a,fierce,surge,of,excitement,and,pride,made,her,want,to,cry,aloud,this,is,mine,my,land,my,seeds,burst,into,life,[END]
she,looked,at,the,barely,visible,young,growth,and,pictured,it,reaching,up,becoming,taller,stronger,then,flowering,perfuming,the,air,intoxicating,the,bees,until,they,could,hardly,fly,[END]
the,men,would,cut,it,then,scythes,flashing,silver,and,make,tall,ricks,of,sweet,golden,hay,[END]
year,after,year,the,cycle,would,turn,sow,and,reap,the,annual,miracle,of,birth,and,growth,[END]
grass,would,grow,and,become,hay,[END]
wheat,would,grow,and,become,bread,[END]
oats,would,grow,and,become,meal,[END]
cat,would,grow,crawl,walk,talk,eat,the,oatmeal,and,the,bread,and,jump,onto,the,stacked,hay,from,the,loft,of,the,barn,just,as,scarlett,had,done,when,she,was,a,child,[END]
ballyhara,was,her,home,[END]
scarlett,squinted,up,at,the,sun,saw,the,clouds,racing,towards,it,knew,that,soon,it,would,rain,and,soon,after,that,it,would,clear,again,and,the,sun,would,warm,the,fields,until,the,next,rain,followed,by,the,next,warming,sunlight,[END]
i'll,feel,the,baking,heat,of,georgia,sun,one,more,time,she,decided,i'm,entitled,to,that,[END]
i,miss,it,sometimes,so,terribly,[END]
but,somehow,tara's,more,like,a,dream,than,a,memory,[END]
it,belongs,in,the,past,like,the,scarlett,i,used,to,be,[END]
that,life,and,that,person,don't,have,anything,to,do,with,me,any,more,[END]

mine,will,be,too,[END]
i'm,the,o'hara,of,ballyhara,[END]

all,that,could,wait,[END]
what,she,must,concentrate,on,was,the,best,way,to,tell,wade,and,ella,about,their,wonderful,new,home,[END]
they,wouldn't,believe,she,wanted,them,why,should,they,[END]

there's,a,ceremony,on,good,friday,that,only,the,o'hara,can,do,[END]
scarlett,didn't,argue,[END]
being,the,o'hara,was,too,important,to,her,[END]
but,she,was,annoyed,[END]
what,difference,could,it,possibly,make,who,planted,the,first,potato,[END]
it,irritated,her,too,that,colum,wouldn't,go,with,her,[END]
and,that,he,was,away,so,much,lately,[END]
on,business,he,said,[END]
well,why,couldn't,he,do,his,fundraising,in,savannah,again,instead,of,wherever,else,he,went,to,[END]
the,truth,was,that,everything,irritated,her,[END]
now,that,she,had,decided,to,go,she,wanted,to,be,gone,[END]
she,was,snappish,with,margaret,scanlon,the,dressmaker,because,it,took,so,long,to,have,her,dresses,made,[END]
and,because,mrs,scanlon,looked,so,interested,when,scarlett,ordered,dresses,in,colorful,silks,and,linens,as,well,as,mourning,black,[END]

suddenly,her,utilitarian,black,skirt,and,stockings,and,shirt,and,shawl,had,become,unspeakably,depressing,to,her,[END]

scarlett,nodded,unable,to,speak,[END]
she,hadn't,realized,until,this,moment,how,important,her,uncle,had,become,in,her,life,[END]
he,seldom,spoke,she,almost,never,talked,to,him,he,was,simply,there,solid,quiet,unchanging,and,strong,[END]

when,they,returned,she,went,to,ballyhara,[END]
the,o'hara,must,celebrate,easter,in,the,ballyhara,church,[END]

there,was,a,crowd,of,people,outside,the,low,door,[END]
so,many,had,come,to,mourn,daniel,that,there,wasn't,enough,room,for,all,of,them,[END]
scarlett,heard,the,words,the,o'hara,saw,a,path,open,for,her,[END]

ochón,ochón,[END]
the,plaintive,primitive,cry,twisted,her,heart,frightened,her,[END]

they,were,eating,and,drinking,and,talking,as,if,nothing,unusual,was,happening,at,all,[END]
the,air,was,thick,with,smoke,from,the,men's,clay,pipes,in,spite,of,the,open,door,and,windows,[END]

yes,he,woke,to,call,people,by,name,and,to,make,his,end,with,a,clean,soul,[END]
ah,it,was,a,grand,confession,he,made,i've,never,heard,a,better,[END]
a,fine,man,daniel,o'hara,was,[END]

someone,noticed,her,[END]
and,tell,us,if,you,will,katie,scarlett,about,your,uncle,refusing,the,farm,with,the,hundred,cattle,you,gave,him,[END]
she,thought,quickly,[END]
this,was,the,way,of,it,she,began,[END]
a,dozen,eager,listeners,leaned,toward,her,[END]
now,what,am,i,going,to,say,[END]
i,[END]
i,said,to,him,uncle,daniel',[END]
i,said,i,want,to,give,you,a,present,',[END]

a,hundred,bullocks,and,fifty,milk,cows,and,three,hundred,geese,and,twenty-five,pigs,and,[END]
six,teams,of,horses,',[END]
the,audience,sighed,at,the,grandeur,[END]
scarlett,felt,inspiration,on,her,tongue,[END]
uncle,daniel,',i,said,this,is,all,for,you,and,a,bag,of,gold,besides,',[END]
but,his,voice,thundered,at,me,till,i,quaked,[END]
i'll,not,touch,it,katie,scarlett,o'hara,',[END]
colum,grabbed,her,arm,and,pulled,her,outside,the,house,through,the,crowd,behind,the,barn,[END]
then,he,let,himself,laugh,[END]
you're,always,surprising,me,scarlett,darling,[END]
you've,just,made,daniel,into,a,giant,but,whether,it's,a,giant,fool,or,a,giant,too,noble,to,take,advantage,of,a,fool,woman,i,don't,know,[END]
scarlett,laughed,with,him,[END]
i,was,just,getting,the,hang,of,it,colum,you,should,have,let,me,stay,[END]
suddenly,she,put,her,hand,over,her,mouth,[END]
how,could,she,be,laughing,at,uncle,daniel's,wake,[END]
colum,took,her,wrist,lowered,her,hand,[END]
it's,all,right,he,said,a,wake's,supposed,to,celebrate,a,man's,life,and,the,importance,of,him,to,all,who,come,[END]
laughter's,part,of,it,as,much,as,lamentation,[END]
daniel,o'hara,was,buried,on,thursday,[END]
the,funeral,was,almost,as,big,as,old,katie,scarlett's,had,been,[END]
scarlett,led,the,procession,to,the,grave,his,sons,had,dug,in,the,ancient,walled,graveyard,at,ballyhara,that,she,and,colum,had,found,and,cleaned,up,[END]
scarlett,filled,a,leather,pouch,with,soil,from,daniel's,grave,[END]
when,she,spread,it,on,her,father's,grave,it,would,be,almost,as,if,he,was,buried,near,his,brother,[END]
when,the,funeral,was,over,the,family,went,to,the,big,house,for,refreshments,[END]
scarlett's,cook,was,delighted,to,have,an,occasion,to,show,off,[END]
long,trestle,tables,stretched,the,length,of,the,unused,drawing,room,and,library,[END]
they,were,covered,with,hams,geese,chickens,beef,mountains,of,breads,and,cakes,gallons,of,porter,barrels,of,whiskey,rivers,of,tea,[END]
hundreds,of,o'haras,had,made,the,trip,in,spite,of,the,muddy,roads,[END]
scarlett,brought,cat,down,to,meet,her,kinflok,[END]
the,admiration,was,all,that,scarlett,could,have,wished,for,and,more,[END]
then,colum,supplied,a,fiddle,and,his,drum,three,cousins,found,pennywhistles,and,the,music,went,on,for,hours,[END]
cat,waved,her,hands,to,the,music,until,she,was,worn,out,then,fall,asleep,in,scarlett's,lap,[END]
i'm,glad,i,missed,the,ship,scarlett,thought,this,is,wonderful,[END]
if,only,daniel's,death,wasn't,the,reason,for,that,[END]
two,of,her,cousins,came,over,to,her,and,bent,down,from,their,great,height,to,speak,quietly,[END]
we,have,need,of,the,o'hara,said,daniel's,son,thomas,[END]
will,you,come,to,the,house,tomorrow,after,breakfast,[END]
asked,patrick's,son,joe,[END]
what's,it,about,[END]
we'll,tell,you,tomorrow,when,there's,quiet,for,you,to,think,[END]
the,question,was,who,should,inherit,daniel's,farm,[END]
because,of,the,long-past,crisis,when,old,patrick,died,two,o'hara,cousins,were,claiming,the,right,[END]
like,his,brother,gerald,daniel,had,never,made,a,will,[END]
it's,tara,all,over,again,thought,scarlett,and,the,decision,was,easy,[END]
daniel's,son,seamus,had,worked,hard,on,the,farm,for,thirty,years,while,patrick's,son,sean,lived,with,old,katie,scarlett,and,did,nothing,[END]
scarlett,gave,the,farm,to,seamus,[END]
like,pa,should,have,given,tara,to,me,[END]
she,was,the,o'hara,so,there,was,no,argument,[END]
scarlett,felt,elated,confident,that,she,had,given,more,justice,to,seamus,than,anyone,had,ever,given,her,[END]
the,next,day,a,far-from-young,woman,left,a,basket,of,eggs,on,the,doorstep,of,the,big,house,[END]
mrs,fitz,found,out,that,she,was,seamus',sweetheart,[END]
she'd,been,waiting,for,almost,twenty,years,for,him,to,ask,her,to,marry,him,[END]
an,hour,after,scarlett's,decision,he,had,[END]
that's,very,sweet,scarlett,said,but,i,hope,they,don't,get,married,real,soon,[END]
i'll,never,get,to,america,at,the,rate,i'm,going,[END]
she,now,had,a,cabin,booked,on,a,ship,sailing,april,26,a,year,exactly,after,the,date,she,was,originally,supposed,to,have,ended,her,vacation,in,ireland,[END]
the,ship,wasn't,the,luxurious,brian,boru,[END]
it,wasn't,even,a,proper,passenger,ship,[END]
but,scarlett,had,her,own,superstition,if,she,delayed,again,until,after,may,day,she'd,somehow,never,leave,at,all,[END]
besides,colum,knew,the,ship,and,its,captain,[END]
it,was,a,cargo,ship,true,but,it,was,carrying,only,bales,of,best,irish,linen,nothing,messy,[END]
and,the,captain's,wife,always,travelled,with,him,so,scarlett,would,have,female,companionship,and,a,chaperone,[END]
best,of,all,the,ship,had,no,paddlewheel,no,steam,engine,[END]
she'd,be,under,sail,all,the,way,[END]
67,[END]
the,weather,was,beautiful,for,more,than,a,week,[END]
the,roads,were,dry,the,hedgerows,were,full,of,flowers,cat's,feverish,sleeplessness,one,night,turned,out,to,be,only,a,new,tooth,coming,in,[END]
on,the,day,before,she,was,to,leave,scarlett,ran,half-dancing,to,ballyhara,town,to,pick,up,the,last,of,cat's,frocks,from,the,dressmaker,[END]
she,was,confident,that,nothing,could,go,wrong,now,[END]
while,margaret,scanlon,wrapped,the,frock,in,tissue,paper,scarlett,looked,out,at,the,deserted,dinner-time,town,and,saw,colum,going,into,the,abandoned,protestant,church,of,ireland,on,the,other,side,of,the,wide,street,[END]
oh,good,she,thought,he's,going,to,do,it,after,all,[END]
i,thought,he'd,never,listen,to,reason,[END]
it,makes,no,sense,at,all,for,the,whole,town,to,be,squashed,into,that,dinky,little,chapel,for,mass,every,sunday,when,there's,that,great,big,church,standing,empty,[END]
just,because,it,was,built,by,protestants,is,no,reason,for,catholics,not,to,take,it,over,[END]
i,don't,know,why,he's,been,so,stubborn,so,long,but,i,won't,fuss,at,him,[END]
i'll,just,tell,him,how,happy,it,makes,me,that,he's,changed,his,mind,[END]
i'll,be,right,back,she,told,mrs,scanlon,[END]
she,hurried,along,the,weed-ridden,path,that,led,to,the,small,side,entrance,tapped,on,the,door,and,pushed,it,open,[END]
a,loud,noise,sounded,then,another,and,scarlett,felt,something,sharp,hit,her,sleeve,heard,a,shower,of,pebbles,on,the,ground,at,her,feet,a,booming,reverberation,inside,the,church,[END]
a,shaft,of,light,from,the,open,door,fell,directly,onto,a,strange,man,who,had,spun,to,face,her,[END]
his,stubbled,face,was,twisted,into,a,snarl,and,his,dark,shadowed,eyes,were,like,a,wild,animal's,[END]
he,was,half,crouching,and,he,was,pointing,a,pistol,at,her,held,out,from,his,rag-clothed,body,in,his,two,dirty,rock-steady,hands,[END]
he,shot,at,me,[END]
the,knowledge,filled,scarlett's,mind,[END]
he's,already,killed,colum,and,now,he's,going,to,kill,me,[END]
cat,[END]
i'll,never,see,cat,again,[END]
white-hot,anger,freed,scarlett,from,the,physical,paralysis,of,shock,[END]
she,raised,her,fists,and,lunged,forward,[END]
the,sound,of,the,second,shot,was,an,explosion,that,echoed,deafeningly,from,the,vaulted,stone,ceilings,for,a,time,that,seemed,forever,[END]
scarlett,threw,herself,to,the,floor,screaming,[END]
i'll,ask,you,to,be,quiet,scarlett,darling,said,colum,[END]
she,knew,his,voice,and,yet,it,was,not,his,voice,[END]
there,was,steel,in,this,voice,and,ice,[END]
scarlett,looked,up,[END]
she,saw,colum's,right,arm,around,the,neck,of,the,man,colum's,left,hand,around,the,man's,wrist,the,pistol,pointing,at,the,ceiling,[END]
she,got,slowly,to,her,feet,[END]
what,is,going,on,here,[END]
she,enunciated,carefully,[END]
close,the,door,if,you,please,said,colum,[END]
there's,light,enough,from,the,windows,[END]
what,[END]
is,[END]
going,[END]
on,[END]
here,[END]
colum,gave,her,no,answer,[END]
drop,it,davey,boy,he,said,to,the,man,[END]
the,pistol,fell,with,a,metallic,crash,onto,the,stone,floor,[END]
slowly,colum,lowered,the,man's,arm,[END]
quickly,he,moved,his,own,arm,from,its,stranglehold,around,the,man's,neck,made,two,fists,with,his,hands,and,clubbed,the,man,with,them,[END]

so,she'd,sell,the,peachtree,street,house,and,the,store,[END]
and,the,saloon,[END]
that,was,sort,of,too,bad,[END]
the,saloon,produced,excellent,income,and,was,no,trouble,at,all,[END]

the,aisle,became,a,filthy,debris,trap,before,twenty,miles,were,done,[END]
a,drunk,lurched,unevenly,past,her,seat,and,she,suddenly,realized,that,she,should,not,be,travelling,alone,[END]

the,hubbub,at,the,atlanta,depot,and,the,shouting,daredevil,drivers,in,the,maelstrom,at,five,points,made,scarlett's,heart,race,with,excitement,and,she,forgot,the,grime,of,the,train,[END]

there,were,buildings,she'd,never,seen,before,new,names,above,old,storefronts,noise,and,hurry,and,push,[END]

i'm,an,old,man,scarlett,[END]
it,would,probably,be,better,for,you,to,hook,up,with,a,younger,lawyer,[END]
scarlett,rose,from,her,chair,held,out,her,hand,smiled,with,real,fondness,for,him,[END]
it,was,only,after,she,was,gone,that,he,could,put,words,to,the,difference,in,her,[END]
scarlett's,grown,up,[END]
she,didn't,call,me,uncle,henry,',[END]
is,mrs,butler,at,home,[END]
scarlett,recognized,ashley's,voice,immediately,[END]
she,hurried,from,the,sitting,room,into,the,hall,a,quick,gesture,of,her,hand,dismissed,the,maid,who'd,answered,the,door,[END]
ashley,dear,i'm,so,happy,to,see,you,[END]
she,held,out,both,her,hands,to,him,[END]
he,clasped,them,tightly,in,his,looking,down,at,her,[END]
scarlett,you've,never,looked,lovelier,[END]
foreign,climates,agree,with,you,[END]
tell,me,where,you've,been,what,you've,been,doing,[END]
uncle,henry,said,you'd,gone,to,savannah,then,he,lost,touch,[END]
we,all,wondered,[END]
i'll,just,bet,you,all,wondered,especially,your,adder-tongued,old,sister,she,thought,[END]
come,in,and,sit,down,she,said,i'm,dying,to,hear,all,the,news,[END]
the,maid,was,hovering,to,one,side,[END]
scarlett,said,quietly,as,she,passed,her,bring,us,a,pot,of,coffee,and,some,cakes,[END]
she,led,the,way,into,the,sitting,room,took,one,corner,of,a,settee,patted,the,seat,beside,her,[END]
sit,here,beside,me,ashley,do,[END]
i,want,to,look,at,you,[END]
thank,the,lord,he's,lost,that,hangdog,look,he,had,[END]
henry,hamilton,must,have,been,right,when,he,said,that,ashley,was,doing,fine,[END]
scarlett,studied,him,through,lowered,lashes,while,she,busied,herself,clearing,room,on,a,table,for,the,coffee,tray,[END]
ashley,wilkes,was,still,a,handsome,man,[END]
his,thin,aristocratic,features,had,become,more,distinguished,with,age,[END]
but,he,looked,older,than,his,years,[END]
he,can't,be,more,than,forty,scarlett,thought,and,his,hair's,more,silver,than,gold,[END]
he,must,spend,a,lot,more,time,in,the,lumberyard,than,he,used,to,he's,got,a,nice,color,to,his,skin,not,that,office,gray,look,he,had,before,[END]
she,looked,up,with,a,smile,[END]
it,was,good,to,see,him,[END]
especially,looking,so,fit,[END]
her,obligation,to,melanie,didn't,seem,so,burdensome,now,[END]
how's,aunt,pitty,[END]
and,india,[END]
and,beau,[END]
he,must,be,practically,a,grown,man,[END]
pitty,and,india,were,just,the,same,said,ashley,with,a,quirk,of,his,lips,[END]
pitty,got,the,vapors,at,every,passing,shadow,and,india,was,very,busy,with,committee,work,to,improve,the,moral,tone,of,atlanta,[END]
they,spoiled,him,abominably,two,spinsters,trying,to,see,which,one,was,the,best,mother,hen,[END]
they,tried,to,spoil,beau,too,but,he'd,have,none,of,it,[END]
ashley's,gray,eyes,lit,up,with,pride,[END]
beau,was,a,real,little,man,[END]
he'd,be,twelve,soon,but,you'd,take,him,for,almost,fifteen,[END]
he,was,president,of,a,sort,of,club,the,neighborhood,boys,had,formed,[END]
they'd,built,a,tree,house,in,pitty's,backyard,made,from,the,best,lumber,the,mill,turned,out,too,[END]
beau,had,seen,to,that,he,already,knew,more,about,the,lumber,business,than,his,father,said,ashley,with,a,mixture,of,ruefulness,and,admiration,[END]
and,he,added,with,intensified,pride,the,boy,might,have,the,makings,of,a,scholar,[END]
he'd,already,won,a,school,prize,for,latin,composition,and,he,was,reading,books,far,above,his,age,level,[END]
but,you,must,be,bored,by,all,this,scarlett,[END]
proud,fathers,can,be,very,tedious,[END]
not,a,bit,ashley,scarlett,lied,[END]
books,books,books,that,was,exactly,what,was,wrong,with,the,wilkeses,[END]
they,did,all,their,living,out,of,books,not,life,[END]
but,maybe,the,boy,would,be,all,right,[END]
if,he,knew,lumber,already,there,was,hope,for,him,[END]
now,if,ashley,would,just,not,get,all,stiff-necked,she,had,one,more,promise,to,melly,that,she,could,settle,[END]
scarlett,put,her,hand,on,ashley's,sleeve,[END]
i've,got,a,big,favor,to,beg,she,said,[END]
her,eyes,were,wide,with,entreaty,[END]
anything,scarlett,you,should,know,that,[END]
ashley,covered,her,hand,with,his,[END]
i'd,like,for,you,to,promise,that,you'll,let,me,send,beau,to,university,and,then,with,wade,on,a,grand,tour,[END]
it,would,mean,a,lot,to,me,after,all,i,think,about,him,as,practically,my,son,too,seeing,that,i,was,there,when,he,was,born,[END]
and,i've,come,into,really,a,lot,of,money,lately,so,that's,no,problem,[END]
you,can't,be,so,mean,that,you'd,say,no,[END]
scarlett,ashley's,smile,was,gone,[END]
he,looked,very,serious,[END]
oh,bother,he's,going,to,be,difficult,[END]
thank,goodness,here's,that,slowpoke,girl,with,the,coffee,[END]
he,can't,talk,in,front,of,her,and,i'll,have,a,chance,to,jump,in,again,before,he,has,a,chance,to,say,no,[END]
how,many,spoons,of,sugar,ashley,[END]
i'll,fix,your,cup,[END]
ashley,took,the,cup,from,her,hand,put,it,on,the,table,[END]
let,the,coffee,wait,for,a,minute,scarlett,[END]
he,took,her,hand,in,his,[END]
look,at,me,dear,[END]
his,eyes,were,softly,luminous,[END]
scarlett's,thoughts,were,distracted,[END]
why,he,looks,almost,like,the,old,ashley,ashley,wilkes,of,twelve,oaks,[END]
i,know,how,you,came,into,that,money,scarlett,[END]
uncle,henry,let,it,slip,[END]
i,understand,how,you,must,feel,[END]
but,there's,no,need,[END]
he,was,never,worthy,of,you,you're,well,rid,of,rhett,never,mind,how,[END]
you,can,put,it,all,behind,you,as,if,it,never,happened,[END]
great,balls,of,fire,ashley's,going,to,propose,[END]
you're,free,from,rhett,[END]
say,you'll,marry,me,scarlett,and,i'll,pledge,my,life,to,making,you,happy,the,way,that,you,deserve,to,be,[END]
there,was,a,time,when,i,would,have,traded,my,soul,for,those,words,scarlett,thought,it's,not,fair,that,now,i,hear,them,and,don't,feel,anything,at,all,[END]
oh,why,did,ashley,have,to,do,that,[END]
before,the,question,was,formed,in,her,mind,she,knew,the,answer,[END]
it,was,because,of,the,old,gossip,so,long,ago,it,seemed,to,be,now,[END]
ashley,was,determined,to,redeem,her,in,the,eyes,of,atlanta,society,[END]
if,that,wasn't,just,like,him,[END]
he'll,do,the,gentlemanly,thing,even,if,it,means,tearing,up,his,whole,life,[END]
and,mine,too,by,the,way,[END]
he,didn't,bother,to,think,of,that,i,don't,suppose,[END]
scarlett,bit,her,tongue,to,keep,from,unleashing,her,anger,on,him,[END]
poor,ashley,[END]
it,wasn't,his,fault,he,was,the,way,he,was,[END]
rhett,said,it,ashley,belonged,to,that,time,before,the,war,[END]
he's,got,no,place,in,the,world,today,[END]
i,can't,be,angry,or,mean,[END]
i,don't,want,to,lose,anyone,who,was,part,of,the,glory,days,[END]
all,that's,left,of,that,world,is,the,memories,and,the,people,who,share,them,[END]
dearest,ashley,scarlett,said,i,don't,want,to,marry,you,[END]
that's,the,all,of,it,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,play,belle,games,with,you,and,tell,lies,and,keep,you,panting,after,me,[END]
i'm,too,old,for,that,and,i,care,for,you,too,much,[END]
you've,been,a,big,piece,of,my,life,all,along,and,you,always,will,be,[END]
say,you'll,let,me,keep,that,[END]
of,course,my,dear,[END]
i'm,honored,you,feel,that,way,[END]
i,won't,distress,you,by,referring,again,to,marriage,[END]
he,smiled,and,he,looked,so,young,so,much,like,the,ashley,of,twelve,oaks,that,scarlett's,heart,turned,over,[END]
dearest,ashley,[END]
he,mustn't,ever,guess,that,she'd,clearly,heard,relief,in,his,voice,[END]
everything,was,all,right,[END]
no,better,than,all,right,[END]
now,they,could,truly,be,friends,[END]
the,past,was,neatly,finished,[END]
what,are,your,plans,scarlett,[END]
are,you,home,for,good,as,i,hope,[END]
she'd,prepared,for,this,question,even,before,she,sailed,from,galway,[END]
she,must,make,sure,that,no,one,in,atlanta,could,know,how,to,find,her,it,made,her,too,vulnerable,to,rhett,to,losing,cat,[END]
i'm,selling,up,ashley,i,don't,want,to,be,tied,down,at,all,for,a,while,[END]
after,i,visited,in,savannah,i,paid,a,visit,to,some,of,pa's,family,in,ireland,then,i,went,travelling,[END]
she,had,to,be,careful,what,she,said,[END]
ashley,had,been,abroad,he'd,catch,her,out,in,a,minute,if,she,claimed,she'd,been,to,places,she,hadn't,been,[END]
somehow,or,other,i,never,got,around,to,seeing,london,[END]
i,figure,i,might,settle,there,for,a,while,[END]
do,help,me,out,ashley,[END]
do,you,think,london's,a,good,idea,[END]
scarlett,knew,from,melanie,that,he,considered,london,as,perfect,as,a,city,could,be,[END]
he'd,talk,his,head,off,and,forget,to,ask,any,more,questions,[END]
i,enjoyed,the,afternoon,so,much,ashley,[END]
you'll,come,again,won't,you,[END]
i'll,be,here,for,a,while,settling,things,[END]
as,often,as,i,can,[END]
it's,a,rare,pleasure,[END]
ashley,accepted,his,hat,and,gloves,from,the,maid,[END]
goodbye,scarlett,[END]
goodbye,[END]
oh,ashley,you,will,grant,my,favor,i,asked,won't,you,[END]
i'll,be,miserable,if,you,don't,[END]
i,don't,think,[END]
i,swear,to,you,ashley,wilkes,if,you,don't,let,me,set,up,a,little,fund,for,beau,i'll,cry,like,a,river,over,its,banks,[END]
and,you,know,as,well,as,i,do,that,no,gentleman,ever,deliberately,makes,a,lady,cry,[END]
ashley,bowed,over,her,hand,[END]
i,was,thinking,how,much,you'd,changed,scarlett,but,i,was,wrong,[END]
you,can,still,wrap,men,around,your,little,finger,and,make,them,like,it,[END]
i'd,be,a,bad,father,to,deny,beau,a,gift,from,you,[END]
oh,ashley,i,do,love,you,and,i,always,will,[END]
thank,you,[END]
and,run,to,the,kitchen,and,tell,that,scarlett,thought,as,she,watched,the,maid,close,the,door,behind,ashley,[END]
might,as,well,give,all,the,old,cats,something,good,to,gossip,about,[END]
besides,i,do,love,ashley,and,always,will,in,a,way,they'd,never,understand,[END]
it,took,much,longer,than,she'd,expected,for,scarlett,to,accomplish,her,business,in,atlanta,[END]
she,didn't,leave,for,tara,until,june,10,[END]
almost,a,month,away,from,cat,already,[END]
i,can't,bear,it,[END]
she,might,forget,me,[END]
i,probably,missed,a,new,tooth,maybe,two,[END]
suppose,she,was,fretful,and,nobody,knew,that,she'd,feel,better,if,she,could,splash,in,the,water,[END]
it's,so,hot,too,[END]
she,might,have,prickly,heat,[END]
a,little,irish,baby,doesn't,know,anything,about,hot,weather,[END]
during,her,final,week,in,atlanta,scarlett,was,so,jumpy,with,nerves,that,she,could,hardly,sleep,[END]
why,wouldn't,it,rain,[END]
red,dust,covered,everything,only,a,half,hour,after,it,had,been,wiped,away,[END]
but,once,on,the,train,to,jonesboro,she,was,able,to,relax,[END]
in,spite,of,the,delays,she,had,done,everything,she'd,set,out,to,do,and,done,it,better,than,both,henry,hamilton,and,her,new,lawyer,said,it,could,be,done,[END]
naturally,enough,the,saloon,had,been,the,easiest,[END]
the,depression,increased,its,business,and,its,value,[END]
she,was,sad,about,the,store,[END]
it,was,worth,more,for,the,land,it,was,on,than,as,a,business,the,new,owners,were,going,to,tear,it,down,and,put,up,a,building,eight,stories,tall,[END]
five,points,at,least,was,still,five,points,depression,or,no,depression,[END]
she'd,realized,enough,from,those,two,sales,to,buy,another,fifty,acres,and,put,up,another,hundred,houses,on,the,edge,of,the,city,[END]
that,would,keep,ashley,prosperous,for,a,couple,of,years,[END]
plus,the,builder,had,told,her,that,other,builders,were,starting,to,buy,only,from,ashley,too,[END]
they,could,trust,him,not,to,sell,green,lumber,something,that,couldn't,be,said,for,the,other,yards,in,atlanta,[END]
it,really,looked,as,if,he,was,going,to,be,a,success,in,spite,of,himself,[END]
and,she,was,going,to,make,a,fortune,[END]
henry,hamilton,was,right,about,that,[END]
her,little,houses,sold,as,fast,as,they,were,finished,[END]
they,had,made,a,profit,[END]
a,lot,of,profit,[END]
she,was,downright,shocked,when,she,saw,how,much,money,had,accumulated,in,her,bank,account,[END]
enough,to,cover,all,the,expenses,she'd,been,worried,about,at,ballyhara,all,these,months,with,everything,going,out,and,so,little,coming,in,[END]
now,she,was,even,[END]
the,harvest,would,be,all,income,free,and,clear,plus,provide,seed,for,next,year,[END]
and,the,rent,rolls,from,the,town,were,bound,to,keep,growing,[END]
before,she,left,a,cooper,was,asking,about,one,of,the,empty,cottages,and,colum,said,he,had,a,tailor,in,mind,for,another,[END]
she,would,have,done,the,same,thing,even,if,she,hadn't,made,so,much,money,but,it,was,much,easier,to,do,since,she,had,[END]
the,builder,was,instructed,to,send,all,the,future,profits,to,stephen,o'hara,in,savannah,[END]
he'd,have,all,the,money,he,needed,to,carry,out,colum's,instructions,[END]
it,was,funny,about,the,peachtree,street,house,scarlett,thought,[END]
you'd,think,it,would,hurt,to,part,with,it,[END]
after,all,it,was,where,i,lived,with,rhett,the,place,where,bonnie,was,born,and,spent,her,terribly,brief,life,[END]
but,the,only,thing,i,felt,was,relief,[END]
when,that,girls',school,made,an,offer,i,could,have,kissed,the,old,prune-faced,headmistress,[END]
it,felt,like,lifting,chains,off,me,[END]
i'm,free,now,[END]
no,more,obligations,in,atlanta,[END]
nothing,binding,me,in,[END]
scarlett,smiled,to,herself,[END]
just,like,her,corsets,[END]
she,had,never,been,laced,up,again,after,colum,and,kathleen,cut,her,free,in,galway,[END]
her,waist,was,a,few,inches,bigger,but,she,was,still,slimmer,than,most,of,the,women,she,saw,on,the,street,who,were,laced,until,they,could,hardly,breathe,[END]
and,she,was,comfortable,at,any,rate,as,comfortable,as,a,person,could,be,in,this,heat,[END]
she,could,dress,herself,too,not,be,dependent,on,a,maid,[END]
and,the,thick,chignon,she,wore,was,no,trouble,to,do,on,her,own,[END]
it,was,wonderful,to,be,self-sufficient,[END]
it,was,wonderful,not,to,care,about,what,other,people,did,or,did,not,do,or,what,they,approved,or,disapproved,[END]
it,was,most,wonderful,of,all,to,be,going,home,to,one,tara,and,then,taking,her,children,home,to,another,one,[END]
soon,she'd,be,with,her,precious,cat,[END]
soon,after,that,back,again,in,the,fresh,sweet,rainwashed,cool,of,ireland,[END]
scarlett's,hand,stroked,the,soft,leather,pouch,in,her,lap,[END]
she'd,take,the,earth,from,ballyhara,to,her,father's,grave,first,thing,[END]
can,you,see,from,where,you,are,pa,[END]
do,you,know,[END]
you'd,be,so,proud,of,your,katie,scarlett,pa,i'm,the,o'hara,[END]
69,[END]
will,benteen,was,waiting,for,her,at,the,jonesboro,depot,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,his,weather-worn,face,and,deceptively,slack-looking,body,and,grinned,from,ear,to,ear,[END]
will,must,be,the,only,man,god,ever,made,who,could,look,like,he,was,lounging,on,a,peg,leg,[END]
she,hugged,him,ferociously,[END]
landsake,scarlett,you,ought,to,warn,a,man,[END]
nearly,knocked,me,off,my,pin,[END]
it's,good,to,see,you,[END]
it's,good,to,see,you,will,[END]
i,expect,i'm,gladder,to,see,you,than,anybody,else,this,whole,trip,[END]
it,was,true,[END]
will,was,more,dear,to,her,than,even,the,savannah,o'haras,[END]
maybe,because,he'd,been,through,the,bad,times,with,her,maybe,because,he,loved,tara,as,much,as,she,did,[END]
maybe,simply,because,he,was,such,an,honest,good,man,[END]
where's,your,maid,scarlett,[END]
oh,i,don't,fool,with,a,maid,any,more,will,[END]
i,don't,fool,with,a,lot,of,things,i,used,to,fool,with,[END]
will,shifted,the,straw,in,his,mouth,[END]
i,noticed,he,said,laconically,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
she'd,never,thought,before,of,what,it,must,feel,like,to,a,man,when,he,hugged,a,girl,without,stays,[END]
no,more,cages,for,me,will,not,ever,not,any,kind,she,said,[END]
she,wished,she,could,tell,him,why,she,was,so,happy,tell,him,about,cat,about,ballyhara,[END]
if,it,was,only,will,she'd,tell,him,in,a,second,she,trusted,him,[END]
but,he,was,suellen's,husband,and,she,wouldn't,trust,her,sister,as,far,as,she,could,throw,her,with,an,anvil,tied,on,besides,[END]
and,will,might,feel,duty,bound,to,tell,his,wife,everything,[END]
scarlett,had,to,hold,her,tongue,[END]
she,climbed,up,onto,the,seat,of,the,wagon,[END]
she'd,never,known,will,to,use,their,buggy,[END]
he,could,combine,buying,stores,in,jonesboro,with,meeting,the,train,[END]
the,wagon,was,loaded,with,sacks,and,boxes,[END]
tell,me,the,news,will,scarlett,said,when,they,were,on,the,road,[END]

he,started,shooting,up,about,the,day,he,hit,fourteen,last,january,and,it,don't,look,like,he's,ever,going,to,stop,[END]
for,all,the,weedy,look,though,he's,strong,as,a,mule,[END]
works,like,one,too,[END]
thanks,to,him,there's,twenty,fresh,acres,under,crops,this,year,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
what,a,help,he'd,be,at,ballyhara,and,how,he'd,love,it,[END]
a,born,farmer,she'd,never,have,thought,it,[END]
must,take,after,pa,the,leather,pouch,was,warm,in,her,lap,[END]

'course,i'd,have,liked,a,boy,any,man,would,but,i'm,not,complaining,[END]
besides,wade's,been,all,the,son,any,man,could,hope,for,[END]
he's,a,fine,boy,scarlett,[END]
she,was,happy,to,hear,it,[END]
and,surprised,[END]
will,was,right,she,wasn't,going,to,know,wade,[END]
not,if,he,was,anything,close,to,the,boy,will,made,him,out,to,be,[END]

she,didn't,like,them,[END]

but,colum,had,told,her,stephen,was,in,charge,of,all,arrangements,so,she,donned,her,mourning,clothes,and,kept,her,complaints,to,herself,[END]
the,ship,was,named,the,golden,fleece,and,it,was,the,latest,thing,in,luxury,[END]
scarlett,had,no,quibble,with,the,size,or,the,comfort,of,her,suite,[END]
but,it,did,not,make,a,direct,crossing,[END]
it,took,a,week,longer,and,she,was,anxious,to,get,back,to,ballyhara,to,see,how,the,crops,were,faring,[END]
it,was,not,until,she,was,actually,on,the,gangplank,that,she,saw,the,big,notice,of,departure,with,the,ship's,itinerary,or,she,would,have,refused,to,go,no,matter,what,stephen,said,[END]
the,golden,fleece,loaded,passengers,in,savannah,charleston,and,boston,disembarked,them,in,liverpool,and,galway,[END]
scarlett,turned,in,panic,ready,to,run,back,to,the,dock,[END]
she,couldn't,go,to,charleston,she,just,couldn't,[END]
rhett,would,know,she,was,on,the,ship,rhett,always,knew,everything,somehow,and,he'd,walk,right,into,her,stateroom,and,take,cat,away,[END]
i'll,kill,him,first,[END]
anger,drove,away,her,panic,and,scarlett,turned,again,to,walk,up,onto,the,ship's,deck,[END]
rhett,butler,wasn't,going,to,make,her,turn,tail,and,run,[END]
all,her,luggage,was,already,on,board,and,she,was,sure,that,stephen,was,smuggling,guns,to,colum,in,her,trunks,[END]
they,were,depending,on,her,[END]
also,she,wanted,to,get,back,to,ballyhara,and,she,wouldn't,let,anything,or,anybody,stand,in,her,way,[END]
by,the,time,scarlett,reached,her,suite,she,had,built,up,a,consuming,fury,against,rhett,[END]
more,than,a,year,had,passed,since,he,had,divorced,her,then,immediately,married,anne,hampton,[END]
during,that,year,scarlett,had,been,so,busy,had,experienced,such,changes,in,her,life,that,she'd,been,able,to,block,out,the,pain,he,had,caused,her,[END]
now,it,tore,her,heart,and,with,the,pain,was,a,deep,fear,of,rhett's,unpredictable,power,[END]
she,transformed,them,into,rage,[END]
rage,was,strengthening,[END]
bridie,was,travelling,with,scarlett,part,way,[END]
the,boston,o'haras,had,found,her,a,good,position,as,a,lady's,maid,[END]
until,she,learned,the,ship,was,going,to,stop,in,charleston,scarlett,had,been,glad,at,the,prospect,of,bridie's,company,[END]
but,the,thought,of,stopping,in,charleston,made,scarlett,so,nervous,that,her,young,cousin's,constant,chatter,nearly,drove,her,crazy,[END]
why,couldn't,bridie,leave,her,alone,[END]
under,patricia's,tutelage,bridie,had,learned,all,the,duties,of,her,job,and,she,wanted,to,try,them,all,out,on,scarlett,[END]
she,was,loudly,distressed,when,she,learned,that,scarlett,had,stopped,wearing,corsets,and,vocally,disappointed,that,none,of,scarlett's,gowns,needed,mending,[END]
scarlett,longed,to,tell,her,that,the,first,requirement,for,a,lady's,maid,was,to,speak,only,when,spoken,to,but,she,was,fond,of,bridie,and,it,wasn't,the,girl's,fault,that,they,were,going,to,stop,in,charleston,[END]
so,she,forced,herself,to,smile,and,act,as,if,nothing,was,bothering,her,[END]
the,ship,sailed,up,the,coast,during,the,night,entering,charleston,harbor,at,first,light,[END]
scarlett,hadn't,slept,at,all,[END]
she,went,out,on,deck,for,the,sunrise,[END]
there,was,a,rose-tinted,mist,on,the,wide,waters,of,the,harbor,[END]
beyond,it,the,city,was,blurred,and,insubstantial,like,a,city,in,a,dream,[END]
the,white,steeple,of,saint,michael's,church,was,palest,pink,[END]
scarlett,imagined,that,she,could,hear,its,familiar,chimes,faintly,in,the,distance,between,the,slow,strokes,of,the,ship's,engine,[END]
they,must,be,unloading,the,fishing,boats,at,the,market,now,no,it's,a,little,early,yet,they,must,still,be,coming,in,[END]
she,strained,her,eyes,but,the,mist,hid,the,boats,if,they,were,there,ahead,[END]
she,concentrated,on,remembering,the,different,kinds,of,fish,the,vegetables,the,names,of,the,coffee,vendors,the,sausage,man,anything,to,keep,her,mind,occupied,to,fend,off,memories,she,didn't,dare,confront,[END]
but,as,the,sun,cleared,the,horizon,behind,her,the,tinted,mist,lifted,and,she,saw,the,pocked,walls,of,fort,sumter,to,one,side,[END]
the,fleece,was,entering,the,waters,where,she'd,sailed,with,rhett,and,laughed,at,the,dolphins,with,him,and,been,struck,by,the,storm,with,him,[END]
damn,him,[END]
i,hate,him,and,his,damned,charleston,[END]
scarlett,told,herself,she,should,go,to,her,stateroom,lock,herself,in,with,cat,but,she,stood,as,if,rooted,to,the,deck,[END]
slowly,the,city,grew,larger,more,distinct,glowing,white,and,pink,and,green,pastel,in,the,shimmering,morning,air,[END]
she,could,hear,saint,michael's,chimes,smell,the,heavy,tropical,sweetness,of,blooming,flowers,see,the,palm,trees,in,white,point,gardens,the,opalescent,glitter,of,crushed,oyster,shell,paths,[END]
then,the,ship,was,passing,the,promenade,along,east,battery,[END]
scarlett,could,see,above,it,from,the,ship's,deck,[END]
there,were,the,treetop-tall,columns,of,the,butler,house,the,shadowed,piazzas,the,front,door,the,windows,to,the,drawing,room,her,bedroom,the,windows,[END]
and,the,telescope,in,the,card,room,[END]
she,picked,up,her,skirts,and,ran,[END]
she,ordered,breakfast,served,in,her,suite,insisted,that,bridie,stay,with,her,and,cat,[END]
the,only,safety,was,there,locked,in,out,of,sight,[END]
where,rhett,couldn't,find,out,about,cat,and,take,her,away,[END]
the,steward,spread,a,glistening,white,cloth,on,the,round,table,in,scarlett's,sitting,room,then,rolled,in,a,cart,with,two,tiers,of,silver,domed,plates,[END]
bridie,giggled,[END]
while,he,meticulously,set,places,and,floral,centerpiece,he,talked,about,charleston,[END]
it,was,all,scarlett,could,do,not,to,correct,him,he,had,so,many,things,wrong,[END]
but,he,was,scottish,on,a,scottish,ship,why,should,anyone,expect,him,to,know,anything,[END]
we'll,be,sailing,again,at,five,o'clock,said,the,steward,after,cargo's,loaded,and,the,new,passengers,board,[END]
you,ladies,might,want,to,take,an,excursion,to,see,the,town,[END]
he,began,placing,platters,and,lifting,off,their,covers,[END]
there's,a,nice,buggy,with,a,driver,who,knows,all,the,places,to,see,[END]
only,fifty,pence,or,two,dollars,fifty,american,[END]
waiting,at,the,foot,of,the,gangplank,[END]
or,if,you'd,like,some,cooler,air,off,the,water,there's,a,boat,over,at,the,next,wharf,south,that,goes,up,the,river,[END]
there,was,a,big,civil,war,in,america,some,ten,years,back,[END]
you,can,see,the,ruins,of,big,mansion,houses,burnt,by,the,armies,fighting,over,them,[END]
you'd,have,to,hurry,though,she,leaves,in,forty,minutes,[END]
scarlett,tried,to,eat,a,piece,of,toast,but,it,stuck,in,her,throat,[END]
the,gilded,clock,on,the,desk,ticked,the,minutes,away,[END]
it,sounded,very,loud,to,her,[END]
at,the,end,of,a,half,hour,she,jumped,up,[END]
i'm,going,out,bridie,but,don't,you,dare,stir,a,step,[END]
open,the,portholes,use,that,palmetto,fan,over,there,but,you,and,cat,stay,in,here,with,the,door,locked,no,matter,how,hot,it,gets,[END]

where,are,you,going,scarlett,[END]
never,mind,about,that,[END]
i'll,be,back,before,the,ship,sails,[END]
the,excursion,boat,was,a,small,rear-wheel,paddle,boat,painted,in,bright,red,white,and,blue,[END]
its,name,in,gold,letters,was,abraham,lincoln,[END]
scarlett,remembered,it,well,[END]
she'd,seen,it,passing,dunmore,landing,[END]
july,was,not,a,month,when,many,people,toured,the,south,[END]
she,was,one,of,only,a,dozen,passengers,[END]
she,sat,under,an,awning,on,the,upper,deck,fanning,herself,and,cursing,mourning,dress,for,its,long-sleeved,high-necked,sweltering,effect,in,the,southern,summer,heat,[END]
a,man,in,a,tall,top,hat,striped,red,and,white,bellowed,commentary,through,a,megaphone,[END]
it,made,her,angrier,by,the,minute,[END]
look,at,all,those,fat-faced,yankees,she,thought,with,hatred,they're,just,lapping,this,up,[END]
cruel,slave,owners,indeed,[END]
sold,down,the,river,my,foot,[END]
we,loved,our,darkies,just,like,family,and,some,of,them,owned,us,more,than,we,owned,them,[END]
uncle,tom's,cabin,[END]
fiddle-dee-dee,[END]
no,decent,person,would,read,that,kind,of,trash,[END]
she,wished,she,hadn't,given,in,to,the,impulse,to,come,[END]
it,was,only,going,to,upset,her,[END]
it,was,already,upsetting,her,and,they,weren't,even,out,of,the,harbor,and,into,the,ashley,river,yet,[END]
mercifully,the,commentator,ran,out,of,things,to,say,and,for,a,long,while,the,only,sound,was,the,thunk-thunk,of,the,pistons,and,the,splash,of,water,as,it,fell,from,the,wheel,[END]
marsh,grass,was,green,and,gold,on,both,sides,with,wide,moss-hung,oaks,on,the,riverbank,behind,it,[END]
dragonflies,darted,through,the,midge-dancing,air,above,the,grass,occasionally,a,fish,leapt,from,the,water,then,flopped,back,in,[END]
scarlett,sat,quietly,removed,from,the,other,passengers,nursing,her,rancor,[END]
rhett's,plantation,was,ruined,and,he,was,doing,nothing,to,save,it,[END]
camellias,[END]
at,ballyhara,she,had,hundreds,of,acres,of,healthy,crops,where,she,had,found,rank,weeds,[END]
and,she,had,rebuilt,an,entire,town,while,he,just,sat,and,stared,at,his,burnt,chimneys,[END]
that's,why,she,had,come,on,the,paddleboat,she,told,herself,[END]
it,would,make,her,feel,good,to,see,how,far,she,was,outstripping,him,[END]
scarlett,tensed,before,each,bend,relaxed,when,it,was,past,and,rhett's,house,had,not,appeared,[END]
she'd,forgotten,ashley,barony,[END]
julia,ashley's,big,square,brick,house,looked,magnificently,forbidding,in,the,center,of,its,unadorned,lawn,[END]
this,is,the,only,plantation,the,heroic,union,forces,did,not,destroy,bawled,the,man,in,the,absurd,hat,[END]
it,was,not,in,the,tender,heart,of,their,commander,to,injure,the,frail,spinster,woman,who,lay,ill,inside,[END]
scarlett,laughed,aloud,[END]
frail,spinster,indeed,[END]
miss,julia,must,have,scared,the,pants,off,him,[END]
the,other,passengers,looked,at,her,curiously,but,scarlett,was,unaware,of,their,scrutiny,[END]
the,landing,would,be,next,[END]
yes,there,was,the,phosphate,mine,[END]
so,much,bigger,[END]
there,were,five,barges,being,loaded,[END]
she,searched,under,the,wide-brimmed,hat,of,the,man,on,the,dock,[END]
it,was,that,white-trash,soldier,she,couldn't,remember,his,name,something,like,hawkins,no,matter,around,that,bend,past,that,big,live,oak,[END]
the,angle,of,the,sunlight,sculpted,the,great,grass,terraces,of,dunmore,landing,into,green,velvet,giant,steps,and,scattered,sequins,on,the,butterfly,lakes,beside,the,river,[END]
scarlett's,involuntary,cry,was,lost,in,the,exclamations,of,the,yankees,crowded,around,her,along,the,rail,[END]
at,the,top,of,the,terraces,the,scorched,chimneys,were,tall,sentinels,against,the,painfully,bright,blue,sky,an,alligator,was,sunning,itself,on,the,grass,between,the,lakes,[END]
dunmore,landing,was,like,its,owner,cultivated,damaged,dangerous,[END]
and,unreachable,[END]
the,shutters,were,closed,on,the,wing,that,remained,the,place,that,rhett,used,for,his,office,and,his,home,[END]
her,eyes,darted,avidly,from,spot,to,spot,comparing,her,memory,to,what,she,saw,[END]
much,more,of,the,garden,was,cleared,and,everything,looked,as,if,it,was,thriving,[END]
some,building,was,going,up,behind,the,house,she,could,smell,raw,lumber,see,the,top,of,a,roof,[END]
the,shutters,of,the,house,were,fixed,or,maybe,new,[END]
they,didn't,sag,at,all,and,they,glistened,with,green,paint,[END]
he'd,done,a,lot,of,work,over,the,fall,and,winter,[END]

scarlett,tried,to,look,away,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,see,the,newly,cleared,gardens,[END]
anne,loves,those,flowers,as,much,as,rhett,does,[END]
and,the,fixed-up,shutters,must,mean,a,fixed-up,house,where,the,two,of,them,live,together,[END]

scarlett,pushed,past,the,concerned,stranger,[END]
the,heat,she,said,[END]
i'll,go,over,there,deeper,in,the,shade,[END]
for,the,remainder,of,the,excursion,she,looked,only,at,the,unevenly,painted,deck,[END]
the,day,seemed,to,last,forever,[END]
70,[END]
five,o'clock,was,striking,when,scarlett,ran,pell-mell,down,the,ramp,from,the,abraham,lincoln,[END]
damn,fool,boat,[END]
she,stopped,to,catch,her,breath,on,the,dock,[END]
she,could,see,that,the,gangplank,of,the,golden,fleece,was,still,in,place,[END]
no,harm,done,[END]
but,still,the,master,of,the,excursion,boat,should,be,horsewhipped,[END]
she'd,been,half,out,of,her,mind,ever,since,four,o'clock,[END]
thank,you,for,waiting,for,me,she,said,to,the,ship's,officer,at,the,head,of,the,gangplank,[END]
oh,there,are,more,to,come,he,said,and,scarlett,transferred,her,anger,to,the,captain,of,the,fleece,[END]
if,he,said,five,o'clock,he,should,sail,at,five,o'clock,[END]
the,sooner,she,got,away,from,charleston,the,happier,she,would,be,[END]
this,must,be,the,hottest,place,on,the,face,of,the,earth,[END]
she,shaded,her,eyes,with,her,hand,to,look,at,the,sky,[END]
not,a,cloud,in,sight,[END]
no,rain,no,wind,[END]
just,heat,[END]
she,started,along,deck,towards,her,rooms,[END]
poor,baby,cat,must,be,practically,cooked,[END]
as,soon,as,they,got,out,of,the,harbor,she'd,bring,her,up,on,deck,for,whatever,breeze,the,ship's,movement,might,cause,[END]
clattering,hoofbeats,and,feminine,laughter,caught,her,attention,[END]
maybe,this,was,who,they,were,waiting,for,[END]
she,glanced,down,at,an,open,victoria,[END]
with,three,fabulous,hats,on,the,women,in,it,[END]
they,weren't,like,any,hats,she'd,ever,seen,and,even,from,a,distance,she,could,tell,they,were,very,expensive,[END]
wide,brimmed,decorated,with,clusters,of,feathers,or,plumes,held,by,sparkling,jewels,and,swirled,with,airy,tulle,netting,from,scarlett's,perspective,the,hats,were,like,wonderful,parasols,or,fantastic,confections,of,pastry,on,big,trays,[END]
i'd,look,simply,wonderful,in,a,hat,like,that,[END]
she,leaned,slightly,over,the,rail,to,look,at,the,women,[END]
they,were,elegant,even,in,the,heat,wearing,pale,organdy,or,voile,trimmed,with,it,looked,like,wide,silk,ribbon,or,was,it,ruching,on,cuirass,fronts,and,scarlett,blinked,no,bustle,at,all,not,even,a,hint,of,one,and,no,train,either,[END]
she,hadn't,seen,anything,like,that,in,savannah,or,atlanta,[END]
who,were,these,people,[END]
her,eyes,devoured,the,pale,kid,gloves,and,folded,parasols,lace,she,thought,but,she,couldn't,be,sure,[END]
whoever,they,were,they,certainly,were,having,a,good,time,laughing,their,heads,off,and,not,hurrying,to,get,on,the,ship,they,were,holding,up,either,[END]
the,panama-hatted,man,with,them,stepped,down,into,the,street,[END]
with,his,left,hand,he,took,off,his,hat,[END]
his,right,hand,reached,upward,to,hand,the,first,woman,down,[END]
scarlett's,hands,clutched,the,railing,[END]
dear,god,it's,rhett,[END]
i've,got,to,run,inside,[END]
no,[END]
no,[END]
if,he's,on,this,ship,i've,got,to,get,cat,off,find,a,place,to,hide,find,another,ship,[END]
but,i,can't,do,that,[END]
i've,got,two,trunks,in,the,hold,with,frilly,dresses,and,colum's,rifles,in,them,[END]
what,in,the,name,of,god,am,i,going,to,do,[END]
her,mind,raced,from,one,impossible,idea,to,another,while,she,stared,blindly,at,the,group,below,her,[END]
slowly,her,brain,registered,what,she,was,seeing,rhett,was,bowing,kissing,one,gracefully,extended,hand,after,another,[END]
her,ears,opened,to,the,repeated,goodbye,and,thank,you,of,the,women,[END]
cat,was,safe,[END]
but,scarlett,was,not,[END]
her,protective,rage,had,disappeared,and,her,heart,was,exposed,[END]
he,doesn't,see,me,[END]
i,can,look,at,him,all,i,want,[END]
please,please,don't,put,your,hat,back,on,rhett,[END]
how,well,he,looked,[END]
his,skin,was,brown,his,smile,as,white,as,his,linen,suit,[END]
he,was,the,only,man,in,the,world,who,didn't,wrinkle,linen,[END]
ah,that,lock,of,hair,that,annoyed,him,so,was,falling,down,on,his,forehead,again,[END]
rhett,flicked,it,back,with,two,fingers,in,a,gesture,that,scarlett,knew,so,well,she,felt,weak-kneed,with,possessive,memory,[END]
what,was,he,saying,[END]
something,outrageously,charming,she,was,sure,but,he,was,using,that,low,intimate,voice,he,saved,for,women,[END]
curse,him,[END]
and,curse,those,women,[END]
she,wanted,that,voice,murmuring,to,her,only,her,[END]
the,ship's,captain,walked,down,the,gangplank,adjusting,the,set,of,his,gold,epauletted,jacket,[END]
don't,make,them,hurry,scarlett,wanted,to,shout,[END]
stay,stay,just,a,little,longer,[END]
it's,my,last,chance,[END]
i'll,never,see,him,again,[END]
let,me,store,up,the,sight,of,him,[END]
he,must,have,just,had,his,share,cut,there's,the,tiniest,pale,line,above,his,ears,[END]
is,that,more,gray,at,the,temples,[END]
it,looks,so,elegant,the,silver,streaking,his,crow-black,hair,[END]
i,remember,how,it,felt,under,my,fingers,crisp,and,shockingly,soft,at,the,same,time,[END]
and,the,muscles,in,his,shoulders,and,his,arms,sliding,so,smoothly,under,the,skin,stretching,the,skin,when,they,hardened,[END]
i,want,[END]
the,ship's,whistle,shrieked,loudly,[END]
scarlett,jumped,[END]
she,could,hear,rapid,footsteps,the,rumble,of,the,gangplank,but,she,kept,her,eyes,fixed,on,rhett,[END]
he,was,smiling,looking,over,there,to,her,right,looking,up,[END]
she,could,see,his,dark,eyes,and,slashing,brows,and,impeccably,groomed,mustache,[END]
his,entire,strong,masculine,unforgettable,pirate's,face,[END]
my,beloved,she,whispered,my,love,[END]
rhett,bowed,once,again,[END]
the,ship,was,moving,away,from,the,dock,[END]
he,put,his,hat,on,and,turned,away,[END]
his,thumb,tilted,the,hat,to,the,back,of,his,head,[END]
don't,go,cried,scarlett's,heart,[END]
rhett,glanced,over,his,shoulder,as,if,there,had,been,a,sound,[END]
his,eyes,met,hers,and,surprise,stiffened,his,lithe,body,[END]
for,a,long,immeasurable,moment,the,two,of,them,looked,at,each,other,while,the,space,between,them,widened,[END]
then,blandness,smoothed,rhett's,face,as,he,touched,two,fingers,to,his,hat,brim,in,salute,[END]
scarlett,lifted,her,hand,[END]
he,was,still,standing,there,on,the,dock,when,the,ship,turned,into,the,channel,to,the,sea,[END]
when,scarlett,could,see,him,no,longer,she,sank,numbly,into,a,deck,chair,[END]
don't,be,silly,bridie,the,steward,will,sit,right,outside,the,door,[END]
he'll,come,get,us,if,cat,so,much,as,turns,over,[END]
there's,no,reason,for,you,not,to,come,to,the,dining,saloon,[END]
you,can't,have,your,dinner,in,here,every,night,[END]
there's,reason,enough,for,me,scarlett,[END]
i,don't,feel,easy,among,fancy,gentlemen,and,ladies,pretending,to,be,one,of,them,[END]
you're,just,as,good,as,they,are,i,told,you,that,[END]
and,i,heard,you,say,it,scarlett,but,you,don't,hear,me,[END]
i,prefer,to,have,me,meal,in,here,with,all,the,silver,hats,on,the,dishes,and,my,manners,my,own,business,[END]
'tis,soon,enough,i'll,have,to,go,where,the,lady,i'm,maiding,tells,me,to,go,and,do,what,i'm,told,to,do,[END]
it's,certain,that,having,a,grand,meal,in,private,comfort,won't,be,one,of,my,instructions,[END]
i'll,take,it,now,while,i,can,[END]
scarlett,had,to,agree,with,bridie,[END]
but,she,couldn't,possibly,have,dinner,in,the,suite,herself,[END]
not,tonight,[END]
she,had,to,find,out,who,those,women,were,and,why,they,were,with,rhett,or,she'd,go,mad,[END]
they,were,english,she,learned,as,soon,as,she,entered,the,dining,saloon,[END]
the,distinctive,accent,was,dominating,the,captain's,table,[END]
scarlett,told,the,steward,that,she,would,like,to,change,her,seating,to,the,small,table,near,the,wall,[END]
the,table,near,the,wall,was,also,near,the,captain's,table,[END]
there,were,fourteen,at,his,table,a,dozen,english,passengers,the,captain,and,his,first,officer,[END]
scarlett,had,a,keen,ear,and,could,tell,almost,at,once,that,the,passengers',accents,were,different,from,the,ship's,officers,although,to,her,they,were,all,english,and,therefore,to,be,despised,by,anyone,with,a,drop,of,irish,blood,[END]
they,were,talking,about,charleston,[END]
scarlett,gathered,that,they,didn't,think,much,of,it,[END]
my,dears,one,of,the,women,trumpeted,i've,never,seen,anything,as,dreary,in,my,life,[END]
how,my,darling,mama,could,have,told,me,that,it,was,the,only,civilized,place,in,america,[END]
it,simply,makes,me,worry,that,she's,gone,dotty,without,our,noticing,[END]
now,sarah,said,the,man,to,her,left,you,do,have,to,take,that,war,of,theirs,into,consideration,[END]
i,found,the,men,to,be,very,decent,[END]
down,to,their,last,shilling,i'm,sure,but,never,a,mention,and,the,liquor,was,first,rate,[END]
single,malt,at,the,club,bar,[END]
geoffrey,my,love,you'd,think,the,sahara,was,civilized,if,there,was,a,club,with,drinkable,whiskey,[END]
heaven,only,knows,it,couldn't,be,any,hotter,[END]
beastly,climate,[END]
there,was,a,chorus,of,agreement,[END]
on,the,other,hand,said,a,youthful,female,voice,that,terribly,attractive,butler,man,said,the,winters,are,quite,delightful,[END]
he,invited,us,back,[END]
i'm,sure,he,invited,you,back,felicity,said,an,older,woman,[END]
you,behaved,disgracefully,[END]
frances,i,did,no,such,thing,protested,felicity,[END]
i,was,only,having,some,fun,for,the,first,time,on,this,dreary,trip,[END]
i,cannot,credit,why,papa,sent,me,to,america,[END]
it's,a,wretched,place,[END]
a,man,laughed,[END]
he,sent,you,sister,dear,to,get,you,out,of,the,clutches,of,that,fortune,hunter,[END]
but,he,was,so,attractive,[END]
i,don't,see,any,point,in,having,a,fortune,if,you,have,to,fend,off,every,attractive,man,in,england,simply,because,he's,not,rich,[END]
at,least,you're,supposed,to,fend,them,off,felicity,said,a,girl,[END]
that's,easy,enough,to,do,[END]
think,of,our,poor,brother,[END]
roger's,supposed,to,draw,american,heiresses,like,flies,and,marry,a,fortune,to,refill,the,family,coffers,[END]
roger,groaned,and,everyone,laughed,[END]
talk,about,rhett,scarlett,implored,silently,[END]
there's,simply,no,market,for,honourables,roger,said,[END]
i,can't,get,it,through,papa's,head,[END]
heiresses,want,tiaras,[END]
the,older,woman,they,called,frances,said,that,she,thought,they,were,all,disgraceful,and,that,she,couldn't,understand,young,people,today,[END]
when,i,was,a,gel,she,began,[END]
felicity,giggled,[END]
frances,dear,when,you,were,a,gel',there,were,no,young,people,[END]
your,generation,were,born,forty,years,old,and,disapproving,of,everything,[END]
your,impertinence,is,intolerable,felicity,[END]
i,shall,speak,to,your,father,[END]
a,brief,silence,fell,[END]
why,on,earth,doesn't,that,felicity,person,say,something,more,about,rhett,[END]
scarlett,thought,[END]
it,was,roger,who,brought,up,the,name,[END]
butler,he,said,offered,some,good,shooting,if,he,came,back,in,the,autumn,[END]
seems,he,had,rice,fields,gone,to,grass,and,the,ducks,practically,landed,on,the,barrel,of,your,gun,[END]
scarlett,tore,a,roll,into,fragments,[END]
who,gave,two,cents,about,ducks,[END]
the,other,englishmen,did,it,seemed,[END]
they,talked,about,shooting,throughout,the,main,course,of,dinner,[END]
she,was,thinking,she'd,have,done,better,to,stay,with,bridie,when,her,ears,picked,up,a,low-toned,private,conversation,between,felicity,and,her,sister,whose,name,turned,out,to,be,marjorie,[END]
both,of,them,thought,rhett,one,of,the,most,intriguing,men,they'd,ever,met,[END]
scarlett,listened,with,mixed,feelings,of,curiosity,and,pride,[END]
a,shame,he's,so,devoted,to,his,wife,marjorie,said,and,scarlett's,heart,sank,[END]
such,a,colorless,little,thing,too,felicity,said,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,little,bit,better,[END]
out,and,out,rebound,i,heard,[END]
didn't,anyone,tell,you,[END]
he,was,married,before,to,an,absolute,tearing,beauty,[END]
she,ran,off,with,another,man,and,left,rhett,butler,flat,[END]
he's,never,gotten,over,it,[END]
gracious,marjorie,can,you,imagine,what,the,other,man,must,be,like,if,she'd,leave,the,butler,man,for,him,[END]
scarlett,smiled,to,herself,[END]
she,was,enormously,gratified,to,know,that,gossip,had,her,leaving,rhett,and,not,the,other,way,around,[END]
she,felt,much,better,than,when,she'd,sat,down,[END]
she,might,even,have,some,dessert,[END]
the,following,day,the,english,discovered,scarlett,[END]
the,three,young,people,agreed,that,she,was,a,superbly,romantic,figure,a,mysterious,young,widow,[END]
damned,nice,looking,too,roger,added,[END]
his,sisters,told,him,he,must,be,going,blind,[END]
with,her,pale,skin,and,dark,hair,and,those,green,eyes,she,was,fantastically,beautiful,[END]
the,only,thing,she,needed,was,some,decent,clothes,and,she'd,turn,heads,wherever,she,went,[END]
they,decided,they'd,take,her,up,[END]
marjorie,made,the,approach,by,admiring,cat,when,scarlett,had,her,on,deck,for,an,airing,[END]
scarlett,was,more,than,willing,to,be,taken,up,[END]
she,wanted,to,hear,every,detail,of,every,hour,they'd,spent,in,charleston,[END]
it,wasn't,difficult,for,her,to,invent,a,tragic,story,of,her,marriage,and,bereavement,that,satisfied,all,their,cravings,for,melodrama,[END]
roger,fell,in,love,with,her,within,the,first,hour,[END]
scarlett,had,been,taught,by,her,mother,that,genteel,discretion,about,family,matters,was,one,of,the,hallmarks,of,a,lady,[END]
felicity,and,marjorie,cowperthwaite,shocked,her,with,their,casual,unveiling,of,family,skeletons,[END]
their,mother,they,said,was,a,pretty,and,clever,woman,who,had,trapped,their,father,into,marriage,[END]
she,managed,to,be,run,down,by,his,horse,when,he,was,out,riding,[END]
poor,papa,is,so,dim,marjorie,laughed,that,he,thought,he'd,probably,ruined,her,because,her,frock,was,torn,and,he,saw,her,bare,breasts,[END]
we're,certain,that,she,tore,it,herself,before,she,ever,left,the,vicarage,[END]
she,married,him,like,a,shot,before,he,could,puzzle,out,what,she,was,up,to,[END]
to,add,to,scarlett's,confusion,felicity,and,marjorie,were,ladies,[END]
not,simply,ladies,as,opposed,to,women,[END]
they,were,lady,felicity,and,lady,marjorie,and,their,dim,papa,was,an,earl,[END]
frances,sturbridge,their,disapproving,chaperone,was,also,lady,they,explained,but,she,was,lady,sturbridge,not,lady,frances,because,she,wasn't,born,a,lady,and,she'd,married,a,man,who,was,only,a,baronet,[END]
whereas,i,could,marry,one,of,the,footmen,and,marjorie,could,run,off,with,the,boot,boy,and,we'd,still,be,lady,felicity,and,marjorie,in,the,foul,sinks,of,bristol,where,our,husbands,robbed,poor,boxes,to,support,us,[END]
scarlett,could,only,laugh,[END]
it's,too,complicated,for,me,she,admitted,[END]
oh,but,my,dear,it,can,be,ever,so,much,more,complicated,than,our,boring,little,family,[END]
when,you,get,into,widows,and,horrid,little,viscounts,and,third,son's,wives,and,so,on,it's,like,a,labyrinth,[END]
mama,has,to,hire,advice,every,time,she,gives,a,dinner,or,she'd,be,guaranteed,to,insult,someone,fearfully,important,[END]
you,simply,must,not,seat,the,daughter,of,an,earl's,younger,son,like,roger,below,somebody,like,poor,frances,[END]
it's,all,too,foolish,for,words,[END]
the,cowperthwaite,ladies,were,more,than,a,little,giddy,and,rattlebrained,and,roger,seemed,to,have,inherited,some,of,papa's,dimness,but,they,were,a,cheerful,and,warmhearted,trio,who,genuinely,liked,scarlett,[END]
they,made,the,trip,fun,for,her,and,she,was,sorry,when,they,left,the,ship,at,liverpool,[END]
now,she,had,almost,two,full,days,before,she,got,to,galway,and,she,wouldn't,be,able,to,delay,any,longer,thinking,about,the,meeting,with,rhett,in,charleston,that,was,really,no,meeting,at,all,[END]
had,he,felt,the,same,shock,of,recognition,she,had,when,their,eyes,met,[END]
it,was,for,her,as,if,the,rest,of,the,world,disappeared,and,they,were,alone,in,some,place,and,time,separate,from,everything,and,everyone,that,existed,[END]
it,wasn't,possible,that,she,could,feel,so,bound,to,him,by,a,look,and,that,he,would,not,feel,the,same,way,[END]
was,it,[END]
she,worried,and,relived,the,moment,until,she,began,to,think,she'd,dreamed,it,or,even,imagined,it,[END]
when,the,fleece,entered,galway,bay,she,was,able,to,store,the,memory,with,her,other,prized,memories,of,rhett,[END]
ballyhara,was,waiting,and,harvest,time,was,near,[END]
but,first,she,had,to,smile,and,whisk,her,trunks,past,the,customs,inspectors,[END]
colum,was,expecting,the,weapons,[END]
it,was,hard,to,remember,that,the,english,were,all,such,bad,people,when,the,cowperthwaites,were,so,charming,[END]
71,[END]
colum,was,waiting,at,the,end,of,the,gangplank,when,scarlett,left,the,golden,fleece,[END]
she,hadn't,expected,him,she'd,known,only,that,someone,would,meet,her,and,take,care,of,her,trunks,[END]
at,the,sight,of,his,stocky,figure,in,worn,black,clericals,and,smiling,irish,face,scarlett,felt,that,she'd,come,home,[END]
her,luggage,went,past,customs,without,any,questions,other,than,and,how,are,things,in,america,[END]
to,which,she,answered,awful,hot,and,how,old,is,that,grand,beautiful,baby,then,[END]
to,which,scarlett,replied,proudly,three,months,shy,of,a,year,and,already,trying,to,walk,[END]
it,took,nearly,an,hour,to,drive,the,short,distance,from,the,port,to,the,train,station,[END]
scarlett,had,never,seen,such,traffic,snarls,not,even,at,five,points,[END]
it,was,because,of,the,galway,races,said,colum,[END]
before,scarlett,could,remember,what,had,happened,to,her,the,previous,year,in,galway,he,quickly,added,details,[END]
steeplechase,and,flat,racing,five,days',worth,every,july,[END]
it,meant,that,the,militia,and,constabulary,were,too,busy,in,the,city,to,be,wasting,time,idling,around,the,docks,[END]
it,also,meant,that,there,was,not,a,hotel,room,to,he,had,at,any,price,[END]
they'd,be,taking,the,afternoon,train,to,ballinasloe,and,spending,the,night,there,[END]
scarlett,wished,there,was,a,train,all,the,way,to,mullingar,[END]
she,wanted,to,get,home,[END]
how,are,the,fields,colum,[END]
is,the,wheat,nearly,ripe,[END]
is,hay,cut,yet,[END]
has,there,been,plenty,of,sun,[END]
and,what,about,the,that,was,cut,[END]
was,there,enough,[END]
did,it,dry,out,like,it,was,supposed,to,[END]
is,it,good,[END]
does,it,burn,hot,[END]
wait,and,see,scarlett,darling,[END]
you'll,be,pleased,with,your,ballyhara,i'm,certain,of,it,[END]
scarlett,was,much,more,than,pleased,[END]
she,was,overcome,[END]
the,townspeople,had,erected,arches,covered,with,fresh,greenery,and,gold,ribbon,over,her,route,through,ballyhara,town,[END]
they,stood,outside,the,arches,waving,handkerchiefs,and,hats,cheering,her,return,[END]
oh,thank,you,thank,you,thank,you,she,cried,over,and,over,with,tears,brimming,from,her,eyes,[END]
at,the,big,house,mrs,fitzpatrick,and,the,three,ill-assorted,maids,and,the,four,dairymaids,and,the,stablemen,were,lined,up,to,greet,her,[END]
scarlett,could,barely,keep,herself,from,hugging,mrs,fitz,but,she,obeyed,the,housekeeper's,rules,and,maintained,her,dignity,[END]
cat,was,bound,by,no,rules,[END]
she,laughed,and,held,out,her,arms,to,mrs,fitzpatrick,and,was,immediately,caught,up,in,an,emotion-ridden,embrace,[END]
less,than,an,hour,later,scarlett,was,dressed,in,her,galway,peasant,clothes,striding,quickly,over,her,fields,cat,in,her,arms,[END]
it,felt,so,good,to,be,moving,stretching,her,legs,[END]
there'd,been,too,many,hours,days,weeks,of,sitting,[END]
on,trains,and,ships,in,offices,and,armchairs,[END]
now,she,wanted,to,walk,ride,bend,reach,run,dance,[END]
she,was,the,o'hara,home,again,and,the,sun,was,warm,between,gentle,cooling,swiftly,passing,irish,rains,[END]
fragrant,mounds,of,golden,hay,stood,in,field,cocks,seven,feet,tall,on,the,meadows,[END]
scarlett,made,a,cave,in,one,and,crawled,inside,it,with,cat,to,play,house,[END]
cat,shrieked,with,delight,when,she,pulled,part,of,the,roof,down,on,them,[END]
and,then,when,the,dust,made,her,sneeze,[END]
she,picked,off,dried,blossoms,and,put,them,in,her,mouth,[END]
her,expression,of,disgust,when,she,spat,them,out,made,scarlett,laugh,[END]
scarlett's,laughter,made,cat,frown,[END]
which,made,scarlett,laugh,all,the,more,[END]
better,get,used,to,being,laughed,at,miss,cat,o'hara,she,said,because,you're,a,wonderfully,silly,little,girl,and,you,make,your,momma,very,very,happy,and,when,people,are,happy,they,laugh,a,lot,[END]
scarlett,took,cat,back,to,the,house,when,she,started,yawning,[END]
pick,the,hay,out,of,her,hair,while,she,naps,she,told,peggy,quinn,[END]
i'll,be,back,in,time,to,give,her,supper,and,a,bath,[END]
she,interrupted,the,slow,chewing,contemplation,of,one,of,the,plow,horses,in,the,stable,to,ride,him,bareback,and,astride,over,ballyhara,in,the,lingering,slowly,dimming,twilight,[END]
the,wheat,fields,were,richly,yellow,even,in,the,blue-hued,light,[END]
there,would,be,a,bounteous,harvest,[END]
scarlett,rode,home,content,[END]
ballyhara,would,probably,never,deliver,the,kind,of,profit,she'd,earned,from,building,and,selling,cheap,houses,but,there,were,satisfactions,beyond,earning,money,[END]
the,land,of,the,o'haras,was,fruitful,again,she,had,brought,it,back,at,least,in,part,and,next,year,there'd,be,more,acres,tilled,the,year,after,still,more,[END]
it's,so,good,to,be,back,scarlett,said,to,kathleen,next,morning,[END]
i,have,about,a,million,messages,from,everybody,in,savannah,[END]
she,settled,herself,happily,beside,the,hearth,and,put,cat,down,to,explore,the,floor,[END]
before,long,the,heads,began,to,appear,above,the,half,door,everyone,eager,to,hear,about,america,and,bridie,and,all,the,rest,[END]
at,the,angelus,the,women,hurried,back,down,the,boreen,to,the,village,and,the,o'hara,men,came,in,from,the,fields,for,their,dinner,[END]
everyone,except,seamus,and,of,course,sean,who'd,always,taken,his,bills,in,the,small,cottage,with,old,katie,scarlett,o'hara,[END]
scarlett,didn't,notice,at,the,time,[END]
she,was,too,busy,greeting,thomas,and,patrick,and,timothy,and,persuading,cat,to,give,up,the,big,spoon,she,was,trying,to,eat,[END]
it,was,only,after,the,men,had,gone,back,to,their,work,that,kathleen,told,her,how,much,things,had,changed,while,she,was,away,[END]
it's,sorry,i,am,to,say,it,scarlett,but,seamus,took,it,hard,that,you,didn't,stay,for,his,wedding,[END]
i,wish,i,could,have,but,i,couldn't,[END]
he,must,have,known,that,[END]
i,had,business,in,america,[END]
i've,a,feeling,it's,more,pegeen,who,bears,the,bad,will,[END]
did,you,not,remark,that,she,wasn't,in,the,visitors,this,morning,[END]
the,truth,was,scarlett,admitted,that,she,hadn't,noticed,at,all,[END]
she'd,only,met,pegeen,once,she,didn't,really,know,her,[END]
what,was,she,like,[END]
kathleen,chose,her,words,carefully,[END]
pegeen,was,a,dutiful,woman,she,said,who,kept,a,clean,house,and,set,a,good,table,and,saw,to,every,comfort,for,seamus,and,sean,in,the,small,cottage,[END]
it,would,be,a,kindness,to,the,whole,family,if,scarlett,would,go,to,call,on,her,and,admire,the,home,she,was,making,[END]
she,was,that,tender,of,her,dignity,that,she,was,waiting,to,be,visited,before,she'd,do,any,visiting,herself,[END]
my,grief,scarlett,said,how,silly,[END]
i'll,have,to,wake,cat,up,from,her,nap,[END]
leave,her,i'll,keep,watch,while,i,do,the,mending,[END]
it's,better,i,don't,go,with,you,[END]
so,kathleen,didn't,much,like,her,cousin's,new,wife,thought,scarlett,that,was,interesting,[END]
and,pegeen,was,keeping,house,separately,instead,of,going,in,with,kathleen,in,the,larger,cottage,at,least,for,dinner,[END]
tender,of,her,dignity,indeed,[END]
what,a,waste,of,energy,to,fix,two,meals,instead,of,one,[END]
she,had,an,idea,she,wasn't,likely,to,take,to,pegeen,but,she,made,up,her,mind,to,be,nice,[END]
it,couldn't,be,easy,coming,into,a,family,that,had,so,many,shared,years,and,she,knew,all,too,well,what,it,felt,like,to,be,the,outsider,[END]
pegeen,made,it,hard,for,scarlett,to,stay,sympathetic,[END]
seamus',wife,had,a,prickly,disposition,[END]
and,she,looks,like,she's,been,drinking,vinegar,scarlett,thought,[END]
pegeen,poured,out,tea,that,had,been,stewed,so,long,it,was,almost,undrinkable,[END]
wants,me,to,know,i,kept,her,waiting,i,reckon,[END]
i,wish,i'd,been,here,for,the,wedding,said,scarlett,bravely,[END]
might,as,well,take,the,bull,by,the,horns,[END]
i've,brought,best,wishes,from,all,the,o'haras,in,america,to,add,to,mine,[END]
i,hope,you,and,seamus,will,be,very,happy,[END]
she,was,pleased,with,herself,[END]
gracefully,said,she,thought,[END]
pegeen,nodded,stiffly,[END]
i'll,tell,seamus,about,your,kindness,she,said,[END]
he's,wanting,to,have,a,word,with,you,[END]
i,told,him,to,stay,nearby,[END]
i'll,call,him,now,[END]
well,[END]
scarlett,said,to,herself,i've,felt,more,welcome,in,my,life,[END]
she,wasn't,sure,at,all,that,she,wanted,seamus,to,have,a,word,with,her,[END]
she'd,hardly,exchanged,ten,words,with,daniel's,oldest,son,in,all,the,time,she'd,been,in,ireland,[END]
after,she,heard,seamus',word,scarlett,was,quite,sure,she,wished,she,hadn't,[END]
he,expected,her,to,pay,the,rent,that,was,coming,due,on,the,farm,and,he,believed,it,was,only,just,that,he,and,pegeen,have,the,bigger,cottage,because,he,was,now,in,daniel's,place,as,owner,[END]
mary,margaret's,proper,willing,to,do,the,cooking,and,washing,for,my,brothers,as,well,as,me,[END]
kathleen,can,do,for,sean,over,here,seeing,she's,his,sister,[END]
i'll,be,glad,to,pay,the,rent,said,scarlett,[END]
but,she'd,have,liked,to,be,asked,not,told,[END]
but,i,don't,see,why,you're,talking,to,me,about,who,lives,where,[END]
you,and,pegeen,i,mean,mary,margaret,should,discuss,that,with,your,brothers,and,kathleen,[END]
you're,the,o'hara,pegeen,nearly,shouted,you've,got,the,say,[END]
she's,got,the,truth,of,it,scarlett,said,kathleen,when,scarlett,complained,to,her,[END]
you,are,the,o'hara,[END]
before,scarlett,could,say,anything,kathleen,smiled,and,told,her,it,made,no,difference,anyhow,[END]
she,was,going,to,be,leaving,daniel's,cottage,soon,she,was,going,to,marry,a,boy,from,dunsany,[END]
he'd,asked,her,only,the,saturday,before,market,day,in,trim,[END]
i,haven't,told,the,others,yet,i,wanted,to,wait,for,you,[END]
scarlett,hugged,kathleen,[END]
how,exciting,[END]
you'll,let,me,give,the,wedding,won't,you,[END]
we'll,have,a,wonderful,party,[END]
so,i,got,off,the,hook,she,told,mrs,fitz,that,night,[END]
but,only,by,the,skin,of,my,teeth,[END]
i'm,not,so,sure,being,the,o'hara,is,exactly,what,i,thought,it,would,be,[END]
and,what,was,that,exactly,mrs,[END]
o,[END]
i,don't,know,[END]
more,fun,i,guess,[END]
in,august,the,potatoes,were,harvested,[END]
it,was,the,best,crop,they'd,ever,had,the,farmers,said,[END]
then,they,began,to,reap,the,wheat,[END]
scarlett,loved,to,watch,them,[END]
the,shiny,sickles,flashed,in,the,sun,and,the,golden,stalks,fell,like,rippling,silk,[END]
sometimes,she,took,the,place,of,the,man,who,followed,the,reaper,[END]
she'd,borrow,the,staff,with,a,curved,end,that,the,farmers,called,the,loghter-hook,and,draw,up,the,fallen,wheat,into,small,sheaves,[END]
she,couldn't,master,the,quick,twisting,movement,the,man,made,to,tie,each,sheaf,with,a,stalk,of,wheat,but,she,became,very,handy,with,the,loghter-hook,[END]
it,sure,beats,picking,cotton,she,told,colum,[END]
yet,there,were,still,moments,when,sharp,pangs,of,homesickness,caught,her,off,guard,[END]
he,understood,her,feelings,he,said,and,scarlett,was,sure,he,did,[END]
he,truly,was,the,brother,she'd,always,wanted,[END]
colum,seemed,preoccupied,but,he,said,it,was,nothing,more,than,his,impatience,that,the,wheat,took,precedence,over,finishing,the,work,on,the,inn,that,brendon,kennedy,was,making,in,the,building,next,to,his,bar,[END]
scarlett,remembered,the,desperate,man,in,the,church,the,man,colum,had,said,was,on,the,run,[END]
she,wondered,if,there,were,more,of,them,what,colum,did,for,them,[END]
but,she'd,really,rather,not,know,and,she,didn't,ask,[END]
she,preferred,to,think,about,happy,things,like,kathleen's,wedding,[END]
kevin,o'connor,wasn't,the,man,scarlett,would,have,picked,for,her,but,he,was,clearly,head,over,heels,in,love,and,he,had,a,good,farm,with,twenty,cows,at,grass,so,he,was,considered,a,very,good,catch,[END]
kathleen,had,a,substantial,dowry,in,cash,saved,up,from,selling,butter,and,eggs,and,in,her,owning,all,the,kitchen,implements,of,daniel's,house,[END]
she,sensibly,accepted,a,gift,of,a,hundred,pounds,from,scarlett,[END]
it,wasn't,necessary,to,add,it,to,her,dowry,she,said,with,a,conspiratorial,wink,[END]
the,great,disappointment,for,scarlett,was,that,she,couldn't,hold,the,wedding,party,at,the,big,house,[END]
tradition,demanded,that,the,wedding,take,place,in,the,house,the,couple,would,live,in,[END]
the,best,scarlett,could,do,was,contribute,several,geese,and,a,half,dozen,barrels,of,porter,to,the,wedding,feast,[END]
even,that,was,going,over,the,edge,a,bit,colum,warned,her,[END]
the,groom's,family,were,the,hosts,[END]
well,if,i'm,going,to,go,over,the,edge,i,might,as,well,go,way,over,scarlett,told,him,[END]
she,warned,kathleen,too,in,case,she,wanted,to,object,[END]
i'm,coming,out,of,mourning,[END]
i'm,sick,to,death,of,wearing,black,[END]
she,danced,every,reel,at,the,wedding,party,wearing,bright,blue,and,red,petticoats,under,a,dark,green,skirt,and,stockings,striped,in,yellow,and,green,[END]
then,she,cried,all,the,way,home,to,ballyhara,[END]
i'm,going,to,miss,her,so,much,colum,[END]
i'll,miss,the,cottage,too,and,all,the,visitors,[END]
i'll,never,go,there,again,not,with,nasty,pegeen,handing,out,her,nasty,old,tea,[END]
twelve,miles,isn't,the,end,of,the,earth,scarlett,darling,[END]
get,yourself,a,good,riding,horse,instead,of,driving,your,buggy,and,you'll,be,in,dunsany,in,no,time,at,all,[END]
scarlett,could,see,the,sense,to,that,although,twelve,miles,was,still,a,long,way,[END]
what,she,refused,to,consider,at,all,was,colum's,quiet,suggestion,that,she,start,thinking,about,marrying,again,[END]
she,woke,up,in,the,night,sometimes,and,the,darkness,in,her,room,was,like,the,dark,mystery,of,rhett's,eyes,meeting,hers,when,her,ship,was,leaving,charleston,[END]
what,had,he,been,feeling,[END]
alone,in,the,silence,of,the,night,alone,in,the,vastness,of,the,ornate,bed,alone,in,the,black,blankness,of,the,unlit,room,scarlett,wondered,and,dreamed,of,impossible,things,and,sometimes,wept,from,the,ache,of,wanting,him,[END]
cat,said,cat,clearly,when,she,saw,her,reflection,in,the,mirror,[END]
oh,thank,god,scarlett,cried,aloud,[END]
she'd,been,afraid,her,baby,was,never,going,to,talk,[END]
cat,had,rarely,gurgled,and,cooed,like,other,babies,and,she,looked,at,people,who,talked,baby,talk,to,her,with,an,expression,of,profound,astonishment,[END]
she,walked,at,ten,months,which,was,early,scarlett,knew,but,a,month,later,she,was,still,practically,mute,except,for,her,laughter,[END]
say,ma-ma,',scarlett,begged,[END]
to,no,avail,[END]
say,ma-ma,',she,tried,again,after,cat,spoke,but,the,little,girl,wriggled,out,of,her,grasp,and,plunged,recklessly,across,the,floor,[END]
her,walking,was,more,enthusiastic,than,skillful,[END]
conceited,little,monster,scarlett,called,after,her,[END]
all,babies,say,ma-ma',for,their,first,word,not,their,own,name,[END]
cat,staggered,to,a,halt,[END]
she,looked,back,at,scarlett,with,a,smile,that,scarlett,said,later,was,positively,diabolical,[END]
mama,she,said,casually,[END]
then,she,lurched,off,again,[END]
she,probably,could,have,said,it,all,along,if,she'd,wanted,to,scarlett,bragged,to,father,flynn,[END]
she,tossed,it,to,me,like,a,bone,to,a,dog,[END]
the,old,priest,smiled,tolerantly,[END]
he,had,listened,to,many,proud,mothers,in,his,long,years,[END]
it's,a,grand,day,he,offered,pleasantly,[END]
a,grand,day,in,every,way,father,[END]
exclaimed,tommy,doyle,the,youngest,of,ballyhara's,farmers,[END]
it's,sure,that,we've,made,the,harvest,of,harvests,[END]
he,refilled,his,glass,and,father,flynn's,[END]
a,man,was,entitled,to,relax,and,enjoy,himself,at,the,harvest,home,celebration,[END]
scarlett,allowed,him,to,give,her,a,glass,of,porter,too,[END]
the,toasts,would,be,starting,soon,and,it,would,be,bad,luck,if,she,didn't,share,them,with,at,least,a,sip,[END]
after,the,good,luck,that,had,blessed,ballyhara,all,year,she,wasn't,about,to,risk,inviting,any,bad,[END]
she,looked,at,the,long,laden,tables,set,up,the,length,of,ballyhara's,wide,street,[END]
each,was,decorated,with,a,ribbon-tied,sheaf,wheat,[END]
each,was,surrounded,by,smiling,people,enjoying,themselves,[END]
this,was,the,best,part,of,being,the,o'hara,[END]
they,had,all,worked,each,in,his,or,her,own,way,and,now,they,were,all,together,the,whole,population,of,the,town,to,celebrate,the,results,of,that,work,[END]
there,was,food,and,drink,sweets,and,a,small,carousel,for,children,a,wooden,platform,for,dancing,later,in,front,of,the,unfinished,inn,[END]
the,air,was,golden,with,afternoon,light,the,wheat,golden,on,the,table,a,golden,feeling,of,happiness,bathed,in,shared,repletion,[END]
it,was,exactly,what,harvest,home,was,meant,to,be,[END]
the,sound,of,horses,coming,made,mothers,look,for,their,younger,children,[END]
scarlett's,heart,stopped,for,a,moment,when,she,couldn't,find,cat,[END]
then,she,saw,her,sitting,on,colum's,knee,at,the,end,of,the,table,[END]
he,was,talking,to,the,man,beside,him,[END]
cat,was,nodding,as,if,she,understood,every,word,[END]
scarlett,grinned,[END]
what,a,funny,little,girl,her,daughter,was,[END]
a,group,of,militia,rode,into,the,end,of,the,street,[END]
three,men,three,officers,their,polished,brass,buttons,more,golden,than,the,wheat,[END]
they,slowed,their,horses,to,a,walk,and,the,noise,around,the,tables,died,away,[END]
some,of,the,men,rose,to,their,feet,[END]
at,least,the,soldiers,have,the,decency,not,to,gallop,past,stirring,up,dust,said,scarlett,to,father,flynn,[END]
but,when,the,men,reined,in,before,the,deserted,church,she,fell,silent,too,[END]
which,way,to,the,big,house,[END]
said,one,of,the,officers,[END]
i'm,here,to,talk,to,the,owner,[END]
scarlett,stood,up,[END]
i,am,the,owner,she,said,[END]
she,was,amazed,that,her,suddenly,dry,mouth,could,make,any,sound,at,all,[END]
the,officer,looked,at,her,tumbled,hair,and,bright,peasant,clothes,[END]
his,lips,curled,in,a,sneer,[END]
very,amusing,girl,but,we're,not,here,to,play,games,[END]
scarlett,felt,an,emotion,that,had,become,almost,a,stranger,to,her,a,wild,elated,anger,[END]
she,stepped,up,onto,the,bench,she'd,been,sitting,on,and,put,her,hands,on,her,hips,[END]
she,looked,insolent,and,she,knew,it,[END]
no,one,invited,you,here,soldier,to,play,games,or,anything,else,[END]
now,what,do,you,want,[END]
i,am,mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
a,second,officer,walked,his,horse,forward,a,few,steps,[END]
he,dismounted,and,came,on,foot,to,stand,in,front,of,and,below,scarlett's,position,on,the,bench,[END]
we're,to,deliver,this,mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
he,removed,his,hat,and,one,of,his,white,gauntlets,and,handed,a,scrolled,paper,up,to,scarlett,[END]
the,garrison,is,going,to,second,a,detachment,to,ballyhara,for,its,protection,[END]
scarlett,could,feel,tension,like,a,storm,in,the,warm,end-of-summer,atmosphere,[END]
she,unrolled,the,paper,and,read,it,slowly,twice,[END]
she,could,feel,the,knots,in,her,shoulders,relax,when,the,full,meaning,of,the,document,was,clear,to,her,[END]
she,lifted,her,head,and,smiled,so,everyone,could,see,her,[END]
then,she,turned,the,full,force,of,her,smile,on,the,officer,looking,up,at,her,[END]
that's,mighty,sweet,of,the,colonel,she,said,but,i'm,really,not,interested,and,he,can't,send,any,soldiers,to,my,town,without,my,agreement,[END]
will,you,tell,him,for,me,[END]
i,don't,have,any,unrest,here,in,ballyhara,at,all,[END]
we,get,along,real,fine,[END]
she,held,the,vellum,sheet,down,to,the,officer,[END]
youall,look,a,mite,parched,would,you,like,a,glass,of,ale,[END]
the,admiring,expression,on,her,face,had,enchanted,men,just,like,this,officer,from,the,day,she,turned,fifteen,[END]
he,blushed,and,stammered,exactly,like,dozens,of,young,men,she'd,beguiled,in,clayton,county,georgia,[END]
thank,you,mrs,o'hara,but,uh,regulations,-that,is,personally,i'd,like,nothing,better,but,the,colonel,wouldn't,um,he'd,think,[END]
i,understand,said,scarlett,kindly,[END]
maybe,some,other,time,[END]
the,first,toast,of,harvest,home,was,to,the,o'hara,[END]
it,would,have,been,the,first,toast,anyway,but,now,the,salute,was,a,loud,roar,[END]
72,[END]
winter,made,scarlett,restless,[END]
except,for,riding,there,was,nothing,active,to,do,and,she,needed,to,be,busy,[END]
the,new,fields,were,cleared,and,manured,by,the,middle,of,november,and,then,what,did,she,have,to,think,about,[END]
there,weren't,even,many,complaints,or,disputes,brought,to,her,office,on,first,sundays,[END]
true,cat,could,walk,across,the,room,herself,to,light,the,christmas,candle,and,there,were,the,new,year's,day,ceremonies,of,harm,brack,against,the,wall,and,being,the,dark-haired,visitor,in,town,but,even,so,the,short,days,seemed,too,long,to,her,[END]
she,was,warmly,welcomed,in,kennedy's,bar,now,that,she,was,known,to,be,supporting,the,fenians,but,she,quickly,tired,of,the,songs,about,the,blessed,martyrs,to,irish,freedom,and,the,loud-voiced,threats,to,run,the,english,out,[END]
she,went,down,to,the,bar,only,when,she,was,starved,for,company,[END]
she,was,overjoyed,when,saint,brigid's,day,arrived,on,february,1,and,the,growing,year,had,begun,again,[END]
she,turned,the,first,sod,with,such,enthusiasm,that,soil,flew,out,in,a,wide,circle,around,her,[END]
this,year,will,be,even,better,than,last,she,predicted,rashly,[END]
but,the,new,fields,put,an,impossible,burden,on,the,farmers,[END]
there,was,never,enough,time,to,do,everything,that,needed,doing,[END]
scarlett,nagged,at,colum,to,move,some,more,laborers,into,the,town,[END]
there,were,still,plenty,of,vacant,cottages,[END]
he,wouldn't,agree,to,let,strangers,in,[END]
scarlett,backed,down,[END]
she,understood,the,need,for,secrecy,about,the,fenians,[END]
finally,colum,found,a,compromise,[END]
she,could,hire,men,just,for,the,summer,[END]
he'd,take,her,to,the,hiring,fair,at,drogheda,[END]
the,horse,fair,would,be,on,too,and,she,could,buy,the,horses,she,thought,she,needed,[END]
thought,',my,foot,colum,o'hara,[END]
i,must,have,been,blind,and,half-witted,too,when,i,paid,good,money,for,the,plow,horses,we've,got,[END]
they,don't,go,any,faster,than,a,box,turtle,on,a,rocky,road,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,be,cheated,again,that,way,[END]
colum,smiled,to,himself,[END]
scarlett,was,an,astonishing,woman,amazingly,competent,at,many,things,[END]
but,she,was,never,going,to,best,an,irish,horse,trader,he,was,sure,of,that,[END]
scarlett,darling,you,look,like,a,village,lass,not,landed,gentry,[END]
no,one,will,believe,you,can,pay,for,a,merry-go-round,ride,let,alone,a,horse,[END]
her,frown,was,meant,to,intimidate,[END]
she,didn't,understand,that,she,really,did,look,like,a,girl,dressed,up,for,a,fair,[END]
her,green,shirt,made,her,eyes,even,greener,and,her,blue,skirt,was,the,color,of,the,spring,sky,[END]

some,of,the,lads,go,to,school,scarlett,darling,[END]

a,fat,lot,of,good,that'll,do,them,ruining,their,eyes,on,books,when,they,could,be,out,in,the,air,earning,a,good,wage,besides,[END]
she,was,cranky,with,impatience,[END]
the,miles,rolled,by,and,the,hedgerows,were,sweet,with,blackthorn,blossoms,[END]
once,they,were,really,on,their,way,scarlett,began,to,enjoy,herself,[END]

it's,a,very,big,fair,this,much,bigger,than,any,you've,seen,[END]
he,knew,that,scarlett,didn't,mean,the,city,when,she,asked,about,drogheda,[END]
she,liked,the,excitement,of,fairs,[END]
the,intriguing,possibilities,in,a,crooked,old,city,street,were,incomprehensible,to,her,[END]
scarlett,liked,things,to,be,obvious,and,easily,understood,[END]
it,was,a,trait,that,often,made,him,uneasy,[END]
he,knew,she,had,no,real,understanding,of,what,danger,she,courted,with,her,involvement,in,the,fenian,brotherhood,and,ignorance,could,lead,to,disaster,[END]
but,today,he,was,on,her,business,not,his,[END]

too,big,i,fear,[END]

i'll,tell,you,what,you,pick,out,the,boys,and,i'll,go,straight,for,the,horses,[END]
you,come,to,me,when,you,finish,[END]
you're,sure,the,boys,will,go,to,ballyhara,on,their,own,[END]
they're,here,for,hiring,and,they're,used,to,walking,[END]
some,of,them,likely,walked,a,hundred,miles,to,be,here,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
better,look,at,their,feet,then,before,you,sign,anything,[END]
i'll,be,looking,at,teeth,[END]
which,way,do,i,go,[END]
back,in,that,corner,where,the,banners,are,[END]
you'll,see,some,of,the,best,horses,in,ireland,at,drogheda,fair,[END]

there,were,big,canvas,tents,that,served,as,temporary,stables,for,the,horses,[END]
ha,[END]
thought,scarlett,nobody's,going,to,sell,me,an,animal,in,bad,light,[END]
she,pushed,into,the,noisy,crowd,that,was,milling,around,inside,the,tent,[END]
my,grief,i've,never,seen,so,many,horses,in,one,place,in,my,life,[END]
how,smart,of,colum,to,bring,me,here,[END]
i'll,have,all,the,choice,i,need,[END]
she,elbowed,her,way,from,one,place,to,another,looked,over,one,horse,after,another,[END]
not,yet,she,said,to,the,traders,[END]
she,didn't,like,the,system,in,ireland,at,all,[END]
you,couldn't,just,walk,up,to,the,owner,and,ask,him,what,he,wanted,for,his,animal,[END]
no,that,was,too,easy,[END]
the,minute,there,was,any,interest,one,of,the,traders,jumped,in,to,name,a,price,that,was,way,out,of,line,one,end,or,another,and,then,badger,buyer,and,seller,into,an,agreement,in,the,end,[END]
she'd,learned,the,hard,way,about,some,of,their,tricks,[END]
they'd,grab,your,hand,and,slap,down,on,it,so,sharp,it,hurt,and,that,meant,you,might,have,bought,yourself,a,horse,if,you,weren't,careful,[END]
she,liked,the,looks,of,a,pair,of,roans,that,the,dealer,shouted,were,perfectly,matched,three-year-olds,and,only,seventy,pounds,the,pair,[END]
scarlett,put,her,hands,behind,her,back,[END]
walk,them,out,in,the,light,where,i,can,see,them,she,said,[END]
owner,and,dealer,and,people,nearby,all,protested,furiously,[END]
takes,all,the,sport,out,said,a,small,man,in,riding,breeches,and,a,sweater,[END]
scarlett,insisted,but,very,sweetly,[END]
catch,more,flies,with,honey,she,reminded,herself,[END]
she,looked,at,the,horses',gleaming,coats,rubbed,her,hand,over,them,and,looked,at,the,pomade,on,her,palm,[END]
then,she,caught,expert,hold,of,one,horse's,head,and,examined,his,teeth,[END]
she,burst,out,laughing,[END]
three-year-old,my,maiden,aunt,[END]
take,'em,in,she,said,with,a,wink,at,the,dealer,[END]
i've,got,a,grandfather,younger,than,them,[END]
she,was,enjoying,herself,very,much,[END]
after,an,hour,though,she'd,only,found,three,horses,that,she,liked,both,as,animal,and,as,a,good,buy,[END]
every,single,time,she,had,to,coax,and,charm,the,owner,into,letting,her,examine,the,horse,in,the,light,[END]
she,looked,enviously,at,the,people,buying,hunters,[END]
there,were,jumps,set,up,in,the,open,and,they,could,get,a,good,look,at,what,they,were,buying,doing,what,they,were,buying,it,to,do,[END]
they,were,such,beautiful,horses,too,[END]
for,a,plow,horse,looks,weren't,important,[END]
she,turned,away,from,the,view,of,the,jumping,[END]
she,needed,three,more,plow,horses,[END]
while,her,eyes,accustomed,themselves,to,the,shaded,interior,of,the,tent,scarlett,leaned,against,one,of,the,thick,tent,supports,[END]
she,was,starting,to,get,tired,[END]
and,she,was,only,half,done,[END]
where,is,this,pegasus,of,yours,bart,[END]
i,don't,see,anything,flying,over,the,jumps,[END]
scarlett's,hands,reached,for,the,thick,support,[END]
i'm,losing,my,mind,[END]
that,sounded,like,rhett's,voice,[END]
if,you,brought,me,on,a,wild,goose,chase,[END]
it,is,[END]
it,is,[END]
i,can't,be,mistaken,[END]
no,one,else,in,the,world,sounds,like,rhett,[END]
she,turned,quickly,looking,into,the,sunlit,square,blinking,[END]
that's,his,back,[END]
isn't,it,[END]
it,is,i'm,sure,it,is,[END]
if,only,he'd,say,something,else,turn,his,head,[END]
it,can't,be,rhett,[END]
he's,got,no,reason,to,be,in,ireland,[END]
but,i,couldn't,be,wrong,about,that,voice,[END]
he,turned,to,speak,to,the,slightly,built,fair-haired,man,beside,him,[END]
it,was,rhett,[END]
her,knuckles,were,white,against,her,hands,so,tightly,was,she,holding,on,to,the,post,[END]
she,was,trembling,[END]
the,other,man,said,something,pointed,with,his,crop,and,rhett,nodded,[END]
then,the,fair-haired,man,walked,away,out,of,her,sight,and,rhett,was,there,alone,[END]
scarlett,stood,in,the,shadow,looking,out,to,the,light,[END]
don't,move,she,ordered,herself,when,he,started,to,walk,away,[END]
but,she,couldn't,obey,[END]
she,burst,from,the,shadows,and,ran,after,him,[END]
rhett,[END]
he,stopped,awkwardly,rhett,who,was,never,clumsy,and,he,spun,around,[END]
an,expression,she,couldn't,recognize,flickered,on,his,face,and,his,dark,eyes,seemed,very,bright,beneath,the,shading,bill,of,his,cap,[END]
then,he,smiled,the,mocking,smile,she,knew,so,well,[END]
you,do,turn,up,in,the,most,unexpected,places,scarlett,he,said,[END]
he's,laughing,at,me,and,i,don't,care,[END]
i,don't,care,about,anything,as,long,as,he'll,say,my,name,and,stand,near,me,[END]
she,could,hear,her,own,heart,beating,[END]
hello,rhett,she,said,how,are,you,[END]
she,knew,it,was,a,foolish,inadequate,thing,to,say,but,she,had,to,say,something,[END]
rhett's,mouth,twitched,[END]
i'm,remarkably,well,for,a,dead,man,he,drawled,or,was,i,mistaken,[END]
i,thought,i,glimpsed,a,widow,at,the,dock,in,charleston,[END]
well,yes,[END]
i,had,to,say,something,[END]
i,wasn't,married,i,mean,i,didn't,have,a,husband,[END]
don't,try,to,explain,scarlett,[END]
it's,not,your,forte,[END]
forty,[END]
what,are,you,talking,about,[END]

please,don't,be,mean,rhett,[END]
it's,not,important,[END]
what,brings,you,to,ireland,[END]
i,thought,you,were,in,england,[END]
what,made,you,think,that,[END]
why,are,we,standing,here,making,conversation,about,nothing,at,all,[END]
why,can't,i,think,[END]
why,am,i,saying,these,stupid,things,[END]
you,didn't,get,off,the,ship,in,boston,[END]
scarlett's,heart,leapt,to,the,meaning,of,what,he'd,said,[END]
he'd,taken,the,trouble,to,find,out,where,she,was,going,he,cared,about,her,he,wanted,to,keep,her,from,disappearing,[END]
happiness,flooded,her,heart,[END]
may,i,assume,from,your,cheerful,attire,that,you're,no,longer,mourning,my,death,[END]
said,rhett,[END]
shame,on,you,scarlett,i'm,not,yet,cold,in,my,grave,[END]
she,looked,down,in,horror,at,her,peasant,clothes,then,up,at,his,impeccably,tailored,hacking,jacket,and,perfectly,tied,white,stock,[END]
why,did,he,always,have,to,make,her,feel,like,a,fool,[END]
why,couldn't,she,at,least,feel,angry,[END]
because,she,loved,him,[END]
whether,he,believed,it,or,didn't,it,was,the,truth,[END]
without,planning,or,thought,of,consequences,scarlett,looked,at,the,man,who,had,been,her,husband,for,so,many,years,of,lies,[END]
i,love,you,rhett,she,said,with,simple,dignity,[END]
how,unfortunate,for,you,scarlett,[END]
you,always,seem,to,be,in,love,with,another,woman's,husband,[END]
he,lifted,his,cap,politely,[END]
i,have,another,commitment,please,excuse,me,if,i,leave,you,now,[END]
goodbye,[END]
he,turned,his,back,on,her,and,walked,away,[END]
scarlett,looked,after,him,[END]
she,felt,as,if,he,had,slapped,her,face,[END]
for,no,reason,[END]
she'd,made,no,demands,on,him,she'd,made,a,gift,of,the,greatest,thing,she'd,learned,to,give,[END]
and,he'd,trampled,it,into,the,muck,[END]
he'd,made,a,fool,of,her,[END]
no,she'd,made,a,fool,of,herself,[END]
scarlett,stood,there,a,brightly,colored,small,isolated,figure,amid,the,noise,and,movement,of,the,horse,fair,for,a,measureless,time,[END]
then,the,world,came,back,into,focus,and,she,saw,rhett,and,his,friend,near,another,tent,in,a,circle,of,intent,spectators,[END]
a,different,tweed-clad,man,was,holding,a,restless,bay,by,the,bridle,and,a,redfaced,man,wearing,a,plaid,vest,was,swooping,his,right,arm,down,in,the,familiar,motions,of,the,horse,trade,[END]
scarlett,imagined,she,could,hear,the,slapping,palms,as,he,exhorted,rhett's,friend,and,the,horse's,owner,to,come,to,a,deal,[END]
her,feet,moved,by,themselves,marching,across,the,space,separating,her,from,them,[END]
there,must,have,been,people,in,her,way,but,she,was,unconscious,of,them,and,somehow,they,melted,away,[END]
the,dealer's,voice,was,like,some,ritual,chant,cadenced,and,hypnotic,[END]
a,hundred,and,twenty,sir,you,know,that's,a,handsome,price,even,for,a,beast,as,grand,as,this,one,[END]
and,you,sir,you,can,go,twenty-five,isn't,that,the,fact,of,it,to,add,a,noble,animal,like,this,to,your,stables,[END]
one-forty,[END]

one-forty,it,is,now,see,the,generous,nature,of,the,man,you'll,prove,you,can,match,him,won't,you,now,[END]
say,one-thirty,instead,of,one,twenty-five,and,there's,only,a,breath,between,you,no,more,than,can,be,for,the,cost,of,a,pint,or,two,[END]
scarlett,stepped,into,the,triangle,of,seller,buyer,and,dealer,[END]
her,face,was,shockingly,white,above,her,green,shirt,her,eyes,greener,than,emeralds,[END]
one-forty,she,said,clearly,[END]
the,dealer,stared,confused,his,rhythm,broken,[END]
scarlett,spit,into,her,right,hand,and,slapped,it,loudly,against,his,[END]
then,she,spit,again,looking,at,the,seller,[END]
he,lifted,his,hand,and,spat,into,the,palm,then,slapped,once,twice,against,hers,in,the,age-old,seal,of,deal,made,[END]
the,dealer,could,only,spit,and,seal,in,acquiescence,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,rhett's,friend,[END]
i,hope,you're,not,too,disappointed,she,said,in,a,honeyed,tone,[END]
why,of,course,not,that,is,to,say,[END]
rhett,broke,in,[END]
bart,i'd,like,you,to,meet,[END]

scarlett,smiled,[END]
she'd,been,in,that,part,of,the,county,not,so,long,ago,at,kathleen's,wedding,[END]
no,wonder,the,name,john,morland,was,familiar,[END]
she'd,heard,all,about,sir,john,morland,from,kathleen's,husband,[END]
he's,a,grand,man,for,all,that,he's,a,landlord,said,kevin,o'connor,a,dozen,times,[END]

there,was,amusement,in,his,eyes,and,something,else,that,she,couldn't,define,[END]
great,balls,of,fire,you'd,think,he'd,never,met,me,before,or,something,[END]
mr,butler,a,pleasure,to,see,you,she,said,graciously,[END]
she,dangled,her,dirty,hand,elegantly,in,front,of,him,[END]
rhett,removed,his,glove,to,take,it,[END]
mrs,o'hara,he,said,with,a,bow,[END]
scarlett,nodded,to,the,staring,dealer,and,the,grinning,former,owner,of,her,horse,[END]
my,groom,will,be,here,shortly,to,make,the,necessary,arrangements,she,said,airily,and,she,hiked,up,her,skirts,to,take,a,bundle,of,banknotes,from,the,garter,above,her,red-andgreen,striped,knee,[END]
guineas,is,that,right,[END]
she,counted,the,money,into,the,seller's,hand,[END]
her,skirts,swirled,when,she,turned,and,walked,away,[END]
what,a,remarkable,woman,said,john,morland,[END]
rhett,smiled,with,his,lips,[END]
astonishing,he,said,in,agreement,[END]

scarlett,looked,down,at,him,from,her,perch,on,the,rail,of,the,jumping,ring,[END]
she,began,to,laugh,[END]
i,think,i,bought,an,elephant,[END]
you've,never,seen,such,a,big,horse,in,your,life,[END]
i,had,to,but,i,don't,know,why,[END]
colum,put,a,steadying,hand,on,her,arm,[END]
her,laughter,was,ragged,and,her,eyes,were,bright,with,pain,[END]
73,[END]
cat,will,go,out,said,the,little,voice,[END]
no,sweetheart,not,today,[END]
soon,but,not,today,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,terrifying,vulnerability,[END]
how,could,she,have,been,so,reckless,[END]
how,could,she,have,ignored,the,danger,to,cat,[END]
dunsany,was,not,that,far,away,not,nearly,far,enough,to,be,sure,that,people,wouldn't,know,about,the,o'hara,and,her,dark-skinned,child,[END]
she,kept,cat,with,her,day,and,night,upstairs,in,their,two,rooms,while,she,looked,worriedly,out,the,window,above,the,drive,[END]
mrs,fitz,was,her,go-between,for,the,things,that,had,to,be,done,and,done,faster,than,fast,[END]
the,dressmaker,raced,back,and,forth,for,fittings,of,scarlett's,riding,habit,the,cobbler,worked,like,a,leprechaun,far,into,the,night,on,her,boots,the,stableman,labored,with,rags,and,oil,over,the,cracked,and,dry,sidesaddle,that,had,been,left,in,the,tack,room,thirty,years,before,scarlett,arrived,and,one,of,the,boys,from,the,hiring,fair,who,had,quiet,hands,and,an,easy,seat,exercised,the,powerful,big,bay,hunter,[END]
when,saturday,dawned,scarlett,was,as,ready,as,she'd,ever,be,[END]
her,horse,was,a,bay,gelding,named,half,moon,[END]
he,was,as,she'd,told,colum,very,big,nearly,seventeen,hands,with,a,deep,chest,and,long,back,and,powerfully,muscled,thighs,[END]
he,was,a,horse,for,a,big,man,scarlett,looked,tiny,and,fragile,and,very,feminine,on,him,[END]
she,was,afraid,she,looked,ridiculous,[END]
and,she,was,quite,certain,that,she'd,make,a,fool,of,herself,[END]
she,didn't,know,half,moon's,temperament,or,peculiarities,and,there,was,no,chance,to,get,to,know,them,because,she,was,riding,sidesaddle,as,all,ladies,did,[END]
when,she,was,a,girl,scarlett,had,loved,riding,sidesaddle,[END]
it,produced,a,graceful,fall,of,skirts,that,emphasized,her,tiny,waist,[END]
also,in,those,days,she,seldom,went,faster,than,a,walk,the,better,to,flirt,with,men,riding,alongside,[END]
but,now,the,sidesaddle,was,a,serious,handicap,[END]
she,couldn't,communicate,with,the,horse,through,pressure,of,her,knees,because,one,knee,was,hooked,around,the,sidesaddle's,pommel,the,other,one,rigid,because,only,by,pressing,on,the,one,stirrup,could,a,lady,counterbalance,her,unbalanced,position,[END]
i'll,probably,fall,off,before,i,even,get,to,dunsany,she,thought,with,despair,and,i'll,certainly,break,my,neck,if,i,get,as,far,as,the,first,fence,[END]
she,knew,from,her,father,that,jumping,fences,and,ditches,and,hedges,and,stiles,and,walls,was,the,thrilling,part,of,hunting,[END]
colum,had,made,things,no,better,when,he,told,her,that,ladies,frequently,avoided,active,hunting,altogether,[END]
the,breakfast,was,the,social,part,and,riding,clothes,were,very,becoming,[END]
serious,accidents,were,much,more,likely,when,riding,sidesaddle,and,no,one,blamed,the,ladies,for,being,sensible,[END]
rhett,would,be,glad,to,see,her,cowardly,and,weak,she,was,convinced,[END]
and,she'd,much,prefer,to,break,her,neck,than,to,give,him,that,satisfaction,[END]
scarlett,touched,her,crop,to,half,moon's,neck,[END]
let's,try,a,trot,and,see,if,i,can,balance,on,this,stupid,saddle,she,sighed,aloud,[END]
colum,had,described,a,fox,hunt,to,scarlett,but,she,wasn't,prepared,for,the,first,impact,of,it,[END]
morland,hall,was,an,amalgamation,of,building,over,more,than,two,centuries,with,wings,and,chimneys,and,windows,and,walls,attached,higgledy-piggledy,to,one,another,around,the,stone-walled,courtyard,that,had,been,the,keep,of,the,fortified,castle,erected,by,the,first,morland,baronet,in,1615,the,square,courtyard,was,filled,with,mounted,riders,and,excited,hounds,[END]
scarlett,forgot,her,apprehensions,at,the,sight,[END]
colum,had,omitted,mention,that,the,men,wore,pinks,misnamed,bright,red,jackets,[END]
she,had,never,seen,anything,so,glamorous,in,her,life,[END]
mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
sir,john,morland,rode,over,to,her,his,gleaming,top,hat,in,his,hand,[END]
welcome,[END]
i,didn't,believe,you'd,come,[END]
scarlett'seyes,narrowed,[END]
did,rhett,say,that,[END]
on,the,contrary,[END]
he,said,wild,horses,wouldn't,keep,you,away,[END]
there,was,no,guile,in,morland,[END]
how,do,you,like,half,moon,[END]
the,baronet,stroked,the,big,hunter's,sleek,neck,[END]
what,a,beauty,he,is,[END]
um,[END]
yes,isn't,he,[END]
said,scarlett,[END]
her,eyes,were,moving,quickly,searching,for,rhett,[END]
what,a,lot,of,people,[END]
damn,this,veil,anyhow,everything,looks,blurred,[END]
she,was,wearing,the,most,conservative,riding,clothes,fashion,allowed,[END]
unrelieved,black,wool,with,a,high,neck,and,low,black,top,hat,with,a,face,veil,pulled,tight,and,tied,over,the,netted,thick,knot,of,hair,at,the,nape,of,her,neck,[END]
it,was,worse,than,mourning,she,thought,but,respectable,as,all,get-out,a,real,antidote,to,bright-colored,skirts,and,striped,stockings,[END]
scarlett,was,rebellious,in,only,one,matter,she,would,not,wear,a,corset,under,her,habit,[END]
the,sidesaddle,was,torture,enough,[END]
rhett,was,looking,at,her,[END]
she,looked,away,quickly,when,she,finally,saw,him,[END]
he's,counting,on,me,to,make,a,spectacle,of,myself,[END]
i'll,show,mr,rhett,butler,[END]
i,might,break,every,bone,in,my,body,but,nobody's,going,to,laugh,at,me,especially,not,him,[END]
ride,along,easy,well,back,and,watch,what,the,others,do,colum,had,said,[END]
scarlett,began,as,he,advised,[END]
she,felt,her,palms,sweating,inside,her,gloves,[END]
up,ahead,the,pace,was,picking,up,then,beside,her,a,woman,laughed,and,whipped,her,horse,breaking,into,a,gallop,[END]
scarlett,looked,briefly,at,the,panorama,of,red,and,black,backs,streaming,down,the,slope,in,front,of,her,at,the,horses,jumping,effortlessly,over,the,low,stone,wall,at,the,base,of,the,hill,[END]
this,is,it,she,thought,it's,too,late,now,to,worry,about,it,[END]
she,shifted,her,weight,without,knowing,she,should,and,felt,half,moon,moving,faster,faster,sure-footed,veteran,of,a,hundred,hunts,[END]
the,wall,was,behind,her,and,she,had,hardly,noticed,the,jump,[END]
no,wonder,john,morland,wanted,half,moon,so,much,[END]
scarlett,laughed,aloud,[END]
it,made,no,difference,that,she'd,never,hunted,in,her,life,that,she,hadn't,sat,sidesaddle,for,more,than,fifteen,years,[END]
she,was,all,right,better,than,all,right,[END]
she,was,having,fun,[END]
no,wonder,pa,never,opened,a,gate,[END]
why,bother,when,you,could,go,over,the,fence,[END]
the,specters,of,her,father,and,bonnie,that,had,plagued,her,were,gone,[END]
her,fear,was,gone,[END]
there,was,only,the,excitement,of,the,misty,air,streaking,past,her,skin,and,the,power,of,the,animal,that,she,controlled,[END]
that,and,the,new,determination,to,overtake,and,pass,and,leave,rhett,butler,far,behind,[END]
scarlett,stood,with,the,muddy,train,of,her,habit,looped,over,her,left,arm,and,a,glass,of,champagne,in,her,right,hand,[END]
the,paw,of,the,fox,that,she'd,been,awarded,would,be,mounted,on,a,silver,base,if,she'd,allow,it,said,john,morland,[END]
i'd,love,it,sir,john,[END]
please,call,me,bart,[END]
all,my,friends,do,[END]
please,call,me,scarlett,[END]
everybody,does,whether,they're,friends,or,not,[END]
she,was,giddy,and,pink-cheeked,from,the,exhilaration,of,the,hunt,and,her,success,[END]
i've,never,had,a,better,day,she,told,bart,[END]
it,was,almost,true,[END]
other,riders,had,congratulated,her,she,saw,the,unmistakable,admiration,in,the,men's,eyes,jealousy,in,the,women's,[END]
everywhere,she,looked,there,were,handsome,men,and,beautiful,women,silver,trays,of,champagne,servants,wealth,people,having,a,good,time,a,good,life,[END]
it,was,like,life,before,the,war,only,now,she,was,grown,up,she,could,do,and,say,what,she,liked,and,she,was,scarlett,o'hara,country,girl,from,north,georgia,in,a,baronet's,castle,partying,with,lady,this,and,lord,that,and,even,a,countess,[END]
it,was,like,a,story,in,a,book,and,scarlett's,head,was,turned,[END]
she,could,almost,forget,that,rhett,was,there,almost,erase,the,memory,of,being,insulted,and,despised,[END]
but,only,almost,[END]
and,her,treacherous,mind,kept,remembering,things,she,had,seen,and,heard,as,she,rode,back,to,the,house,after,the,hurt,rhett,acting,like,it,didn't,matter,that,she'd,beaten,him,to,the,kill,[END]
teasing,the,countess,as,if,she,were,just,anybody,at,all,[END]
looking,so,damned,at,ease,and,comfortable,and,not,impressed,[END]
being,so,[END]
so,rhett,[END]
damn,him,anyhow,[END]
congratulations,scarlett,[END]
rhett,was,at,her,side,and,she,hadn't,seen,him,approaching,[END]
scarlett's,arm,jerked,and,champagne,spilled,on,her,skirts,[END]
dammit,rhett,do,you,have,to,sneak,up,on,people,like,that,[END]
i'm,sorry,[END]
rhett,offered,her,a,handkerchief,[END]
and,i'm,sorry,for,my,boorish,behavior,at,the,horse,fair,[END]
my,only,excuse,is,that,i,was,shocked,to,see,you,there,[END]
scarlett,took,the,handkerchief,and,bent,over,to,wipe,at,the,dampness,on,her,skirts,[END]
there,was,no,point,to,it,her,habit,was,already,spattered,with,mud,from,the,wild,cross-country,chase,[END]
but,it,gave,her,a,chance,to,collect,her,thoughts,and,to,hide,her,face,for,a,moment,[END]
i,will,not,show,how,much,i,care,she,vowed,silently,[END]
i,will,not,show,how,much,he,hurt,me,[END]
she,looked,up,and,her,eyes,were,sparkling,her,lips,curved,in,a,smile,[END]
you,were,shocked,she,said,[END]
imagine,what,i,was,[END]
what,on,earth,are,you,doing,in,ireland,[END]
buying,horses,[END]
i'm,determined,to,win,at,the,races,next,year,[END]
john,morland's,stables,have,a,reputation,for,producing,likely,yearlings,[END]
i,go,to,paris,tuesday,to,look,at,some,more,[END]
what,brought,you,to,drogheda,in,local,costume,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
oh,rhett,you,know,how,i,love,to,dress,up,[END]
i,borrowed,those,clothes,from,one,of,the,maids,at,the,house,i'm,visiting,[END]
she,looked,from,side,to,side,searching,for,john,morland,[END]
i've,got,to,make,my,manners,and,get,going,she,said,over,her,shoulder,[END]
my,friends,will,be,furious,if,i'm,not,back,pretty,soon,[END]
she,looked,at,rhett,for,an,instant,then,hurried,off,[END]
she,didn't,dare,stay,[END]
not,close,to,him,like,that,[END]
not,even,in,the,same,room,[END]
the,same,house,[END]
the,rain,began,when,she,was,a,little,more,than,five,miles,from,ballyhara,[END]
scarlett,blamed,it,for,the,wetness,on,her,cheeks,[END]
on,wednesday,she,took,cat,to,tara,[END]
the,ancient,mounds,were,just,high,enough,for,cat,to,feel,triumphant,when,she,climbed,them,[END]
scarlett,watched,cat's,recklessness,on,the,run,down,the,mound,and,forced,herself,not,to,warn,her,that,she,might,fall,[END]
she,told,cat,about,tara,and,her,family,and,the,banquets,of,the,high,kings,[END]
before,they,left,she,held,the,little,girl,as,high,as,she,could,to,look,out,over,the,country,of,her,birth,[END]
you're,a,little,irish,cat,your,roots,go,deep,here,[END]
do,you,understand,anything,i'm,saying,[END]
no,said,cat,[END]
scarlett,put,her,down,so,she,could,run,[END]
the,strong,little,legs,never,walked,now,always,ran,[END]
cat,fell,often,[END]
there,were,ancient,hidden,irregularities,under,the,grass,[END]
but,she,never,cried,[END]
she,got,to,her,feet,and,ran,some,more,[END]
watching,her,was,healing,for,scarlett,[END]
it,made,her,whole,again,[END]
colum,who's,this,man,parnell,[END]
people,were,talking,about,him,at,the,hunt,breakfast,but,i,couldn't,make,any,sense,out,of,what,they,were,saying,[END]
a,protestant,said,colum,and,an,anglo,[END]
nobody,to,concern,them,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,argue,but,she'd,learned,it,was,a,waste,of,time,[END]
colum,never,discussed,the,english,especially,not,the,english,landowners,in,ireland,who,were,known,as,the,anglo-irish,[END]
he,would,manage,to,change,the,subject,before,she,knew,he,was,doing,it,[END]
it,bothered,her,that,he,wouldn't,even,admit,that,some,of,the,english,might,be,nice,people,[END]
she'd,liked,the,sisters,on,the,ship,from,america,and,everyone,had,been,nice,to,her,at,the,hunt,[END]
colum's,intransigence,made,her,feel,a,distance,between,them,[END]
if,he'd,only,talk,about,it,instead,of,snapping,her,head,off,[END]
she,asked,mrs,fitz,the,other,question,that,had,been,on,her,mind,[END]
who,were,the,irish,butlers,that,everyone,hated,so,much,[END]
the,housekeeper,brought,her,a,map,of,ireland,[END]
do,you,see,this,[END]
she,swept,her,hand,over,an,entire,county,as,big,as,county,meath,[END]
that's,kilkenny,[END]
butler,country,[END]
the,dukes,of,ormonde,they,are,[END]
they're,probably,the,strongest,anglo,family,in,ireland,[END]
scarlett,looked,closely,at,the,map,[END]
not,far,from,the,city,of,kilkenny,she,saw,the,name,dunmore,cave,[END]
and,rhett's,plantation,was,called,dunmore,landing,[END]
there,had,to,be,a,connection,[END]
scarlett,started,to,laugh,[END]
she'd,been,feeling,so,superior,because,the,o'haras,were,rulers,of,twelve,hundred,acres,and,here,were,the,butlers,with,their,own,county,[END]
without,lifting,a,finger,rhett,had,won,again,[END]
he,always,won,[END]
how,could,any,woman,be,blamed,for,loving,a,man,like,that,[END]
and,what's,so,amusing,mrs,[END]
o,[END]
i,am,mrs,fitz,[END]
thank,god,i,can,laugh,about,it,[END]
mary,moran,poked,her,head,around,the,door,without,knocking,[END]
scarlett,didn't,bother,to,say,anything,[END]
the,gangly,nervous,girl,would,be,even,worse,for,weeks,if,anyone,criticized,her,[END]
servants,[END]
a,problem,even,when,you,hardly,had,any,[END]
what,is,it,mary,[END]
a,gentleman,to,see,ye,[END]
the,maid,held,out,a,card,[END]
her,eyes,were,even,rounder,than,usual,[END]
sir,john,morland,bart,[END]
scarlett,ran,down,the,stairs,[END]
bart,[END]
what,a,surprise,[END]
come,in,we,can,sit,on,the,steps,[END]
i,don't,have,any,furniture,[END]
she,was,genuinely,pleased,to,see,him,but,she,couldn't,take,him,up,to,her,sitting,room,[END]
cat,was,having,her,nap,next,door,[END]
bart,morland,sat,down,on,the,stone,steps,as,if,it,were,the,most,natural,thing,in,the,world,to,have,no,furniture,[END]
he'd,had,the,devil,of,a,time,finding,her,he,said,until,he,ran,into,the,postman,in,the,bar,[END]
that,was,his,only,excuse,for,being,so,late,delivering,her,trophy,from,the,hunt,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,silver,plaque,with,her,name,and,the,date,of,the,hunt,[END]
the,fox,pad,was,no,longer,bloody,that,was,something,but,it,was,not,a,thing,of,beauty,[END]
disgusting,isn't,it,[END]
said,bart,cheerfully,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
no,matter,what,colum,said,she,liked,john,morland,[END]
would,you,like,to,say,hello,to,half,moon,[END]
thought,you'd,never,suggest,it,[END]
i,was,wondering,how,to,drop,a,really,weighty,hint,[END]
how,is,he,[END]
scarlett,made,a,face,[END]
underexercised,i'm,afraid,[END]
i,feel,guilty,about,it,but,i've,been,very,busy,[END]
it's,haying,time,[END]
how's,your,crop,[END]
so,far,so,good,[END]
if,we,don't,get,a,real,rain,[END]
they,walked,through,the,colonnade,and,out,to,the,stable,[END]
scarlett,was,going,to,pass,it,on,the,way,to,the,pasture,and,half,moon,but,bart,stopped,her,[END]
could,he,go,inside,[END]
her,stables,were,famous,and,he'd,never,seen,them,[END]
scarlett,was,puzzled,but,she,agreed,readily,[END]
the,horses,were,at,work,or,pasture,so,there,was,nothing,to,see,except,empty,stalls,but,if,he,wanted,to,see,them,[END]
the,stalls,were,separated,by,granite,columns,with,doric,capitals,[END]
tall,vaulting,sprang,up,from,the,columns,to,meet,and,cross,and,create,a,ceiling,of,stone,that,looked,as,light,and,weightless,as,air,and,sky,[END]
john,morland,cracked,his,knuckles,then,apologized,[END]
when,he,was,really,excited,he,said,he,did,it,without,thinking,[END]
you,don't,find,it,extraordinary,to,have,a,stable,that,looks,like,a,cathedral,[END]
i'd,put,an,organ,in,it,and,play,bach,to,the,horses,all,day,[END]
probably,give,them,strangles,[END]
morland's,whooping,laugh,made,scarlett,laugh,too,he,sounded,so,comic,[END]
she,filled,a,small,bag,with,oats,for,him,to,feed,half,moon,[END]
walking,beside,morland,scarlett,searched,her,mind,for,some,way,to,interrupt,his,admiring,chatter,about,her,stables,something,casual,she,could,say,to,start,him,talking,about,rhett,[END]
there,was,no,need,[END]
i,say,what,luck,for,me,that,you're,friends,with,rhett,butler,bart,exclaimed,[END]
if,he,hadn't,introduced,us,i'd,never,have,gotten,a,look,at,those,stables,of,yours,[END]
i,was,so,surprised,to,run,into,him,like,that,scarlett,said,quickly,[END]
how,do,you,happen,to,know,him,[END]
he,didn't,really,know,rhett,at,all,bart,replied,[END]
some,old,friends,had,written,to,him,a,month,ago,saying,that,they,were,sending,rhert,to,look,at,his,horses,[END]
then,rhett,had,arrived,bearing,a,letter,of,introduction,from,them,[END]
he's,a,remarkable,fellow,really,serious,about,horses,[END]
knows,a,lot,too,[END]
i,wish,he,could,have,stayed,longer,[END]
are,you,old,friends,[END]
he,never,quite,got,around,to,telling,me,[END]
thank,goodness,thought,scarlett,[END]
i,have,some,family,in,charleston,she,said,[END]
met,him,when,i,was,visiting,there,[END]
then,you,must,have,met,my,friends,the,brewtons,[END]
when,i,was,at,cambridge,i'd,go,down,to,london,for,the,season,just,in,hopes,that,sally,brewton,might,have,come,over,[END]
i,was,mad,for,her,just,like,everybody,else,[END]
sally,brewton,[END]
that,monkey,face,[END]
scarlett,blurted,before,she,thought,[END]
bart,grinned,[END]
the,very,same,[END]
isn't,she,marvelous,[END]
she's,such,an,original,[END]
scarlett,nodded,enthusiastically,and,smiled,[END]
but,in,truth,she'd,never,understand,how,men,could,be,mad,for,anyone,that,ugly,[END]
john,morland,assumed,that,everyone,who,knew,sally,must,certainly,adore,her,and,he,talked,about,her,for,the,next,half,hour,while,he,leaned,on,the,pasture,fence,and,tried,to,entice,half,moon,to,come,get,the,oats,he,held,in,his,palm,[END]
scarlett,half-listened,while,she,thought,her,own,thoughts,[END]
then,rhett's,name,captured,her,full,attention,[END]
bart,chuckled,as,he,recounted,the,gossip,sally,had,included,in,her,letter,[END]
rhett,had,fallen,into,the,oldest,snare,in,history,it,seemed,[END]
some,orphanage,was,having,an,outing,at,his,country,place,and,one,of,the,orphans,turned,up,missing,when,it,was,time,to,leave,[END]
so,what,did,he,do,but,go,off,with,the,schoolteacher,to,search,for,it,[END]
all,ended,well,the,child,was,found,but,not,until,after,dark,[END]
which,meant,of,course,that,the,spinster,teacher,was,compromised,and,rhett,had,to,marry,her,[END]
the,best,part,was,that,he'd,been,run,out,of,town,years,before,when,he,refused,to,make,an,honest,woman,out,of,another,girl,he'd,been,indiscreet,with,[END]
you'd,think,he,would,have,learned,to,be,careful,after,the,first,time,bart,chortled,[END]
he,must,be,a,lot,more,absentminded,than,he,appears,[END]
don't,you,find,that,hilarious,scarlett,[END]
scarlett,[END]
she,gathered,her,wits,[END]
speaking,as,a,female,i'd,say,it,serves,mr,butler,right,[END]
he,has,the,look,of,a,man,who's,caused,a,lot,of,girls,a,lot,of,trouble,when,he,wasn't,being,absentminded,[END]
john,morland,whooped,with,laughter,[END]
the,sound,attracted,half,moon,who,approached,the,fence,warily,[END]
bart,shook,the,bag,of,oats,[END]
scarlett,was,elated,and,yet,she,felt,like,crying,[END]
so,that,was,why,rhett,had,been,so,quick,to,divorce,and,remarry,[END]
what,a,sly,boots,anne,hampton,is,[END]
she,had,me,fooled,good,and,proper,[END]
or,maybe,not,[END]
maybe,it,was,just,wretched,luck,for,me,that,it,took,so,long,to,find,the,stray,orphan,[END]
and,that,anne,is,miss,eleanor's,special,favorite,[END]
and,that,she,looks,so,much,like,melly,[END]
half,moon,backed,away,from,the,oats,[END]
john,morland,reached,into,a,pocket,of,his,jacket,and,found,an,apple,[END]
the,horse,nickered,in,anticipation,[END]
look,here,scarlett,bart,said,as,he,broke,the,apple,[END]
i've,got,something,a,bit,ticklish,to,talk,to,you,about,[END]
he,extended,his,open,palm,with,one,quarter,of,the,apple,on,it,for,half,moon,[END]
a,bit,ticklish,[END]
if,he,only,knew,how,ticklish,his,conversation,had,already,been,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
i,don't,mind,you,spoiling,that,animal,rotten,if,that's,what,you,mean,she,said,[END]
heavens,no,[END]
bart's,gray,eyes,widened,[END]
what,could,have,put,such,a,thought,in,her,head,[END]
it,was,something,truly,delicate,he,explained,[END]
alice,harrington,she,was,the,stoutish,one,at,the,hunt,who'd,ended,up,in,the,ditch,was,having,a,house,party,at,midsummer,night,and,she,wanted,to,invite,scarlett,but,didn't,have,the,nerve,[END]
he'd,been,appointed,diplomat,to,sound,her,out,about,it,[END]
scarlett,had,a,hundred,questions,[END]
essentially,they,boiled,down,to,when,where,and,what,to,wear,[END]
colum,would,be,furious,she,was,sure,but,she,didn't,care,[END]
she,wanted,to,get,dressed,up,and,drink,champagne,and,ride,like,the,wind,again,over,streams,and,fences,following,the,hounds,and,the,fox,[END]
74,[END]
harrington,house,was,a,huge,block,of,a,house,made,of,portland,stone,[END]
it,wasn't,far,from,ballyhara,just,past,a,crossroads,village,named,pike,corner,[END]
the,entrance,was,hard,to,find,there,were,no,gates,and,no,gatehouse,only,a,pair,of,unadorned,and,unmarked,stone,columns,[END]
the,gravel,drive,skirted,a,broad,lake,then,turned,into,a,plain,gravelled,area,in,front,of,the,stone,house,[END]
a,footman,came,out,of,the,front,door,at,the,sound,of,the,buggy's,wheels,[END]
he,handed,scarlett,down,then,turned,her,over,to,a,maid,who,was,waiting,in,the,hallway,[END]
my,name,is,wilson,miss,she,said,with,a,curtsey,[END]
will,you,be,wanting,to,rest,a,bit,after,your,journey,or,will,you,be,joining,the,others,[END]
scarlett,chose,to,join,the,others,and,the,footman,led,her,the,length,of,the,hall,to,an,open,door,onto,a,lawn,[END]
mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
shouted,alice,harrington,[END]
now,scarlett,remembered,her,vividly,[END]
ended,up,in,a,ditch,hadn't,been,much,of,a,description,nor,had,stout,[END]
fat,and,loud,would,have,identified,alice,harrington,for,her,at,once,[END]
she,moved,toward,scarlett,with,a,surprisingly,light,step,and,bellowed,that,she,was,happy,to,see,her,[END]
i,do,hope,you,like,croquet,i'm,terrible,and,my,team,would,adore,to,lose,me,[END]
i've,never,played,scarlett,said,[END]
all,the,better,[END]
you'll,have,beginner's,luck,[END]
she,held,out,her,mallet,[END]
green,stripes,it's,perfect,for,you,[END]
you,have,such,unusual,eyes,[END]
let,me,introduce,everyone,then,you,can,take,my,place,and,give,my,team,a,chance,[END]
alice's,team,now,scarlett's,was,made,up,of,an,elderly,man,in,tweeds,introduced,as,general,smyth-burns,and,a,couple,in,their,arly,twenties,who,both,wore,spectacles,emma,and,chizzie,fulwich,[END]
the,general,presented,the,opponents,to,her,charlotte,montague,a,tall,thin,woman,with,beautifully,dressed,gray,hair,alice's,cousin,desmond,grantley,who,was,as,rotund,as,she,and,an,elegant,pair,named,genevieve,and,ronald,bennet,[END]
watch,out,for,ronald,said,emma,fulwich,he,cheats,[END]
the,game,was,fun,scarlett,thought,and,the,scent,of,freshly,mowed,lawn,was,better,than,flowers,[END]
her,competitive,instincts,were,at,their,full,height,before,her,third,turn,came,around,and,she,earned,a,well,done,[END]
and,a,pat,on,the,shoulder,from,the,general,when,she,whacked,ronald,bennet's,ball,far,out,onto,the,lawn,[END]
when,the,game,was,over,alice,harrington,halloed,them,an,invitation,to,tea,[END]
the,table,was,set,up,under,a,tremendous,beech,tree,its,shade,was,welcome,[END]
so,was,the,sight,of,john,morland,[END]
he,was,listening,attentively,to,the,young,woman,sitting,beside,him,on,the,bench,but,he,waggled,his,fingers,at,scarlett,in,greeting,[END]
the,rest,of,the,house,party,was,there,too,[END]
scarlett,met,sir,francis,kinsman,a,handsome,rakehell,type,and,his,wife,and,she,pretended,convincingly,that,she,remembered,alice's,husband,henry,from,the,hunt,at,bart's,[END]
bart's,companion,was,clearly,not,pleased,to,be,interrupted,forntroductions,but,she,was,icily,gracious,[END]
this,is,louisa,ferncliff,said,alice,with,determined,cheerfulness,[END]
she's,an,honourable,alice,whispered,to,scarlett,[END]
scarlett,smiled,said,how,do,you,do,and,let,it,go,at,that,[END]
she,had,a,pretty,good,idea,that,the,frosty,young,woman,wouldn't,take,kindly,to,being,called,louisa,right,off,the,bat,and,surely,you,didn't,call,people,honourable,[END]
especially,when,they,looked,like,they,hoped,john,morland,would,suggest,a,little,dishonorable,kissing,behind,a,bush,[END]
desmond,grantley,held,a,chair,for,scarlett,and,asked,if,she,would,permit,him,to,bring,her,an,assortment,of,sandwiches,and,cakes,[END]
scarlett,generously,said,she,would,[END]
she,looked,at,the,circle,of,what,colum,scornfully,called,gentry,and,thought,again,that,he,shouldn't,be,so,pigheaded,[END]
these,people,were,really,very,nice,[END]
she,was,sure,she,was,going,to,have,a,good,time,[END]
alice,harrington,took,scarlett,up,to,her,bedroom,after,tea,[END]
it,was,a,long,way,through,rather,shabby,reception,rooms,up,a,wide,staircase,with,a,worn,runner,and,along,a,broad,hall,with,no,rug,at,all,[END]
the,room,was,big,but,sparsely,furnished,scarlett,thought,and,the,wallpaper,was,definitely,faded,[END]
sarah,has,unpacked,for,you,[END]
she'll,be,up,to,do,your,bath,and,help,you,dress,at,seven,if,that's,all,right,[END]
dinner's,at,eight,[END]
scarlett,assured,alice,that,the,arrangements,were,fine,[END]
there's,writing,material,in,the,desk,and,some,books,on,that,table,but,if,you'd,rather,have,something,different,[END]
heavens,no,alice,[END]
now,don't,let,me,take,up,your,time,when,you,have,guests,and,all,[END]
she,snatched,up,a,book,at,random,[END]
i,can,hardly,wait,to,read,this,[END]
i've,been,wanting,to,for,ages,[END]
what,she'd,really,been,wanting,was,escape,from,alice's,incessant,noisy,recital,of,the,virtues,of,her,fat,cousin,desmond,[END]
no,wonder,she,was,nervous,about,inviting,me,scarlett,thought,she,must,know,that,desmond's,nothing,to,make,a,girl's,heart,beat,faster,[END]
i,guess,she,found,out,i'm,a,rich,widow,and,she,wants,to,help,him,get,his,licks,in,first,before,anybody,else,finds,out,about,me,[END]
too,bad,alice,there's,not,a,chance,not,in,a,million,years,[END]
as,soon,as,alice,was,gone,the,maid,assigned,to,scarlett,tapped,on,the,door,and,entered,[END]
she,curtseyed,smiling,eagerly,[END]
me,name,is,sarah,she,said,[END]
i'm,honored,to,be,dressing,the,o'hara,[END]
when,will,the,trunks,be,arriving,then,[END]
trunks,[END]
what,trunks,[END]
scarlett,asked,[END]
the,maid,covered,her,mouth,with,her,hand,and,moaned,through,her,fingers,[END]
you'd,better,sit,down,scarlett,said,[END]
i,have,an,idea,i,need,to,ask,you,a,bunch,of,questions,[END]
the,girl,was,happy,to,oblige,[END]
scarlett's,heart,grew,heavier,by,the,minute,as,she,learned,how,much,she,didn't,know,[END]
the,worst,thing,was,there'd,be,no,hunt,[END]
hunting,was,for,autumn,and,winter,[END]
the,only,reason,sir,john,morland,had,arranged,one,was,to,show,off,his,horses,to,his,rich,american,guest,[END]
almost,as,bad,was,the,news,that,ladies,dressed,for,breakfast,changed,for,lunch,changed,for,afternoon,changed,for,dinner,never,wore,the,same,thing,twice,[END]
scarlett,had,two,daytime,frocks,one,dinner,gown,and,her,riding,habit,[END]
there,was,no,point,in,sending,to,ballyhara,for,any,more,either,[END]
mrs,scanlon,the,dressmaker,had,gone,without,sleep,to,finish,the,things,she,had,with,her,[END]
all,her,clothes,made,new,for,the,trip,to,america,were,hopelessly,out,of,fashion,[END]
i,think,i'll,leave,first,thing,in,the,morning,said,scarlett,[END]
oh,no,sarah,cried,you,mustn't,do,that,the,o'hara,[END]
what,do,you,care,what,the,others,do,[END]
they're,only,anglos,[END]
scarlett,smiled,at,the,girl,[END]
so,it's,us,against,them,sarah,is,that,what,you're,telling,me,[END]
how,did,you,know,i,was,the,o'hara,[END]
everyone,in,county,meath,knows,about,the,o'hara,said,the,girl,proudly,everyone,irish,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
she,felt,better,already,[END]
now,sarah,she,said,tell,me,all,about,the,anglos,who,are,here,[END]
scarlett,was,sure,the,servants,in,the,house,must,know,everything,about,everybody,[END]
they,always,did,[END]
sarah,didn't,disappoint,her,[END]
when,scarlett,went,downstairs,for,dinner,she,was,armored,against,any,snobbishness,she,might,meet,[END]
she,knew,more,about,the,other,guests,than,their,own,mothers,did,[END]
even,so,she,felt,like,a,backwoods,cracker,[END]
and,she,was,furious,at,john,morland,[END]
all,he'd,said,was,light,frocks,in,the,daytime,and,something,rather,naked,for,dinner,at,night,[END]
the,other,women,were,gowned,and,jewelled,like,queens,she,thought,and,she'd,left,her,pearls,and,her,diamond,earbobs,at,home,[END]
also,she,was,sure,that,her,gown,fairly,screamed,aloud,that,a,village,dressmaker,had,made,it,[END]
she,gritted,her,teeth,and,made,up,her,mind,that,she,was,going,to,have,a,good,time,anyhow,[END]
might,as,well,i'll,never,get,invited,any,place,else,[END]
in,fact,there,were,many,things,she,enjoyed,[END]
in,addition,to,croquet,there,was,boating,on,the,lake,plus,contests,shooting,at,targets,with,bow,and,arrows,and,a,game,called,tennis,both,of,them,quite,the,latest,rage,she,was,told,[END]
after,dinner,saturday,everyone,rummaged,through,big,boxes,of,costumes,that,had,been,brought,to,the,drawing,room,[END]
there,was,buffoonery,and,uninhibited,laughter,and,a,lack,of,self-consciousness,that,scarlett,envied,[END]
henry,harrington,draped,scarlett,in,a,longtrained,silk,cloak,glittering,with,tinsel,and,put,a,crown,of,fake,jewels,on,her,head,[END]
that,makes,you,tonight's,titania,he,said,[END]
other,men,and,women,draped,or,clothed,themselves,from,the,boxes,shouting,out,who,they,were,and,racing,through,the,big,room,in,a,free-for-all,game,of,hiding,behind,chairs,and,chasing,one,another,[END]
i,know,it's,all,very,silly,john,morland,said,apologetically,through,a,huge,papier-mâché,lion's,head,[END]
but,it,is,midsummer,night,we're,all,allowed,to,go,a,bit,mad,[END]
i'm,mighty,put,out,with,you,bart,scarlett,told,him,[END]
you're,no,help,to,a,lady,at,all,[END]
why,didn't,you,tell,me,i,needed,dozens,of,dresses,[END]
oh,lord,do,you,[END]
i,never,notice,what,ladies,have,on,[END]
i,don't,understand,why,they,fuss,so,[END]
by,the,time,everyone,tired,of,the,game,they,were,playing,the,long,long,irish,twilight,was,done,[END]
it's,dark,alice,shouted,[END]
let's,go,look,at,the,fires,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,wave,of,guilt,[END]
she,should,be,at,ballyhara,[END]
midsummer,night,was,almost,as,important,as,saint,brigid's,day,in,farming,tradition,[END]
bonfires,marked,the,turning,point,in,the,year,its,shortest,night,and,gave,mystical,protection,for,the,cattle,and,the,crops,[END]
when,the,house,party,went,out,onto,the,dark,lawn,they,could,see,the,glow,of,a,distant,fire,hear,the,sound,of,an,irish,reel,[END]
scarlett,knew,she,should,be,at,ballyhara,[END]
the,o'hara,should,be,at,the,bonfire,ceremony,[END]
and,there,too,when,the,sun,rose,and,the,cattle,were,run,through,the,dying,coals,of,the,fire,[END]
colum,had,told,her,she,shouldn't,go,to,an,anglo,house,party,[END]
whether,she,believed,in,them,or,not,the,ancient,traditions,were,important,to,the,irish,[END]
she'd,gotten,angry,with,him,[END]
superstitions,couldn't,run,her,life,[END]
but,now,she,suspected,she,was,wrong,[END]
why,aren't,you,at,the,ballyhara,fire,[END]
asked,bart,[END]
why,aren't,you,at,yours,[END]
scarlett,snapped,angrily,[END]
because,i'm,not,wanted,there,said,john,morland,[END]
his,voice,in,the,darkness,sounded,very,sad,[END]
i,did,go,once,[END]
i,thought,there,might,be,one,of,those,folk,wisdom,things,behind,running,the,cattle,through,the,ashes,[END]
good,for,the,hooves,or,something,[END]
i,wanted,to,try,it,on,the,horses,[END]
did,it,work,[END]
i,never,found,out,[END]
all,the,joy,went,out,of,the,celebration,when,i,arrived,so,i,left,[END]
i,should,have,left,here,scarlett,blurted,[END]
what,an,absurd,thing,to,say,[END]
you're,the,only,real,person,here,[END]
an,american,too,[END]
you're,the,exotic,bloom,in,the,patch,of,weeds,scarlett,[END]
she,hadn't,thought,of,it,that,way,[END]
it,made,sense,too,[END]
people,always,made,much,over,guests,from,far,away,[END]
she,felt,much,better,until,she,heard,the,honourable,louisa,say,aren't,they,entertaining,[END]
i,do,adore,the,irish,when,they,go,all,pagan,and,primitive,like,this,[END]
if,only,they,weren't,so,lazy,and,stupid,i,wouldn't,mind,living,in,ireland,[END]
scarlett,vowed,silently,to,apologize,to,colum,the,minute,she,got,back,home,[END]
she,should,never,have,left,her,own,place,and,her,own,people,[END]
and,hasn't,any,other,living,soul,ever,made,a,mistake,scarlett,darling,[END]
you,had,to,learn,the,way,of,them,for,yourself,else,how,would,you,know,[END]
dry,your,eyes,now,and,ride,out,to,see,the,fields,[END]
the,hired,lads,have,started,building,the,haycocks,[END]
scarlett,kissed,her,cousin's,cheek,[END]
he,hadn't,said,i,told,you,so,[END]
in,the,weeks,that,followed,scarlett,was,invited,to,two,more,house,parties,by,people,she,had,met,at,alice,harrington's,[END]
she,wrote,stilted,proper,refusals,for,both,[END]
when,the,haycocks,were,finished,she,had,the,hired,lads,start,working,on,the,ruined,lawn,behind,the,house,[END]
it,could,be,back,in,good,grass,by,next,summer,and,cat,would,love,to,play,croquet,[END]
that,part,had,been,fun,[END]
the,wheat,was,ripe,yellow,almost,ready,to,harvest,when,a,rider,brought,a,note,to,her,and,invited,himself,into,the,kitchen,for,a,cup,of,tea,or,something,more,manly,while,he,waited,for,her,to,write,a,reply,for,him,to,take,back,[END]
charlotte,montague,would,like,to,call,on,her,if,it,was,convenient,[END]
who,on,earth,was,charlotte,montague,[END]
scarlett,had,to,rack,her,brain,for,nearly,ten,minutes,before,she,recalled,the,pleasant,unobtrusive,older,woman,at,the,harringtons',[END]
mrs,montague,she,remembered,had,not,raced,around,like,a,wild,indian,on,midsummer,night,[END]
she'd,sort,of,disappeared,after,dinner,[END]
not,that,it,made,her,any,less,english,[END]
but,what,could,she,want,[END]
scarlett's,curiosity,was,piqued,[END]
the,note,said,a,matter,of,considerable,interest,to,us,both,[END]
she,went,to,the,kitchen,herself,to,give,mrs,montague's,messenger,the,note,inviting,her,to,tea,that,afternoon,[END]
she,knew,she,was,trespassing,on,mrs,fitz's,territory,[END]
the,kitchen,was,supposed,to,be,viewed,only,from,the,bridge-like,gallery,above,[END]
but,it,was,her,kitchen,wasn't,it,[END]
and,cat,had,started,spending,hours,there,every,day,why,couldn't,she,[END]
scarlett,nearly,put,on,her,pink,frock,for,mrs,montague's,call,[END]
it,was,cooler,than,her,galway,skirts,and,the,afternoon,was,very,warm,for,ireland,[END]
then,she,put,it,back,in,the,wardrobe,[END]
she,wouldn't,pretend,to,be,what,she,was,not,[END]
she,ordered,harm,brack,for,tea,instead,of,the,scones,she,usually,had,[END]
charlotte,montague,was,wearing,a,gray,linen,jacket,and,skirt,with,a,lace,jabot,that,scarlett's,fingers,itched,to,touch,[END]
she'd,never,seen,lace,so,thick,and,elaborate,[END]
the,older,woman,took,off,her,gray,kid,gloves,and,gray,feathered,hat,before,she,sat,in,the,plush-covered,chair,next,to,the,tea,table,[END]
thank,you,for,receiving,me,mrs,o'hara,[END]
i,doubt,that,you,want,to,waste,time,talking,about,the,weather,you'd,prefer,to,know,why,i'm,here,is,that,correct,[END]
mrs,montague,had,an,interesting,wryness,in,her,voice,and,her,smile,[END]
i've,been,dying,of,curiosity,said,scarlett,[END]
she,liked,this,beginning,[END]
i,have,learned,that,you're,a,successful,businesswoman,both,here,and,in,america,[END]
don't,be,alarmed,[END]
what,i,know,i,keep,to,myself,it's,one,of,my,most,valuable,assets,[END]
another,as,you,can,imagine,is,that,i,have,means,of,learning,things,that,others,do,not,[END]
i'm,a,businesswoman,too,[END]
i,would,like,to,tell,you,about,my,business,if,i,may,[END]
scarlett,could,only,nod,dumbly,[END]
what,did,this,woman,know,about,her,[END]
and,how,[END]
to,put,it,at,its,most,basic,level,she,arranged,things,said,mrs,montague,[END]
she,was,born,the,youngest,daughter,of,a,younger,son,of,a,good,family,and,she,had,married,a,younger,son,of,another,[END]
even,before,he,died,in,a,hunting,accident,she,had,grown,tired,of,being,always,on,the,edge,of,things,always,trying,to,keep,up,appearances,and,lead,the,life,expected,of,well-bred,ladies,and,gentlemen,always,in,need,of,money,[END]
after,she,was,widowed,she,found,herself,in,the,position,of,poor,relation,a,position,that,was,intolerable,[END]
what,she,had,was,intelligence,education,taste,and,entrée,to,all,the,best,houses,in,ireland,[END]
she,built,on,them,adding,discretion,and,information,to,the,attributes,she,began,with,[END]
i,am,in,a,manner,of,speaking,a,professional,house,guest,and,friend,[END]
i,give,generously,of,advice,in,clothing,in,entertaining,in,decorating,houses,in,arranging,marriages,or,assignations,[END]
and,i,am,paid,generous,commissions,by,dressmakers,and,tailors,bootmakers,and,jewelers,furniture,dealers,and,rug,merchants,[END]
i,am,skillful,and,tactful,and,it,is,doubtful,that,anyone,suspects,that,i,am,being,paid,[END]
even,if,they,do,suspect,either,they,don't,want,to,know,or,they,are,so,satisfied,with,the,outcome,that,they,don't,care,particularly,since,it,costs,them,nothing,[END]
scarlett,was,shocked,and,fascinated,[END]
why,was,the,woman,confessing,all,of,this,to,her,of,all,people,[END]
i'm,telling,you,this,because,i,am,sure,you're,no,fool,mrs,o'hara,[END]
you,would,wonder,and,rightly,if,i,offered,to,help,you,as,the,saying,goes,out,of,the,goodness,of,my,heart,[END]
there,is,no,goodness,in,my,heart,except,insofar,as,it,adds,to,my,personal,well-being,[END]
i,have,a,business,proposal,for,you,[END]
you,deserve,better,than,a,shabby,little,party,given,by,a,shabby,little,woman,like,alice,harrington,[END]
you,have,beauty,and,brains,and,money,[END]
you,can,be,an,original,[END]
if,you,put,yourself,in,my,hands,under,my,tutelage,i,will,make,you,the,most,admired,the,most,sought-after,woman,in,ireland,[END]
it,will,take,two,to,three,years,[END]
then,the,whole,world,will,be,open,to,you,to,do,with,as,you,will,[END]
you,will,be,famous,[END]
and,i,will,have,enough,money,to,retire,in,luxury,[END]
mrs,montague,smiled,[END]
i've,been,waiting,nearly,twenty,years,for,someone,like,you,to,come,along,[END]
75,[END]
scarlett,hurried,across,the,kitchen,bridge,to,mrs,fitzpatrick's,rooms,as,soon,as,charlotte,montague,left,[END]
she,didn't,care,that,she,was,supposed,to,send,for,the,housekeeper,to,come,to,her,she,had,to,talk,to,someone,[END]
mrs,fitz,came,out,of,her,room,before,scarlett,could,knock,on,the,door,[END]
you,should,have,sent,for,me,mrs,o'hara,she,said,in,a,low,voice,[END]
i,know,i,know,but,it,takes,so,long,and,what,i,have,to,tell,you,just,won't,wait,[END]
scarlett,was,extremely,agitated,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick's,cold,look,calmed,her,down,rapidly,[END]
it,will,have,to,wait,she,said,[END]
the,kitchen,maids,will,hear,every,word,you,say,and,repeat,it,with,embellishments,[END]
walk,slowly,with,and,follow,my,lead,[END]
scarlett,felt,like,a,chastised,child,[END]
she,did,as,she,was,told,[END]
halfway,across,the,gallery,above,the,kitchen,mrs,fitzpatrick,stopped,[END]
scarlett,stopped,with,her,and,contained,her,impatience,while,mrs,fitz,talked,about,improvements,that,had,been,made,in,the,kitchen,[END]
the,wide,balustrade,was,plenty,big,enough,to,sit,on,scarlett,thought,idly,but,she,stood,as,erect,as,mrs,fitz,looking,down,at,the,kitchen,and,the,exceedingly,busy-looking,maids,far,below,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick's,progress,was,stately,but,she,did,move,[END]
when,they,reached,the,house,scarlett,started,talking,as,soon,as,the,door,to,the,bridge,closed,behind,them,[END]
of,course,it's,ridiculous,she,said,after,she,reported,what,mrs,montague,had,said,[END]
i,told,her,so,too,[END]
i'm,irish,',i,said,i,don't,want,to,be,sought,after,by,the,english,',[END]

kennedy's,inn,is,nearly,finished,[END]
we'll,have,men,coming,and,going,soon,[END]
what,better,than,to,have,other,comings,and,goings,to,distract,the,eyes,of,the,english,[END]
i,took,this,montague,woman's,measure,at,a,glance,[END]
she's,a,cold,greedy,sort,[END]
mark,my,words,the,first,thing,she,will,do,is,tell,scarlett,that,the,big,house,must,be,furnished,and,furbished,[END]
this,montague,will,play,games,with,the,cost,of,everything,but,scarlett,can,well,afford,it,[END]
and,there,will,be,strangers,coming,through,trim,to,ballyhara,every,day,of,the,year,with,their,paints,and,velvets,and,french,fashions,[END]
no,one,will,pay,heed,to,one,or,two,more,travelling,this,way,[END]
there's,wonder,already,about,the,pretty,american,widow,[END]
why,isn't,she,looking,for,a,husband,[END]
i,say,we'll,do,better,to,send,her,out,to,the,english,at,their,parties,[END]
otherwise,the,english,officers,may,start,coming,here,to,court,her,[END]
colum,promised,to,put,his,mind,on,it,[END]
he,went,out,that,night,and,walked,for,miles,trying,to,decide,what,was,best,for,scarlett,what,was,best,for,the,brotherhood,how,they,could,be,reconciled,[END]
he'd,been,so,worried,of,late,that,he,didn't,always,think,clearly,[END]
there,had,been,reports,of,some,men,losing,their,commitment,to,the,fenian,movement,[END]
good,harvests,for,two,years,in,a,row,were,making,men,comfortable,and,comfort,made,it,harder,to,risk,everything,[END]
also,fenians,who,had,infiltrated,the,constabulary,were,hearing,rumors,about,an,informer,in,the,brotherhood,[END]
underground,groin,were,perpetually,in,danger,from,informants,[END]
twice,in,the,past,uprising,had,been,destroyed,by,treachery,[END]
but,this,one,had,been,so,carefully,so,slowly,planned,[END]
every,precaution,taken,[END]
nothing,left,to,chance,[END]
it,mustn't,go,wrong,now,[END]
they,were,so,close,[END]
the,highest,councils,had,planned,to,give,the,signal,for,action,in,the,winter,when,three-fourths,of,the,english,militia,would,be,away,from,their,garrisons,for,fox,hunting,[END]
instead,the,word,had,come,down,delay,until,the,informer,is,identified,and,disposed,of,[END]
the,waiting,was,eating,away,at,him,[END]
when,the,sunrise,came,he,walked,through,the,rose-tinted,ground,mist,to,the,big,house,let,himself,in,with,a,key,and,went,to,rosaleen's,room,[END]
i,believe,you're,right,he,told,her,[END]
does,that,earn,me,a,cup,of,tea,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,made,a,graceful,apology,to,scarlett,later,that,day,admitting,that,she,had,been,too,hasty,and,too,prejudiced,[END]
she,urged,scarlett,to,start,creating,a,social,life,for,herself,with,charlotte,montague's,help,[END]
i've,decided,it's,a,silly,idea,scarlett,replied,[END]
i'm,too,busy,[END]
when,rosaleen,told,colum,he,laughed,[END]
she,slammed,the,door,when,she,left,his,house,[END]
harvest,harvest,home,celebration,golden,autumn,days,golden,leaves,beginning,to,fall,[END]
scarlett,rejoiced,in,the,rich,crops,mourned,the,end,of,the,growing,year,[END]
september,was,the,time,for,the,half-yearly,rents,and,she,knew,her,tenants,would,have,profit,left,over,[END]
it,was,a,grand,thing,being,the,o'hara,[END]
she,gave,a,big,party,for,cat's,second,birthday,[END]
all,the,ballyhara,children,ten,and,under,played,in,the,big,empty,rooms,on,the,ground,floor,tasted,ice,cream,for,probably,the,first,time,ate,barm,brack,with,tiny,favors,baked,in,it,as,well,as,currants,and,raisins,[END]
every,one,of,them,went,home,with,a,shiny,coin,[END]
scarlett,made,sure,they,went,home,early,because,of,all,the,superstitions,about,halloween,[END]
then,she,took,cat,upstairs,for,her,nap,[END]
did,you,like,your,birthday,darling,[END]
cat,smiled,drowsily,[END]
yes,[END]
sleepy,momma,[END]
i,know,you,are,angel,[END]
it's,way,past,your,nap,time,[END]
come,on,[END]
into,bed,[END]
you,can,nap,in,momma's,big,bed,because,this,is,a,big,birthday,[END]
cat,sat,up,as,soon,as,scarlett,laid,her,down,[END]
where's,cat's,present,[END]
i'll,get,it,darling,[END]
scarlett,brought,the,big,china,dollbaby,from,its,box,where,cat,had,left,it,[END]
cat,shook,her,head,[END]
the,other,one,[END]
she,turned,on,her,stomach,and,slid,down,under,the,eiderdown,to,the,floor,landing,with,a,thump,[END]
then,she,crawled,under,the,bed,[END]
she,backed,out,with,a,yellow,tabby,cat,in,her,arms,[END]
for,pity's,sake,cat,where,did,that,come,from,[END]
give,it,to,me,before,it,scratches,you,[END]
will,you,give,it,back,[END]
of,course,if,you,want,it,[END]
but,it's,a,barn,cat,baby,it,might,not,want,to,stay,in,the,house,[END]
it,likes,me,[END]
scarlett,gave,in,[END]
the,cat,hadn't,scratched,cat,and,she,looked,so,happy,with,it,[END]
what,harm,could,it,possibly,do,to,let,her,keep,it,[END]
she,put,the,two,of,them,in,her,bed,[END]
i'll,probably,end,up,sleeping,with,a,hundred,fleas,but,a,birthday,is,a,birthday,[END]
cat,nestled,into,the,pillows,[END]
her,drooping,eyes,opened,suddenly,[END]
when,annie,brings,my,milk,she,said,my,friend,can,drink,mine,[END]
her,green,eyes,closed,and,she,went,limp,with,sleep,[END]
annie,tapped,on,the,door,came,in,with,a,cup,of,warm,milk,[END]
she,told,them,when,she,got,back,to,the,kitchen,that,mrs,o'hara,had,laughed,and,laughed,she,couldn't,think,why,[END]
she'd,said,something,about,cats,and,milk,[END]
if,anybody,wanted,to,know,what,she,thought,said,mary,moran,she,thought,it,would,be,a,lot,more,seemly,for,that,baby,to,have,a,decent,christian,name,may,the,saints,protect,her,[END]
all,three,maids,and,the,cook,crossed,themselves,three,times,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,saw,and,heard,from,the,bridge,[END]
she,crossed,herself,too,and,said,a,silent,prayer,[END]
cat,would,soon,be,too,big,to,keep,protected,all,the,time,[END]
people,were,afraid,of,fairy,changelings,and,what,people,feared,they,tried,to,destroy,[END]
down,in,ballyhara,town,mothers,were,scrubbing,their,children,with,water,in,which,angelica,root,had,steeped,all,day,[END]
it,was,a,known,protection,against,witches,and,spirits,[END]
the,horn,did,it,[END]
scarlett,was,exercising,half,moon,when,both,of,them,heard,the,horn,and,then,the,hounds,[END]
somewhere,close,by,in,the,countryside,people,were,hunting,[END]
for,all,she,knew,rhett,might,even,be,with,them,[END]
she,put,half,moon,over,three,ditches,and,four,hedges,on,ballyhara,but,it,wasn't,the,same,[END]
she,wrote,to,charlotte,montague,the,next,day,[END]
two,weeks,later,three,wagons,rolled,heavily,up,the,drive,[END]
the,furniture,for,mrs,montague's,rooms,had,arrived,[END]
the,lady,followed,in,a,smart,carriage,along,with,her,maid,[END]
she,directed,the,disposition,of,the,furniture,in,a,bedroom,and,sitting,room,near,scarlett's,then,left,her,maid,to,see,to,her,unpacking,[END]
now,we,begin,she,said,to,scarlett,[END]
i,might,just,as,well,not,be,here,at,all,scarlett,complained,[END]
the,only,thing,i'm,allowed,to,do,is,sign,bank,drafts,for,scandalous,amounts,of,money,[END]
she,was,talking,to,ocras,cat's,tabby,[END]
the,name,meant,hungry,in,irish,and,had,been,given,by,the,cook,in,an,exasperated,moment,[END]
ocras,ignored,scarlett,but,she,had,no,one,else,to,talk,to,[END]
charlotte,montague,and,mrs,fitzpatrick,seldom,asked,her,opinion,about,anything,[END]
both,of,them,knew,what,a,big,house,should,be,and,she,didn't,[END]
nor,was,she,very,interested,[END]
for,most,of,her,life,the,house,she,lived,in,had,simply,been,there,already,as,it,was,and,she'd,never,thought,about,it,[END]
tara,was,tara,aunt,pittypat's,was,aunt,pitty's,even,though,half,of,it,belonged,to,her,[END]
scarlett,had,involved,herself,only,with,the,house,rhett,built,for,her,[END]
she'd,bought,the,newest,and,most,expensive,furnishings,and,decorations,and,she'd,been,pleased,with,them,because,they,proved,how,rich,she,was,[END]
the,house,itself,never,gave,her,pleasure,she,hardly,saw,it,[END]
just,as,she,didn't,really,see,the,big,house,at,ballyhara,[END]
eighteenth-century,palladian,charlotte,said,and,what,pray,tell,was,so,important,about,that,[END]
what,mattered,to,scarlett,was,the,land,for,its,richness,and,its,crops,and,the,town,for,its,rents,and,services,and,because,no,one,not,even,rhett,owned,his,own,town,[END]
however,she,understood,perfectly,well,that,accepting,invitations,placed,an,obligation,on,her,to,return,them,and,she,couldn't,invite,people,to,a,place,that,had,furniture,in,only,two,rooms,[END]
she,was,lucky,she,upposed,that,charlotte,montague,wanted,to,transform,the,big,house,for,her,[END]
she,had,more,interesting,things,to,do,with,her,time,[END]
scarlett,was,firm,about,the,points,that,mattered,to,her,cat,must,have,a,room,next,to,her,own,not,in,some,nursery,wing,with,a,nanny,and,scarlett,would,do,her,own,accounts,not,turn,all,her,business,over,to,a,bailiff,[END]
other,than,that,charlotte,and,mrs,fitz,could,do,whatever,they,liked,[END]
the,costs,made,her,wince,but,she,had,agreed,to,give,charlotte,a,free,hand,and,it,was,too,late,to,back,out,once,she'd,shaken,hands,on,it,[END]
besides,money,just,didn't,matter,to,her,now,the,way,it,used,to,[END]
so,scarlett,took,refuge,in,the,estate,office,and,cat,made,the,kitchen,her,own,while,workmen,did,unknown,expensive,noisy,smelly,things,to,her,house,for,months,on,end,[END]
at,least,she,had,the,farm,to,run,and,her,duties,as,the,o'hara,[END]
also,she,was,buying,horses,[END]
i,know,little,or,nothing,about,horses,said,charlotte,montague,[END]
it,was,a,statement,that,made,scarlett's,eyebrows,skid,upwards,[END]
she'd,come,to,believe,that,there,was,nothing,on,earth,charlotte,didn't,claim,to,be,an,expert,on,[END]
you'll,need,at,least,four,saddle,horses,and,six,hunters,eight,would,be,better,and,you,must,ask,sir,john,morland,to,assist,you,in,selecting,them,[END]
six,hunters,[END]
god's,nightgown,charlotte,you're,talking,about,more,than,five,hundred,pounds,[END]
scarlett,shouted,[END]
you're,crazy,[END]
she,brought,her,voice,down,to,normal,sound,she'd,learned,that,shouting,at,mrs,montague,was,a,waste,of,energy,nothing,bothered,the,woman,[END]
i'll,educate,you,a,little,about,horses,she,said,with,venomous,sweetness,[END]
you,can,only,ride,one,[END]
teams,are,for,carriages,and,plows,[END]
she,lost,the,argument,[END]
as,usual,[END]
that,was,why,she,didn't,bother,to,argue,about,john,morland's,help,she,told,herself,[END]
but,scarlett,knew,that,really,she,had,been,hoping,to,have,a,reason,to,see,bart,[END]
he,might,have,some,news,of,rhett,[END]
she,rode,over,to,dunsany,the,next,day,[END]
morland,was,delighted,by,her,request,[END]
of,course,he'd,help,her,find,the,best,hunters,in,all,ireland,[END]
do,you,ever,hear,from,your,american,friend,bart,[END]
she,hoped,the,question,sounded,casual,she'd,waited,long,enough,to,get,it,in,[END]
john,morland,could,talk,about,horses,even,longer,than,pa,and,beatrice,tarleton,[END]
rhett,do,you,mean,[END]
scarlett's,heart,turned,over,at,the,sound,of,his,name,[END]
yes,he's,much,more,responsible,about,his,correspondence,than,i,am,[END]
john,gestured,towards,the,untidy,pile,of,letters,and,bills,on,his,desk,[END]
would,the,man,just,get,on,with,it,[END]
what,about,rhett,[END]
bart,shrugged,turned,his,back,to,the,desk,[END]
he's,determined,to,enter,the,filly,he,bought,from,me,in,the,charleston,races,[END]
i,told,him,she,was,bred,for,hurdles,and,not,for,the,flat,but,he's,sure,her,speed,will,compensate,[END]
i'm,afraid,he's,going,to,be,disappointed,[END]
in,another,three,or,four,years,perhaps,he,might,prove,right,but,when,you,remember,that,her,dam,was,out,of,[END]
scarlett,stopped,listening,[END]
john,morland,would,talk,bloodlines,all,the,way,back,to,the,flood,[END]
why,couldn't,he,tell,her,what,she,wanted,to,know,[END]
was,rhett,happy,[END]
had,he,mentioned,her,[END]
she,looked,at,the,young,baronet's,animated,intense,face,and,forgave,him,[END]
in,his,own,eccentric,way,he,was,one,of,the,most,charming,men,in,the,world,[END]
john,morland's,life,was,built,around,horses,[END]
he,was,a,conscientious,landlord,interested,in,his,estate,and,his,tenants,[END]
but,breeding,and,training,race,horses,was,his,true,passion,followed,closely,by,fox,hunting,in,the,winter,on,the,magnificent,hunters,he,kept,for,himself,[END]
possibly,they,compensated,for,the,romantic,tragedy,of,bart's,absolute,devotion,to,the,woman,who,had,gained,possession,of,his,heart,when,they,were,both,not,much,more,than,children,[END]
her,name,was,grace,hastings,[END]
she'd,been,married,to,julian,hastings,for,nearly,twenty,years,[END]
john,morland,and,scarlett,shared,a,bond,of,hopeless,love,[END]
charlotte,had,told,her,what,everyone,in,ireland,knew,john,was,relatively,immune,to,husband-hunting,women,because,he,had,little,money,[END]
his,title,and,his,property,were,old,impressively,old,but,he,had,no,income,except,his,rents,and,he,spent,almost,every,shilling,of,that,on,his,horses,[END]
even,so,he,was,very,handsome,in,an,absentminded,way,tall,and,fair,with,warm,interested,gray,eyes,and,a,breathtakingly,sweet,smile,that,accurately,reflected,his,goodhearted,nature,[END]
he,was,strangely,innocent,for,a,man,who,had,spent,all,of,his,forty-some,years,in,the,worldly,circles,of,british,society,[END]
occasionally,a,woman,with,money,of,her,own,like,the,honourable,louisa,fell,in,love,with,him,and,made,a,determined,pursuit,that,embarrassed,morland,and,amused,everyone,else,[END]
his,eccentricities,became,more,pronounced,then,his,absentmindedness,bordered,on,vacancy,his,waistcoats,were,often,buttoned,wrong,his,contagious,whooping,laughter,became,sometimes,inappropriate,and,he,rearranged,his,collection,of,paintings,by,george,stubbs,so,often,that,the,walls,of,his,house,became,peppered,with,holes,[END]
a,beautiful,portrait,of,the,famous,horse,eclipse,was,balanced,perilously,on,a,stack,of,books,scarlett,noticed,[END]
it,made,no,difference,to,her,she,wanted,to,know,about,rhett,[END]
i'll,go,ahead,and,ask,she,decided,[END]
bart,won't,remember,anyhow,[END]
did,rhett,say,anything,about,me,[END]
morland,blinked,his,mind,on,the,filly's,forebears,[END]
then,her,question,registered,[END]
oh,yes,he,asked,me,if,you,might,possibly,sell,half,moon,[END]
he's,thinking,about,starting,up,the,dunmore,hunt,again,[END]
he,wants,me,to,keep,my,eye,open,for,any,more,like,half,moon,too,[END]
he'll,have,to,come,back,to,buy,them,i,guess,scarlett,said,praying,for,affirmation,[END]
bart's,answer,sunk,her,in,despair,[END]
no,he'll,have,to,trust,me,[END]
his,wife's,expecting,you,see,and,he,won't,leave,her,side,[END]
but,now,that,i'll,be,aiming,you,at,the,cream,of,the,crop,i,couldn't,help,rhett,anyhow,[END]
i'll,write,and,tell,him,so,as,soon,as,i,find,the,time,[END]
scarlett,was,so,preoccupied,with,bart's,news,that,he,had,to,shake,her,arm,to,get,her,attention,[END]
when,did,she,want,to,start,the,search,for,her,hunters,he,asked,[END]
today,she,answered,[END]
throughout,the,winter,she,went,every,saturday,with,john,morland,to,one,hunt,or,another,in,county,meath,trying,out,hunters,that,were,for,sale,[END]
it,wasn't,easy,to,find,mounts,that,suited,her,for,she,demanded,that,the,horse,be,as,fearless,as,she,was,[END]
she,rode,as,if,demons,were,chasing,her,and,the,riding,eventually,made,it,possible,for,her,to,stop,imagining,rhett,as,father,to,any,child,but,cat,[END]
when,she,was,home,she,tried,to,give,the,little,girl,extra,attention,and,affection,[END]
as,usual,cat,scorned,embraces,[END]
but,she,would,listen,to,stories,about,the,horses,for,as,long,as,scarlett,would,talk,[END]
when,february,came,scarlett,turned,the,first,sod,with,the,same,happy,excitement,as,in,earlier,years,[END]
she,had,succeeded,in,relegating,rhett,to,the,past,and,seldom,thought,of,him,at,all,[END]
it,was,a,new,year,full,of,good,things,to,come,[END]
if,charlotte,and,mrs,fitz,ever,got,finished,with,whatever,they,were,doing,to,her,house,she,might,even,be,able,to,give,a,party,[END]
she,missed,kathleen,and,the,rest,of,the,family,[END]
pegeen,made,visits,so,uncomfortable,that,she,almost,never,saw,her,cousins,any,more,[END]
that,could,wait,it,would,have,to,[END]
there,was,planting,to,be,done,[END]
in,june,scarlett,spent,a,long,exhausting,day,being,measured,by,the,dressmaker,charlotte,montague,had,brought,over,from,dublin,[END]
mrs,sims,was,merciless,[END]
scarlett,had,to,hold,her,arms,up,out,in,front,at,her,sides,one,up,one,down,one,forward,one,back,in,every,imaginable,position,and,some,she,would,never,have,imagined,[END]
for,what,seemed,like,hours,[END]
then,the,same,thing,sitting,[END]
then,in,every,position,of,the,quadrille,the,waltz,the,cotillion,[END]
the,only,thing,she,didn't,measure,me,for,was,my,shroud,scarlett,groaned,[END]
charlotte,montague,gave,one,of,her,infrequent,smiles,[END]
she,probably,did,without,your,knowing,it,[END]
daisy,sims,is,very,thorough,[END]
i,refuse,to,believe,that,terrifying,woman's,name,is,daisy,scarlett,said,[END]
don't,you,ever,call,her,that,unless,she,invites,you,to,[END]
no,one,below,the,rank,of,duchess,is,ever,allowed,to,be,familiar,with,daisy,[END]
she's,the,best,at,her,trade,they,wouldn't,dare,risk,offending,her,[END]
you,called,her,daisy,[END]
i'm,the,best,at,my,trade,too,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
she,liked,charlotte,montague,and,respected,her,as,well,[END]
though,she,wouldn't,call,her,exactly,cozy,to,have,for,a,friend,[END]
she,put,on,her,peasant,clothes,then,and,had,supper,charlotte,reminded,her,it,was,dinner,before,she,went,out,to,the,hill,near,knightsbrook,river,for,the,lighting,of,the,midsummer,night,bonfire,[END]
when,she,was,dancing,to,the,familiar,music,of,the,fiddles,and,pipes,and,colum's,bodhran,she,thought,how,lucky,she,was,[END]
if,what,charlotte,had,promised,was,true,she,was,going,to,have,both,worlds,irish,and,anglo,[END]
poor,bart,she,remembered,wasn't,welcome,at,his,own,estate's,bonfire,[END]
scarlett,thought,of,her,good,fortune,again,when,she,presided,at,the,harvest,home,banquet,[END]
ballyhara,had,another,good,crop,not,as,good,as,the,two,previous,years,but,still,enough,to,make,every,man's,pocket,jingle,[END]
everyone,in,ballyhara,celebrated,their,good,fortune,[END]
everyone,except,colum,scarlett,noticed,[END]
he,looked,as,if,he,hadn't,slept,in,a,week,[END]
she,wished,she,could,ask,him,what,was,wrong,but,he'd,been,cross,as,a,bear,with,her,for,weeks,[END]
and,he,never,seemed,to,go,to,the,bar,any,more,according,to,mrs,fitz,[END]
well,she,wasn't,going,to,let,his,gloom,ruin,her,good,mood,[END]
harvest,home,was,a,party,[END]
also,the,hunting,season,would,be,starting,any,day,now,and,her,new,riding,habit,was,the,most,enchanting,design,scarlett,had,ever,seen,[END]
mrs,sims,was,everything,charlotte,had,said,she,was,[END]
if,you're,ready,we,will,take,a,tour,said,charlotte,montague,[END]
scarlett,put,down,her,teacup,[END]
she,was,more,eager,than,she,wanted,to,admit,[END]
mighty,kind,of,you,charlotte,seeing,as,how,every,door,except,my,rooms,has,been,locked,for,practically,a,year,[END]
she,sounded,as,cranky,as,she,could,but,she,suspected,that,charlotte,was,too,smart,to,be,fooled,[END]
i'll,just,find,cat,to,go,with,us,[END]
if,you,like,scarlett,but,she,saw,everything,as,it,was,done,[END]
she's,a,remarkable,child,just,appears,when,a,door,or,window,is,left,open,[END]
it,made,some,of,the,painters,quite,nervous,when,they,found,her,on,top,of,their,scaffolding,[END]
don't,tell,me,things,like,that,i'll,have,a,seizure,[END]
little,monkey,she,climbs,everything,[END]
scarlett,called,for,cat,and,looked,for,cat,to,no,avail,[END]
sometimes,the,little,girl's,independence,annoyed,her,like,now,[END]
usually,she,was,proud,[END]
i,guess,she'll,catch,up,with,us,if,she's,interested,she,said,at,last,[END]
let's,go,i'm,dying,to,see,[END]
might,as,well,admit,it,[END]
she,wasn't,fooling,anybody,[END]
charlotte,led,the,way,upstairs,first,to,long,corridors,lined,with,bedrooms,for,guests,then,back,down,again,to,what,scarlett,still,had,trouble,calling,the,first,floor,instead,of,in,american,usage,the,second,[END]
charlotte,took,her,to,the,end,of,the,house,away,from,the,rooms,she'd,been,using,[END]
your,bedroom,your,bath,your,boudoir,your,dressing,room,cat's,playroom,bedroom,nursery,[END]
the,doors,flew,open,as,charlotte,unveiled,her,labors,[END]
scarlett,was,enchanted,with,the,feminine,pale-green-and-gilt,furniture,in,her,rooms,and,the,frieze,of,alphabet,animal,paintings,in,cat's,playroom,[END]
the,child-size,chairs,and,tables,made,her,clap,her,hands,[END]
why,hadn't,she,thought,of,it,[END]
there,was,even,a,child-size,tea,set,on,cat's,table,and,a,child-size,chair,by,the,hearth,[END]
your,private,rooms,are,french,said,charlotte,louis,sixteenth,if,you,care,[END]
they,represent,your,robillard,self,[END]
your,o'hara,self,dominates,the,reception,rooms,on,the,ground,floor,[END]
the,only,ground,floor,room,that,scarlett,knew,was,the,marblefloored,hall,[END]
she,used,its,door,to,the,drive,and,the,broad,stone,staircase,to,the,upper,floors,[END]
charlotte,montague,led,her,quickly,through,it,[END]
she,opened,tall,double,doors,on,one,side,of,it,and,ushered,scarlett,into,the,dining,room,[END]
my,stars,scarlett,exclaimed,i,don't,know,enough,people,to,fill,up,all,those,chairs,[END]
you,will,said,charlotte,[END]
she,led,scarlett,through,the,long,room,to,another,tall,door,[END]
now,this,is,your,breakfast,room,and,morning,room,[END]
you,may,want,to,have,dinner,in,here,as,well,when,you,are,a,small,number,[END]
she,walked,across,the,room,to,more,doors,[END]
the,great,salon,and,ballroom,she,announced,[END]
i,admit,to,being,very,pleased,with,this,[END]
one,long,wall,was,made,up,of,widely,spaced,french,doors,with,tall,gilt,mirrors,between,them,[END]
the,wall,opposite,was,centered,by,a,fireplace,surmounted,by,another,gilt-framed,mirror,[END]
all,the,mirrors,were,infinitesimally,tilted,so,that,they,reflected,not,only,the,room,but,also,the,high,ceiling,[END]
it,was,painted,with,scenes,from,the,heroic,legends,of,irish,history,[END]
the,high,kings',buildings,on,the,hill,of,tara,looked,rather,like,roman,temples,[END]
scarlett,loved,it,[END]
the,furniture,throughout,this,floor,is,irish-made,so,are,the,fabrics,all,wools,and,linens,and,the,silver,china,glass,almost,everything,[END]
this,is,where,the,o'hara,is,hostess,[END]
come,there's,only,the,library,still,to,see,[END]
scarlett,liked,the,leather-covered,chairs,and,chesterfield,and,she,recognized,that,the,leather-backed,books,were,very,handsome,[END]
you've,done,a,wonderful,job,charlotte,she,said,sincerely,[END]
yes,well,it,wasn't,as,difficult,as,at,first,i,feared,[END]
the,people,who,lived,here,must,have,used,a,capability,brown,design,for,the,gardens,so,there,was,only,pruning,and,cleaning,to,do,[END]
the,kitchen,garden,will,be,very,productive,next,year,though,it,may,be,two,years,before,the,wall,fruits,come,back,[END]
they,had,to,be,pruned,back,to,leaders,[END]
scarlett,hadn't,the,remotest,idea,what,charlotte,was,talking,about,nor,the,faintest,interest,[END]
she,was,wishing,gerald,o'hara,could,see,the,ceiling,in,the,ballroom,and,ellen,o'hara,could,admire,the,furniture,in,her,boudoir,[END]
charlotte,opened,more,doors,[END]
here,we,are,in,the,hall,again,she,said,[END]
excellent,circular,movement,for,large,parties,[END]
the,georgian,architects,knew,precisely,what,they,were,doing,[END]
come,through,to,the,entrance,door,scarlett,[END]
she,escorted,scarlett,onto,the,top,of,the,steps,that,led,down,to,the,freshly,gravelled,drive,[END]
your,staff,mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
my,grief,scarlett,said,weakly,[END]
two,long,rows,of,uniformed,servants,were,facing,her,[END]
to,her,right,mrs,fitzpatrick,stood,slightly,in,front,of,the,cook,four,kitchen,maids,two,parlor,maids,four,upstairs,maids,three,dairymaids,the,head,laundress,and,three,laundry,maids,[END]
to,her,left,she,saw,a,haughty-looking,man,who,could,only,be,a,butler,eight,footmen,two,nervous-footed,boys,the,stableman,she,knew,and,six,grooms,and,five,men,she,guessed,were,gardeners,by,their,earth-stained,hands,[END]
i,believe,i,need,to,sit,down,she,whispered,[END]
first,you,smile,and,welcome,them,to,ballyhara,charlotte,said,[END]
her,tone,would,permit,no,remonstrance,[END]
scarlett,did,as,she,was,told,[END]
back,inside,the,house,which,had,now,become,an,establishment,scarlett,began,to,giggle,[END]
they're,all,better,dressed,than,i,am,she,said,[END]
she,looked,at,charlotte,montague's,expressionless,face,[END]
you're,about,to,bust,out,laughing,charlotte,you,can't,fool,me,[END]
you,and,mrs,fitz,must,have,had,a,high,old,time,planning,this,[END]
we,did,rather,charlotte,admitted,[END]
a,smile,was,the,nearest,thing,to,bust,out,laughing,that,scarlett,could,get,from,her,[END]
scarlett,invited,all,the,people,from,ballyhara,and,adamstown,to,come,up,to,see,the,revived,big,house,[END]
the,long,dining,room,table,was,spread,with,refreshments,and,she,darted,from,room,to,room,urging,everyone,to,help,themselves,dragging,them,to,see,the,high,kings,[END]
charlotte,montague,stood,quietly,to,one,side,of,the,big,staircase,quietly,disapproving,[END]
scarlett,ignored,her,[END]
she,tried,to,ignore,the,discomfort,and,embarrassment,of,her,cousins,and,villagers,but,within,a,half,hour,of,their,arrival,she,was,close,to,tears,[END]
it,goes,against,tradition,mrs,o,rosaleen,fitzpatrick,murmured,to,her,it's,naught,to,do,with,you,[END]
no,farmer's,boot,has,ever,crossed,the,threshold,of,a,big,house,in,ireland,[END]
we're,a,people,ruled,by,the,old,ways,and,we're,not,ready,for,change,[END]
but,i,thought,the,fenians,wanted,to,change,everything,[END]
mrs,fitz,sighed,[END]
that,is,so,[END]
but,the,change,is,for,a,return,to,even,older,ways,than,the,ones,that,keep,the,boots,out,of,a,big,house,[END]
i,wish,i,could,explain,more,clearly,[END]
don't,bother,mrs,fitz,[END]
i've,just,made,a,mistake,that's,all,[END]
i,won't,do,it,again,[END]
it,was,the,error,of,a,generous,heart,[END]
take,credit,for,that,[END]
scarlett,forced,a,smile,[END]
but,she,was,bewildered,and,upset,[END]
what,was,the,point,of,having,all,these,irish-decorated,rooms,if,the,irish,didn't,feel,comfortable,in,them,[END]
and,why,did,her,own,cousins,treat,her,like,a,stranger,in,her,own,house,[END]
after,everyone,left,and,the,servants,removed,all,traces,of,the,party,scarlett,went,from,room,to,room,alone,[END]
well,i,like,it,she,decided,[END]
i,like,it,a,lot,[END]
it,was,she,thought,a,damn,sight,prettier,than,dunmore,landing,would,ever,be,or,ever,was,[END]
she,stood,in,the,midst,of,the,reflected,images,of,the,high,kings,and,imagined,rhett,there,with,her,full,of,envy,and,admiration,[END]
it,would,be,years,from,now,when,cat,was,grown,and,he,would,be,heartsick,that,he,had,missed,seeing,his,daughter,grow,up,to,become,the,beautiful,heiress,of,the,home,of,the,o'haras,[END]
scarlett,ran,to,the,stairs,and,up,them,and,through,the,corridor,to,cat's,room,[END]
hello,said,cat,[END]
she,was,sitting,at,her,little,table,carefully,pouring,milk,into,a,cup,for,her,big,tabby,[END]
ocras,was,watching,attentively,from,his,commanding,position,in,the,center,of,the,table,[END]
sit,down,momma,cat,invited,[END]
scarlett,lowered,herself,onto,a,small,chair,[END]
if,only,rhett,were,there,to,join,the,tea,party,[END]
but,he,wasn't,and,he,never,would,be,and,she,had,to,accept,it,[END]
he,would,have,tea,parties,with,his,other,child,his,other,children,by,anne,[END]
scarlett,resisted,the,impulse,to,grab,cat,in,her,arms,[END]
i'd,like,two,lumps,of,sugar,please,miss,o'hara,she,said,[END]
that,night,scarlett,couldn't,sleep,[END]
she,sat,upright,in,the,center,of,her,exquisite,french,bed,with,her,silk-covered,eiderdown,wrapped,closely,around,her,for,warmth,[END]
but,the,warmth,and,comfort,she,wanted,was,to,feel,rhett's,arms,around,her,to,hear,his,deep,voice,mocking,the,disastrous,party,until,she,could,laugh,at,it,and,at,the,error,of,giving,it,[END]
she,wanted,comfort,for,her,disappointment,[END]
she,wanted,love,grown-up,caring,and,understanding,[END]
her,heart,had,learned,to,love,it,was,overflowing,with,love,and,she,had,nowhere,to,spend,it,[END]
damn,rhett,for,getting,in,the,way,[END]
why,couldn't,she,love,bart,morland,[END]
he,was,kind,he,was,attractive,scarlett,enjoyed,being,with,him,[END]
if,she,really,wanted,him,she,didn't,doubt,for,a,minute,that,she,could,make,him,forget,grace,hastings,[END]
but,she,didn't,want,him,that,was,the,problem,[END]
she,didn't,want,anybody,except,rhett,[END]
it's,not,fair,[END]
she,thought,like,a,child,[END]
and,like,a,child,eventually,she,cried,herself,to,sleep,[END]
when,she,woke,she,was,in,control,of,herself,once,more,[END]
so,what,if,everyone,had,hated,her,party,[END]
so,what,if,colum,hadn't,stayed,more,than,ten,minutes,[END]
she,had,other,friends,and,she,was,going,to,make,lots,more,[END]
now,that,the,house,was,finally,done,charlotte,was,busy,as,a,spider,spinning,a,web,with,plans,about,the,future,[END]
and,in,the,meantime,the,weather,was,perfect,for,hunting,and,mrs,sims,had,made,a,tremendously,becoming,riding,habit,for,her,[END]
76,[END]
scarlett,rode,to,sir,john,morland's,hunt,in,style,[END]
she,was,riding,a,saddle,horse,and,was,accompanied,by,two,grooms,leading,half,moon,and,comet,one,of,her,new,hunters,[END]
the,skirts,of,her,new,habit,flowed,elegantly,over,her,new,sidesaddle,and,she,was,very,pleased,with,herself,[END]
she,had,had,to,fight,mrs,sims,like,a,tiger,but,she,had,won,[END]
no,corsets,[END]
charlotte,had,been,amazed,[END]
no,one,she,said,ever,argued,with,daisy,sims,and,won,[END]
no,one,till,me,maybe,scarlett,thought,[END]
i,won,the,argument,with,charlotte,too,[END]
bart,morland's,hunt,was,no,place,for,scarlett,to,make,her,emergence,into,the,world,of,irish,society,said,charlotte,[END]
he,himself,was,beyond,reproach,and,except,for,his,lack,of,money,one,of,the,most,eligible,bachelors,around,[END]
but,he,didn't,keep,a,grand,household,at,all,[END]
the,footmen,at,his,breakfasts,were,really,stable,grooms,in,livery,for,a,few,hours,[END]
charlotte,had,secured,a,much,more,important,invitation,for,scarlett,[END]
it,would,do,exactly,what,was,needed,to,prepare,for,her,real,debut,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,possibly,go,first,to,morland,hall,instead,of,charlotte's,selection,[END]
i,can,and,i,will,scarlett,said,firmly,[END]
bart,is,my,friend,[END]
she,repeated,it,until,charlotte,gave,in,[END]
she,didn't,tell,charlotte,the,rest,[END]
she,needed,to,go,someplace,where,she,felt,at,least,a,little,bit,comfortable,[END]
now,that,it,was,getting,close,the,prospect,of,society,scared,her,even,more,than,it,enticed,her,[END]
she,kept,thinking,of,what,mammy,had,said,about,her,once,just,a,mule,in,horse's,harness,[END]
as,the,paris-inspired,wardrobe,from,mrs,sims,came,into,the,house,scarlett,thought,of,the,saying,more,and,more,often,[END]
she,could,imagine,hundreds,of,lords,and,ladies,and,earls,and,countesses,whispering,it,when,she,went,to,her,first,important,party,[END]
bart,i'm,glad,to,see,you,[END]
i'm,glad,to,see,you,too,scarlett,[END]

i've,been,lion-hunting,[END]
i'm,proud,as,lucifer,[END]
scarlett,smiled,graciously,at,the,young,member,of,parliament,for,county,meath,[END]
he,was,very,handsome,she,thought,even,though,usually,she,didn't,much,like,men,who,wore,beards,even,well-trimmed,ones,like,this,mr,parnell,[END]
she'd,heard,the,name,before,oh,yes,at,bart's,breakfast,[END]
she,remembered,now,[END]
colum,really,detested,this,parnell,[END]
she'd,have,to,pay,attention,so,she,could,tell,colum,all,about,him,[END]
after,the,hunt,[END]
for,now,half,moon,was,eager,to,go,and,so,was,she,[END]
i,can't,for,the,life,of,me,understand,how,you,can,be,so,stubborn,colum,[END]
scarlett,had,passed,from,enthusiasm,to,explanation,to,rage,[END]
you've,never,even,bothered,to,go,hear,the,man,speak,for,pity's,sake,[END]
well,i,heard,him,he,was,fascinating,everybody,was,hanging,on,his,every,word,[END]
and,he,wants,exactly,what,you,always,talked,about,ireland,for,the,irish,and,no,evictions,and,even,no,rent,and,no,landlords,[END]
what,more,can,you,ask,[END]
colum's,patience,cracked,[END]
i,can,ask,that,you,not,be,such,a,trusting,fool,[END]
do,you,not,know,that,your,mr,parnell,is,a,landlord,himself,[END]
and,a,protestant,[END]
and,educated,at,the,english,oxford,university,[END]
he's,looking,for,votes,not,justice,[END]
the,man's,a,politician,and,his,home,rule,policy,that,you've,swallowed,for,the,sugar,coating,of,his,earnest,manner,and,handsome,face,is,nothing,more,nor,less,than,a,stick,for,him,to,shake,at,the,english,and,a,carrot,to,tempt,the,poor,ignorant,irish,donkey,[END]
there's,simply,no,talking,to,you,[END]
why,he,said,right,out,that,he,supports,the,fenians,[END]
colum,grabbed,scarlett's,arm,[END]

she,jerked,away,from,him,[END]
of,course,not,[END]
you,take,me,for,a,fool,and,lecture,me,like,i'm,a,fool,but,i,am,not,a,fool,[END]
and,i,know,this,much,[END]
there's,no,reason,to,smuggle,in,guns,and,start,a,war,if,you,can,get,what,you,want,without,it,[END]
i,lived,through,a,war,that,a,bunch,of,hotheads,started,because,of,some,high-faluting,principles,[END]
all,it,did,was,kill,most,of,my,friends,and,ruin,everything,[END]
for,nothing,[END]
i'm,telling,you,right,now,colum,o'hara,there's,a,way,to,get,ireland,back,for,the,irish,without,killing,and,burning,and,that's,what,i'm,for,[END]

scarlett,didn't,press,him,she,had,gotten,what,she,wanted,[END]
before,she,went,home,she,detoured,to,the,little,chapel,and,made,confession,to,father,flynn,[END]
losing,her,temper,with,colum,was,of,it,but,not,the,main,part,[END]
she,was,there,to,be,absolved,of,the,sin,that,made,her,own,blood,run,cold,[END]
she,had,thanked,god,when,john,morland,told,her,that,six,months,earlier,rhett's,wife,had,lost,her,baby,[END]
not,long,after,scarlett,left,colum,o'hara,entered,the,confessional,[END]
he,had,lied,to,her,a,heavy,sin,[END]
after,doing,his,penance,he,went,to,the,arsenal,in,the,anglican,church,to,make,sure,the,arms,were,sufficiently,well,concealed,in,the,event,she,decided,to,investigate,[END]
charlotte,montague,and,scarlett,left,for,the,house,party,that,was,scarlett's,debut,after,she,went,to,early,mass,on,sunday,[END]
the,party,was,to,last,a,week,[END]
scarlett,didn't,like,being,away,from,cat,for,so,long,but,the,birthday,party,was,only,just,over,mrs,[END]
fitz,was,still,in,a,tight-lipped,fury,about,the,damage,all,the,running,children,had,done,to,the,parquet,in,the,ballroom,and,she,was,certain,that,cat,wouldn't,miss,her,[END]
with,all,the,new,furnishings,to,inspect,and,new,servants,to,investigate,cat,was,a,very,busy,little,girl,[END]
scarlett,charlotte,and,evans,charlotte's,maid,rode,in,scarlett's,elegant,brougham,to,the,train,station,in,trim,[END]
the,house,party,was,in,county,monaghan,too,far,to,go,by,road,[END]
scarlett,was,more,excited,than,nervous,[END]
going,to,john,morland's,first,had,been,a,good,idea,[END]
charlotte,was,nervous,enough,for,both,of,them,although,it,didn't,show,scarlett's,future,in,the,fashionable,world,would,be,decided,by,the,way,she,impressed,people,this,week,[END]
charlotte's,future,also,[END]
she,glanced,at,scarlett,to,reassure,herself,[END]
yes,she,looked,lovely,in,her,green,merino,travelling,costume,[END]
those,eyes,of,hers,were,a,gift,from,god,so,distinctive,and,memorable,[END]
and,her,slim,uncorseted,body,was,sure,to,set,tongues,wagging,and,the,pulses,of,men,racing,[END]
she,looked,precisely,like,what,charlotte,had,insinuated,to,chosen,friends,a,beautiful,not-too-young,american,widow,with,fresh,colonial,looks,and,charm,somewhat,gauche,but,refreshing,as,a,result,romantically,irish,as,only,a,foreigner,could,be,substantially,perhaps,even,phenomenally,wealthy,so,much,so,that,she,could,afford,to,be,a,free,spirit,well,bred,with,an,aristocratic,french,bloodline,but,vigorous,and,exuberant,from,her,american,background,unpredictable,but,well-mannered,naive,yet,experienced,all,in,all,an,intriguing,and,amusing,addition,to,the,circles,of,people,who,knew,too,much,about,one,another,and,were,avid,for,someone,new,to,talk,about,[END]
perhaps,i,should,tell,you,again,who,is,likely,to,be,at,the,party,charlotte,suggested,[END]
please,don't,charlotte,i'll,forget,again,anyhow,[END]
besides,i,know,the,important,part,[END]
a,duke,is,more,important,than,a,marquess,then,comes,an,earl,and,after,that,viscount,baron,and,baronet,[END]
i,may,call,all,the,men,sir',just,like,in,the,south,so,i,needn't,worry,about,that,milord',and,your,grace',business,but,i,must,never,call,the,ladies,ma'am',the,way,we,do,in,america,because,that's,reserved,for,queen,victoria,and,she's,definitely,not,going,to,be,there,[END]
so,unless,i'm,asked,to,use,the,christian,name,i,just,smile,and,avoid,using,anything,[END]
a,plain,old,mister',or,miss',is,hardly,worth,bothering,with,at,all,unless,they're,honourable,',[END]
i,do,think,that's,funny,[END]
why,not,respectable',or,something,else,like,that,[END]
charlotte,shuddered,inside,[END]
scarlett,was,too,confident,too,breezy,[END]
you,haven't,paid,attention,scarlett,[END]
there,are,some,names,with,no,title,at,all,not,even,honourable,',that,are,equally,as,important,as,any,non-royal,dukes,[END]
the,herberts,burkes,clarkes,lefroys,blennerhassetts,[END]

charlotte,stopped,[END]
what,would,be,would,be,[END]
the,house,was,an,immense,gothic-style,structure,with,turrets,and,towers,stained-glass,windows,as,tall,as,a,cathedral's,corridors,that,extended,for,more,than,a,hundred,yards,[END]
scarlett's,confidence,ebbed,when,she,saw,it,[END]
you're,the,o'hara,she,reminded,herself,and,she,marched,up,the,stone,entrance,steps,with,her,chin,at,an,angle,that,dared,anyone,to,challenge,her,[END]
by,the,end,of,dinner,that,night,she,was,smiling,at,everyone,even,the,footman,behind,her,tall-backed,chair,[END]
the,food,was,excellent,copious,exquisitely,presented,but,scarlett,barely,tasted,it,[END]
she,was,feasting,on,admiration,[END]
there,were,forty-six,guests,in,the,house,party,and,they,all,wanted,to,know,her,[END]
and,on,new,year's,day,i,have,to,knock,on,every,single,door,in,the,town,go,in,go,out,go,in,again,and,drink,a,cup,of,tea,[END]
i,declare,i,don't,know,why,i,don't,turn,yellow,as,a,chinaman,drinking,half,the,tea,in,china,the,way,i,do,she,said,gaily,to,the,man,on,her,left,[END]
he,was,fascinated,by,the,duties,of,the,o'hara,[END]
when,the,hostess,turned,the,table,scarlett,enchanted,the,retired,general,on,her,right,with,a,day-by-day,account,of,the,siege,of,atlanta,[END]
her,southern,accent,was,not,at,all,what,one,expected,an,american,to,sound,like,they,reported,later,to,anyone,who'd,listen,and,she's,a,damn'd,intelligent,woman,[END]
she,was,also,a,damn'd,attractive,woman,[END]
the,excessively,big,diamond-and-emerald,engagement,ring,she'd,received,from,rhett,sparkled,impressively,on,her,bare-but-not-too-bare,bosom,[END]
charlotte,had,ordered,it,remade,into,a,pendant,that,hung,from,a,white,gold,chain,so,fine,that,it,was,nearly,invisible,[END]
after,dinner,scarlett,played,whist,with,her,customary,skill,[END]
her,partner,won,enough,money,to,cover,her,losses,at,three,previous,house,parties,and,scarlett,became,a,sought-after,companion,among,ladies,as,well,as,gentlemen,[END]
the,following,morning,and,for,five,mornings,after,there,was,a,hunt,[END]
even,on,a,mount,from,her,host's,stables,scarlett,was,adept,and,fearless,[END]
her,success,was,assured,[END]
the,anglo-irish,gentry,as,a,whole,admired,nothing,quite,as,much,as,they,did,a,fine,rider,[END]
charlotte,montague,had,to,be,vigilant,or,she'd,be,caught,looking,like,a,cat,who'd,just,finished,a,bowl,of,thick,cream,[END]
did,you,enjoy,yourself,[END]
she,asked,scarlett,on,the,way,back,to,ballyhara,[END]
every,minute,charlotte,[END]
bless,you,for,getting,me,invited,[END]
everything,was,perfect,[END]
it's,so,thoughtful,having,those,sandwiches,in,the,bedroom,[END]
i,always,get,hungry,late,at,night,i,guess,everybody,does,[END]
charlotte,laughed,until,her,eyes,were,streaming,with,tears,[END]
it,made,scarlett,hurry,[END]
i,don't,see,what's,so,funny,about,a,healthy,appetite,[END]
with,the,card,game,lasting,until,all,hours,it's,a,long,time,after,dinner,when,you,go,to,bed,[END]
when,charlotte,could,speak,she,explained,[END]
at,the,more,sophisticated,houses,the,ladies',bedrooms,were,supplied,with,a,plate,of,sandwiches,that,could,be,used,as,a,signal,to,admirers,[END]
set,on,the,floor,of,the,corridor,outside,a,lady's,room,the,sandwiches,were,an,invitation,for,a,man,to,come,in,[END]
scarlett,blushed,crimson,[END]
my,grief,charlotte,i,ate,every,crumb,[END]
what,must,the,maids,think,[END]
not,just,the,maids,scarlett,[END]
everyone,in,the,house,party,must,be,wondering,who,the,fortunate,man,was,[END]
or,men,[END]
naturally,no,gentleman,would,claim,the,title,or,he,wouldn't,be,a,gentleman,[END]
i'll,never,be,able,to,look,anyone,in,the,face,again,[END]
that's,the,most,scandalous,thing,i,ever,heard,[END]
it's,disgusting,[END]
and,i,thought,they,were,all,such,nice,people,[END]
but,my,dear,child,it's,precisely,the,nice,people,who,devise,these,discretions,[END]
everyone,knows,the,rules,and,no,one,refers,to,them,[END]
people's,amusements,are,their,own,secrets,unless,they,choose,to,tell,[END]
scarlett,was,about,to,say,that,where,she,came,from,people,were,honest,and,decent,[END]
then,she,remembered,sally,brewton,in,charleston,[END]
sally,had,talked,the,same,way,all,about,discretion,and,amusements,as,if,infidelity,and,promiscuity,were,a,normal,accepted,thing,[END]
charlotte,montague,smiled,complacently,[END]
if,any,one,thing,had,been,needed,to,create,a,legend,for,scarlett,o'hara,the,mistake,about,the,sandwiches,had,accomplished,it,[END]
now,she'd,be,known,as,refreshingly,colonial,but,satisfactorily,sophisticated,[END]
charlotte,began,to,make,preliminary,schedules,in,her,mind,for,her,retirement,[END]
only,a,few,more,months,to,go,and,she'd,never,again,suffer,through,boredom,at,a,fashionable,party,of,any,kind,[END]
i,shall,arrange,for,delivery,of,the,irish,times,every,day,she,said,to,scarlett,and,you,must,study,every,word,in,it,[END]
everyone,you,will,meet,in,dublin,will,expect,you,to,be,familiar,with,the,news,it,reports,[END]
dublin,[END]
you,didn't,tell,me,we,were,going,to,dublin,[END]
didn't,i,[END]
i,thought,surely,i,had,[END]
i,do,apologize,scarlett,[END]
dublin,is,the,center,of,everything,you,will,love,it,[END]
it's,a,real,city,not,an,overgrown,country,town,like,drogheda,or,galway,[END]
and,the,castle,is,the,most,thrilling,thing,you,will,ever,experience,in,your,entire,life,[END]
a,castle,[END]
not,a,ruin,[END]
i,didn't,know,there,was,such,a,thing,[END]
does,the,queen,live,there,[END]
no,thank,heaven,[END]
the,queen,is,a,fine,ruler,but,an,extremely,dull,woman,[END]
no,the,castle,in,dublin,is,ruled,by,her,majesty's,representative,the,viceroy,[END]
you,will,be,presented,to,him,and,to,the,vicereine,in,the,throne,room,[END]
mrs,montague,painted,a,word,picture,for,scarlett,of,pomp,and,splendor,beyond,anything,she'd,ever,heard,of,[END]
it,made,charleston's,saint,cecilia,sound,like,nothing,at,all,[END]
and,it,made,scarlett,want,success,in,dublin,society,with,all,her,heart,[END]
that,would,put,rhett,butler,in,his,place,[END]
he,wouldn't,be,important,to,her,at,all,[END]
it,was,safe,to,tell,her,now,charlotte,thought,[END]
after,this,week's,success,the,invitation,will,surely,come,[END]
there's,no,longer,a,chance,that,i'll,lose,the,deposit,on,the,suite,at,the,shelbourne,that,i,booked,for,the,season,when,i,got,scarlett's,note,last,year,[END]
where's,my,precious,cat,[END]
scarlett,called,when,she,ran,into,the,house,[END]
momma's,home,sweetheart,[END]
she,found,cat,after,a,half,hour's,search,in,the,stables,sitting,atop,half,moon,[END]
she,looked,frighteningly,small,on,the,big,horse,[END]
scarlett,muted,her,voice,so,that,she,wouldn't,spook,half,moon,[END]
come,to,momma,darling,and,give,me,a,hug,[END]
her,heart,thumped,out,of,rhythm,while,she,watched,her,child,jump,down,into,the,straw,near,the,powerful,metal-shod,hooves,[END]
cat,was,out,of,scarlett's,sight,until,her,small,dark,face,popped,up,over,the,half,door,to,the,stall,[END]
she,was,climbing,it,not,opening,it,[END]
scarlett,knelt,to,catch,her,in,an,embrace,[END]
oh,i'm,so,happy,to,see,you,angel,[END]
i,missed,you,a,lot,[END]
did,you,miss,me,[END]
yes,[END]
cat,wriggled,out,of,her,arms,[END]
well,at,least,she,missed,me,she's,never,said,that,before,[END]
scarlett,stood,up,when,the,warm,surge,of,love,for,cat,subsided,into,the,total,devotion,that,was,her,habitual,emotion,[END]
i,didn't,know,you,liked,horses,kitty,cat,[END]
i,do,[END]
i,like,animals,[END]
scarlett,forced,herself,to,sound,cheerful,[END]
would,you,like,to,have,a,pony,of,your,own,[END]
the,right,size,for,a,little,girl,[END]
i,won't,let,myself,think,of,bonnie,i,won't,[END]
i,promised,that,i,wouldn't,hobble,cat,or,wrap,her,in,cottonwool,because,i,lost,bonnie,in,the,accident,[END]
i,promised,cat,when,she,was,fresh,born,that,i'd,let,her,be,whoever,she,turned,out,to,be,that,i'd,give,her,all,the,freedom,a,free,spirit,needs,to,have,[END]
i,didn't,know,it,would,be,so,hard,that,i'd,want,to,protect,her,every,single,minute,[END]
but,i've,got,to,keep,my,promise,[END]
i,know,it,was,right,[END]
she'll,have,a,pony,if,she,wants,one,and,she'll,learn,to,jump,and,i'll,make,myself,watch,if,it,kills,me,[END]
i,love,cat,too,much,to,hem,her,in,[END]
scarlett,had,no,way,of,knowing,that,cat,had,walked,down,to,ballyhara,town,while,she,was,away,[END]
three,now,cat,was,becoming,interested,in,other,children,and,games,[END]
she,went,looking,for,some,of,the,playmates,who'd,been,at,her,birthday,party,[END]
a,group,of,four,or,five,little,boys,were,playing,in,the,wide,street,[END]
when,she,walked,oward,them,they,ran,away,[END]
two,stopped,long,enough,to,scoop,up,rocks,and,throw,them,at,her,[END]
cailleach,[END]
cailleach,[END]
they,screamed,in,terror,[END]
they'd,learned,the,word,from,their,mothers,the,gaelic,for,witch,[END]
cat,looked,up,at,her,mother,[END]
yes,i'd,like,a,pony,she,said,[END]
ponies,didn't,throw,things,[END]
she,considered,telling,her,mother,about,the,boys,asking,her,about,the,word,[END]
cat,liked,to,learn,new,words,[END]
but,she,didn't,like,that,word,[END]
she,wouldn't,ask,[END]
i'd,like,a,pony,today,[END]
i,can't,find,a,pony,today,baby,[END]
i'll,start,looking,tomorrow,[END]
i,promise,[END]
let's,go,home,now,and,have,tea,[END]
with,cakes,[END]
definitely,with,cakes,[END]
up,in,their,rooms,scarlett,got,out,of,her,beautiful,travelling,suit,as,quickly,as,she,could,[END]
she,felt,an,undefined,need,to,wear,her,shirt,and,skirt,and,bright,peasant,stockings,[END]
by,mid-december,scarlett,was,pacing,the,long,hallways,of,the,big,house,like,a,caged,animal,[END]
she,had,forgotten,how,much,she,hated,the,dark,short,wet,days,of,winter,[END]
she,thought,about,going,down,to,kennedy's,several,times,but,ever,since,her,unfortunate,party,for,all,the,townspeople,she,no,longer,felt,as,easy,with,them,as,once,she,had,[END]
she,rode,a,little,bit,[END]
it,wasn't,necessary,the,grooms,kept,all,the,horses,exercised,[END]
but,she,needed,to,be,out,even,in,the,ice-filled,rain,[END]
when,there,were,a,few,hours,of,sun,she,watched,while,cat,rode,her,shetland,pony,in,great,joyful,loops,across,the,frozen,meadow,[END]
scarlett,knew,it,was,bad,for,next,summer's,grass,but,cat,was,as,restless,as,she,was,[END]
it,was,all,scarlett,could,do,to,persuade,her,to,stay,indoors,even,in,the,kitchen,or,the,stables,[END]
on,christmas,eve,cat,lit,the,christ,child,candle,and,then,all,the,candles,she,could,reach,on,the,christmas,tree,[END]
colum,held,her,up,to,reach,the,higher,ones,[END]
outlandish,english,custom,he,said,[END]
you'll,probably,burn,your,house,to,the,ground,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,bright,decorations,and,glowing,candles,on,the,tree,[END]
i,think,it's,very,pretty,even,if,the,queen,of,england,did,start,the,fashion,she,said,[END]
besides,i've,got,holly,over,all,the,windows,and,doors,too,colum,so,it's,irish,everywhere,in,ballyhara,except,this,room,[END]
don't,be,such,a,grumpy,[END]
colum,laughed,[END]
cat,o'hara,did,you,know,your,godfather,was,a,grumpy,[END]
today,yes,said,cat,[END]
this,time,colum's,laugh,wasn't,forced,[END]
out,of,the,mouths,of,babes,he,said,[END]
it's,my,fault,for,asking,[END]
he,helped,scarlett,bring,out,cat's,present,after,she,fell,asleep,[END]
it,was,a,full-size,stuffed,toy,pony,on,rockers,[END]
on,christmas,morning,cat,looked,at,it,with,scorn,[END]
it's,not,real,[END]
it's,a,toy,darling,for,indoors,in,this,nasty,weather,[END]
cat,climbed,on,it,and,rocked,[END]
she,conceded,that,for,a,pony,that,wasn't,real,it,was,not,a,bad,toy,[END]
scarlett,breathed,a,sigh,of,relief,[END]
she,wouldn't,feel,quite,so,guilty,now,when,she,went,to,dublin,[END]
she,was,to,meet,charlotte,at,the,gresham,hotel,there,the,day,after,new,year's,harm,brack,and,tea,[END]
77,[END]
scarlett,had,no,idea,dublin,was,so,near,[END]
it,seemed,she,was,barely,settled,in,the,train,at,trim,before,dublin,was,announced,[END]
evans,charlotte,montague's,maid,met,her,and,directed,a,porter,to,take,her,cases,[END]
then,follow,me,if,you,please,mrs,o'hara,evans,said,and,walked,off,[END]
scarlett,had,trouble,keeping,up,with,her,because,of,the,hurrying,crowds,in,the,station,[END]
it,was,the,biggest,building,scarlett,had,ever,seen,and,the,busiest,[END]
but,nothing,like,as,busy,as,dublin's,streets,[END]
scarlett,pressed,her,nose,to,the,window,of,the,hackney,in,her,excitement,[END]
charlotte,was,right,she,was,going,to,love,dublin,[END]
all,too,soon,the,hackney,stopped,[END]
scarlett,stepped,down,helped,by,a,lavishly,uniformed,attendant,[END]
she,was,staring,at,a,passing,horse-drawn,tram,when,evans,touched,her,arm,[END]
this,way,please,[END]
charlotte,was,waiting,for,her,behind,a,tea,table,in,the,sitting,room,of,their,suite,of,rooms,[END]
charlotte,[END]
scarlett,exclaimed,i,saw,a,streetcar,with,an,upstairs,and,a,downstairs,and,both,of,them,packed,full,[END]
good,afternoon,to,you,too,scarlett,[END]
i'm,pleased,that,dublin,pleases,you,[END]
give,evans,your,wraps,and,come,and,have,tea,[END]
we,have,a,great,deal,to,do,[END]
that,evening,mrs,sims,arrived,with,three,assistants,carrying,muslin-wrapped,gowns,and,dresses,[END]
scarlett,stood,and,moved,as,ordered,while,mrs,sims,and,mrs,montague,discussed,every,detail,of,every,garment,[END]
each,evening,gown,was,more,elegant,than,the,one,that,preceded,it,[END]
scarlett,preened,before,the,pier,glass,when,she,wasn't,being,prodded,and,pinched,by,mrs,sims,[END]
when,the,dressmaker,and,her,woman,left,scarlett,discovered,suddenly,that,she,was,exhausted,[END]
she,was,happy,to,agree,when,charlotte,suggested,they,dine,in,the,suite,and,she,ate,ravenously,[END]
do,not,gain,so,much,as,a,millimeter,around,the,middle,scarlett,or,you'll,have,to,be,fitted,all,over,again,charlotte,warned,[END]
i'll,run,it,all,off,shopping,scarlett,said,[END]
she,buttered,another,piece,of,bread,[END]
i,saw,at,least,eight,shop,windows,that,looked,wonderful,on,the,drive,from,the,station,[END]
charlotte,smiled,indulgently,[END]
she'd,receive,a,very,welcome,commission,from,every,shop,scarlett,patronized,[END]
you'll,have,all,the,shopping,your,heart,desires,i,can,promise,you,that,[END]
but,only,in,the,afternoons,[END]
in,the,mornings,you'll,be,sitting,for,your,portrait,[END]
that's,nonsense,charlotte,[END]
what,do,i,want,with,a,portrait,of,myself,[END]
i,had,one,done,once,and,i,hated,it,[END]
i,looked,mean,as,a,snake,[END]
you,will,not,look,mean,in,this,one,take,my,word,[END]
monsieur,hervé,is,an,expert,at,ladies,[END]
and,the,portrait,is,important,[END]
it,must,be,done,[END]
i'll,do,it,because,i,do,everything,you,say,but,i,won't,like,it,take,my,word,[END]
the,next,morning,scarlett,was,awakened,by,the,sound,of,traffic,[END]
it,was,still,dark,but,street,lamps,showed,her,four,lines,of,wagons,and,drays,and,carriages,of,every,description,moving,along,the,street,below,her,bedroom,window,[END]
no,wonder,dublin,has,such,wide,streets,she,thought,happily,almost,everything,in,ireland,with,wheels,on,it,is,here,[END]
she,sniffed,sniffed,again,[END]
i,must,be,going,crazy,[END]
i,could,swear,i,smell,coffee,[END]
fingers,tapped,gently,on,her,door,[END]
breakfast,is,in,the,sitting,room,when,you're,ready,said,charlotte,[END]
i've,sent,the,waiter,away,all,you,need,is,a,wrapper,[END]
scarlett,nearly,knocked,mrs,montague,down,opening,the,door,[END]
coffee,[END]
if,you,knew,how,much,i've,missed,coffee,[END]
oh,charlotte,why,didn't,you,tell,me,they,drink,coffee,in,dublin,[END]
i'd,have,taken,e,train,every,morning,just,for,breakfast,[END]
the,coffee,tasted,even,better,than,it,smelled,[END]
luckily,charlotte,preferred,tea,because,scarlett,drank,the,entire,pot,[END]
then,she,obediently,put,on,the,silk,stockings,and,combinations,charlotte,unpacked,from,a,box,[END]
she,felt,quite,wicked,[END]
the,light,slippery,undergarments,were,altogether,different,from,the,batiste,or,muslin,she'd,worn,all,her,life,[END]
she,tied,her,wool,dressing,gown,tightly,around,her,when,evans,came,in,with,a,woman,she'd,never,seen,before,[END]
this,is,serafina,said,charlotte,[END]
she's,italian,so,don't,be,concerned,if,you,don't,understand,a,word,she,says,[END]
she's,going,to,do,your,hair,[END]
all,you,have,to,do,is,sit,still,and,let,her,talk,to,herself,[END]
she's,having,a,one-way,conversation,with,every,hair,on,my,head,thought,scarlett,after,nearly,an,hour,[END]
her,neck,was,getting,stiff,and,she,hadn't,the,faintest,idea,what,the,woman,was,doing,to,her,[END]
charlotte,had,seated,her,near,the,window,in,the,sitting,room,where,the,morning,light,was,strongest,[END]
mrs,sims,and,one,assistant,looked,as,impatient,as,scarlett,felt,[END]
they'd,arrived,twenty,minutes,earlier,[END]
ecco,[END]
said,serafina,[END]
benissimo,said,mrs,montague,[END]
now,said,mrs,sims,[END]
her,assistant,lifted,the,muslin,wrap,from,the,gown,mrs,sims,was,holding,[END]
scarlett,drew,in,her,breath,[END]
the,white,satin,glistened,in,the,light,and,the,light,made,the,silver,embroidery,shine,as,if,it,were,a,living,thing,[END]
it,was,a,fantasy,of,a,gown,[END]
scarlett,stood,her,hands,reached,out,to,touch,it,[END]
gloves,first,mrs,sims,commanded,[END]
every,finger,would,leave,a,mark,[END]
scarlett,saw,that,the,dressmaker,was,wearing,white,kid,gloves,[END]
she,took,the,pristine,long,gloves,charlotte,was,holding,out,to,her,[END]
they,were,already,folded,back,and,powdered,for,her,to,get,them,on,without,stretching,[END]
when,she,had,smoothed,them,all,the,way,up,charlotte,used,a,small,silver,buttonhook,with,rapid,competence,serafina,dropped,a,silk,handkerchief,over,her,head,and,removed,her,wrapper,and,then,mrs,sims,lowered,the,dress,onto,scarlett's,upraised,arms,and,onto,her,body,[END]
while,she,fastened,the,back,serafina,deftly,removed,the,handkerchief,and,made,a,few,delicate,touches,to,scarlett's,hair,[END]
there,was,a,knock,at,the,door,[END]
well,timed,said,mrs,montague,[END]
that,will,be,monsieur,hervé,[END]
we'll,want,mrs,o'hara,over,here,mrs,[END]
sims,[END]
charlotte,led,scarlett,to,the,center,of,the,room,[END]
scarlett,could,hear,her,opening,the,door,and,speaking,in,a,low,voice,[END]
i,suppose,she's,talking,french,and,expects,me,to,[END]
no,charlotte,must,know,me,better,than,that,by,now,[END]
i,wish,i,had,a,looking,glass,i,want,to,see,the,gown,on,me,[END]
she,lifted,one,foot,then,the,other,when,mrs,sims',assistant,tapped,her,toes,[END]
she,couldn't,see,the,slippers,the,woman,slipped,onto,her,feet,mrs,sims,was,poking,her,in,the,shoulder,blades,and,his,sing,at,her,about,standing,up,straight,[END]
the,assistant,fiddled,with,the,bottom,of,her,skirt,[END]
mrs,o'hara,said,charlotte,montague,please,allow,me,to,present,monsieur,françois,hervé,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,rotund,bald,man,who,walked,in,front,of,her,and,bowed,[END]
how,do,you,do,she,said,[END]
was,she,supposed,to,shake,hands,with,a,painter,[END]
fantastique,said,the,painter,[END]
he,snapped,his,fingers,[END]
two,men,carried,the,enormous,pier,glass,to,a,spot,between,the,windows,[END]
when,they,stepped,away,scarlett,saw,herself,[END]
the,white,satin,gown,was,more,décolleté,than,she'd,realized,[END]
she,stared,at,the,daring,expanse,of,bosom,and,shoulder,[END]
then,at,the,reflection,of,a,woman,she,hardly,recognized,[END]
her,hair,was,piled,high,on,her,head,in,a,mass,of,curls,and,tendrils,so,artful,that,they,looked,almost,happenstance,[END]
the,white,satin,glimmered,the,narrow,length,of,her,body,and,a,silver-encrusted,white,satin,train,spread,in,a,sinuous,semicircle,around,the,white,satin,slippers,with,silver,heels,[END]
why,i,look,like,grandma,robillard's,portrait,more,than,i,look,like,me,[END]
the,years,of,habitual,girlishness,fell,away,[END]
she,was,looking,at,a,woman,not,the,flirtatious,belle,of,clayton,county,[END]
and,she,liked,what,she,saw,very,much,[END]
she,was,mystified,and,excited,by,this,stranger,[END]
her,soft,lips,quivered,faintly,at,the,corners,and,her,tilted,eyes,took,on,a,deeper,more,mysterious,sheen,[END]
her,chin,lifted,in,supreme,self-confidence,and,she,looked,directly,into,her,own,eyes,with,challenge,and,approval,[END]
that's,it,whispered,charlotte,montague,to,herself,[END]
that's,the,woman,to,take,all,ireland,by,storm,[END]
the,whole,world,if,she,wants,it,[END]
easel,murmured,the,artist,[END]
quickly,you,cretins,[END]
i,shall,do,portrait,that,will,make,me,famous,[END]
i,don't,understand,it,scarlett,said,to,charlotte,after,the,siting,[END]
it's,like,i,never,saw,that,person,before,in,my,life,yet,i,knew,[END]
i'm,confused,charlotte,[END]
my,dear,child,that,is,the,beginning,of,wisdom,[END]
charlotte,do,let's,ride,one,of,those,darling,trams,scarlett,begged,[END]
i,deserve,a,reward,after,standing,like,a,statue,for,hours,on,end,[END]
it,had,been,a,long,sitting,charlotte,agreed,future,ones,would,probably,be,shorter,[END]
for,one,thing,it,would,likely,rain,and,without,good,light,m,hervé,wouldn't,be,able,to,paint,[END]
then,you,agree,[END]
we'll,take,the,tram,[END]
charlotte,nodded,[END]
scarlett,felt,like,hugging,her,but,charlotte,montague,wasn't,that,kind,of,person,[END]
and,in,an,undefined,way,neither,was,she,any,longer,scarlett,felt,[END]
the,view,of,herself,as,a,woman,no,longer,a,girl,had,thrilled,her,but,unsettled,her,too,[END]
it,was,going,to,take,some,getting,used,to,[END]
they,climbed,the,iron,spiral,to,the,upper,level,of,the,tram,[END]
it,was,exposed,and,very,cold,but,the,view,was,superb,[END]
scarlett,looked,on,all,sides,at,the,city,the,crowded,wide,streets,the,swarming,wide,sidewalks,[END]
dublin,was,the,first,real,city,she'd,ever,seen,[END]
it,had,a,population,of,more,than,a,quarter,million,people,[END]
atlanta,was,a,boomtown,of,twenty,thousand,[END]
the,tram,moved,on,its,tracks,through,the,traffic,with,inexorable,right,of,way,[END]
pedestrians,and,vehicles,scattered,hastily,at,the,last,minute,as,it,approached,[END]
frenzied,and,noisy,the,narrow,escapes,delighted,scarlett,[END]
then,she,saw,the,river,[END]
the,tram,stopped,on,the,bridge,and,she,could,see,along,the,liffey,[END]
bridge,after,bridge,after,bridge,all,different,all,teeming,with,traffic,[END]
the,quays,enticing,with,shop,fronts,and,crowds,[END]
the,water,bright,in,the,sunlight,[END]
the,liffey,was,left,behind,the,tram,was,suddenly,in,shadow,tall,buildings,were,near,on,both,sides,[END]
scarlett,felt,the,chill,[END]
we'd,better,go,down,at,the,next,stop,said,charlotte,[END]
we,get,off,at,the,following,one,[END]
she,led,the,way,[END]
after,they,crossed,a,bedlam,intersection,charlotte,gestured,toward,the,street,that,curved,ahead,of,them,[END]
grafton,street,she,said,as,if,she,were,making,an,introduction,[END]
we'll,want,to,take,a,hackney,back,to,the,gresham,but,on,foot,is,the,only,way,to,see,the,shops,[END]
would,you,like,coffee,before,we,begin,[END]
you,should,become,acquainted,with,bewley's,[END]
i,don't,know,charlotte,[END]
i,might,just,take,a,look,inside,this,shop,first,[END]
that,fan,in,the,window,see,the,one,in,that,back,corner,with,the,pink,tassels,it's,the,most,adorable,thing,[END]
oh,and,that,chinesey,one,i,didn't,see,that,at,first,[END]
and,that,precious,pomander,[END]
look,charlotte,at,the,embroidery,on,those,gloves,[END]
have,you,ever,[END]
oh,my,goodness,[END]
charlotte,nodded,at,the,liveried,door,attendant,[END]
he,pulled,the,door,wide,and,bowed,[END]
she,didn't,mention,that,there,were,at,least,four,more,shops,on,grafton,street,with,hundreds,of,fans,and,gloves,[END]
charlotte,was,quite,sure,that,scarlett,would,discover,for,herself,that,a,major,attribute,of,a,major,city,is,an,infinite,spectrum,of,temptation,[END]
after,ten,days,of,sittings,and,fittings,and,shopping,scarlett,went,home,to,ballyhara,with,dozens,of,presents,for,cat,several,gifts,for,mrs,fitz,and,colum,ten,pounds,of,coffee,and,a,coffee,maker,for,herself,[END]
she,was,in,love,with,dublin,and,could,hardly,wait,to,return,[END]
at,ballyhara,her,cat,was,waiting,[END]
as,soon,as,the,train,left,the,city,scarlett,was,in,a,fever,to,get,home,[END]
she,had,so,many,things,to,tell,cat,so,many,plans,for,the,time,when,she'd,take,her,funny,little,monkey,of,a,country,child,to,the,city,[END]
she,had,to,hold,her,after-mass,office,hours,too,[END]
she'd,delayed,them,for,a,week,already,[END]
and,soon,it,would,be,saint,brigid's,day,[END]
scarlett,thought,that,was,the,best,of,all,the,moment,when,the,year,really,began,with,the,turning,of,the,first,sod,[END]
how,very,very,lucky,she,was,[END]
she,had,both,country,and,city,the,o'hara,and,that,still,unknown,woman,in,the,pier,glass,[END]
scarlett,left,cat,engrossed,in,a,picture,book,of,animals,her,other,presents,still,unwrapped,[END]
she,ran,down,the,drive,to,colum's,gatehouse,with,the,cashmere,muffler,she'd,brought,him,and,all,her,impressions,of,dublin,to,share,[END]
oh,i'm,sorry,she,said,when,she,saw,that,he,had,a,guest,[END]
the,well-dressed,man,was,a,stranger,to,her,[END]
not,at,all,not,at,all,said,colum,[END]
come,meet,john,devoy,[END]
he's,just,in,from,america,[END]
devoy,was,polite,but,clearly,not,pleased,to,be,interrupted,[END]
scarlett,made,her,excuses,left,colum's,gift,and,walked,home,briskly,[END]
now,what,kind,of,american,comes,to,an,out-of-the-way,place,like,ballyhara,and,isn't,pleased,to,meet,another,american,[END]
he,must,be,one,of,colum's,fenians,that's,it,[END]
and,he's,annoyed,because,colun,isn't,part,of,that,crazy,revolution,thing,any,more,[END]
the,reverse,was,the,truth,[END]
john,devoy,was,seriously,leaning,towards,support,for,parnell,and,he,was,one,of,the,most,influential,american,fenians,[END]
if,he,abandoned,support,for,the,revolution,the,blow,would,be,nearly,mortal,[END]
colum,argued,passionately,against,home,rule,long,into,the,night,[END]
the,man,wants,power,and,will,use,any,treachery,to,get,it,he,said,about,parnell,[END]
what,about,you,colum,[END]
devoy,retorted,[END]
sounds,to,me,like,you,can't,stand,a,better,man,getting,your,job,done,and,done,better,[END]
colum's,reply,was,immediate,[END]
he'll,make,speeches,in,london,till,hell,freezes,and,he'll,win,headlines,in,all,the,newspapers,but,we'll,still,be,left,with,starving,irish,under,the,boots,of,the,english,[END]
the,irish,people,will,win,nothing,at,all,[END]
and,when,they,tire,of,mr,parnell's,headlines,they'll,revolt,[END]
with,no,organization,and,no,hope,of,success,[END]
i,tell,you,devoy,we're,waiting,too,long,[END]
parnell,talks,you,talk,i,talk,and,all,the,while,the,irish,suffer,[END]
after,devoy,went,to,kennedy's,inn,for,the,night,colum,paced,his,small,sitting,room,until,the,oil,in,the,lamp,burned,out,[END]
then,he,sat,in,the,cold,darkness,on,a,stool,by,the,dying,embers,on,the,hearth,[END]
brooding,on,devoy's,angry,outburst,[END]
could,the,man,be,right,[END]
was,power,the,motive,and,not,love,for,ireland,[END]
how,could,a,man,know,the,truth,of,his,own,soul,[END]
thin,watery,sunlight,shone,briefly,as,scarlett,drove,a,spade,into,the,earth,on,saint,brigid's,day,[END]
it,was,a,good,omen,for,the,year,to,come,[END]
to,celebrate,she,treated,everyone,in,ballyhara,town,to,porter,and,meat,pies,at,kennedy's,[END]
it,was,going,to,be,the,best,year,of,all,she,was,sure,of,it,[END]
the,next,day,she,went,to,dublin,for,the,six,weeks,known,as,the,castle,season,[END]
78,[END]
she,and,charlotte,had,a,suite,of,rooms,at,the,shelbourne,hotel,this,time,not,the,gresham,[END]
the,shelbourne,was,the,place,to,stay,in,dublin,for,the,season,[END]
scarlett,hadn't,gone,inside,the,imposing,brick,building,on,her,previous,visit,to,dublin,[END]
we,choose,the,occasion,to,be,seen,charlotte,told,her,[END]
now,she,gazed,around,the,huge,hall,inside,the,entrance,and,understood,why,charlotte,wanted,them,to,be,here,[END]
everything,was,imposingly,grand,the,space,the,staff,the,guests,the,controlled,hushed,busyness,[END]
she,lifted,her,chin,then,followed,the,porter,up,the,half-flight,to,the,first,floor,the,most,desirable,of,desirables,[END]
though,scarlett,did,not,know,it,she,looked,exactly,like,charlotte's,description,to,the,doorman,[END]
you,will,know,her,at,once,[END]
she,is,extremely,beautiful,and,she,carries,her,head,like,an,empress,[END]
in,addition,to,the,suite,a,private,drawing,room,was,reserved,for,scarlett's,use,[END]
charlotte,showed,it,to,her,before,they,went,down,for,tea,[END]
the,finished,portrait,stood,on,a,brass,easel,in,a,corner,of,the,green,brocaded,room,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,it,with,wonder,[END]
did,she,really,look,like,that,[END]
that,woman,wasn't,afraid,of,anything,and,she,felt,as,nervous,as,a,cat,[END]
she,followed,charlotte,downstairs,in,a,daze,[END]
charlotte,identified,some,of,the,people,at,other,tables,in,the,sumptuous,lounge,[END]
you'll,meet,them,all,eventually,[END]
after,you're,presented,you'll,serve,tea,and,coffee,in,your,drawing,room,every,afternoon,[END]
people,will,bring,people,to,meet,you,[END]
who,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,ask,[END]
who,will,bring,people,and,who,are,the,people,they'll,bring,[END]
but,she,didn't,bother,[END]
charlotte,always,knew,what,she,was,doing,[END]
the,only,thing,scarlett,needed,to,be,responsible,for,was,not,getting,tangled,up,in,her,train,when,she,backed,away,after,her,presentation,[END]
charlotte,and,mrs,sims,were,going,to,coach,her,with,a,practice,presentation,gown,every,day,until,the,day,[END]
the,heavy,white,envelope,bearing,the,chamberlain's,seal,was,delivered,to,the,hotel,the,day,after,scarlett,arrived,[END]
charlotte's,expression,gave,no,hint,of,how,relieved,she,was,[END]
one,never,knew,for,sure,about,best-laid,plans,[END]
she,opened,it,with,steady,fingers,[END]
first,drawing,room,she,said,as,expected,[END]
day,after,tomorrow,[END]
scarlett,waited,in,a,group,of,white-gowned,girls,and,women,on,the,landing,outside,the,closed,double,doors,to,the,throne,room,[END]
it,seemed,to,her,she'd,been,doing,nothing,but,waiting,for,a,hundred,years,[END]
why,on,earth,had,she,agreed,to,do,this,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,answer,her,own,question,it,was,too,complex,[END]
in,part,she,was,the,o'hara,determined,to,conquer,the,english,[END]
in,part,she,was,an,american,girl,dazzled,by,the,grandeur,of,the,british,empire's,royal,panoply,[END]
at,bottom,scarlett,had,never,in,her,life,backed,down,from,a,challenge,and,never,would,[END]
another,name,was,called,[END]
not,hers,[END]
god's,nightgown,[END]
were,they,going,to,make,her,be,last,[END]
charlotte,hadn't,warned,her,about,that,[END]
charlotte,hadn't,even,told,her,until,the,last,minute,that,she'd,be,alone,all,the,way,[END]
i'll,find,you,in,the,supper,room,after,the,drawing,room,is,over,[END]
that,was,a,fine,way,to,treat,her,throwing,her,to,the,wolves,like,that,[END]
she,stole,another,glance,down,her,front,[END]
she,was,terrified,that,she,might,just,fall,right,out,of,the,scandalously,low-cut,gown,[END]
that,would,really,make,this,what,had,charlotte,said,[END]
an,experience,to,remember,[END]
madam,the,o'hara,of,ballyhara,[END]
oh,lord,that's,me,[END]
she,repeated,charlotte,montague's,coaching,litany,to,herself,[END]
walk,forward,stop,outside,the,door,[END]
a,footman,will,lift,the,train,you,have,looped,over,your,left,arm,and,arrange,it,behind,you,[END]
the,gentleman,usher,will,open,the,doors,[END]
wait,for,him,to,announce,you,[END]
madam,the,o'hara,of,ballyhara,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,the,throne,room,[END]
well,pa,what,do,you,think,of,your,katie,scarlett,now,[END]
she,thought,[END]
i'm,going,to,stroll,along,that,fifty,miles,or,so,of,red,carpet,runner,and,kiss,the,viceroy,of,ireland,cousin,of,the,queen,of,england,[END]
she,glanced,at,the,majestically,dressed,gentleman,usher,and,her,right,eyelid,quivered,in,what,might,almost,have,been,a,conspiratorial,wink,[END]
the,o'hara,walked,like,an,empress,to,face,the,viceroy's,redbearded,magnificence,and,present,her,cheek,for,the,ceremonial,kiss,of,welcome,[END]
turn,to,the,vicereine,now,and,curtsey,[END]
back,straight,[END]
not,too,low,[END]
stand,up,[END]
now,back,back,back,three,steps,don't,worry,the,weight,of,the,train,holds,it,away,from,your,body,[END]
now,extend,your,left,arm,[END]
wait,[END]
let,the,footman,have,plenty,of,time,to,arrange,the,train,over,your,arm,[END]
now,turn,[END]
walk,out,[END]
scarlett's,knees,obligingly,waited,until,she,was,seated,at,one,of,the,supper,tables,before,they,started,trembling,[END]
charlotte,made,no,attempt,to,hide,her,satisfaction,[END]
she,entered,scarlett's,bedroom,with,the,stiff,squares,of,white,cardboard,fanned,in,her,hand,[END]
my,dear,scarlett,you,were,a,dazzling,success,[END]
these,invitations,arrived,before,even,i,was,up,and,dressed,[END]
state,ball,that's,quite,special,[END]
saint,patrick's,ball,that,was,to,be,expected,[END]
second,drawing,room,you'll,be,able,to,watch,other,people,running,the,gauntlet,[END]
and,a,small,dance,in,the,throne,room,[END]
three-fourths,of,the,peers,in,ireland,have,never,been,invited,to,one,of,the,small,dances,[END]
scarlett,giggled,[END]
the,terror,of,being,presented,was,behind,her,and,she,was,a,success,[END]
i,guess,i,won't,mind,now,that,i,spent,last,year's,wheat,crop,on,all,those,new,clothes,[END]
let's,go,shopping,today,and,spend,this,year's,crop,[END]
you,won't,have,time,[END]
eleven,gentlemen,including,the,gentleman,usher,have,written,to,ask,permission,to,call,on,you,[END]
plus,fourteen,ladies,with,their,daughters,[END]
tea,time,won't,be,long,enough,[END]
you'll,have,to,serve,coffee,and,tea,in,the,mornings,too,[END]
the,maids,are,opening,your,drawing,room,right,now,[END]
i,ordered,pink,flowers,so,wear,your,brown,and,rose,plaid,taffeta,for,the,morning,and,the,green,velvet,faced,in,pink,for,the,afternoon,[END]
evans,will,be,here,to,do,your,hair,as,soon,as,you're,up,[END]
scarlett,was,the,season's,hit,[END]
gentlemen,flocked,to,meet,the,rich,widow,who,was,also,mirabile,dictu,fantastically,beautiful,[END]
mothers,swarmed,her,private,reception,room,with,daughters,in,tow,to,meet,the,gentlemen,[END]
after,the,first,day,charlotte,never,ordered,flowers,again,[END]
admirers,sent,so,many,that,there,wasn't,room,for,all,of,them,[END]
many,of,the,bouquets,contained,leather,cases,from,dublin's,finest,jeweler,but,scarlett,reluctantly,returned,all,the,brooches,bracelets,rings,earrings,[END]
even,an,american,from,clayton,county,georgia,knows,that,you're,expected,to,pay,back,favors,she,told,charlotte,[END]
i,won't,be,obligated,to,anybody,not,that,way,[END]
her,goings,and,comings,were,reported,faithfully,and,sometimes,even,accurately,in,the,gossip,column,of,the,daily,irish,times,[END]
shop,owners,in,morning,coats,came,themselves,to,show,her,choice,items,they,hoped,she,might,like,and,she,defiantly,bought,herself,many,of,the,jewelry,pieces,she,had,refused,to,accept,[END]
the,viceroy,danced,with,her,twice,at,the,state,ball,[END]
all,the,guests,at,her,coffees,and,teas,admired,her,portrait,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,it,every,morning,and,every,afternoon,before,the,first,visitors,arrived,[END]
she,was,learning,herself,[END]
charlotte,montague,observed,the,metamorphosis,with,interest,[END]
the,practiced,flirt,vanished,replaced,by,a,serene,somewhat,amused,woman,who,had,only,to,turn,her,smoky,green,eyes,on,man,woman,or,child,to,draw,them,mesmerized,to,her,side,[END]
i,used,to,work,like,a,mule,to,be,charming,scarlett,thought,now,i,don't,do,anything,at,all,[END]
she,couldn't,understand,it,at,all,but,she,accepted,the,gift,of,it,with,simple,gratitude,[END]
did,you,say,two,hundred,people,charlotte,[END]
that's,what,you,call,a,small,dance,[END]
relatively,[END]
there,are,always,five,or,six,hundred,at,the,state,and,saint,patrick's,balls,and,more,than,a,thousand,at,the,drawing,rooms,[END]
you,certainly,already,know,at,least,half,the,people,who'll,be,there,probably,many,more,than,half,[END]
i,still,think,it's,tacky,that,you,weren't,invited,[END]
it's,the,way,things,are,[END]
i'm,not,offended,[END]
charlotte,was,anticipating,the,evening,with,pleasure,[END]
she,planned,to,go,over,her,account,book,[END]
scarlett's,success,and,scarlett's,extravagance,greatly,exceeded,even,charlotte's,most,optimistic,expectations,[END]
she,felt,like,a,nabob,and,she,liked,to,gloat,over,her,wealth,[END]
admission,to,the,coffee,hour,alone,was,bringing,in,gifts,of,almost,a,hundred,pounds,a,week,[END]
and,there,were,still,two,weeks,left,in,the,season,[END]
she,would,see,scarlett,off,to,her,privileged,evening,with,a,light,heart,[END]
scarlett,paused,in,the,doorway,of,the,throne,room,to,enjoy,the,spectacle,[END]
you,know,jeffrey,i,never,get,used,to,this,place,she,said,to,the,gentleman,usher,[END]
i'm,like,cinderella,at,the,ball,[END]
i'd,never,associate,you,with,cinderella,scarlett,he,said,adoringly,[END]
scarlett's,wink,had,put,his,shirt,in,her,pocket,when,she,entered,the,first,drawing,room,[END]
you'd,be,surprised,scarlett,said,[END]
she,nodded,absentmindedly,in,response,to,bows,and,smiles,from,familiar,faces,nearby,[END]
how,lovely,it,was,[END]
it,couldn't,be,real,she,couldn't,really,be,here,[END]
everything,had,happened,so,fast,she,needed,time,to,absorb,it,[END]
the,great,room,shimmered,gold,[END]
gilded,columns,supported,the,ceiling,gilded,flat,column,pilasters,filled,the,walls,between,the,tall,windows,draped,in,gold-fringed,crimson,velvet,[END]

gold,buttons,gold,epaulets,gold,frogging,gold,braid,gleamed,on,the,dress,uniforms,of,regimental,officers,and,the,court,uniforms,of,viceregal,officials,[END]
many,of,the,men,wore,bright,sashes,slashed,across,their,chests,pinned,with,jewelled,orders,the,viceroy's,knee,breeches,touched,the,garter,around,his,leg,[END]
the,men,were,almost,more,splendid,than,the,women,[END]
almost,but,not,quite,for,the,women,were,jewelled,at,neck,breast,ears,and,wrists,many,wore,tiaras,as,well,[END]
their,gowns,were,made,of,rich,materials,satin,velvet,brocade,silk,embroidered,often,in,glowing,silks,or,gold,and,silver,threads,[END]
a,body,could,get,blinded,just,looking,i'd,better,go,on,in,and,make,my,manners,[END]
scarlett,made,her,way,across,the,room,to,curtsey,to,the,viceregal,host,and,hostess,[END]
the,music,started,as,she,finished,[END]

a,gold-braided,red,arm,crooked,to,offer,support,for,her,hand,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
it,was,charles,ragland,[END]
she'd,met,him,at,a,house,party,and,he,had,called,on,her,every,day,since,her,arrival,in,dublin,[END]
he,made,no,secret,of,his,admiration,[END]
charles',handsome,face,blushed,every,time,she,spoke,to,him,[END]
he,was,awfully,sweet,and,attractive,even,though,he,was,an,english,soldier,[END]
they,weren't,at,all,like,yankees,no,matter,what,colum,said,[END]
for,one,thing,they,were,infinitely,better,dressed,[END]
she,rested,her,hand,lightly,on,ragland's,arm,and,he,escorted,her,into,the,pattern,of,the,quadrille,[END]
you,are,very,beautiful,tonight,scarlett,[END]
so,are,you,charles,[END]
i,was,just,thinking,that,the,men,are,more,dressed,up,than,the,ladies,[END]
thank,heaven,for,uniforms,[END]
knee,breeches,are,the,devil,to,wear,[END]
a,man,feels,a,perfect,fool,in,satin,shoes,[END]
serves,them,right,[END]
they've,been,peeking,at,ladies',ankles,for,ages,let,them,see,what,it,feels,like,when,we,ogle,their,legs,[END]
scarlett,you,shock,me,[END]
the,pattern,shifted,and,he,was,gone,[END]
i,probably,do,scarlett,thought,[END]
charles,was,as,innocent,as,a,schoolboy,sometimes,[END]
she,looked,up,at,her,new,partner,[END]
my,god,[END]
she,said,aloud,[END]
it,was,rhett,[END]
how,flattering,he,said,with,his,twisty,half,smile,[END]
no,one,else,smiled,like,that,[END]
scarlett,was,filled,with,light,with,lightness,[END]
she,felt,as,if,she,were,floating,above,the,polished,floor,buoyant,with,happiness,[END]
and,then,before,she,could,speak,again,the,quadrille,took,him,away,[END]
she,smiled,automatically,at,her,new,partner,[END]
the,love,burning,in,her,eyes,took,his,breath,away,[END]
her,mind,was,racing,why,is,rhett,here,[END]
could,it,be,because,he,wanted,to,see,me,[END]
because,he,had,to,see,me,because,he,couldn't,keep,away,[END]
the,quadrille,moved,at,its,stately,tempo,making,scarlett,frantic,with,impatience,[END]
when,it,ended,she,was,facing,charles,ragland,[END]
it,took,all,her,self-control,to,smile,and,thank,him,and,murmur,a,hasty,excuse,before,she,turned,to,search,for,rhett,[END]
her,eyes,met,his,almost,immediately,[END]
he,was,standing,only,an,arm's,length,away,[END]
scarlett's,pride,kept,her,from,reaching,out,to,him,[END]
he,knew,i'd,be,looking,for,him,she,thought,angrily,[END]
who,does,he,think,he,is,anyhow,to,come,strolling,into,my,world,and,just,stand,there,and,expect,me,to,fall,into,his,arms,[END]
there,are,plenty,of,men,in,dublin,in,this,room,even,who've,been,smothering,me,with,attention,hanging,around,my,drawing,room,sending,flowers,every,day,and,notes,and,even,jewelry,[END]
what,makes,mister,high,and,mighty,rhett,butler,think,that,all,he,has,to,do,is,lift,his,little,finger,and,i'll,come,running,[END]
what,a,pleasant,surprise,she,said,and,the,cool,tone,of,her,voice,pleased,her,[END]
rhett,held,out,his,hand,and,she,put,hers,in,it,without,thinking,[END]
may,i,have,this,dance,mrs,[END]
er,[END]
o'hara,[END]
scarlett,caught,her,breath,in,alarm,[END]
rhett,you're,not,going,to,tell,on,me,[END]
everybody,believes,i'm,a,widow,[END]
he,smiled,and,took,her,into,his,arms,as,the,music,began,[END]
your,secret,is,safe,with,me,scarlett,[END]
she,could,feel,the,rasp,of,his,voice,on,her,skin,and,his,warm,breath,[END]
it,made,her,weak,[END]
what,the,devil,are,you,doing,here,[END]
she,asked,[END]
she,had,to,know,[END]
his,hand,was,warm,at,her,waist,strong,supporting,directing,her,body,as,they,turned,[END]
unconsciously,scarlett,revelled,in,his,strength,and,rebelled,against,his,control,over,her,even,as,she,remembered,the,joy,of,following,his,steps,in,the,giddying,swirling,motion,of,the,waltz,[END]
rhett,chuckled,[END]
i,couldn't,resist,my,curiosity,he,said,[END]
i,was,in,london,on,business,and,everyone,was,talking,about,an,american,who,was,taking,dublin,castle,by,storm,[END]
could,that,be,scarlett,of,the,striped,stockings,',[END]
i,asked,myself,[END]
i,had,to,find,out,[END]
bart,morland,confirmed,my,suspicions,[END]
then,i,couldn't,get,him,to,stop,talking,about,you,[END]
he,even,made,me,ride,with,him,through,your,town,[END]
according,to,him,you,rebuilt,it,with,your,own,hands,[END]
his,eyes,raked,over,her,from,head,to,toe,[END]
you've,changed,scarlett,he,said,quietly,[END]
the,charming,girl,has,become,an,elegant,grown-up,woman,[END]
i,salute,you,i,really,do,[END]
the,unvarnished,honesty,and,warmth,of,his,voice,made,scarlett,forget,her,resentments,[END]
thank,you,rhett,she,said,[END]
are,you,happy,in,ireland,scarlett,[END]
yes,i,am,[END]
i'm,glad,[END]
his,words,were,rich,with,deeper,meaning,[END]
for,the,first,time,in,all,the,years,she'd,known,him,scarlett,understood,rhett,at,least,in,part,[END]
he,did,come,to,see,me,she,understood,he's,been,thinking,about,me,all,this,time,worrying,about,where,i'd,gone,and,how,i,was,[END]
he,never,stopped,caring,no,matter,what,he,said,[END]
he,loves,me,and,always,will,just,as,i'll,always,love,him,[END]
the,realization,filled,her,with,happiness,and,she,tasted,it,like,champagne,sipped,it,to,make,it,last,[END]
rhett,was,here,with,her,and,they,were,in,this,moment,closer,than,they,had,ever,been,[END]
an,aide-de-camp,approached,them,when,the,waltz,ended,[END]
his,excellency,requests,the,honor,of,the,next,dance,mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
rhett,raised,his,eyebrows,in,the,quizzical,mockery,scarlett,remembered,so,well,[END]
her,lips,curved,in,a,smile,for,him,alone,[END]
tell,his,excellency,that,i,will,be,delighted,she,said,[END]
she,looked,at,rhett,before,she,took,the,aide's,arm,[END]
in,clayton,county,she,murmured,to,rhett,we'd,say,that,i,was,in,high,cotton,[END]
she,heard,his,laughter,follow,her,as,she,walked,away,[END]
i'm,allowed,she,told,herself,and,she,looked,back,over,her,shoulder,to,see,him,laughing,[END]
it's,really,too,much,she,thought,it's,not,fair,at,all,[END]
he,even,looks,good,in,those,silly,satin,britches,and,shoes,[END]
her,green,eyes,sparkled,with,laughter,when,she,curtseyed,to,the,viceroy,before,they,began,to,dance,[END]
scarlett,felt,no,real,surprise,that,rhett,was,no,longer,there,when,she,looked,for,him,again,[END]
for,as,long,as,she,had,known,him,rhett,had,appeared,and,disappeared,without,explanation,[END]
i,shouldn't,have,been,surprised,to,see,him,here,tonight,she,thought,[END]
i,was,feeling,like,cinderella,why,shouldn't,the,only,prince,charming,i,want,be,here,[END]
she,could,feel,his,arms,around,her,as,if,he,had,left,a,mark,otherwise,it,would,be,easy,to,believe,that,she,had,made,it,all,up,the,gilded,room,the,music,his,presence,even,hers,[END]
when,she,returned,to,her,rooms,at,the,shelbourne,scarlett,turned,up,the,gas,and,stood,before,a,long,looking,glass,in,the,bright,light,to,look,at,herself,and,see,what,rhett,had,seen,[END]
she,looked,beautiful,and,sure,of,herself,like,her,portrait,like,the,portrait,of,her,grandmother,[END]
her,heart,began,to,ache,[END]
why,couldn't,she,be,like,the,other,portrait,of,grandma,robillard,[END]
the,one,in,which,she,was,soft,and,flushed,with,love,given,and,received,[END]
for,in,rhett's,caring,words,she,knew,there,had,also,been,sadness,and,farewell,[END]
in,the,middle,of,the,night,scarlett,o'hara,woke,in,her,luxurious,scented,room,on,the,best,floor,of,the,best,hotel,in,dublin,and,wept,with,racking,convulsive,sobs,[END]
if,only,[END]
repeated,again,and,again,in,her,head,like,a,battering,ram,[END]
79,[END]
the,night's,anguish,left,no,visible,marks,on,scarlett,[END]
her,face,was,smoothly,serene,the,next,morning,and,her,smiles,were,as,lovely,as,ever,when,she,poured,out,coffee,and,tea,for,the,men,and,women,who,crowded,her,drawing,room,[END]
sometime,during,the,dark,hours,of,the,night,she,had,found,the,courage,to,let,rhett,go,[END]
if,i,love,him,she,understood,i,must,not,try,to,hold,on,to,him,[END]
i,have,to,learn,to,give,him,his,freedom,just,the,way,i,try,to,give,cat,hers,because,i,love,her,[END]
i,wish,i,could,have,told,rhett,about,her,he'd,be,so,proud,of,her,[END]
i,wish,the,castle,season,was,over,[END]
i,miss,cat,dreadfully,[END]
i,wonder,what,she's,up,to,[END]
cat,was,running,with,the,strength,of,desperation,through,the,woods,at,ballyhara,[END]
the,ground,mists,of,morning,still,clung,in,places,and,she,couldn't,see,where,she,was,going,[END]
she,stumbled,and,fell,but,she,got,up,right,away,[END]
she,had,to,keep,running,even,though,she,was,short,of,breath,from,running,so,much,already,[END]
she,sensed,another,stone,coming,and,ducked,behind,the,protection,of,a,tree,trunk,[END]
the,boys,chasing,her,shouted,and,jeered,[END]
they,had,almost,caught,up,with,her,even,though,they'd,never,ventured,into,the,woods,near,the,big,house,before,[END]
it,was,safe,now,[END]
they,knew,the,o'hara,was,in,dublin,with,the,english,[END]
their,parents,talked,about,nothing,else,[END]
there,she,is,[END]
one,shouted,and,the,others,lifted,their,hands,to,throw,[END]
but,the,figure,stepping,from,behind,a,tree,was,not,cat,[END]
it,was,the,cailleach,with,a,gnarled,finger,pointing,[END]
the,boys,howled,with,fear,and,ran,[END]
come,with,me,said,grainne,[END]
i,will,give,you,some,tea,[END]
cat,put,her,hand,in,the,old,woman's,[END]
grainne,came,out,from,hiding,and,walked,very,slowly,and,cat,had,no,trouble,keeping,pace,with,her,[END]
will,there,be,cakes,[END]
cat,asked,[END]
there,will,said,the,cailleach,[END]
although,scarlett,grew,homesick,for,ballyhara,she,lasted,the,castle,season,out,[END]
she'd,given,charlotte,montague,her,word,[END]
it's,exactly,like,the,season,in,charleston,she,thought,[END]
why,is,it,i,wonder,that,fashionable,people,work,so,hard,at,having,fun,for,so,long,at,a,time,[END]
she,soared,from,success,to,even,greater,success,and,mrs,fitz,shrewdly,took,advantage,of,the,rapturous,paragraphs,in,the,irish,times,that,described,them,[END]
every,evening,she,took,the,newspaper,down,to,kennedy's,bar,to,show,the,people,of,ballyhara,how,famous,the,o'hara,was,[END]
day,by,day,grumbling,about,scarlett's,fondness,for,the,english,gave,way,to,pride,that,the,o'hara,was,more,admired,than,any,of,the,anglo,women,[END]
colum,did,not,applaud,rosaleen,fitzpatrick's,cleverness,[END]
his,mood,was,too,somber,for,him,to,see,the,humor,in,it,[END]
the,anglos,will,seduce,her,just,as,they're,doing,john,devoy,he,said,[END]
colum,was,both,wrong,and,right,[END]
no,one,in,dublin,wanted,scarlett,to,be,less,irish,[END]
it,was,a,large,part,of,her,attractiveness,[END]
the,o'hara,was,an,original,[END]
but,scarlett,had,discovered,an,unsettling,truth,[END]
the,anglo-irish,thought,of,themselves,as,being,just,as,irish,as,the,o'haras,of,adamstown,[END]
these,families,were,living,in,ireland,before,america,was,even,settled,charlotte,montague,said,one,day,in,irritation,[END]
how,can,you,call,them,anything,but,irish,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,unravel,the,complexities,so,she,stopped,trying,[END]
she,didn't,really,have,to,she,decided,[END]
she,could,have,both,worlds,the,ireland,of,ballyhara's,farms,and,the,ireland,of,dublin,castle,[END]
cat,would,have,them,too,when,she,grew,up,[END]
and,that's,much,better,than,she,would,have,had,if,i'd,stayed,in,charleston,scarlett,told,herself,firmly,[END]
when,the,saint,patrick's,ball,ended,at,four,in,the,morning,the,castle,season,was,over,[END]
the,next,event,was,some,miles,away,in,county,kildare,[END]
everyone,would,be,at,the,punchestown,races,charlotte,told,her,[END]
she'd,be,expected,to,be,there,[END]
scarlett,declined,[END]
i,love,racing,and,horses,charlotte,but,i'm,ready,to,go,home,now,[END]
i'm,late,already,with,this,month's,office,hours,[END]
i'll,pay,for,the,hotel,reservations,you,made,[END]
no,need,said,charlotte,[END]
she,could,sell,them,for,four,times,their,cost,[END]
and,she,herself,had,no,interest,in,horses,[END]
she,thanked,scarlett,for,making,her,an,independent,woman,[END]
you,are,independent,now,as,well,scarlett,[END]
you,don't,need,me,any,more,[END]
stay,on,mrs,sims',good,side,and,let,her,dress,you,[END]
the,shelbourne,has,reserved,your,rooms,for,next,year's,season,[END]
your,house,will,accommodate,all,the,guests,you,ever,want,to,have,and,your,housekeeper,is,the,most,professional,woman,i've,ever,met,in,that,position,[END]
you,are,in,the,world,now,[END]
do,with,it,what,you,will,[END]
what,will,you,do,charlotte,[END]
i,will,have,what,i,always,wanted,[END]
a,small,apartment,in,a,roman,palazzo,[END]
good,food,good,wine,and,day,after,day,of,sunlight,[END]
i,abhor,rain,[END]
even,charlotte,couldn't,complain,about,this,weather,scarlett,thought,[END]
the,spring,was,sunnier,than,anyone,could,remember,a,spring,ever,being,[END]
the,grass,was,tall,and,rich,and,the,wheat,planted,three,weeks,before,on,saint,patrick's,day,had,already,hazed,the,fields,with,tender,fresh,green,[END]
the,harvest,this,year,should,make,up,for,last,year's,disappointment,and,then,some,[END]
it,was,wonderful,to,be,home,[END]
how,is,ree,doing,[END]
she,asked,cat,[END]
it,was,just,like,her,daughter,to,name,the,small,shetland,pony,king,scarlett,thought,indulgently,[END]
cat,valued,her,loves,high,[END]
it,was,nice,too,that,cat,used,the,gaelic,word,[END]
she,liked,to,think,of,cat,as,a,true,irish,child,[END]
even,though,she,did,look,like,a,gypsy,[END]
her,black,hair,would,not,stay,neatly,in,its,braids,and,the,sunny,weather,had,browned,her,even,more,[END]
cat,took,off,hat,and,shoes,the,moment,she,got,outside,[END]
he,doesn't,like,it,when,i,ride,him,with,a,saddle,[END]
i,don't,like,it,either,[END]
bareback,is,better,[END]
no,you,don't,my,precious,[END]
you've,got,to,learn,to,ride,with,a,saddle,and,so,does,ree,[END]
be,thankful,it's,not,a,sidesaddle,[END]
the,one,you,have,for,hunting,[END]
yes,[END]
you'll,have,one,some,day,but,not,for,a,long,long,time,[END]
cat,would,be,four,in,october,not,all,that,much,younger,than,bonnie,was,when,she,had,her,fall,[END]
the,sidesaddle,could,wait,for,a,very,long,time,[END]
if,only,bonnie,had,been,astride,instead,of,still,learning,to,ride,sidesaddle,no,she,mustn't,think,like,that,[END]
if,only,could,break,your,heart,[END]
let's,ride,down,to,the,town,cat,would,you,like,that,[END]
we,could,go,see,colum,[END]
scarlett,was,worried,about,him,he,was,so,moody,these,days,[END]
cat,doesn't,like,town,[END]
can,we,ride,to,the,river,[END]
all,right,[END]
i,haven't,been,to,the,river,in,a,long,time,that's,a,good,idea,[END]
may,i,climb,up,in,the,tower,[END]
you,may,not,[END]
the,door's,too,high,and,it's,more,than,likely,full,of,bats,[END]
will,we,go,see,grainne,[END]
scarlett's,hands,tightened,on,her,reins,[END]
how,do,you,know,grainne,[END]
the,wise,woman,had,told,her,to,keep,cat,away,to,guard,her,close,to,home,[END]
who,had,taken,cat,there,[END]
and,why,[END]
she,gave,cat,some,milk,[END]
scarlett,didn't,care,for,the,sound,of,it,[END]
cat,only,referred,to,herself,in,the,third,person,when,something,made,her,nervous,or,angry,[END]
what,didn't,you,like,about,grainne,cat,[END]
she,thinks,cat,is,another,little,girl,named,dara,[END]
cat,told,her,but,she,didn't,hear,[END]
oh,honey,she,knows,it's,you,[END]
that's,a,very,special,name,she,gave,you,when,you,were,just,a,little,baby,[END]
it's,gaelic,like,the,names,you,gave,ree,and,ocras,[END]
dara,means,oak,tree,the,best,and,strongest,tree,of,all,[END]
that's,silly,[END]
a,girl,can't,be,a,tree,[END]
she,doesn't,have,leaves,[END]
scarlett,sighed,[END]
she,was,overjoyed,when,cat,wanted,to,talk,the,child,was,so,often,quiet,but,it,wasn't,always,easy,to,talk,to,her,[END]
she's,such,an,opinionated,little,thing,and,she,always,can,tell,when,you're,fudging,a,little,[END]
the,truth,the,whole,truth,or,she,gives,you,a,look,that,could,kill,[END]
look,cat,there's,the,tower,[END]
did,i,tell,you,the,story,how,old,it,is,[END]
yes,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,laugh,[END]
it,would,be,wrong,to,tell,a,child,to,lie,but,sometimes,a,polite,fib,would,be,welcome,[END]
i,like,the,tower,said,cat,[END]
i,do,too,sweetheart,[END]
scarlett,wondered,why,she,hadn't,come,here,for,so,long,[END]
she'd,almost,forgotten,how,strange,the,old,stones,made,her,feel,[END]
it,was,eerie,and,peaceful,at,the,same,time,[END]
she,made,a,promise,to,herself,not,to,let,so,many,months,slip,away,before,her,next,visit,[END]
this,was,after,all,the,real,heart,of,ballyhara,where,it,had,begun,[END]
the,blackthorn,was,already,blooming,in,the,hedges,and,it,was,still,april,[END]
what,a,season,they,were,having,[END]
scarlett,slowed,the,buggy,for,a,long,sniff,[END]
there,was,no,real,need,to,hurry,the,dresses,would,wait,[END]
she,was,driving,into,trim,for,a,package,of,summer,clothes,mrs,sims,had,sent,[END]
there,were,six,invitations,to,june,house,parties,on,her,desk,[END]
she,wasn't,sure,she,was,ready,to,start,partying,so,soon,but,she,was,ready,to,see,some,grown-ups,[END]
cat,was,her,heart,of,hearts,but,[END]
and,mrs,fitz,was,so,busy,running,the,big,household,that,she,never,had,time,for,a,friendly,cup,of,tea,[END]
colum,had,gone,to,galway,to,meet,stephen,[END]
she,didn't,know,how,she,felt,about,stephen,coming,to,ballyhara,[END]
spooky,stephen,[END]
maybe,he,wouldn't,be,so,spooky,in,ireland,[END]
maybe,he'd,just,been,so,strange,and,silent,in,savannah,because,he,was,mixed,up,in,the,gun,business,[END]
at,least,that,was,over,[END]
the,extra,income,she,was,getting,now,from,the,little,houses,in,atlanta,was,pleasant,too,[END]
she,must,have,given,the,fenians,a,fortune,[END]
much,better,spent,on,frocks,frocks,didn't,hurt,anyone,[END]
stephen,would,have,all,the,news,from,savannah,too,[END]
she,was,longing,to,know,how,everyone,was,[END]
maureen,was,just,as,bad,about,writing,letters,as,she,was,[END]
she,hadn't,heard,anything,about,the,savannah,o'haras,in,months,[END]
or,about,anyone,else,[END]
it,made,sense,that,when,she'd,made,the,decision,to,sell,up,in,atlanta,she'd,decided,to,put,everything,in,america,behind,her,and,never,look,back,[END]
still,it,would,be,nice,to,hear,about,atlanta,folks,[END]
she,knew,from,the,profits,she,was,making,that,the,little,houses,were,selling,so,ashley's,business,must,be,good,[END]
what,about,aunt,pittypat,though,[END]
and,india,[END]
had,she,dried,up,so,much,she,was,dust,[END]
and,all,those,people,who,had,once,been,so,important,to,her,so,long,ago,[END]
i,wish,i'd,kept,in,touch,with,the,aunts,myself,instead,of,leaving,money,with,my,lawyer,to,send,them,their,allowance,from,[END]
i,was,right,not,letting,them,know,where,i,was,i,was,right,to,protect,cat,from,rhett,[END]
but,maybe,he,wouldn't,do,anything,now,look,at,the,way,he,was,at,the,castle,[END]
if,i,write,to,eulalie,i'll,get,all,the,charleston,news,from,her,[END]
i'll,hear,about,rhett,[END]
could,i,bear,it,to,hear,that,he,and,anne,are,blissfully,happy,raising,racehorses,and,butler,babies,[END]
i,don't,believe,i,want,to,know,[END]
i'll,let,the,aunts,stay,like,they,are,[END]
all,i'd,get,anyhow,is,a,million,crossed,pages,of,lecturing,and,i,get,enough,lecturing,from,mrs,fitz,to,fill,that,hole,[END]
maybe,she's,right,about,giving,some,parties,it,is,a,shame,to,have,that,house,and,all,those,servants,standing,idle,[END]

i,don't,give,a,fig,what,anglo,mothers,do,i'm,not,going,to,have,a,nanny,running,cat's,life,[END]
i,see,little,enough,of,her,now,the,way,she's,always,off,at,the,stables,or,in,the,kitchen,or,wandering,over,the,place,or,up,a,tree,somewhere,[END]
and,the,idea,of,sending,her,away,to,some,convent,school,is,just,plain,crazy,[END]
when,she's,old,enough,the,school,in,ballyhara,will,do,just,fine,[END]
she'll,have,friends,there,too,[END]
it's,worrisome,to,me,sometimes,that,she,never,wants,to,play,with,any,other,children,what,on,earth,is,going,on,[END]
it's,not,market,day,[END]
why's,the,bridge,all,jammed,up,with,people,like,this,[END]
scarlett,leaned,down,from,the,buggy,and,touched,a,hurrying,woman,on,the,shoulder,[END]
what's,happening,[END]
the,woman,looked,up,[END]
her,eyes,were,bright,her,whole,face,excited,[END]
it's,a,flogging,[END]
better,hurry,or,you'll,miss,it,[END]
a,flogging,[END]
scarlett,didn't,want,to,see,some,poor,devil,of,a,soldier,being,whipped,[END]
she,had,an,idea,that,flogging,was,punishment,in,the,military,[END]
she,tried,to,turn,the,buggy,around,but,the,pushing,hurrying,mass,of,people,avid,to,see,the,spectacle,caught,her,up,in,their,press,[END]
her,horse,was,buffeted,her,buggy,rocked,and,pushed,[END]
the,only,thing,she,could,do,was,get,down,and,hold,the,bridle,soothe,the,horse,with,strokes,and,soft,sounds,walking,at,the,pace,of,the,people,around,her,[END]
when,forward,motion,stopped,scarlett,could,hear,the,whistling,of,the,lash,and,the,dreadful,liquid,sound,it,made,when,it,landed,[END]
she,wanted,to,cover,her,ears,but,she,needed,her,hands,to,gentle,the,frightened,horse,[END]
it,seemed,to,her,that,the,ghastly,noises,went,on,forever,[END]
one,hundred,[END]
that's,it,she,heard,then,the,groaning,disappointment,of,the,mob,[END]
she,held,tightly,on,to,the,bridle,the,pushing,and,shoving,was,worse,than,before,as,the,crowd,dispersed,[END]
she,didn't,shut,her,eyes,until,too,late,[END]
she'd,already,seen,the,mutilated,body,and,the,picture,was,burned,on,her,brain,[END]
he,was,tied,onto,an,upright,spoked,wheel,his,wrists,and,ankles,bound,with,leather,thongs,[END]
a,purple-stained,blue,shirt,hung,over,his,rough,woolen,pants,from,the,waist,baring,what,must,have,once,been,a,broad,back,[END]
now,it,was,a,giant,red,wound,with,loose,red,strips,of,flesh,and,skin,hanging,from,it,[END]
scarlett,turned,her,head,into,the,horse's,mane,[END]
she,felt,sick,[END]
her,horse,tossed,his,head,nervously,throwing,her,away,[END]
there,was,a,terrible,sweet,smell,in,the,air,[END]
she,heard,someone,vomiting,and,her,stomach,heaved,[END]
she,leaned,over,as,best,she,could,without,releasing,the,bridle,and,was,sick,onto,the,cobbles,[END]
all,right,then,lad,there's,no,shame,to,losing,your,breakfast,after,a,flogging,[END]
go,along,to,the,pub,and,have,a,large,whiskey,[END]
marbury'll,help,me,cut,him,down,[END]
scarlett,raised,her,head,to,look,at,the,speaker,a,british,soldier,in,the,uniform,of,a,sergeant,in,the,guards,[END]
he,was,talking,to,an,ashen-faced,private,[END]
the,private,stumbled,away,[END]
another,came,forward,to,assist,the,sergeant,[END]
they,cut,the,leather,from,behind,the,wheel,and,the,body,fell,into,the,bloodsoaked,mud,beneath,it,[END]
that,was,green,grass,last,week,scarlett,thought,[END]
this,can't,be,[END]
that's,meant,to,be,soft,green,grass,[END]
what,about,the,wife,sergeant,[END]
a,pair,of,soldiers,were,holding,the,arms,of,a,silent,straining,woman,in,a,hooded,black,cloak,[END]
let,her,go,[END]

the,cart,will,come,later,to,take,him,away,[END]
the,woman,ran,after,the,men,[END]
she,caught,the,sergeant's,goldstriped,sleeve,[END]
your,officer,promised,i,could,bury,him,she,cried,[END]
he,gave,me,his,word,[END]
the,sergeant,shoved,her,away,[END]
i,only,had,orders,for,the,flogging,the,rest,is,none,of,my,business,[END]
leave,me,be,woman,[END]
the,black-cloaked,figure,stood,alone,on,the,street,watching,the,soldiers,walk,into,the,bar,[END]
she,made,one,sound,a,shuddering,sob,[END]
then,she,turned,and,ran,to,the,wheel,the,blood-covered,body,[END]
danny,oh,danny,oh,my,dear,[END]
she,crouched,then,kneeled,in,the,ghastly,mud,trying,to,lift,torn,shoulders,and,lolling,head,into,her,lap,[END]
her,hood,fell,away,revealing,a,pale,fine-boned,face,neatly,chignoned,golden,hair,blue,eyes,in,shadowed,circles,of,grief,[END]
scarlett,was,frozen,in,place,[END]
to,move,to,clatter,wheels,over,cobbles,would,be,an,obscene,intrusion,on,the,woman's,tragedy,[END]
a,dirty,little,boy,ran,barefoot,across,the,square,[END]
can,i,have,a,button,or,something,lady,[END]
my,ma,wants,a,keepsake,[END]
he,shook,the,woman's,shoulder,[END]
scarlett,raced,over,the,cobbles,the,blood-spattered,grass,the,edge,of,the,churned,mud,[END]
she,grabbed,the,boy's,arm,[END]
he,looked,up,startled,mouth,gaping,[END]
scarlett,slapped,his,face,with,all,the,strength,in,her,arm,[END]
the,sound,of,it,was,like,the,crack,of,a,rifle,shot,[END]
get,out,of,here,you,filthy,little,devil,[END]
get,out,of,here,[END]
the,boy,ran,bawling,with,fear,[END]

she,was,in,it,now,scarlett,knew,[END]
she,had,to,do,what,little,could,be,done,[END]
i,know,a,doctor,in,trim,she,said,[END]
i'll,go,get,him,[END]
a,doctor,[END]
will,he,want,to,bleed,him,do,you,think,[END]
her,bitter,desperate,words,were,english-accented,like,the,voices,at,the,castle,balls,[END]
he'll,prepare,your,husband,for,burial,said,scarlett,quietly,[END]
the,woman's,bloody,hand,seized,the,hem,of,scarlett's,skirt,[END]
she,lifted,it,to,her,lips,an,abject,kiss,of,gratitude,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,clouded,with,tears,[END]
my,god,i,don't,deserve,this,[END]
i,would,have,turned,the,buggy,if,i,could,[END]
don't,she,said,please,don't,[END]
the,woman's,name,was,harriet,stewart,her,husband's,daniel,kelly,[END]
that,was,all,scarlett,knew,until,daniel,kelly,was,in,the,closed,coffin,inside,the,catholic,chapel,[END]
then,the,widow,who,had,spoken,only,to,answer,the,priest's,questions,looked,around,her,with,wild,darting,eyes,[END]
billy,where's,billy,[END]
he,should,be,here,[END]
the,priest,found,out,that,there,was,a,son,locked,in,a,room,at,the,hotel,to,keep,him,away,from,the,flogging,[END]
they,were,very,kind,said,the,woman,they,let,me,pay,with,my,wedding,ring,though,it's,not,gold,[END]
i'll,bring,him,scarlett,said,[END]

you'll,take,care,of,mrs,[END]

the,poor,lady's,near,breaking,[END]
i,will,not,break,down,harriet,kelly,said,[END]
i,cannot,[END]
i,must,take,care,of,my,boy,[END]
he's,such,a,little,boy,only,eight,[END]
her,voice,was,thin,and,brittle,as,new,ice,[END]
scarlett,hurried,[END]
billy,kelly,was,a,sturdy,blond,boy,big,for,his,age,loud,with,anger,[END]
at,his,captivity,behind,the,thick,locked,door,[END]
at,the,british,soldiers,[END]
i'll,get,a,rod,of,iron,from,a,smithy,and,smash,their,heads,till,they,shoot,me,he,shouted,[END]
the,innkeeper,needed,all,his,burly,strength,to,hold,the,boy,[END]
don't,be,a,fool,billy,kelly,[END]
scarlett's,sharp,words,were,like,cold,water,thrown,in,the,child's,face,[END]
your,mother,needs,you,and,you,want,to,add,to,her,grief,[END]
what,kind,of,man,are,you,[END]
the,innkeeper,could,release,him,then,[END]
the,boy,was,still,[END]
where,is,my,mother,[END]
he,said,and,he,sounded,as,young,and,frightened,as,he,was,[END]
come,with,me,said,scarlett,[END]
80,[END]
harriet,stewart,kelly's,story,was,revealed,slowly,[END]
she,and,her,son,had,been,at,ballyhara,for,more,than,a,week,before,scarlett,learned,even,the,bare,bones,of,it,[END]
daughter,of,an,english,clergyman,harriet,had,taken,a,post,as,assistant,governess,in,the,family,of,lord,witley,[END]
she,was,well,educated,for,a,woman,nineteen,and,completely,ignorant,of,the,world,[END]
one,of,her,duties,was,to,accompany,the,children,of,the,house,on,their,rides,before,breakfast,[END]
she,fell,in,love,with,the,white,smile,and,playful,lilting,voice,of,the,groom,who,also,accompanied,them,[END]
when,he,asked,her,to,run,away,with,him,she,thought,it,the,most,romantic,adventure,in,the,world,[END]
the,adventure,ended,on,the,small,farm,of,daniel,kelly's,father,[END]
there,were,no,references,and,so,no,jobs,for,a,runaway,groom,or,governess,[END]
danny,worked,the,stony,fields,with,his,father,and,brothers,harriet,did,what,his,mother,told,her,to,do,for,the,most,part,scrubbing,and,darning,[END]
she,had,mastered,fine,embroidery,as,one,of,the,accomplishments,necessary,to,a,lady,[END]
that,billy,was,her,only,child,was,testimony,to,the,death,of,the,romance,[END]
danny,kelly,missed,the,world,of,fine,horses,in,grand,stables,and,the,dashing,striped,waistcoat,top,hat,and,tall,leather,boots,that,were,a,groom's,dress,livery,[END]
he,blamed,harriet,for,his,fall,from,grace,consoled,himself,with,whiskey,[END]
his,family,hated,her,because,she,was,english,and,protestant,[END]
danny,was,arrested,when,he,attacked,an,english,officer,in,a,bar,[END]
his,family,gave,him,up,for,dead,when,he,was,sentenced,to,a,hundred,stripes,of,the,whip,[END]
they,were,already,holding,the,wake,when,harriet,took,billy's,hand,and,a,loaf,of,bread,and,set,out,to,walk,the,twenty,miles,to,trim,the,site,of,the,insulted,officer's,regimental,barracks,[END]
she,pled,for,her,husband's,life,[END]
she,was,granted,his,body,for,burial,[END]
i'll,take,my,son,to,england,mrs,o'hara,if,you,will,lend,me,the,fare,[END]
my,parents,are,dead,but,i,have,cousins,who,might,give,us,a,home,[END]
i'll,repay,you,from,my,wages,[END]
i'll,find,some,kind,of,work,[END]
what,nonsense,said,scarlett,[END]
haven't,you,noticed,that,i,have,a,little,girl,running,wild,as,a,woods,colt,[END]
cat,needs,a,governess,[END]
besides,she's,already,attached,herself,to,billy,like,a,shadow,[END]
she,needs,a,friend,even,more,[END]
you'd,be,doing,me,a,mighty,big,favor,if,you'd,stay,mrs,[END]
kelly,[END]
it,was,true,as,far,as,it,went,[END]
what,scarlett,didn't,say,was,that,she,had,no,confidence,at,all,in,harriet's,ability,to,get,herself,on,the,right,boat,to,england,much,less,earn,a,living,once,she,got,there,[END]
she's,got,plenty,of,spine,but,no,smarts,was,scarlett's,summing-up,[END]
the,only,things,she,knows,are,things,she,learned,out,of,books,[END]
scarlett's,opinion,of,bookish,people,had,never,been,very,high,[END]
despite,her,scorn,for,harriet's,lack,of,practical,sense,scarlett,was,pleased,to,have,her,in,the,house,[END]
ever,since,she'd,returned,from,dublin,scarlett,had,found,the,big,house,disturbingly,empty,[END]
she,hadn't,expected,to,miss,charlotte,montague,but,she,had,[END]
harriet,filled,the,gap,nicely,[END]
in,many,ways,she,was,even,better,company,than,charlotte,because,harriet,was,fascinated,by,even,the,smallest,thing,the,children,did,and,scarlett,heard,about,small,adventures,that,cat,would,not,have,thought,worth,reporting,[END]
billy,kelly,was,company,for,cat,too,and,scarlett's,uneasiness,about,cat's,isolation,was,laid,to,rest,[END]
the,only,drawback,to,harriet's,presence,was,mrs,fitzpatrick's,hostility,[END]
we,don't,want,english,at,ballyhara,mrs,o,she,had,said,when,scarlett,brought,harriet,and,her,son,from,trim,[END]
it,was,bad,enough,having,the,montague,woman,here,but,at,least,she,did,something,useful,to,you,[END]
well,maybe,you,don't,want,mrs,kelly,but,i,do,and,it's,my,house,[END]
scarlett,was,tired,of,being,told,what,she,should,and,shouldn't,do,[END]
charlotte,had,done,it,and,now,mrs,fitz,[END]
harriet,never,criticized,her,at,all,[END]
on,the,contrary,[END]
she,was,so,grateful,for,the,roof,over,her,head,and,scarlett's,hand-me-down,clothes,that,sometimes,scarlett,felt,like,shouting,at,her,not,to,be,so,all-fired,meek,and,mild,[END]
scarlett,felt,like,shouting,at,everybody,and,she,was,ashamed,of,herself,because,there,was,absolutely,no,reason,for,her,ill,temper,[END]
never,in,memory,had,there,been,such,a,growing,season,everyone,said,[END]
the,grain,was,already,half,again,as,tall,as,normal,and,the,potato,fields,were,thick,with,strong,green,growth,[END]
one,glorious,sunny,day,followed,another,and,the,celebrations,at,weekly,market,day,in,trim,lasted,long,into,the,soft,warm,night,[END]
scarlett,danced,until,her,shoes,and,stockings,had,holes,in,them,but,the,music,and,laughter,failed,to,raise,her,spirits,for,long,[END]
when,harriet,sighed,romantically,about,the,young,couples,walking,along,the,river,with,their,arms,entwined,scarlett,turned,away,from,her,with,an,impatient,shrug,of,the,shoulders,[END]
thank,goodness,for,the,invitations,that,were,coming,daily,in,the,mail,she,thought,[END]
the,house,parties,were,beginning,soon,[END]
it,seemed,that,the,elegant,festivities,in,dublin,and,the,temptations,of,the,shops,had,made,trim,market,day,lose,most,of,its,appeal,[END]
by,the,end,of,may,the,waters,of,the,boyne,were,so,low,that,one,could,see,the,stones,laid,centuries,before,as,footing,for,the,ford,[END]
the,farmers,were,looking,anxiously,at,the,clouds,blown,by,the,west,wind,across,the,beautiful,low,sky,[END]
the,fields,needed,rain,[END]
the,brief,showers,that,refreshed,the,air,wet,the,soil,only,enough,to,draw,the,roots,of,wheat,and,timothy,grass,toward,the,surface,weakening,the,stalks,[END]
cat,reported,that,the,north,track,to,grainne's,cottage,was,turning,into,a,beaten,path,[END]
she,has,more,butter,than,she,can,eat,cat,said,spreading,her,own,butter,on,a,muffin,[END]
people,are,buying,spells,for,rain,[END]
you've,decided,to,be,friends,with,grainne,[END]
yes,[END]
billy,likes,her,[END]
scarlett,smiled,[END]
whatever,billy,said,was,law,to,cat,[END]
it,was,lucky,the,boy,was,so,good,natured,cat's,adoration,could,have,been,a,terrible,trial,[END]
instead,he,was,as,patient,as,a,saint,[END]
billy,had,inherited,his,father's,way,with,horses,[END]
he,was,teaching,cat,to,be,an,expert,rider,far,beyond,anything,that,scarlett,could,have,done,[END]
as,soon,as,cat,was,a,few,years,older,she'd,be,on,a,horse,not,a,pony,[END]
she,mentioned,at,least,twice,a,day,that,ponies,were,for,little,girls,and,cat,was,a,big,girl,[END]
fortunately,it,was,billy,who,said,not,big,enough,[END]
cat,would,never,have,accepted,it,from,scarlett,[END]
scarlett,went,to,a,house,party,in,roscommon,in,early,june,confident,that,she,was,in,no,way,deserting,her,daughter,[END]
she,probably,won't,even,notice,that,i'm,not,there,[END]
how,humbling,[END]
isn't,the,weather,splendid,[END]
said,everyone,at,the,party,[END]
they,played,tennis,on,the,lawn,after,dinner,in,the,soft,clear,light,that,lasted,until,after,ten,o'clock,[END]
scarlett,was,pleased,to,be,with,so,many,of,the,people,she'd,liked,most,in,dublin,[END]
the,only,one,she,didn't,greet,with,real,enthusiasm,was,charles,ragland,[END]
it,was,your,regiment,that,flogged,that,pitiful,man,to,death,charles,[END]
i'll,never,forget,and,i'll,never,forgive,[END]
wearing,regular,clothes,doesn't,change,the,fact,that,you're,an,english,soldier,and,that,the,military,are,monsters,[END]
charles,was,surprisingly,unapologetic,[END]
i'm,truly,sorry,that,you,saw,it,scarlett,[END]
flogging's,a,filthy,business,[END]
but,we're,seeing,things,that,are,even,worse,and,they,must,be,stopped,[END]
he,declined,to,give,examples,but,scarlett,heard,from,general,conversation,about,the,violence,against,landlords,that,was,cropping,up,all,over,ireland,[END]
fields,were,torched,cows,had,their,throats,cut,an,agent,for,a,big,estate,near,galway,was,ambushed,and,hacked,to,pieces,[END]
there,was,hushed,anxious,talk,about,a,resurgence,of,the,whiteboys,organized,bands,of,marauders,that,had,terrified,landowners,more,than,a,hundred,years,before,[END]
it,couldn't,be,said,wiser,heads,[END]
these,latest,incidents,were,scattered,and,sporadic,and,usually,the,work,of,known,troublemakers,[END]
but,they,did,tend,to,make,one,a,bit,uncomfortable,when,the,tenants,stared,in,the,carriage,as,one,drove,past,[END]
scarlett,forgave,charles,[END]
but,she,said,he,mustn't,expect,her,to,forget,[END]
i'll,even,take,the,blame,for,the,flogging,if,it,will,make,you,remember,me,he,said,ardently,[END]
then,he,blushed,like,a,boy,[END]
dammit,i,invent,speeches,worthy,of,lord,byron,when,i'm,in,the,barracks,thinking,of,you,then,i,blurt,out,some,rubbish,when,i'm,in,your,presence,[END]
you,know,don't,you,that,i'm,most,abominably,in,love,with,you,[END]
yes,i,know,[END]
it's,all,right,charles,[END]
i,don't,believe,i,would,have,liked,lord,byron,and,i,like,you,very,much,[END]
do,you,my,angel,[END]
might,i,hope,that,[END]
i,don't,think,so,charles,[END]
don't,look,so,desperate,[END]
it's,not,you,[END]
i,don't,think,so,with,anybody,[END]
the,sandwiches,in,scarlett's,room,lowly,curled,up,their,edges,during,the,night,[END]
it's,so,good,to,be,home,[END]
i'm,afraid,i'm,an,awful,kind,of,person,harriet,[END]
when,i'm,away,i,always,get,an,itch,to,be,home,no,matter,how,much,fun,i'm,having,[END]
but,i'll,bet,you,i,start,thinking,about,the,next,party,i've,accepted,before,this,week's,out,[END]
tell,me,all,about,what,happened,while,i,was,gone,[END]
did,cat,pester,billy,half,to,death,[END]
not,too,much,[END]
they've,invented,a,new,game,they,call,sink,the,vikings,',[END]
i,don't,know,where,the,name,comes,from,[END]
cat,said,you,could,explain,she,only,remembered,enough,to,make,up,the,name,[END]
they've,put,a,rope,ladder,on,the,tower,[END]
billy,hauls,rocks,up,it,then,they,throw,them,through,the,slits,into,the,river,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
that,minx,[END]
she's,been,nagging,me,about,getting,up,in,the,tower,for,ages,[END]
and,i,notice,she's,got,billy,doing,the,heavy,work,[END]
before,she's,even,four,years,old,[END]
she's,going,to,be,a,terror,by,the,time,she's,six,[END]
you'll,have,to,beat,her,with,a,stick,to,make,her,learn,her,letters,[END]
probably,not,[END]
she's,already,curious,about,the,animal,alphabet,in,her,room,[END]
scarlett,smiled,at,the,implied,suggestion,that,her,daughter,was,probably,a,near-genius,[END]
she,was,willing,to,believe,that,cat,could,do,everything,earlier,and,better,than,any,child,in,the,history,of,mankind,[END]
will,you,tell,me,about,the,house,party,scarlett,[END]
harriet,asked,wistfully,[END]
experience,hadn't,caused,her,to,lose,her,romantic,dreaminess,[END]
it,was,lovely,said,scarlett,[END]
we,were,oh,about,two,dozen,i,guess,and,for,once,there,was,no,boring,old,retired,general,to,talk,about,what,he'd,learned,from,the,duke,of,wellington,[END]
we,had,a,knock-down-drag-out,croquet,tournament,with,someone,taking,bets,and,giving,odds,like,a,horse,race,[END]
i,was,on,a,team,with,[END]
mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
the,words,were,screamed,not,spoken,[END]
scarlett,jumped,up,from,her,chair,[END]
a,maid,ran,in,panting,and,red-faced,[END]
kitchen,[END]
she,gasped,[END]
cat,[END]
burned,[END]
scarlett,almost,knocked,her,down,when,she,tore,past,her,[END]
she,could,hear,cat,wailing,when,she,was,only,halfway,through,the,colonnade,from,house,to,kitchen,wing,[END]
scarlett,ran,even,faster,[END]
cat,never,cried,[END]

the,first,visit,was,to,scarlett's,office,where,he,found,her,studying,the,estate,ledgers,[END]
her,frown,smoothed,out,when,she,saw,him,at,the,door,reappeared,when,he,suggested,she,give,a,party,to,welcome,her,cousin,stephen,back,to,ireland,[END]
she,capitulated,at,last,as,he'd,known,she,would,and,then,colum,was,able,to,use,the,invitation,to,the,party,as,his,reason,for,all,the,other,visits,[END]
he,listened,keenly,for,indications,that,rosaleen's,warning,had,a,basis,but,he,heard,nothing,to,his,great,relief,[END]
after,sunday,mass,all,the,villagers,and,o'haras,from,all,county,meath,came,to,ballyhara,to,welcome,stephen,home,and,to,hear,about,america,[END]
there,were,long,trestle,tables,on,the,lawn,with,steaming,platters,of,boiled,salt,beef,and,cabbage,baskets,piled,with,hot,boiled,potatoes,and,foamy,pitchers,of,porter,[END]
the,french,doors,were,open,to,the,drawing,room,with,its,ceiling,of,irish,heroes,as,invitation,into,the,big,house,for,any,who,cared,to,enter,[END]
it,was,almost,a,good,party,[END]
scarlett,consoled,herself,afterwards,with,the,thought,that,she'd,done,her,best,and,she'd,had,a,long,time,with,kathleen,[END]
i've,missed,you,so,kathleen,she'd,told,her,cousin,[END]

she,hasn't,missed,me,at,all,scarlett,realized,sadly,[END]
stephen,talked,no,more,in,ireland,than,he,had,in,america,but,the,family,didn't,seem,to,mind,[END]
he's,a,silent,man,and,that's,the,all,of,it,[END]
scarlett,avoided,him,[END]
he,was,still,spooky,stephen,to,her,[END]
he,had,brought,back,one,delicious,piece,of,news,[END]
grandfather,robillard,had,died,and,left,his,estate,to,pauline,and,eulalie,[END]
they,were,in,the,pink,house,together,took,their,constitutionals,every,day,and,were,reputed,to,be,even,richer,than,the,telfair,sisters,[END]

everyone,stopped,talking,stopped,eating,stopped,laughing,to,look,up,in,hope,at,the,mocking,bright,blue,sky,[END]
father,flynn,added,a,special,mass,every,day,and,people,lit,candles,with,private,prayers,for,rain,[END]
on,midsummer,day,the,clouds,borne,on,the,west,wind,began,to,pile,together,instead,of,scudding,past,[END]
by,late,afternoon,they,filled,the,horizon,half-black,and,heavy,[END]
the,men,and,women,who,were,building,the,bonfire,for,the,night's,celebration,lifted,their,heads,into,the,staccato,gusts,of,wind,smelling,rain,[END]
it,would,be,a,celebration,indeed,if,the,rains,returned,and,the,crops,were,saved,[END]
the,storm,broke,at,first,dark,in,a,cannonade,of,deafening,cracks,of,lightning,that,lit,up,the,sky,brighter,than,day,and,a,deluge,of,rain,[END]
people,fell,to,the,ground,and,covered,their,heads,[END]
hail,peppered,them,with,stones,of,ice,as,big,as,walnuts,[END]
cries,of,pain,and,fear,filled,the,moments,of,silence,between,lightning,cracks,[END]
scarlett,was,leaving,the,big,house,for,the,music,and,dancing,at,the,bonfire,[END]
she,ducked,back,inside,soaked,to,the,skin,in,only,seconds,and,ran,upstairs,to,find,cat,[END]
she,was,looking,out,the,window,her,green,eyes,wide,her,ears,covered,by,her,hands,[END]
harriet,kelly,huddled,in,a,corner,holding,billy,close,for,protection,[END]
scarlett,kneeled,beside,cat,to,watch,the,rampage,of,nature,[END]
it,lasted,a,half,hour,then,the,sky,was,clear,star-studded,with,a,gleaming,three-quarter,moon,[END]
the,bonfire,was,sodden,and,scattered,it,would,not,be,lighted,this,night,[END]
and,the,fields,of,grass,and,wheat,were,flattened,by,the,hail,that,covered,them,in,gray-white,misshapen,balls,[END]
a,keening,rose,from,the,throats,of,the,irish,of,ballyhara,[END]
its,piercing,sound,cut,through,the,stone,walls,and,glass,panes,into,cat's,room,[END]
scarlett,shuddered,and,drew,her,dark,child,close,[END]
cat,whimpered,softly,[END]
her,hands,were,not,enough,to,hold,back,the,sound,[END]
we've,lost,our,harvest,scarlett,said,[END]
she,was,standing,on,a,table,in,the,middle,of,ballyhara's,wide,street,facing,the,people,of,the,town,[END]
but,there's,plenty,to,be,saved,[END]
the,grass,will,still,dry,to,hay,and,we'll,have,straw,from,the,wheat,stalks,even,though,there'll,be,no,kernels,to,grind,for,flour,[END]
i'm,going,now,to,trim,and,navan,and,drogheda,to,buy,supplies,for,the,winter,[END]
there'll,be,no,hunger,in,ballyhara,[END]
that,i,promise,you,my,word,as,the,o'hara,[END]
they,cheered,her,then,[END]
but,at,night,by,their,hearths,they,talked,about,the,witch,and,the,changeling,and,the,tower,where,the,changeling,had,stirred,the,ghost,of,the,hanged,lord,to,vengeance,[END]
81,[END]
the,clear,skies,and,relentless,heat,returned,and,lasted,[END]
the,front,page,of,the,times,was,made,up,entirely,of,reports,and,speculations,on,the,weather,[END]
pages,two,and,three,had,more,and,more,items,about,outrages,against,landlords',property,and,agents,[END]
scarlett,glanced,at,the,newspaper,every,day,then,threw,it,aside,[END]
atbleast,she,didn't,have,to,worry,about,her,tenants,thank,god,for,that,[END]
they,knew,she'd,take,care,of,them,[END]
but,it,wasn't,easy,[END]
too,often,when,she,arrived,in,a,town,or,city,that,was,supposed,to,have,stockpiles,of,flour,and,meal,she,discovered,that,the,supplies,were,only,rumors,or,were,all,gone,[END]
in,the,beginning,she,haggled,with,vigor,about,the,inflated,prices,but,as,supplies,became,more,scarce,she,was,so,happy,to,find,anything,at,all,that,she,paid,whatever,was,asked,often,for,inferior,goods,[END]
it's,as,bad,as,it,was,in,georgia,after,the,war,she,thought,[END]
no,it's,worse,[END]
because,then,we,were,fighting,the,yankees,who,stole,or,burned,everything,[END]
now,i'm,fighting,for,the,lives,of,more,people,than,i,ever,had,depending,on,me,at,tara,[END]
and,i,don't,even,know,who,the,enemy,is,[END]
i,can't,believe,god's,put,a,curse,on,ireland,[END]
but,she,bought,a,hundred,dollars',worth,of,candles,for,the,pepole,of,ballyhara,to,light,in,supplication,when,they,prayed,in,the,chapel,[END]
and,she,rode,her,horse,or,drove,her,wagon,carefully,around,the,piles,of,stones,that,had,begun,to,appear,beside,roads,or,in,fields,[END]
she,didn't,know,what,older,deities,were,being,appeased,but,if,they'd,bring,rain,she,was,willing,to,give,them,every,stone,in,county,meath,[END]
she'd,carry,them,with,her,own,hands,if,she,had,to,[END]
scarlett,felt,helpless,and,it,was,a,new,and,frightening,experience,[END]
she,had,thought,she,understood,farming,because,she'd,grown,up,on,a,plantation,[END]
the,good,years,at,ballyhara,had,in,fact,been,no,more,than,she,expected,because,she,had,worked,hard,and,demanded,hard,work,from,others,[END]
but,what,was,she,to,do,now,that,willingness,to,work,wasn't,enough,[END]
she,continued,to,go,to,the,parties,she,had,accepted,in,such,high,spirits,[END]
now,she,was,looking,for,information,from,other,landowners,not,for,entertainment,[END]
scarlett,arrived,a,day,late,at,kilbawney,abbey,for,the,giffords',house,party,[END]
i'm,terribly,sorry,florence,she,said,to,lady,gifford,if,i,had,any,manners,at,all,i,would,have,thought,to,send,a,telegram,[END]
but,the,truth,is,i,was,going,from,pillar,to,post,looking,for,flour,and,meal,contracts,and,i,completely,lost,track,of,what,day,it,was,[END]
lady,gifford,was,so,relieved,that,scarlett,was,there,that,she,forgot,to,be,offended,[END]
everyone,else,at,the,house,party,had,accepted,her,invitation,instead,of,another,because,she'd,held,out,the,bait,that,scarlett,was,coming,[END]
i've,been,waiting,for,the,opportunity,to,shake,your,hand,young,woman,[END]
the,knickerbockered,gentleman,pumped,scarlett's,hand,vigorously,[END]

in,due,time,scarlett,learned,that,bart,had,no,news,of,rhett,at,all,[END]
she,also,learned,more,than,she,wanted,to,know,about,delivering,a,foal,when,it,was,turned,in,the,mare's,womb,[END]
it,didn't,matter,[END]
bart,was,one,of,her,favorite,people,and,always,would,be,[END]
all,the,talk,was,of,the,weather,[END]
ireland,had,never,before,in,its,history,had,a,drought,and,what,else,could,this,succession,of,sunny,days,be,called,[END]
there,was,almost,no,corner,of,the,country,that,didn't,need,rain,[END]
there'd,be,trouble,for,sure,when,rents,were,due,in,september,[END]
she,hadn't,thought,of,that,[END]
scarlett's,heart,felt,like,lead,[END]
of,course,the,farmers,wouldn't,be,able,to,pay,their,rents,[END]
and,if,she,didn't,make,them,pay,how,could,she,expect,the,town,tenants,to,pay,[END]
the,shops,and,bars,even,the,doctor,depended,on,the,money,the,farmers,spent,with,them,[END]
she,was,going,to,have,no,income,at,all,[END]
it,was,horribly,difficult,to,keep,up,the,appearance,of,cheerfulness,but,she,had,to,[END]
oh,she'd,be,glad,when,the,weekend,was,over,[END]
the,final,night,of,the,party,was,july,14,bastille,day,[END]
guests,had,been,told,to,bring,fancy,dress,[END]
scarlett,wore,her,best,and,brightest,galway,clothes,with,four,petticoats,of,different,colors,beneath,a,red,skirt,[END]
her,striped,stockings,were,scratchy,in,the,heat,but,they,caused,such,a,sensation,that,it,was,worth,the,discomfort,[END]
i,never,dreamed,the,peasants,were,so,charmingly,dressed,under,their,dirt,lady,gifford,exclaimed,[END]
i'm,going,to,buy,some,of,everything,to,take,to,london,next,year,[END]
people,will,be,begging,for,the,name,of,my,dressmaker,[END]
what,a,stupid,woman,thought,scarlett,[END]
thank,goodness,this,is,the,last,night,[END]
charles,ragland,came,in,for,the,dancing,after,dinner,[END]
the,party,he'd,been,to,had,broken,up,that,morning,[END]
i,would,have,left,anyhow,he,told,scarlett,later,[END]
when,i,heard,that,you,were,so,near,i,had,to,come,[END]
so,near,[END]
you,were,fifty,miles,away,[END]
a,hundred,would,be,the,same,[END]
scarlett,let,charles,kiss,her,in,the,shadow,of,the,great,oak,tree,[END]
it,had,been,so,terribly,long,since,she'd,been,kissed,or,felt,a,man's,strong,arms,tighten,protectively,around,her,[END]
she,felt,herself,melting,in,his,embrace,[END]
it,felt,wonderful,[END]
beloved,charles,said,hoarsely,[END]
shhh,[END]
just,kiss,me,till,i'm,dizzy,charles,[END]
dizzy,she,became,[END]
she,held,on,to,his,broad,muscular,shoulders,to,keep,from,falling,[END]
but,when,he,said,he'd,come,to,her,room,scarlett,drew,away,from,him,her,head,clear,[END]
kisses,were,one,thing,sharing,her,bed,was,out,of,the,question,[END]
she,burned,the,contrite,note,he,slid,under,her,door,during,night,and,she,left,too,early,in,the,morning,to,need,to,say,goodbye,[END]
when,she,got,home,she,went,at,once,to,find,cat,[END]
it,came,as,no,surprise,to,learn,that,she,and,billy,had,gone,to,the,tower,[END]
it,was,the,only,cool,place,on,ballyhara,[END]
what,was,a,surprise,was,to,find,colum,and,mrs,fitzpatrick,waiting,for,her,under,a,big,tree,at,the,rear,of,the,house,with,a,lavish,tea,spread,on,a,shadowed,table,[END]
scarlett,was,delighted,[END]
colum,had,been,such,a,stranger,for,so,long,so,stand-offish,about,coming,up,to,the,big,house,[END]
it,was,wonderful,to,have,her,almost-brother,back,[END]
i've,got,the,strangest,story,to,tell,you,she,said,[END]
it,drove,me,half-crazy,with,curiosity,when,i,heard,it,[END]
what,do,you,think,colum,[END]
is,it,possible,that,the,young,lord,really,hanged,himself,in,the,tower,[END]
scarlett,described,the,marquess,of,trevanne,with,laughing,wicked,accuracy,and,mimicked,his,speech,as,she,repeated,it,[END]
colum,set,down,his,teacup,with,tightly,controlled,precision,[END]
i,have,no,opinion,scarlett,darling,he,said,and,his,voice,was,as,light,and,laughing,as,scarlett,liked,to,remember,it,[END]
anything,is,possible,in,ireland,else,we,would,be,plagued,with,snakes,like,the,rest,of,the,world,[END]
he,smiled,as,he,stood,up,[END]
and,now,i,must,go,[END]
i,tarried,from,my,day's,duties,only,to,see,your,beautiful,self,[END]
disregard,anything,this,woman,may,tell,you,about,my,fondness,for,the,cakes,i,ate,with,my,tea,[END]
he,walked,away,so,rapidly,that,scarlett,had,no,time,to,wrap,some,cakes,in,a,napkin,for,him,to,take,along,[END]
i'll,return,shortly,said,mrs,fitz,and,she,hurried,after,colum,[END]
well,[END]
said,scarlett,[END]
she,saw,harriet,kelly,in,the,distance,at,the,end,of,the,browned,lawn,and,waved,at,her,[END]
come,have,tea,scarlett,shouted,[END]
there,was,plenty,left,[END]
rosaleen,fitzpatrick,had,to,lift,up,her,skirt,and,run,to,catch,up,with,colum,halfway,down,the,long,drive,[END]
she,walked,silently,at,his,side,until,she,caught,her,breath,sufficiently,so,that,she,could,speak,[END]
and,what,happens,now,[END]
she,asked,[END]
you're,rushing,to,your,bottle,is,that,the,truth,of,it,[END]
colum,stopped,turned,to,face,her,[END]
there,is,no,truth,of,anything,and,that,is,what,scours,my,heart,[END]
did,you,hear,her,then,[END]
quoting,the,englishman's,lies,believing,them,[END]
just,as,devoy,and,the,others,believe,the,shining,english,lies,of,parnell,[END]
i,could,stay,no,longer,rosaleen,for,fear,of,smashing,her,english,teacups,and,howling,protest,like,a,chained,dog,[END]
rosaleen,looked,at,the,anguish,in,colum's,eyes,and,hardened,her,expression,[END]
too,long,had,she,poured,sympathy,on,his,wounded,spirit,it,had,not,helped,[END]
he,was,tortured,by,his,sense,of,failure,and,betrayal,[END]
after,more,than,twenty,years,of,working,for,ireland's,freedom,after,success,at,his,assigned,task,after,filling,the,arsenal,in,the,protestant,church,at,ballyhara,colum,had,been,told,it,was,all,valueless,[END]
parnell's,political,actions,had,more,meaning,[END]
colum,had,always,been,willing,to,die,for,his,country,he,could,not,bear,to,live,without,believing,that,he,was,helping,her,[END]
rosaleen,fitzpatrick,shared,colum's,distrust,of,parnell,she,shared,his,frustration,that,his,work,and,hers,had,been,discarded,by,the,fenian,leaders,[END]
but,she,could,put,her,own,feelings,aside,to,follow,orders,[END]
her,commitment,was,as,great,as,his,perhaps,greater,for,she,lusted,for,personal,revenge,even,more,than,justice,[END]
now,however,rosaleen,put,aside,her,allegiance,to,fenianism,[END]
colum's,suffering,meant,more,to,her,than,ireland's,for,she,loved,him,in,a,way,that,no,woman,should,permit,herself,to,love,a,priest,and,she,could,not,let,him,destroy,himself,through,doubt,and,anger,[END]
what,kind,of,irishman,are,you,then,colum,o'hara,[END]
she,said,harshly,[END]
will,you,let,devoy,and,the,others,rule,alone,and,wrongly,[END]
you,hear,what's,happening,[END]
the,people,are,fighting,on,their,own,and,paying,a,fearful,price,for,lack,of,a,leader,[END]
they,do,not,want,parnell,no,more,than,you,[END]
you,created,the,means,for,an,army,[END]
why,don't,you,go,now,and,build,the,army,to,use,the,means,instead,of,drinking,yourself,to,blindness,like,any,bravery-spouting,layabout,in,a,corner,bar,[END]
colum,looked,at,her,then,beyond,her,and,his,eyes,slowly,filled,with,hope,[END]
rosaleen,dropped,her,gaze,to,the,ground,[END]
she,couldn't,chance,letting,him,see,the,emotion,burning,in,her,eyes,[END]
i,don't,know,how,you,can,bear,this,heat,said,harriet,kelly,[END]
under,her,parasol,there,was,a,sheen,of,perspiration,on,her,delicate,face,[END]
i,love,it,scarlett,said,[END]
it's,just,like,home,[END]
nave,i,ever,told,you,about,the,south,harriet,[END]
she,had,not,harriet,said,[END]
summer,was,my,favorite,time,said,scarlett,[END]
the,heat,and,the,dry,days,were,just,what,was,wanted,[END]
it,was,so,beautiful,the,cotton,plants,green,and,fixing,to,bust,open,all,in,row,after,row,stretching,as,far,as,your,eye,could,see,[END]
the,field,hands,would,sing,when,they,hoed,you,could,hear,the,music,in,the,distance,kind,of,hanging,there,in,the,air,[END]
she,heard,her,own,words,and,was,horrified,[END]
what,was,she,saying,[END]
home,[END]
this,was,her,home,now,[END]
ireland,[END]
harriet's,eyes,were,dreamy,[END]
how,lovely,she,sighed,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,her,with,disgust,then,turned,it,on,herself,[END]
romantic,dreaminess,had,gotten,harriet,kelly,into,more,trouble,than,she,knew,what,to,do,with,and,she,still,didn't,know,any,better,[END]
but,i,do,[END]
i,didn't,have,to,put,the,south,behind,me,general,sherman,did,it,for,me,and,i'm,too,old,to,pretend,it,never,happened,[END]
i,don't,know,what's,wrong,with,me,i'm,all,at,sixes,and,sevens,[END]
maybe,it's,the,heat,maybe,i've,lost,the,knack,of,it,[END]
i'm,going,to,go,work,on,the,accounts,harriet,said,scarlett,[END]
the,neat,rows,of,numbers,were,always,calming,for,her,and,she,felt,like,she,was,about,to,jump,out,of,her,skin,[END]
the,account,books,were,terribly,depressing,[END]
the,only,money,she,had,coming,in,was,the,profit,from,the,little,houses,she,was,building,on,the,edge,of,atlanta,[END]
well,at,least,that,money,was,no,longer,going,to,that,revolutionary,movement,colum,used,to,belong,to,[END]
it,would,help,some,a,lot,really,[END]
but,not,nearly,enough,[END]
she'd,spent,incredible,sums,on,the,house,and,the,village,[END]
and,dublin,[END]
she,couldn't,believe,how,extravagant,she'd,been,in,dublin,although,the,orderly,columns,of,numbers,proved,it,beyond,question,[END]
if,only,joe,colleton,would,shave,a,little,in,building,those,houses,[END]
they'd,still,sell,like,hotcakes,but,the,profit,would,be,much,bigger,[END]
she,wouldn't,let,him,buy,cheaper,lumber,the,whole,reason,for,building,them,in,the,first,place,was,to,keep,ashley,in,business,[END]
there,were,plenty,of,other,ways,to,cut,expenses,[END]
foundations,[END]
chimneys,[END]
brick,didn't,have,to,be,top,quality,[END]
scarlett,shook,her,head,impatiently,[END]
joe,colleton,would,never,do,it,on,his,own,[END]
he,was,just,like,ashley,bone,honest,and,full,of,unbusinesslike,ideals,[END]
she,remembered,them,talking,together,at,the,site,[END]
if,ever,there,were,birds,of,a,feather,it,was,those,two,[END]
she,wouldn't,be,surprised,if,they,stopped,in,the,middle,of,talking,lumber,prices,to,start,talking,about,some,fool,book,they'd,read,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,grew,thoughtful,[END]
she,ought,to,send,harriet,kelly,to,atlanta,[END]
she'd,be,a,perfect,wife,for,ashley,[END]
they,were,another,two,of,a,kind,living,out,of,books,hopeless,in,the,real,world,[END]
harriet,was,a,ninny,in,lots,of,ways,but,she,stuck,by,her,obligations,she'd,stayed,with,her,no-good,husband,for,nearly,ten,years,and,she,had,her,own,kind,of,gumption,[END]
it,took,a,lot,of,sand,to,walk,in,to,the,commanding,officer,in,broken,shoes,and,beg,for,danny,kelly's,life,[END]
ashley,needed,that,kind,of,steel,behind,him,[END]
he,needed,somebody,to,take,care,of,too,[END]
it,couldn't,be,doing,him,any,good,having,india,and,aunt,pitty,fussing,over,him,all,the,time,[END]
what,it,was,likely,doing,to,beau,was,too,awful,to,think,about,[END]
billy,kelly,would,teach,him,a,thing,or,three,[END]
scarlett,grinned,[END]
she'd,better,send,a,box,of,smelling,salts,for,aunt,pitty,along,with,billy,kelly,[END]
her,grin,faded,[END]
no,it,wouldn't,do,[END]
cat,would,be,heartbroken,without,billy,[END]
she'd,drooped,for,a,week,when,ocras,ran,away,and,the,tabby,hadn't,been,one-tenth,of,what,billy,was,in,her,life,[END]
besides,harriet,couldn't,stand,the,heat,[END]
no,it,wouldn't,do,at,all,[END]
not,at,all,[END]
scarlett,bent,her,head,to,the,account,books,again,[END]
82,[END]
we've,got,to,stop,spending,so,much,money,scarlett,said,angrily,[END]
she,shook,the,account,book,at,mrs,fitzpatrick,[END]
there's,no,reason,on,earth,for,feeding,this,army,of,servants,when,flour,for,bread,costs,a,fortune,[END]
at,least,half,of,them,will,have,to,be,let,go,[END]
what,good,do,they,do,anyhow,[END]
and,don't,sing,me,that,old,song,about,having,to,churn,the,cream,to,make,the,butter,because,if,there's,one,thing,that,there's,too,much,of,these,days,it's,butter,[END]
you,can't,sell,it,for,hapenny,a,pound,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick,waited,for,scarlett's,tirade,to,end,[END]
then,she,calmly,took,the,book,from,her,and,put,it,on,a,table,[END]
you'd,turn,them,out,onto,the,road,then,[END]
she,said,[END]
they'll,find,plenty,of,company,for,many,of,the,big,houses,in,ireland,are,doing,just,what,you're,proposing,[END]
not,a,day,goes,by,we,don't,have,a,dozen,or,more,poor,souls,begging,a,bowl,of,soup,at,the,kitchen,door,[END]
will,you,add,to,their,number,[END]
scarlett,strode,impatiently,to,the,window,[END]
no,of,course,not,don't,be,ridiculous,[END]
but,there,must,be,some,way,we,can,cut,expenses,[END]
it's,more,costly,to,feed,your,fine,horses,than,your,servants,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick's,voice,was,cold,[END]
scarlett,turned,on,her,[END]
that,will,be,all,she,said,furiously,[END]
leave,me,alone,[END]
she,picked,up,the,book,and,went,to,her,desk,[END]
but,she,was,too,upset,to,concentrate,on,the,accounts,[END]
how,could,mrs,fitz,be,so,mean,[END]
she,must,know,that,i,enjoy,hunting,more,than,anything,else,in,my,life,[END]
the,only,thing,that's,getting,me,through,this,horrible,summer,is,knowing,that,come,fall,the,hunting,will,begin,again,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,eyes,and,tried,to,remember,the,crisp,cold,mornings,with,the,night's,light,frost,turned,to,trailing,mist,and,the,sound,of,the,horn,signalling,the,beginning,of,the,chase,[END]
a,tiny,muscle,jumped,involuntarily,in,the,soft,flesh,over,her,clenched,jaw,[END]
she,wasn't,good,at,imagining,she,was,good,at,doing,[END]
she,opened,her,eyes,and,worked,doggedly,on,the,accounts,[END]
with,no,grain,to,sell,and,no,rents,to,collect,she,was,going,to,lose,money,this,year,[END]
the,knowledge,bothered,her,because,she,had,always,made,money,in,business,and,losing,it,was,a,highly,disagreeable,change,[END]
but,scarlett,had,grown,up,in,a,world,where,it,was,accepted,that,sometimes,a,crop,failed,or,a,storm,wrought,havoc,[END]
she,knew,that,next,year,would,be,different,and,certainly,better,[END]
she,was,not,a,failure,because,of,the,disaster,of,the,drought,and,the,hail,[END]
it,wasn't,like,the,lumber,business,or,the,store,where,she,would,have,been,responsible,if,there,had,been,no,profit,[END]
besides,the,losses,would,barely,make,a,dent,in,her,fortune,[END]
she,could,be,extravagant,for,the,rest,of,her,life,and,the,crops,at,ballyhara,could,fail,every,year,and,she,would,still,have,plenty,of,money,[END]
scarlett,sighed,unconsciously,[END]
for,so,many,years,she,had,worked,and,scrimped,and,saved,thinking,that,if,only,she,could,have,enough,money,she,would,be,happy,[END]
now,she,had,it,thanks,to,rhett,and,somehow,it,didn't,mean,anything,at,all,[END]
except,that,there,was,no,longer,anything,to,work,for,to,scheme,and,strive,for,[END]
she,wasn't,foolish,enough,to,want,to,be,poor,and,desperate,again,but,she,needed,to,be,challenged,to,use,her,quick,intelligence,to,conquer,obstacles,[END]
and,so,she,thought,with,longing,about,jumping,fences,and,ditches,and,taking,chances,on,a,powerful,horse,that,she,controlled,by,force,of,will,[END]
when,the,accounts,were,done,scarlett,turned,to,the,pile,of,personal,mail,with,a,silent,groan,[END]
she,hated,writing,letters,[END]
she,already,knew,what,was,in,the,mail,[END]
many,were,invitations,[END]
she,put,them,in,a,stack,[END]
harriet,could,pen,the,polite,refusals,for,her,no,one,would,know,she,hadn't,written,them,herself,and,harriet,loved,being,useful,[END]
there,were,two,more,proposals,[END]
scarlett,received,at,least,one,a,week,[END]
they,pretended,to,be,love,letters,but,she,knew,very,well,that,they,wouldn't,be,there,if,she,wasn't,a,rich,widow,[END]
most,of,them,anyhow,[END]
she,replied,to,the,first,one,with,the,convenient,phrases,about,honored,by,your,regard,and,unable,to,return,your,affection,to,the,degree,you,merit,and,place,incalculable,value,on,your,friendship,that,protocol,demanded,and,supplied,[END]
the,second,was,not,so,easy,[END]
it,was,from,charles,ragland,[END]
of,all,the,men,she,had,met,in,ireland,charles,was,the,most,truly,eligible,to,her,[END]
his,adoration,was,convincing,not,at,all,like,the,elaborate,fawning,over,her,that,so,many,men,did,[END]
he,wasn't,after,her,money,she,was,sure,of,that,[END]
he,came,from,money,himself,his,people,were,big,landowners,in,england,[END]
he,was,a,younger,son,and,he'd,chosen,the,army,instead,of,the,church,[END]
but,he,must,have,some,money,of,his,own,[END]
his,dress,uniform,cost,more,than,all,her,ball,gowns,put,together,she,was,sure,[END]
what,else,[END]
charles,was,handsome,[END]
he,was,as,big,as,rhett,only,blond,instead,of,dark,[END]
not,washed-out,blond,though,like,so,many,fair,people,[END]
his,hair,was,gold,with,just,a,touch,of,red,in,it,startling,against,his,tanned,skin,[END]
he,was,really,very,good,looking,[END]
women,looked,at,him,like,they,could,eat,him,with,a,spoon,[END]
so,why,didn't,she,love,him,[END]
she,had,thought,about,it,she'd,thought,often,and,long,[END]
but,she,couldn't,she,didn't,care,enough,[END]
i,want,to,love,somebody,[END]
i,know,how,it,feels,to,love,it's,the,best,feeling,in,the,world,[END]
i,can't,bear,the,unfairness,that,i,learned,about,loving,too,late,[END]
charles,loves,me,and,i,want,to,be,loved,i,need,it,[END]
i'm,lonely,by,myself,without,it,[END]
why,can't,i,love,him,[END]
because,i,love,rhett,that's,why,[END]
that's,why,for,charles,and,for,every,other,man,in,the,world,[END]
they're,none,of,them,rhett,[END]
you,will,never,have,rhett,her,mind,told,her,[END]
and,her,heart,cried,out,in,anguish,do,you,think,i,don't,know,that,[END]
do,you,think,i,can,ever,completely,forget,it,[END]
do,you,think,that,it,doesn't,haunt,me,every,time,i,see,him,in,cat,[END]
do,you,think,it,doesn't,spring,on,me,from,nowhere,just,when,i,believe,that,my,life,is,my,own,[END]
scarlett,wrote,carefully,looking,for,the,kindest,words,she,knew,to,say,no,to,charles,ragland,[END]
he,would,never,understand,if,she,told,him,that,she,truly,liked,him,that,in,a,very,small,way,perhaps,she,even,loved,him,because,he,loved,her,and,that,her,affection,for,him,made,it,impossible,for,her,to,marry,him,[END]
she,wished,better,for,him,than,a,wife,who,would,forever,belong,to,another,man,[END]
the,year's,final,house,party,was,not,far,from,kilbride,which,was,not,far,from,trim,[END]
scarlett,could,drive,herself,instead,of,all,the,complications,of,taking,the,train,[END]
she,left,very,early,in,the,morning,when,it,was,still,cool,[END]
her,horses,were,suffering,from,the,heat,despite,being,sponged,down,four,times,a,day,[END]
even,she,had,started,to,feel,it,she,felt,twitchy,and,sweaty,almost,all,night,when,she,was,trying,to,sleep,[END]
thank,heaven,it,was,august,[END]
the,summer,was,almost,done,if,it,would,only,admit,it,[END]
the,sky,was,still,tinged,with,pink,but,there,was,already,a,haze,of,heat,in,the,distance,[END]
scarlett,hoped,she'd,calculated,the,time,right,for,the,trip,[END]

why,hadn't,she,thought,to,bring,the,revolver,with,her,[END]

idiots,[END]
why,couldn't,they,at,least,be,wearing,those,masks,like,she'd,read,about,in,the,newspaper,[END]

where,were,you,[END]

scarlett,shook,her,head,to,clear,it,[END]
she,couldn't,be,hearing,right,[END]
but,more,questions,and,more,answers,confirmed,it,[END]
the,two,men,both,irish,were,now,the,best,of,friends,[END]
with,happy,shared,memories,of,being,on,opposite,sides,in,a,savage,war,[END]
i,don't,understand,she,admitted,at,last,[END]

when,scarlett,reached,the,sutcliffes',house,she,shocked,their,butler,almost,out,of,his,professional,composure,by,asking,for,a,brandy,with,her,coffee,[END]
she,was,more,confused,than,she,could,handle,[END]
afterwards,she,bathed,and,put,on,a,fresh,frock,and,came,downstairs,her,composure,restored,[END]
until,she,saw,charles,ragland,[END]
he,shouldn't,be,at,this,party,[END]

mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
john,graham,was,a,tall,slender,man,with,the,loose-limbed,ease,of,the,natural,athlete,[END]
he,was,the,master,of,hounds,of,the,galway,blazers,perhaps,the,most,famous,hunt,in,all,ireland,[END]
every,fox,hunter,in,great,britain,hoped,to,be,invited,to,join,one,of,the,blazers',hunts,[END]
graham,knew,it,and,scarlett,knew,that,he,knew,it,[END]
there,was,no,point,in,being,coy,[END]
mr,graham,are,you,open,to,bribery,[END]
why,didn't,charles,quit,staring,at,her,like,that,[END]
what,was,he,doing,here,anyhow,[END]
john,graham,threw,back,his,silvered,head,in,laughter,[END]

i've,heard,that,about,americans,too,that,they,tend,to,extravagance,[END]
scarlett,was,tiring,of,banter,[END]
and,charles',presence,made,her,edgy,[END]
what,you,may,not,have,heard,mr,graham,is,that,americans,take,fences,where,the,irish,go,through,gates,and,the,english,go,back,home,[END]
if,you'll,let,me,ride,with,the,blazers,i'll,take,at,least,a,pad,or,i'll,eat,a,flock,of,crows,in,front,of,you,all,without,salt,[END]

she,can,ride,uncle,john,into,the,ground,and,never,look,back,[END]
come,on,i'll,introduce,you,[END]
there,were,promising,rumbles,of,thunder,but,no,rain,[END]
by,midday,the,air,was,stifling,[END]
ernest,sutcliffe,rang,the,dinner,gong,to,get,everyone's,attention,[END]
he,and,his,wife,had,planned,something,different,for,the,afternoon,he,said,nervously,[END]
there,is,the,usual,croquet,and,archery,what,[END]
or,the,library,and,billiards,in,the,house,what,[END]
or,whatever,one,does,customarily,[END]
what,[END]

with,many,starts,and,stops,and,sputters,ernest,got,on,with,it,[END]
there,were,bathing,costumes,for,anyone,who,wanted,one,and,ropes,strung,across,the,river,for,the,adventurous,to,hold,on,to,while,cooling,off,in,the,rushing,water,[END]
hardly,rushing,',amended,nan,sutcliffe,but,a,decent,little,current,[END]
footmen,will,be,there,with,iced,champagne,[END]
scarlett,was,one,of,the,first,to,accept,[END]
it,sounded,like,being,in,a,cool,tub,all,afternoon,[END]
it,was,immensely,more,enjoyable,than,a,cool,tub,even,though,the,water,was,warmer,than,she'd,hoped,it,would,be,[END]
scarlett,moved,along,the,rope,hand,over,hand,towards,the,center,and,deeper,water,[END]
suddenly,she,found,herself,in,the,grip,of,the,current,[END]
it,was,colder,so,much,colder,that,gooseflesh,rose,on,her,arms,and,very,swift,[END]
it,pushed,her,up,against,the,rope,then,knocked,her,feet,out,from,under,her,[END]
she,was,holding,on,for,her,life,[END]
her,legs,gyrated,out,of,control,and,the,current,twisted,her,body,in,half,circles,[END]
she,felt,a,dangerous,temptation,to,let,go,of,the,rope,and,ride,swirling,in,the,current,to,wherever,it,would,take,her,[END]
free,of,the,earth,under,her,feet,free,of,walls,or,roads,or,anything,controlled,and,controlling,[END]
for,long,heartracing,moments,she,imagined,herself,letting,go,just,letting,go,[END]
she,was,shaking,from,the,effort,she,had,to,make,to,keep,her,grip,fast,on,the,rope,[END]
slowly,with,intense,concentration,and,determination,she,moved,on,hand,over,hand,until,she,was,free,of,the,current's,pull,[END]
she,turned,her,head,away,from,the,others,splashing,and,shouting,in,the,water,and,she,cried,she,didn't,know,why,[END]
there,were,slow,eddies,like,fingers,from,the,current,in,the,warmer,water,outside,it,[END]
scarlett,slowly,became,aware,of,their,caresses,then,she,let,herself,float,among,them,[END]
warm,tendrils,of,movement,stroked,her,legs,her,thighs,her,body,her,breasts,twined,around,her,waist,and,her,knees,beneath,the,wool,tunic,and,bloomers,[END]
she,felt,longings,she,could,not,name,an,emptiness,that,cried,out,to,be,filled,within,her,[END]
rhett,she,whispered,against,the,rope,bruising,her,lips,inviting,the,roughness,and,the,hurt,[END]
isn't,this,splendid,fun,[END]
cried,nan,sutcliffe,[END]
who,wants,champagne,[END]
scarlett,forced,herself,to,look,around,[END]
scarlett,you,brave,thing,you,went,right,through,the,frightening,part,[END]
you'll,have,to,come,back,[END]
none,of,us,has,the,nerve,to,bring,your,champagne,to,you,[END]
yes,thought,scarlett,i,have,to,go,back,[END]
after,dinner,she,made,her,way,to,charles,ragland's,side,[END]
her,cheeks,were,very,pale,her,eyes,very,bright,[END]
may,i,offer,you,a,sandwich,tonight,[END]
she,asked,quietly,[END]
charles,was,an,experienced,skillful,lover,[END]
his,hands,were,gentle,his,lips,firm,and,warm,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,eyes,and,let,her,skin,receive,his,touch,the,way,it,had,received,the,caresses,of,the,river,[END]
then,he,spoke,her,name,and,she,felt,the,ecstatic,sensations,slipping,away,[END]
no,she,thought,no,i,don't,want,to,lose,it,i,mustn't,[END]
she,closed,her,eyes,tighter,thought,of,rhett,pretended,that,the,hands,were,rhett's,hands,the,lips,rhett's,lips,that,the,warm,strong,thrusting,filling,her,aching,emptiness,was,rhett's,[END]
it,was,no,good,[END]
it,was,not,rhett,[END]
the,sorrow,of,it,made,her,want,to,die,[END]
she,turned,her,face,away,from,charles',questing,mouth,and,wept,until,he,was,at,rest,[END]
my,darling,he,said,i,love,you,so,[END]

what,is,it,darling,what's,wrong,[END]
me,[END]
me,[END]
i,was,wrong,[END]
please,leave,me,alone,[END]
her,voice,was,so,small,so,poignant,with,despair,that,charles,reached,out,to,comfort,her,then,drew,back,in,full,knowledge,that,there,was,only,one,comfort,he,could,give,[END]
he,moved,quietly,as,he,gathered,his,clothes,and,he,shut,the,door,behind,him,with,only,the,slightest,sound,[END]
83,[END]
i,have,gone,to,join,my,regiment,[END]

she,went,down,to,breakfast,with,bruise-like,dark,shadows,under,her,eyes,imprint,of,the,desolate,weeping,that,had,replaced,sleep,for,her,[END]
she,looked,cool,in,her,mint-green,linen,frock,[END]
she,felt,encased,in,ice,[END]
she,was,obliged,to,smile,talk,listen,laugh,[END]
guests,had,a,duty,to,make,a,house,party,a,success,[END]
she,looked,at,the,people,seated,along,the,sides,of,the,long,table,[END]
smiling,talking,listening,laughing,[END]
how,many,of,them,she,wondered,have,wounds,inside,them,too,[END]
how,many,feel,dead,and,grateful,for,it,[END]
how,brave,people,are,[END]
she,nodded,at,the,footman,who,was,holding,a,plate,for,her,at,the,long,sideboard,[END]
at,her,signal,he,opened,the,big,silver,serving,dishes,one,after,another,for,her,approval,[END]
scarlett,accepted,some,rashers,of,bacon,and,a,spoonful,of,salt,and,scrambled,eggs,[END]

then,she'd,be,able,to,go,back,to,her,room,[END]
luckily,this,was,a,big,party,and,mostly,for,shooting,[END]
most,of,the,men,would,already,be,out,with,their,guns,[END]
there,would,be,luncheon,in,the,house,and,somewhere,on,the,grounds,wherever,the,shoot,was,[END]
there,would,be,tea,served,indoors,and,out,[END]

the,footman,deposited,her,plate,and,the,small,tray,with,individual,tea,service,[END]
then,he,pulled,out,the,chair,seated,her,shook,out,the,folds,of,her,napkin,and,draped,it,across,her,lap,[END]
scarlett,nodded,to,the,woman,[END]

i'll,have,to,find,out,about,stabling,[END]
i'll,write,to,john,graham,tomorrow,[END]
she,was,home,before,she,knew,it,[END]
such,good,news,scarlett,[END]
she'd,never,seen,harriet,looking,so,excited,[END]
why,she's,much,prettier,than,i,thought,[END]
with,the,right,clothes,[END]
while,you,were,gone,a,letter,came,from,one,of,my,cousins,in,england,[END]
i,told,you,did,i,not,that,i'd,written,of,my,good,fortune,and,your,kindness,[END]
this,cousin,his,name,is,reginald,parsons,but,the,family,always,called,him,reggie,has,arranged,for,billy,to,be,admitted,to,the,school,his,son,attends,reggie's,son,that,is,[END]
his,name,is,[END]
wait,a,minute,harriet,[END]
what,are,you,talking,about,[END]
billy's,going,to,the,school,in,ballyhara,i,thought,[END]
naturally,he'd,have,had,to,if,there,was,no,alternative,[END]
that's,what,i,wrote,to,reggie,[END]
scarlett's,jaw,set,[END]
what's,wrong,with,the,school,here,i'd,like,to,know,[END]
nothing,is,wrong,with,it,scarlett,[END]
it's,a,good,irish,village,school,[END]
i,want,something,better,for,billy,surely,you,understand,that,[END]
surely,i,do,no,such,thing,[END]
she,was,prepared,to,defend,ballyhara's,school,irish,schools,ireland,itself,at,the,top,of,her,lungs,if,need,be,[END]
then,she,took,a,good,look,at,harriet,kelly's,soft,defenseless,face,[END]
it,was,no,longer,soft,there,was,no,weakness,[END]
harriet's,gray,eyes,were,normally,hazy,with,dreams,now,they,looked,like,steel,[END]
she,was,ready,to,fight,anyone,anything,for,her,son,[END]
scarlett,had,seen,the,same,kind,of,thing,before,the,lamb,turned,lion,when,melanie,wilkes,took,a,stand,about,something,she,believed,in,[END]
what,about,cat,[END]
she'll,be,so,lonely,without,billy,[END]
i'm,sorry,scarlett,but,i,have,to,think,of,what's,best,for,billy,[END]
scarlett,sighed,[END]
i'd,like,to,suggest,a,different,alternative,harriet,[END]
you,and,i,both,know,that,in,england,billy,will,always,be,branded,the,irish,son,of,an,irish,stable,groom,[END]
in,america,he,can,become,anything,you,want,him,to,be,[END]
early,in,september,scarlett,held,a,stoically,silent,cat,in,her,arms,to,wave,goodbye,to,billy,and,his,mother,as,their,ship,left,kingstown,harbor,for,america,[END]
billy,was,crying,harriet's,face,had,the,radiance,of,resolve,and,hope,[END]
her,eyes,were,cloudy,with,dreams,[END]
scarlett,hoped,at,least,part,of,the,dreams,would,come,true,[END]
she,had,written,to,ashley,and,uncle,henry,hamilton,telling,them,about,harriet,and,asking,them,to,watch,out,for,her,and,help,her,find,a,place,to,stay,and,work,as,a,teacher,[END]
she,was,sure,they'd,do,that,much,at,least,[END]
the,rest,was,up,to,harriet,and,circumstances,[END]
let's,go,to,the,zoo,kitty,cat,[END]
there,are,giraffes,and,lions,and,bears,and,a,big,big,elephant,[END]
cat,likes,lions,best,[END]
you,might,change,your,mind,when,you,see,the,baby,bears,[END]
they,stayed,in,dublin,for,a,week,going,to,the,zoo,every,day,eating,cream,buns,in,bewley's,coffee,shop,afterwards,then,the,puppet,theater,followed,by,high,tea,at,the,shelbourne,with,silver,tiers,of,sandwiches,and,scones,silver,bowls,of,whipped,cream,silver,trays,of,éclairs,[END]
scarlett,learned,that,her,daughter,was,indefatigable,and,had,a,digestive,system,of,cast,iron,[END]
back,at,ballyhara,she,helped,cat,turn,the,tower,into,cat's,private,place,to,be,visited,only,by,invitation,[END]
cat,swept,the,dried,cobwebs,and,droppings,of,centuries,out,of,the,high,doorway,then,scarlett,pulled,up,bucket,after,bucket,of,water,from,the,river,and,the,two,of,them,scrubbed,the,walls,and,floor,of,the,room,[END]
cat,laughed,and,splashed,and,blew,soap,bubbles,while,she,scrubbed,[END]
it,reminded,scarlett,of,the,baths,when,cat,was,a,baby,[END]
she,didn't,mind,at,that,it,took,them,over,a,week,to,get,the,place,clean,[END]
nor,did,she,mind,that,the,stone,steps,to,upper,levels,were,missing,[END]
cat,would,have,liked,to,wash,the,tower,all,the,way,to,the,top,[END]
they,finished,just,in,time,for,what,would,have,been,harvest,home,in,a,normal,year,[END]
colum,had,advised,her,not,to,try,and,make,a,celebration,when,there,was,nothing,to,celebrate,[END]
he,helped,her,distribute,the,sacks,of,flour,and,meal,salt,and,sugar,potatoes,and,cabbages,that,came,to,the,town,on,wide,wagons,from,all,the,suppliers,scarlett,had,found,[END]
they,didn't,even,say,thank,you,',she,said,bitterly,when,the,ordeal,was,over,[END]
or,if,they,did,they,sure,didn't,act,like,they,meant,it,[END]
you'd,think,it,might,just,dawn,on,a,few,people,that,i'm,hurting,from,the,drought,too,[END]
my,wheat,and,grass,were,ruined,the,same,as,theirs,and,i'm,losing,all,my,rents,and,i,bought,all,that,stuff,[END]
she,couldn't,verbalize,the,deepest,hurt,of,all,[END]
the,land,the,o'hara,land,had,turned,against,her,and,the,people,her,people,of,ballyhara,[END]
she,poured,all,of,her,energies,into,cat's,tower,[END]
the,same,woman,who,hadn't,so,much,as,peered,through,a,window,to,see,what,was,happening,to,her,house,now,spent,hours,going,through,all,the,rooms,scrutinizing,each,piece,of,furniture,each,rug,every,blanket,quilt,pillow,selecting,the,best,[END]
cat,was,the,final,arbiter,[END]
she,looked,over,her,mother's,choices,and,picked,a,bright,flowered,bathmat,three,patchwork,quilts,and,a,sevres,vase,the,vase,for,her,paintbrushes,[END]
the,mat,and,quilts,went,into,a,deep,wide,indentation,in,the,massively,thick,wall,of,the,tower,[END]
for,her,nap,said,cat,[END]
then,she,patiently,went,back,and,forth,house,to,tower,with,her,favorite,picture,books,her,paint,box,her,leaf,collection,and,a,box,containing,stale,crumbs,saved,from,cakes,that,she,had,especially,liked,[END]
she,was,planning,to,lure,birds,and,animals,to,her,room,[END]
then,she'd,paint,their,pictures,on,her,wall,[END]
scarlett,listened,to,cat's,plans,and,watched,her,laborious,preparations,with,pride,in,cat's,determination,to,create,a,world,that,would,satisfy,her,even,without,billy,in,it,[END]
she,could,learn,from,her,four-year-old,daughter,she,thought,sadly,[END]
on,halloween,she,gave,cat,the,birthday,party,that,the,little,girl,designed,for,herself,[END]
there,were,four,small,cakes,each,with,four,candles,[END]
they,ate,one,of,the,cakes,themselves,sitting,on,the,clean,floor,of,cat's,tower,sanctuary,[END]
they,gave,the,second,one,to,grainne,eating,it,with,her,[END]
then,they,went,home,leaving,the,other,two,cakes,for,the,birds,and,animals,[END]
the,next,day,not,a,crumb,was,left,cat,reported,with,excitement,[END]
she,didn't,invite,her,mother,to,come,see,[END]
the,tower,was,all,hers,now,[END]
like,everyone,else,in,ireland,scarlett,read,the,newspapers,that,autumn,with,alarm,that,grew,into,outrage,[END]
for,her,the,alarm,was,caused,by,the,number,of,evictions,reported,[END]
the,farmers',efforts,to,fight,back,were,perfectly,understandable,as,far,as,she,was,concerned,[END]
attacking,a,bailiff,or,a,pair,of,constables,with,fists,or,pitchfork,was,only,a,normal,human,reaction,and,she,was,sorry,that,it,stopped,none,of,the,evictions,[END]
it,wasn't,the,fault,of,the,farmer,that,crops,had,failed,and,there,was,no,money,from,sale,of,the,grain,[END]
she,knew,all,about,that,herself,[END]
at,nearby,hunts,the,talk,was,always,about,the,same,thing,and,the,landowners,were,much,less,tolerant,than,scarlett,[END]
they,were,worried,by,the,instances,of,resistance,by,farmers,[END]
dammit,what,do,they,expect,[END]
if,they,don't,pay,their,rents,they,don't,keep,their,houses,[END]
they,know,that,it's,always,been,like,that,[END]
bloody,insurgence,that's,what's,going,on,[END]
but,scarlett's,reactions,became,the,same,as,her,neighboring,estate,owners',when,the,whiteboys,entered,in,[END]
there,had,been,scattered,incidents,during,the,summer,[END]
the,whiteboys,were,more,organized,now,and,more,brutal,[END]
night,after,night,barns,and,hayricks,were,torched,[END]
cattle,and,sheep,were,killed,pigs,slaughtered,donkeys,and,plow,horses,had,legs,broken,or,tendons,cut,[END]
shops,windows,were,smashed,and,manure,or,burning,torches,thrown,inside,[END]
and,more,and,more,as,autumn,turned,to,winter,there,were,attacks,from,concealment,against,military,men,english,soldiers,and,irish,constables,and,gentry,in,carriages,or,on,horseback,[END]
scarlett,took,two,grooms,along,on,the,roads,to,the,meets,[END]
and,she,worried,constantly,about,cat,[END]
losing,billy,seemed,to,have,upset,cat,much,less,than,she,had,feared,[END]
cat,never,moped,and,she,never,whined,[END]
she,was,always,occupied,with,some,project,or,some,game,she,invented,for,herself,[END]
but,she,was,only,four,it,made,scarlett,nervous,now,that,cat,went,off,by,herself,so,much,[END]
scarlett,was,determined,not,to,cage,her,child,but,she,began,to,wish,that,cat,were,less,agile,less,independent,less,fearless,[END]
cat,visited,stables,barns,stillroom,and,dairy,garden,and,gardensheds,[END]
she,wandered,through,woods,and,fields,like,a,wild,creature,at,home,there,and,the,house,was,a,land,of,opportunity,for,play,in,rooms,that,were,cleaned,but,not,used,attics,full,of,boxes,and,trunks,basements,with,wine,racks,barrels,of,foodstuffs,rooms,for,servants,for,silver,for,milk,butter,cheese,ice,ironing,washing,sewing,carpenter's,repairs,bootblacking,the,myriad,activities,that,maintained,the,big,house,[END]
there,was,never,any,point,in,looking,for,cat,[END]
she,might,be,anywhere,[END]
she,always,came,home,for,her,meals,and,bath,time,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,figure,out,how,the,child,knew,what,time,it,was,but,cat,was,never,late,[END]
mother,and,daughter,went,riding,together,every,day,after,breakfast,[END]
but,scarlett,grew,afraid,to,go,out,on,the,roads,because,of,the,whiteboys,and,she,didn't,want,to,spoil,the,intimacy,of,their,rides,by,taking,grooms,along,so,their,route,became,the,path,she,had,first,used,past,the,tower,and,through,the,ford,and,into,the,boreen,that,led,to,daniel's,cottage,[END]
pegeen,o'hara,might,not,like,it,she,thought,but,she'll,have,to,put,up,with,cat,and,me,if,she,wants,me,to,keep,on,paying,seamus',rent,[END]
she,wished,daniel's,youngest,son,timothy,wasn't,taking,such,a,long,time,about,finding,a,bride,[END]
he,would,have,the,little,cottage,when,he,did,and,the,girl,could,only,be,an,improvement,on,pegeen,[END]
scarlett,missed,the,easy,intimacy,she,had,known,with,her,family,before,pegeen,joined,it,[END]
every,time,she,left,for,a,hunt,scarlett,asked,cat,if,she,minded,being,left,[END]
the,little,brown,forehead,wrinkled,with,perplexity,above,cat's,clear,green,eyes,[END]
why,do,people,mind,[END]
she,asked,[END]
it,made,scarlett,feel,better,[END]
in,december,she,explained,to,cat,that,she'd,be,gone,for,a,longer,time,because,she,was,going,a,long,way,on,the,train,[END]
cat's,response,was,the,same,[END]
scarlett,set,off,for,the,long-awaited,hunt,with,the,galway,blazers,on,a,tuesday,[END]
she,wanted,a,day,of,rest,for,herself,as,well,as,her,horses,before,thursday's,hunt,[END]
she,wasn't,tired,on,the,contrary,she,was,almost,too,excited,to,sit,still,[END]
but,she,wasn't,about,to,take,any,chances,[END]
she,had,to,be,better,than,her,best,[END]
if,thursday,was,a,triumph,she'd,stay,for,friday,and,saturday,as,well,[END]
her,best,would,be,good,enough,then,[END]
at,the,end,of,the,first,day's,hunting,john,graham,presented,scarlett,with,the,gore-gummed,pad,that,she,had,won,[END]
she,accepted,it,with,a,court,curtsey,[END]
thank,you,your,excellency,[END]
everyone,applauded,[END]
the,applause,was,even,louder,when,two,stewards,came,in,bearing,a,huge,platter,that,held,a,steaming,pie,[END]
i've,been,telling,everyone,about,your,sporting,bet,mrs,o'hara,said,graham,and,we'd,devised,a,small,joke,for,you,[END]
this,is,a,pie,of,minced,crow,meat,[END]
i,will,now,take,the,first,bite,[END]
the,rest,of,the,blazers,will,follow,[END]
i,had,expected,you,to,be,doing,it,unaccompanied,[END]
scarlett,smiled,her,sweetest,smile,[END]
i'll,sprinkle,some,salt,on,it,for,you,sir,[END]
she,first,noticed,the,hawk-faced,man,on,the,black,horse,on,friday,when,he,made,an,impossible,jump,ahead,of,her,and,she,reined,in,abruptly,to,watch,nearly,losing,her,seat,[END]
he,rode,with,an,arrogant,fearlessness,that,made,her,own,recklessness,seem,tame,[END]
afterwards,people,surrounded,him,at,the,hunt,breakfast,all,of,them,talking,the,man,saying,little,[END]
he,was,tall,enough,for,her,to,see,his,aquiline,face,and,dark,eyes,and,hair,almost,blue,it,was,so,black,[END]
who,is,that,bored-looking,tall,man,[END]
she,asked,a,woman,she,knew,[END]
my,dear,[END]
the,woman,said,with,excitement,[END]
isn't,he,too,fascinating,for,words,[END]
she,sighed,happily,[END]
everyone,says,he's,the,most,wicked,man,in,britain,[END]
his,name,is,fenton,[END]
fenton,what,[END]
just,fenton,[END]
he's,the,earl,of,fenton,[END]
you,mean,he,doesn't,have,any,name,of,his,own,at,all,[END]
she'd,never,understand,all,this,english,title,rigmarole,scarlett,thought,[END]
it,made,no,sense,at,all,[END]
her,companion,smiled,[END]
a,superior,smile,it,seemed,to,scarlett,and,she,became,angry,[END]
but,the,woman,quickly,disarmed,her,[END]
isn't,it,silly,[END]
she,said,[END]
his,christian,name,is,luke,i,don't,know,what,the,family,name,is,[END]
i,just,think,of,him,as,lord,fenton,[END]
no,one,in,my,circle,of,friends,is,important,enough,to,address,him,any,other,way,except,milord',or,lord,fenton',or,fenton,',[END]
she,sighed,again,[END]
he's,terribly,grand,[END]
and,so,outrageously,attractive,[END]
scarlett,made,no,comment,aloud,[END]
privately,she,thought,he,looked,like,he,needed,taking,down,a,peg,or,two,[END]
returning,from,the,kill,on,saturday,fenton,walked,his,horse,alongside,scarlett's,[END]
she,was,glad,she,was,on,half,moon,it,put,her,almost,at,eye,level,[END]
good,morning,said,fenton,touching,the,brim,of,his,top,hat,[END]
i,understand,we're,neighbors,mistress,o'hara,[END]
i'd,like,to,call,and,pay,my,respects,if,i,may,[END]
that,would,be,very,pleasant,[END]
where,is,your,place,[END]
fenton,raised,his,thick,black,eyebrows,[END]
don't,you,know,[END]
i'm,on,the,opposite,side,of,the,boyne,adamstown,[END]
scarlett,was,glad,she,hadn't,known,[END]
obviously,he'd,expected,her,to,[END]
what,conceit,[END]
i,know,adamstown,well,she,said,i,have,some,o'hara,cousins,who,are,tenants,of,yours,[END]
indeed,[END]
i've,never,known,my,tenants',names,[END]
he,smiled,[END]
his,teeth,were,brilliantly,white,[END]
it,is,quite,charming,that,american,candor,about,your,humble,origins,[END]
it,was,mentioned,in,london,even,so,you,see,it's,serving,your,purposes,very,well,[END]
he,touched,his,crop,to,his,hat,and,moved,off,[END]
the,nerve,of,the,man,[END]
and,the,bad,manners,he,didn't,even,tell,me,his,name,[END]
as,if,he,was,sure,i,must,have,asked,someone,[END]
oh,i,do,wish,i,hadn't,[END]
when,she,got,home,she,told,mrs,fitz,to,give,instructions,to,the,butler,she,was,not,at,home,to,the,earl,of,fenton,the,first,two,times,he,called,[END]
then,she,concentrated,on,decorating,the,house,for,christmas,[END]
she,decided,they,really,should,have,a,bigger,tree,this,year,[END]
scarlett,opened,the,parcel,from,atlanta,as,soon,as,it,was,delivered,to,her,office,[END]
harriet,kelly,had,sent,her,some,cornmeal,bless,her,heart,[END]
i,guess,i,talk,about,missing,corn,bread,more,than,i,know,i,do,[END]
and,a,present,for,cat,from,billy,[END]
i'll,let,her,have,it,when,she,comes,home,for,tea,[END]
ah,here,it,is,a,nice,fat,letter,[END]
scarlett,settled,herself,comfortably,with,a,pot,of,coffee,to,read,it,[END]
harriet's,letters,were,always,full,of,surprises,[END]
the,first,one,she,wrote,when,she,arrived,in,atlanta,had,brought,among,eight,tightly,written,pages,of,rhapsodic,thanks,the,unbelievable,story,that,india,wilkes,had,a,serious,beau,[END]
a,yankee,no,less,who,was,the,new,minister,at,the,methodist,church,[END]
scarlett,relished,the,idea,[END]
india,wilkes,miss,confederacy,noble,cause,herself,[END]
let,a,yankee,in,britches,come,along,and,give,her,the,time,of,day,and,she'll,forget,there,ever,was,a,war,[END]
scarlett,skimmed,the,pages,about,billy's,accomplishments,[END]
cat,might,be,interested,she'd,read,them,aloud,later,[END]
then,she,found,what,she,was,looking,for,[END]
ashley,had,asked,harriet,to,marry,him,[END]
it's,what,i,wanted,isn't,it,[END]
it's,silly,for,me,to,feel,a,twinge,of,jealousy,[END]
when's,the,wedding,[END]
i'll,send,a,magnificent,present,[END]
oh,for,heaven's,sake,[END]
aunt,pitty,can't,live,alone,in,the,house,with,ashley,after,india's,wedding,because,it,wouldn't,be,proper,[END]
i,do,not,believe,it,[END]
yes,i,do,[END]
it's,just,what,aunt,pitty,would,swoon,over,worrying,about,how,it,would,look,for,her,the,oldest,spinster,in,the,world,to,be,living,with,a,single,man,[END]
at,least,that,gets,harriet,married,pretty,soon,[END]
not,exactly,the,most,passionate,proposal,in,the,world,but,i'm,sure,harriet,can,do,it,up,with,lace,and,rosebuds,in,her,mind,[END]
too,bad,the,wedding's,in,february,[END]
i'd,have,been,tempted,to,go,but,not,tempted,enough,to,miss,the,castle,season,[END]
it,hardly,seems,possible,that,i,once,thought,atlanta,was,a,big,city,[END]
i'll,see,if,cat,would,like,to,go,to,dublin,with,me,after,new,year's,[END]
mrs,sims,said,the,fittings,would,only,take,a,few,hours,in,the,mornings,[END]
i,wonder,what,they,do,with,those,poor,zoo,animals,in,the,winter,[END]
have,you,another,cup,in,that,pot,mistress,o'hara,[END]
it,was,a,chilly,ride,over,here,[END]
scarlett,stared,up,at,the,earl,of,fenton,her,mouth,gaping,in,surprise,[END]
oh,lord,i,must,look,a,sight,i,hardly,even,brushed,my,hair,this,morning,[END]
i,told,my,butler,to,say,i'm,not,at,home,she,blurted,[END]
fenton,smiled,[END]
but,i,came,the,back,way,[END]
may,i,sit,down,[END]
i'm,amazed,you,wait,to,be,asked,[END]
please,do,[END]
ring,the,bell,first,though,[END]
i've,only,got,one,cup,seeing,i,wasn't,at,home,to,visitors,[END]
fenton,tugged,the,bellpull,took,a,chair,close,to,hers,[END]
i'll,use,your,cup,if,you,don't,mind,[END]
it,will,take,a,week,for,another,to,get,here,[END]
i,do,mind,[END]
so,there,[END]
scarlett,blurted,[END]
then,she,burst,out,laughing,[END]
i,haven't,said,so,there',in,twenty,years,[END]
i'm,surprised,i,didn't,stick,out,my,tongue,too,[END]
you're,a,very,irritating,man,milord,[END]
luke,[END]
scarlett,[END]
may,i,have,some,coffee,[END]
the,pot's,empty,[END]
so,there,[END]
fenton,looked,a,little,less,overbearing,when,he,laughed,as,he,did,then,[END]
84,[END]
scarlett,visited,her,cousin,molly,that,afternoon,throwing,that,socially,ambitious,creature,into,such,a,frenzy,of,gentility,that,scarlett's,oflhand,questions,about,the,earl,of,fenton,were,barely,noticed,[END]
the,visit,was,very,short,[END]
molly,didn't,know,anything,at,all,save,that,the,earl's,decision,to,spend,some,time,at,his,adamstown,estate,had,shocked,his,servants,and,his,agent,[END]
they,kept,the,house,and,stables,ready,at,all,times,just,in,case,he,might,choose,to,come,there,but,this,was,the,first,time,in,nearly,five,years,that,he,had,arrived,[END]
the,staff,were,now,all,preparing,for,a,house,party,said,molly,[END]

at,daniel's,cottage,the,o'hara,men,commented,on,the,earl's,arrival,with,bitter,humor,[END]
fenton,had,picked,his,time,badly,they,said,[END]
the,fields,were,too,dry,and,hard,to,be,ruined,by,the,hunters,like,last,time,[END]
the,drought,had,been,there,before,him,and,his,friends,[END]
scarlett,returned,to,ballyhara,no,wiser,than,she'd,left,it,[END]
fenton,had,said,nothing,to,her,about,a,hunt,or,about,a,house,party,[END]
if,he,gave,one,and,she,wasn't,invited,it,would,be,a,terrible,slap,in,the,face,[END]
after,dinner,she,wrote,a,half,dozen,notes,to,friends,she'd,made,during,the,season,[END]
such,a,fuss,in,these,parts,she,scribbled,about,lord,fenton,popping,up,at,his,place,near,here,[END]
he's,been,absentee,for,so,many,years,that,even,the,shopkeepers,don't,have,any,good,gossip,about,him,[END]
she,smiled,as,she,sealed,the,notes,[END]
if,that,doesn't,bring,out,all,the,skeletons,in,his,closet,i,don't,know,what,will,[END]
the,next,morning,she,dressed,with,care,in,one,of,the,gowns,she'd,worn,at,her,drawing,rooms,in,dublin,[END]
i,don't,care,a,fig,about,looking,attractive,for,that,irritating,man,she,told,herself,but,i,will,not,let,him,sneak,up,on,me,again,when,i'm,not,ready,for,guests,[END]
the,coffee,grew,cold,in,the,pot,[END]
fenton,found,her,in,the,fields,exercising,comet,that,afternoon,[END]
scarlett,was,wearing,her,irish,clothes,and,cloak,riding,astride,[END]
how,sensible,you,are,scarlett,he,said,[END]
i've,always,been,convinced,that,sidesaddles,are,ruinous,to,a,good,horse,and,that,looks,like,a,fine,one,[END]
would,you,care,to,match,him,against,mine,in,a,short,race,[END]
i'd,be,delighted,scarlett,said,with,honeyed,sweetness,[END]
but,the,drought,left,everything,so,parched,that,the,dust,behind,me,will,probably,choke,you,half,to,death,[END]
fenton,raised,his,eyebrows,[END]
loser,provides,champagne,to,lay,the,dust,in,the,throat,of,both,he,challenged,[END]
done,[END]
to,trim,[END]
to,trim,[END]
fenton,wheeled,his,horse,and,began,the,race,before,scarlett,knew,what,was,happening,[END]
she,was,coated,with,dust,before,she,caught,up,with,him,on,the,road,choking,as,she,urged,comet,alongside,coughing,when,they,thundered,across,the,bridge,into,town,in,a,tie,[END]
they,reined,in,on,the,green,beside,the,castle,walls,[END]
you,owe,me,a,drink,said,fenton,[END]
the,devil,you,say,[END]
it,was,a,tie,[END]
then,i,owe,you,one,as,well,[END]
shall,we,have,two,bottles,or,would,you,prefer,to,break,the,tie,by,racing,back,[END]
scarlett,kicked,comet,sharply,and,took,a,head,start,[END]
she,hear,luke,laughing,behind,her,[END]
the,race,ended,in,the,forecourt,of,ballyhara,[END]
scarlett,won,barely,[END]
she,grinned,happily,pleased,with,herself,pleased,with,comet,pleased,with,luke,for,the,fun,she'd,had,[END]
he,touched,the,brim,of,his,dusty,hat,with,his,crop,[END]
i'll,bring,the,champagne,for,dinner,he,said,[END]
expect,me,at,eight,[END]
then,he,galloped,off,[END]
scarlett,stared,after,him,[END]
the,nerve,of,the,man,[END]
comet,sidestepped,skittishly,and,she,realized,that,she,had,let,the,reins,go,slack,[END]
she,gathered,them,up,and,patted,comet's,lathered,neck,[END]
you're,right,she,said,aloud,[END]
you,need,a,cool-down,and,a,good,grooming,[END]
so,do,i,i,think,i've,just,been,tricked,good,and,proper,[END]
she,began,to,laugh,[END]
what's,that,for,[END]
asked,cat,[END]
she,watched,her,mother,inserting,the,diamonds,in,her,earlobes,with,fascination,[END]
for,decoration,said,scarlett,[END]
she,tossed,her,head,and,the,diamonds,swayed,and,sparkled,beside,her,face,[END]
like,the,christmas,tree,said,cat,[END]
scarlett,laughed,[END]
sort,of,i,guess,[END]
i,never,thought,of,that,[END]
will,you,decorate,me,for,christmas,too,[END]
not,until,you're,much,much,older,kitty,cat,[END]
little,girls,can,have,tiny,pearl,necklaces,or,plain,gold,bracelets,but,diamonds,are,for,grown-up,ladies,[END]
would,you,like,to,have,some,jewelry,for,christmas,[END]
no,[END]
not,if,it's,for,little,girls,[END]
why,are,you,decorating,you,[END]
it's,not,christmas,yet,for,days,and,days,[END]
scarlett,was,startled,to,realize,that,cat,had,never,seen,her,in,evening,dress,before,[END]
when,they,had,been,in,dublin,they'd,always,dined,in,their,rooms,at,the,hotel,[END]
there's,a,guest,coming,for,dinner,she,said,a,dress-up,guest,[END]
the,first,one,at,ballyhara,she,thought,[END]
mrs,fitz,was,right,all,along,i,should,have,done,this,sooner,[END]
it's,fun,to,have,company,and,get,dressed,up,[END]
the,earl,of,fenton,was,an,entertaining,and,polished,dinner,companion,[END]
scarlett,found,herself,talking,much,more,than,she,had,intended,about,hunting,about,learning,to,ride,as,a,child,about,gerald,o'hara,and,his,irish,love,of,horses,[END]
fenton,was,very,easy,to,talk,to,[END]
so,easy,that,she,forgot,what,she,wanted,to,ask,him,until,the,end,of,the,meal,[END]
i,suppose,your,guests,will,be,arriving,any,minute,she,said,as,the,dessert,was,served,[END]
what,guests,[END]
luke,held,his,glass,of,champagne,up,to,examine,the,color,[END]
why,for,your,hunting,party,said,scarlett,[END]
fenton,tasted,the,wine,and,nodded,approval,to,the,butler,[END]
where,did,you,get,that,idea,[END]
i'm,not,having,a,hunt,nor,any,guests,[END]
then,what,are,you,doing,in,adamstown,[END]
they,say,you,never,come,here,[END]
the,glasses,were,both,filled,[END]
luke,lifted,his,in,a,toast,to,scarlett,[END]
shall,we,drink,to,amusing,ourselves,[END]
he,said,[END]
scarlett,could,feel,herself,blushing,[END]
she,was,almost,certain,she,had,just,been,propositioned,[END]
she,raised,her,glass,in,response,[END]
let's,drink,to,you,being,a,good,loser,of,very,good,champagne,she,said,with,a,smile,looking,at,him,through,lowered,lashes,[END]
later,when,she,was,getting,ready,for,bed,she,turned,luke's,words,over,and,over,in,her,mind,[END]
had,he,come,to,adamstown,just,to,see,her,[END]
and,did,he,intend,to,seduce,her,[END]
if,he,did,he,was,in,for,the,surprise,of,his,life,[END]
she'd,beat,him,at,that,game,just,like,she,had,beat,him,in,the,race,[END]
it,would,be,fun,too,to,make,such,an,arrogant,self-satisfied,man,fall,hopelessly,in,love,with,her,[END]
men,shouldn't,be,that,handsome,and,that,rich,it,made,them,think,they,could,have,everything,their,own,way,[END]
scarlett,climbed,into,bed,and,nestled,under,the,covers,[END]
she,was,looking,forward,to,going,riding,with,fenton,in,the,morning,as,she'd,promised,[END]
they,raced,again,this,time,to,pike,corner,and,fenton,won,[END]
then,back,to,adamstown,and,fenton,won,again,[END]
scarlett,wanted,to,get,fresh,horses,and,try,again,but,luke,declined,with,a,laugh,[END]
you,might,break,your,neck,in,your,determination,and,i'd,never,collect,my,winnings,[END]
what,winnings,[END]
we,had,no,bet,on,this,race,[END]
he,smiled,and,said,nothing,more,but,his,glance,roved,over,her,body,[END]
you're,insufferable,lord,fenton,[END]
so,i've,been,told,more,than,once,[END]
but,never,with,quite,so,much,vehemence,[END]
do,all,american,women,have,such,passionate,natures,[END]
you'll,never,find,out,from,me,scarlett,thought,but,she,curbed,her,tongue,as,she,curbed,her,horse,[END]
it,had,been,a,mistake,to,let,him,goad,her,into,losing,her,temper,and,she,was,even,more,annoyed,with,herself,than,she,was,with,him,[END]
i,know,better,than,that,[END]
rhett,always,used,to,make,me,fly,off,the,handle,and,it,gave,him,the,upper,hand,every,time,[END]
rhett,[END]
scarlett,looked,at,fenton's,black,hair,and,dark,mocking,eyes,and,superbly,tailored,clothes,[END]
no,wonder,her,eyes,had,sought,him,out,in,the,crowded,field,at,the,galway,blazers,[END]
he,did,have,a,look,of,rhett,about,him,[END]
but,only,at,first,[END]
there,was,somehing,very,different,she,didn't,know,exactly,what,[END]
i,thank,you,for,the,race,luke,even,if,i,didn't,win,she,said,[END]
now,i've,got,to,be,going,i,have,work,to,do,[END]
a,momentary,look,of,surprise,showed,on,his,face,then,he,smiled,[END]
i,expected,you,to,have,breakfast,with,me,[END]
scarlett,returned,his,smile,[END]
i,expect,you,did,[END]
she,could,feel,his,eyes,on,her,as,she,rode,away,[END]
when,a,groom,rode,over,to,ballyhara,in,the,afternoon,with,a,bouquet,of,hothouse,flowers,and,luke's,invitation,to,dinner,at,adamstown,she,wasn't,surprised,[END]
she,wrote,a,note,of,refusal,for,the,groom,to,take,back,[END]
then,she,ran,upstairs,giggling,to,put,on,her,riding,habit,again,[END]
she,was,arranging,his,flowers,in,a,vase,when,luke,strode,through,the,door,into,the,long,drawing,room,[END]
you,wanted,another,race,to,pike,corner,if,i'm,not,mistaken,he,said,[END]
scarlett's,laughter,was,in,her,eyes,only,[END]
you're,not,mistaken,about,that,she,said,[END]
colum,climbed,up,onto,the,bar,in,kennedy's,[END]
now,stop,your,yawping,all,of,you,[END]
what,more,could,the,poor,woman,do,i,ask,you,[END]
did,she,forgive,your,rents,or,did,she,not,[END]
and,did,she,not,give,you,food,for,the,winter,[END]
and,more,grain,and,meal,in,the,storehouse,waiting,for,when,you,run,out,of,what,you've,got,[END]
it's,ashamed,i,am,to,see,grown,men,pulling,their,mouths,into,a,baby's,pout,and,inventing,grievances,as,excuse,for,having,another,pint,[END]
drink,yourselves,into,the,floor,if,you,want,to,it's,a,man's,right,to,poison,his,stomach,and,addle,his,head,but,don't,be,blaming,your,weakness,on,the,o'hara,[END]
she's,gone,over,to,the,landlords,[END]
prancing,off,to,the,lords,and,ladies,all,summer,[END]
hardly,a,day,goes,by,she's,not,tearing,own,the,road,racing,the,black,devil,lord,of,adamstown,[END]
the,area,was,a,roar,with,angry,shouts,[END]
colum,shouted,them,all,down,[END]
what,kind,of,men,are,they,that,gossip,like,a,bunch,of,women,about,another,woman's,clothes,and,parties,and,romances,[END]
you,make,me,sick,the,lot,of,you,[END]
he,spit,on,the,top,of,the,bar,[END]
who,wants,to,lick,that,up,[END]
you're,not,men,it,should,suit,you,fine,[END]
the,sudden,silence,could,have,produced,any,kind,of,reaction,[END]
colum,spread,his,feet,apart,and,held,his,hands,loosely,in,front,of,him,ready,to,form,fists,[END]
ach,colum,it's,that,restless,we,are,with,no,reason,to,do,a,little,burning,and,shooting,like,the,lads,we,hear,about,in,other,towns,said,the,oldest,of,the,farmers,[END]
get,down,from,there,and,get,out,your,bodhran,and,i'll,be,the,whistle,and,kennedy,the,fiddle,with,you,[END]
let's,sing,some,songs,about,the,rising,and,get,drunk,together,like,good,fenian,men,[END]
colum,literally,jumped,at,the,chance,to,calm,things,down,[END]
he,was,already,singing,when,his,boots,hit,the,floor,[END]
there,beside,the,singing,river,that,dark,mass,of,men,were,seen,[END]
far,above,the,shining,weapons,hung,their,own,beloved,green,[END]
death,to,evevy,foe,and,traitor,[END]
forward,[END]
strike,the,marching,tune,[END]
and,hurrah,my,boys,for,freedom,'tis,the,risin',of,the,moon,[END]
it,was,true,that,scarlett,and,luke,raced,their,horses,on,the,roads,around,ballyhara,and,adamstown,[END]
also,over,fences,ditches,hedges,and,the,boyne,[END]
almost,every,morning,for,a,week,he,forded,the,cold,river,and,strode,into,the,morning,room,with,a,demand,for,coffee,and,challenge,to,a,race,[END]
scarlett,was,always,waiting,for,him,with,seeming,composure,but,in,fact,fenton,kept,her,constantly,on,edge,[END]
his,mind,was,quick,his,conversation,unpredictable,and,she,could,not,relax,her,attention,or,her,defenses,for,a,minute,[END]
luke,made,her,laugh,made,her,angry,made,her,feel,alive,to,the,ends,of,her,fingertips,and,toes,[END]
the,all-out,racing,across,the,countryside,released,some,of,the,tension,she,felt,when,he,was,around,[END]
the,battle,between,them,was,clearer,their,common,ruthlessness,undisguised,[END]
but,the,excitement,she,always,felt,when,she,forced,her,courage,to,its,reckless,limits,was,threatening,as,well,as,thrilling,[END]
scarlett,sensed,something,powerful,and,unknown,hidden,deep,within,her,that,was,in,danger,of,breaking,free,of,her,control,[END]
mrs,fitz,warned,her,that,the,townspeople,were,disturbed,by,her,behavior,[END]
the,o'hara,is,losing,their,respect,she,said,sternly,[END]
your,social,life,with,the,anglos,is,different,it's,distant,[END]
this,racketing,around,with,the,earl,of,fenton,rubs,their,noses,in,your,preference,for,the,enemy,[END]
i,don't,care,if,their,damn,noses,are,rubbed,bloody,[END]
my,life,is,my,own,business,[END]
scarlett's,vehemence,startled,mrs,fitzpatrick,[END]
is,it,like,that,then,[END]
she,said,and,her,tone,wasn't,stern,at,all,[END]
are,you,in,love,with,him,[END]
no,i'm,not,[END]
and,i'm,not,going,to,be,[END]
so,leave,me,alone,and,tell,all,of,them,to,leave,me,alone,too,[END]
rosaleen,fitzpatrick,kept,her,thoughts,to,herself,after,that,[END]
but,her,instincts,as,a,woman,saw,trouble,in,the,feverish,brightness,of,scarlett's,eyes,[END]
am,i,in,love,with,luke,[END]
mrs,fitzpatrick's,question,forced,scarlett,to,question,herself,[END]
no,she,answered,at,once,[END]
then,why,am,i,out,of,sorts,all,day,on,the,mornings,he,doesn't,show,up,[END]
she,could,find,no,convincing,answer,[END]
she,thought,about,what,she'd,learned,from,the,letters,of,friends,responding,to,her,mention,of,him,[END]
the,earl,of,fenton,was,notorious,they,all,said,[END]
he,possessed,one,of,the,greatest,fortunes,in,britain,owned,properties,in,england,and,scotland,as,well,as,his,estate,in,ireland,[END]
he,was,an,intimate,of,the,prince,of,wales,maintained,a,huge,town,house,in,london,where,rumored,bacchanals,alternated,with,famously,elaborate,entertainments,to,which,all,society,schemed,for,invitations,[END]
he,had,been,the,favored,target,of,matchmaking,parents,for,over,twenty,years,ever,since,he,had,inherited,his,title,and,wealth,at,the,age,of,eighteen,but,he,had,escaped,capture,by,anyone,even,several,noted,beauties,with,fortunes,of,their,own,[END]
there,were,whispered,stories,about,broken,hearts,shattered,reputations,even,suicides,[END]
and,more,than,one,husband,had,met,him,on,the,duelling,field,[END]
he,was,immoral,cruel,dangerous,some,said,evil,[END]
therefore,of,course,the,most,mysterious,and,fascinating,man,in,the,world,[END]
scarlett,imagined,the,sensation,it,would,cause,if,an,irish-american,widow,in,her,thirties,succeeded,where,all,the,titled,beauties,had,failed,and,her,lips,curved,in,a,small,secret,smile,faded,at,once,[END]
fenton,showed,none,of,the,signs,of,a,man,desperately,in,love,[END]
he,intended,to,possess,her,not,marry,her,[END]
her,eyes,narrowed,[END]
i'm,not,about,to,let,him,add,my,name,the,long,list,of,his,conquests,[END]
but,she,couldn't,help,wondering,what,it,would,be,like,to,kissed,by,him,[END]
85,[END]
fenton,whipped,his,horse,into,a,burst,of,speed,and,passed,scarlett,laughing,aloud,[END]
she,bent,forward,crying,aloud,to,half,moon,to,go,faster,[END]
almost,immediately,she,had,to,pull,back,on,the,reins,[END]
the,road,curved,between,high,stone,walls,and,luke,had,stopped,up,ahead,with,his,horse,turned,to,block,the,way,[END]
what,are,you,playing,at,[END]
she,demanded,[END]
i,could,have,crashed,right,into,you,[END]
exactly,what,i,had,in,mind,said,fenton,[END]
before,scarlett,understood,what,was,happening,he,had,caught,hold,of,half,moon's,mane,and,drawn,the,two,horses,close,[END]
his,other,hand,closed,over,the,back,of,scarlett's,neck,and,held,her,head,immobile,while,his,mouth,fastened,over,hers,[END]
his,kiss,was,bruising,commanding,her,lips,to,open,drawing,her,tongue,between,his,teeth,[END]
his,hand,forced,her,to,succumb,[END]
scarlett's,heart,pounded,with,surprise,fear,and,as,the,kiss,lasted,on,and,on,a,thrill,of,surrender,to,his,strength,[END]
when,he,released,her,she,was,shaken,and,weak,[END]
now,you'll,stop,refusing,my,invitations,to,dinner,said,luke,[END]
his,dark,eyes,glittered,with,satisfaction,[END]
scarlett,gathered,her,wits,[END]
you,presume,too,much,she,said,hating,her,breathlessness,[END]
do,i,[END]
i,doubt,it,[END]
luke's,arm,curved,along,her,back,and,held,her,against,his,chest,while,he,kissed,her,again,[END]
his,hand,found,her,breast,and,squeezed,it,to,the,border,of,pain,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,surging,response,a,longing,for,his,hands,on,all,her,body,and,his,brutal,lips,against,her,skin,[END]
the,nervous,horses,moved,breaking,the,embrace,and,scarlett,was,nearly,unseated,[END]
she,fought,for,balance,on,the,saddle,and,in,her,thoughts,[END]
she,mustn't,do,this,she,mustn't,give,herself,to,him,give,in,to,him,[END]
if,she,did,he'd,lose,interest,as,soon,as,he,conquered,her,she,knew,it,[END]
and,she,didn't,want,to,lose,him,[END]
she,wanted,him,[END]
this,was,no,lovesick,boy,like,charles,ragland,this,was,a,man,[END]
she,could,even,fall,in,love,with,a,man,like,this,[END]
scarlett,stroked,half,moon,calming,him,thanking,him,in,her,heart,for,saving,her,from,folly,[END]
when,she,turned,to,face,fenton,her,swollen,lips,were,stretched,in,a,smile,[END]
why,don't,you,put,on,an,animal's,pelt,and,drag,me,to,your,house,by,my,hair,[END]
she,said,[END]
there,was,precisely,the,right,blend,of,humor,and,contempt,in,her,voice,[END]
then,you,wouldn't,frighten,the,horses,[END]
she,urged,half,moon,into,a,walk,then,a,trot,heading,back,the,way,they,had,come,[END]
she,turned,her,head,and,spoke,over,her,shoulder,[END]
i,won't,come,to,dinner,luke,but,you,may,follow,me,to,ballyhara,for,coffee,[END]
if,you,want,more,than,that,i,can,offer,you,early,luncheon,or,breakfast,[END]
scarlett,murmured,softly,to,half,moon,urging,hurry,[END]
she,couldn't,read,the,meaning,of,the,scowl,on,fenton's,face,and,she,felt,something,very,like,fear,[END]
she,had,already,dismounted,when,luke,rode,into,the,stableyard,[END]
he,swung,a,leg,over,and,slid,down,from,his,horse,throwing,the,reins,to,a,groom,[END]
scarlett,pretended,not,to,notice,that,luke,had,commandeered,the,only,groom,in,sight,[END]
she,led,half,moon,inside,the,stable,herself,to,find,another,boy,[END]
when,her,eyes,adjusted,to,the,dim,light,she,stopped,in,her,tracks,afraid,to,move,[END]
cat,was,in,the,stall,directly,in,front,of,her,standing,barefoot,and,bare-legged,atop,comet,with,her,small,arms,outstretched,for,balance,[END]
she,had,on,a,heavy,aran,jersey,borrowed,from,one,of,the,stableboys,[END]
it,bunched,over,her,tucked-up,skirts,and,the,sleeves,hung,past,the,ends,of,her,fingers,[END]
as,usual,her,black,hair,had,escaped,its,braids,and,was,a,mass,of,tangles,[END]
she,looked,like,urchin,or,a,gypsy,child,[END]
what,are,you,doing,cat,[END]
said,scarlett,quietly,[END]
she,knew,the,big,horse's,edgy,disposition,[END]
a,loud,noise,could,spook,him,[END]
i'm,starting,to,practice,circus,said,cat,[END]
like,the,picture,in,my,book,of,the,lady,on,the,horse,[END]
when,i,go,in,the,ring,i'll,need,a,parasol,please,[END]
scarlett,kept,her,voice,even,[END]
this,was,more,frightening,even,than,bonnie,[END]
comet,could,shy,cat,off,then,crush,her,[END]
it,would,be,more,fair,if,you,waited,to,start,next,summer,[END]
your,feet,must,feel,very,cold,on,comet's,back,[END]
oh,[END]
cat,slid,onto,the,floor,at,once,next,to,the,metal-shod,hooves,[END]
i,didn't,think,of,that,[END]
her,voice,came,from,deep,in,the,gated,stall,[END]
scarlett,held,her,breath,[END]
then,cat,climbed,over,the,gate,with,her,boots,and,wool,stockings,in,her,hand,[END]
i,knew,the,boots,would,hurt,[END]
scarlett,willed,herself,not,to,grab,her,child,in,her,arms,and,hold,her,safe,[END]
cat,would,resent,her,relief,[END]
she,looked,to,her,right,for,a,groom,to,take,half,moon,[END]
she,saw,luke,standing,quietly,and,staring,at,cat,[END]
this,is,my,daughter,katie,colum,o'hara,she,said,[END]
and,make,of,it,what,you,will,fenton,she,thought,[END]
cat,looked,up,from,her,concentration,on,tying,her,boot,laces,[END]
she,studied,fenton's,face,before,she,spoke,[END]
my,name,is,cat,she,said,[END]
what,is,your,name,[END]
luke,said,the,earl,of,fenton,[END]
good,morning,luke,[END]
would,you,like,the,yellow,of,my,egg,[END]
i'm,going,to,eat,my,breakfast,now,[END]
i,would,like,that,very,much,he,said,[END]
they,made,a,strange,procession,cat,led,the,way,to,the,house,with,fenton,walking,beside,her,adjusting,his,long,stride,to,her,short,legs,[END]
i,had,my,breakfast,before,cat,told,him,but,i'm,hungry,again,so,i,will,have,breakfast,again,[END]
that,strikes,me,as,eminently,sensible,he,said,[END]
there,was,no,mockery,in,his,thoughtful,tone,of,voice,[END]
scarlett,followed,the,two,of,them,[END]
she,was,still,unsettled,by,the,fright,cat,had,given,her,and,she,had,not,yet,quite,recovered,from,the,moments,of,passionate,emotion,when,luke,kissed,her,[END]
she,felt,dazed,and,confused,[END]
fenton,was,the,last,man,on,earth,she,would,have,expected,to,love,children,and,yet,he,seemed,to,be,fascinated,by,cat,[END]
he,was,treating,her,exactly,right,too,taking,her,seriously,not,condescending,to,her,because,she,was,so,small,[END]
cat,had,no,patience,with,people,who,tried,to,baby,her,[END]
somehow,luke,seemed,to,sense,that,and,respect,it,[END]
scarlett,felt,tears,fill,her,eyes,[END]
oh,yes,she,could,love,this,man,[END]
what,a,father,he,could,be,to,her,beloved,child,[END]
she,blinked,rapidly,[END]
this,was,not,the,time,for,sentimentality,[END]
for,cat's,sake,as,well,as,for,her,own,she,had,to,be,strong,and,clear,headed,[END]
she,looked,at,fenton's,sleek,dark,head,inclined,toward,cat,[END]
he,looked,very,tall,and,broad,and,powerful,[END]
invincible,[END]
she,shivered,inwardly,then,rejected,her,cowardice,[END]
she,would,win,[END]
she,had,to,now,[END]
she,wanted,him,for,herself,and,for,cat,[END]
scarlett,nearly,laughed,at,the,scene,luke,and,cat,presented,[END]
cat,was,totally,absorbed,in,the,delicate,business,of,cutting,off,the,top,of,her,boiled,egg,without,shattering,it,fenton,was,watching,cat,with,equal,concentration,[END]
suddenly,without,warning,desperate,grief,drove,scarlett's,amusement,away,[END]
those,dark,eyes,watching,cat,should,be,rhett's,not,luke's,[END]
rhett,should,be,the,one,fascinated,by,his,daughter,rhett,the,one,to,share,her,breakfast,egg,rhett,the,one,to,walk,beside,her,matching,his,pace,to,her,small,steps,[END]
painful,longing,carved,a,hollow,in,scarlett's,breast,where,her,heart,should,be,and,anguish,so,long,held,at,bay,flooded,in,to,fill,it,[END]
she,ached,for,rhett's,presence,for,his,voice,for,his,love,[END]
if,only,i'd,told,him,about,cat,before,it,was,too,late,[END]
if,only,i'd,stayed,in,charleston,[END]
if,only,[END]
cat,tugged,at,scarlett's,sleeve,[END]
are,you,going,to,eat,your,egg,momma,[END]
i'll,open,it,for,you,[END]
thank,you,darling,said,scarlett,to,her,child,[END]
don't,be,a,fool,she,said,to,herself,[END]
she,smiled,at,cat,and,at,the,earl,of,fenton,[END]
what,was,past,was,past,and,she,had,to,think,about,the,future,[END]
i,have,a,suspicion,you're,going,to,have,another,yolk,to,eat,luke,scarlett,laughed,[END]
cat,said,goodbye,and,ran,outdoors,after,breakfast,but,fenton,stayed,[END]
bring,more,coffee,he,told,the,maid,without,looking,at,her,[END]
tell,me,about,your,daughter,he,said,to,scarlett,[END]
she,only,likes,the,white,of,the,egg,scarlett,answered,smiling,to,mask,her,worry,[END]
what,should,she,tell,him,about,cat's,father,[END]
suppose,luke,asked,his,name,how,he,died,who,he,was,[END]
but,fenton,asked,only,about,cat,[END]
how,old,is,this,remarkable,daughter,of,yours,scarlett,[END]
he,professed,astonishment,when,told,that,cat,was,barely,four,asked,if,she,was,always,so,self-possessed,if,she,had,always,been,precocious,if,she,was,very,high-strung,[END]
scarlett,warmed,to,his,genuine,interest,and,talked,until,her,throat,was,raw,about,the,marvels,of,cat,o'hara,[END]
you,should,see,her,on,her,pony,luke,she,rides,better,than,i,do,or,you,[END]
and,she,climbs,everything,like,a,monkey,[END]
the,painters,had,to,pluck,her,off,their,ladders,[END]
she,knows,the,woods,as,well,as,any,fox,and,she,has,a,built-in,compass,she,never,gets,lost,[END]
high-strung',[END]
there's,not,a,nervous,bone,in,her,body,[END]
she's,so,fearless,that,it,terrifies,me,sometimes,[END]
and,she,never,carries,on,when,she,gets,a,bump,or,a,bruise,[END]
even,when,she,was,a,baby,she,hardly,ever,cried,and,when,she,started,walking,she'd,just,look,surprised,when,she,fell,then,got,right,back,up,again,[END]
of,course,she's,healthy,[END]
didn't,you,see,how,straight,and,strong,she,is,[END]
she,eats,like,a,horse,too,and,never,gets,sick,[END]
you,wouldn't,believe,the,number,of,éclairs,and,cream,buns,she,can,tuck,away,without,turning,a,hair,[END]
when,scarlett,heard,the,hoarseness,in,her,voice,she,looked,at,the,clock,and,laughed,[END]
my,grief,i've,been,bragging,for,an,age,[END]
it's,all,your,fault,luke,for,egging,me,on,so,[END]
you,should,have,shut,me,up,[END]
not,at,all,[END]
i'm,interested,[END]
watch,out,or,you'll,make,me,jealous,[END]
you,act,like,you're,falling,in,love,with,my,daughter,[END]
fenton,raised,his,eyebrows,[END]
love,is,for,shopkeepers,and,penny,romances,[END]
i'm,interested,in,her,[END]
he,stood,and,bowed,lifted,scarlett's,hand,from,her,lap,and,brushed,it,with,a,light,kiss,[END]
i,leave,for,london,in,the,morning,so,i'll,take,leave,of,you,now,[END]
scarlett,stood,up,close,to,him,[END]
i'll,miss,our,races,she,said,meaning,every,word,[END]
will,you,be,back,soon,[END]
i'll,call,on,you,and,cat,when,i,return,[END]
well,[END]
thought,scarlett,after,he,was,gone,[END]
he,didn't,even,try,to,kiss,me,goodbye,[END]
she,didn't,know,whether,it,was,a,compliment,or,an,insult,[END]
he,must,regret,the,way,he,acted,when,he,kissed,me,before,she,decided,[END]
i,guess,he,lost,control,of,himself,[END]
and,he,sure,is,scared,of,the,word,love,[END]
she,concluded,that,luke,showed,all,the,symptoms,of,a,man,who,was,falling,in,love,against,his,will,[END]
it,made,her,very,happy,[END]
he'd,be,a,wonderful,father,for,cat,[END]
scarlett,touched,her,bruised,lips,gently,with,the,tip,of,a,finger,[END]
and,he,was,a,very,exciting,man,[END]
86,[END]
luke,was,very,much,on,scarlett's,mind,during,the,following,weeks,[END]
she,was,restless,and,on,bright,mornings,she,raced,alone,over,the,routes,they'd,followed,together,[END]
when,she,and,cat,decorated,the,tree,she,remembered,the,pleasure,of,dressing,up,for,dinner,the,night,he,first,came,to,ballyhara,[END]
and,when,she,pulled,the,wishbone,of,the,christmas,goose,with,cat,she,wished,that,he,would,return,from,london,soon,[END]
sometimes,she,closed,her,eyes,and,tried,to,remember,the,way,it,felt,to,have,his,arms,around,her,but,every,attempt,made,her,tearfully,angry,because,rhett's,face,and,rhett's,embrace,and,rhett's,laughter,always,filled,her,memory,instead,[END]
that,was,because,she'd,known,luke,such,a,short,time,she,told,herself,[END]
in,time,his,presence,would,blot,out,the,memories,of,rhett,that,was,only,logical,[END]
on,new,year's,eve,there,was,a,great,racket,and,colum,marched,in,beating,the,bodhran,followed,by,two,fiddlers,and,rosaleen,fitzpatrick,playing,the,bones,[END]
scarlett,screeched,with,joyful,surprise,and,ran,to,hug,him,[END]
i'd,given,up,hope,that,you'd,ever,come,home,colum,[END]
now,it's,bound,to,be,a,good,year,with,a,beginning,like,this,[END]
she,got,cat,up,from,her,sleep,and,they,saw,in,the,first,moments,of,1880,with,music,and,love,all,around,them,[END]
new,year's,day,began,with,laughter,as,the,harm,brack,shattered,against,the,wall,showering,crumbs,and,currants,all,over,cat's,dancing,body,and,upturned,open-mouthed,face,[END]
but,afterwards,the,sky,darkened,with,clouds,and,an,icy,wind,tore,at,scarlett's,shawl,when,she,made,the,rounds,of,new,year's,visits,in,her,town,[END]
colum,took,a,drink,in,every,house,liquor,not,tea,and,talked,politics,with,the,men,until,scarlett,thought,she,would,scream,[END]
will,you,not,come,to,the,bar,then,scarlett,darling,and,raise,a,glass,to,a,brave,new,year,and,new,hope,for,the,irish,[END]
said,colum,after,the,last,cottage,had,been,visited,[END]
scarlett's,nostrils,flared,at,the,smell,of,whiskey,on,him,[END]
no,i'm,tired,and,cold,and,i'm,going,home,[END]
come,with,me,and,we,have,a,quiet,time,by,the,fire,[END]
a,quiet,time,is,what,i,dread,most,scarlett,aroon,[END]
quiet,lets,the,darkness,creep,into,a,man's,soul,[END]
colum,walked,unsteadily,through,the,door,of,kennedy's,bar,and,scarlett,trudged,slowly,up,the,drive,to,the,big,house,holding,her,shawl,close,around,her,[END]
her,red,skirt,and,the,blue,and,yellow,stripes,on,her,stockings,looked,drab,in,the,cold,gray,light,[END]
hot,coffee,and,a,hot,bath,she,promised,herself,as,she,pushed,open,the,heavy,front,door,[END]
she,heard,a,stifled,giggle,when,entered,the,hall,and,her,heart,tightened,[END]
cat,must,be,playing,hide,and,seek,[END]
scarlett,pretended,to,suspect,nothing,[END]
she,closed,the,door,behind,her,dropped,her,shawl,on,a,chair,then,looked,around,[END]
happy,new,year,the,o'hara,said,the,earl,of,fenton,[END]
or,is,it,marie,antoinette,[END]
is,this,the,peasant,costume,all,the,best,dressmakers,in,london,are,creating,for,costume,balls,this,year,[END]
he,was,on,the,landing,of,the,staircase,[END]
scarlett,stared,up,at,him,[END]
he,was,back,[END]
oh,why,had,he,caught,her,looking,this,way,[END]
it,wasn't,what,she'd,planned,at,all,[END]
but,it,didn't,matter,[END]
luke,was,back,and,so,soon,and,she,no,longer,felt,tired,at,all,[END]
happy,new,year,she,said,[END]
and,it,was,[END]
fenton,stepped,to,one,side,and,scarlett,saw,cat,on,the,stairs,behind,him,[END]
both,cat's,arms,were,held,up,for,her,two,hands,to,steady,the,gleaming,jewelled,tiara,on,her,tousled,head,[END]
she,walked,down,the,steps,to,scarlett,her,green,eyes,laughing,her,mouth,twitching,to,keep,from,grinning,[END]
behind,her,trailed,a,long,wide,slash,of,color,a,crimson,velvet,robe,bordered,with,a,wide,band,of,ermine,[END]
cat's,wearing,your,regalia,countess,luke,said,[END]
i've,come,to,arrange,our,marriage,[END]
scarlett's,knees,gave,way,and,she,sat,on,the,marble,floor,in,a,circle,of,red,with,green,and,blue,petticoats,spilling,from,beneath,[END]
a,flicker,of,anger,mixed,with,her,shocked,thrill,of,triumph,[END]
this,couldn't,be,true,[END]
it,was,too,easy,[END]
it,took,all,the,fun,out,of,everything,[END]
it,seems,our,surprise,was,a,success,cat,said,luke,[END]
he,untied,the,heavy,silk,cords,at,her,neck,and,took,the,tiara,from,her,hands,[END]
you,may,go,now,[END]
i,have,to,talk,to,your,mother,[END]
can,i,open,my,box,[END]
yes,[END]
it's,in,your,room,[END]
cat,looked,at,scarlett,smiled,then,ran,giggling,up,the,stairs,[END]
luke,gathered,the,robe,over,his,left,arm,held,the,tiara,in,his,left,hand,and,walked,down,to,stand,near,scarlett,with,his,right,hand,reaching,down,to,her,[END]
he,looked,very,tall,very,big,his,eyes,very,dark,[END]
she,gave,him,her,hand,and,he,lifted,her,to,her,feet,[END]
we'll,go,into,the,library,said,fenton,[END]
there's,a,fire,and,a,bottle,of,champagne,for,a,toast,to,seal,the,bargain,[END]
scarlett,allowed,him,to,lead,the,way,[END]
he,wanted,to,marry,her,[END]
she,couldn't,believe,it,[END]
she,was,numb,speechless,with,shock,[END]
while,luke,poured,the,wine,she,warmed,herself,at,the,fire,[END]
luke,held,a,glass,out,to,her,[END]
scarlett,took,it,[END]
her,mind,was,beginning,to,register,what,was,happening,and,she,found,her,voice,[END]
why,did,you,say,bargain,',luke,[END]
why,hadn't,he,said,he,loved,her,and,wanted,her,to,be,his,wife,[END]
fenton,touched,the,rim,of,his,glass,to,hers,[END]
what,else,is,marriage,but,a,bargain,scarlett,[END]
our,respective,solicitors,will,draw,up,the,contracts,but,that's,just,a,matter,of,form,[END]
you,know,surely,what,to,expect,[END]
you're,not,a,girl,or,an,innocent,[END]
scarlett,set,her,glass,carefully,on,a,table,[END]
then,she,lowered,herself,carefully,into,a,chair,[END]
something,was,horribly,wrong,[END]
there,was,no,warmth,in,his,face,in,his,words,[END]
he,wasn't,even,looking,at,her,[END]
i,would,like,for,you,to,tell,me,please,she,said,slowly,what,to,expect,[END]
fenton,shrugged,impatiently,[END]
very,well,[END]
you'll,find,me,quite,generous,[END]
i,assume,that,is,your,chief,concern,[END]
he,was,he,said,one,of,the,wealthiest,men,in,england,although,he,expected,she,had,found,that,out,for,herself,[END]
he,genuinely,admired,her,astuteness,at,social,climbing,[END]
she,could,keep,her,own,money,[END]
he,would,naturally,provide,her,with,all,her,clothing,carriages,jewels,servants,et,cetera,[END]
he,expected,her,to,be,a,credit,to,him,[END]
he,had,observed,that,she,had,the,ability,[END]
she,could,also,keep,ballyhara,for,her,lifetime,[END]
it,seemed,to,amuse,her,[END]
for,that,matter,she,could,play,with,adamstown,too,when,she,wanted,to,muddy,her,boots,[END]
after,her,death,ballyhara,would,go,to,their,son,even,as,adamstown,would,be,his,upon,luke's,death,[END]
the,joining,of,contiguous,lands,had,always,been,one,of,the,chief,causes,for,marriage,[END]
for,of,course,the,essential,feature,of,the,bargain,is,that,you,provide,me,with,an,heir,[END]
i'm,the,last,of,my,line,and,it's,my,duty,to,continue,it,[END]
once,i,get,a,son,on,you,your,life,is,your,own,with,the,usual,attention,to,maintaining,a,semblance,of,discretion,[END]
he,refilled,his,glass,then,drained,it,[END]
scarlett,could,thank,cat,for,her,tiara,said,luke,[END]
i,had,needless,to,say,no,thought,of,making,you,the,countess,of,fenton,[END]
you're,the,kind,of,woman,i,enjoy,playing,with,[END]
the,stronger,the,spirit,the,greater,the,pleasure,in,breaking,it,to,my,will,[END]
it,would,have,been,interesting,[END]
but,not,as,interesting,as,that,child,of,yours,[END]
i,want,my,son,to,be,like,her,fearless,with,indestructible,rude,health,[END]
the,fenton,blood,has,been,thinned,by,inbreeding,[END]
infusing,your,peasant,vitality,will,remedy,that,[END]
i,note,that,my,tenant,o'haras,your,family,live,to,a,great,age,[END]
you,are,a,valuable,possession,scarlett,[END]
you,will,give,me,an,heir,to,be,proud,of,and,you,won't,disgrace,him,or,me,in,society,[END]
scarlett,had,been,staring,at,him,like,an,animal,mesmerized,by,a,serpent,[END]
but,now,she,broke,the,spell,[END]
she,took,her,glass,from,the,table,[END]
i,will,when,hell,freezes,over,[END]
she,cried,then,she,threw,the,glass,into,the,fire,[END]
the,alcohol,flared,in,an,explosion,of,flame,[END]
there's,your,toast,to,seal,your,bargain,lord,fenton,[END]
get,out,of,my,house,[END]
you,make,my,flesh,crawl,[END]
fenton,laughed,[END]
scarlett,tensed,poised,to,spring,at,him,to,batter,his,laughing,face,[END]
i,thought,you,cared,for,your,child,he,said,with,a,sneer,[END]
i,must,have,been,mistaken,[END]
the,words,kept,scarlett,from,moving,[END]
you,disappoint,me,scarlett,he,said,you,really,do,[END]
i,attributed,more,shrewdness,to,you,than,you,are,demonstrating,[END]
forget,your,injured,vanity,and,consider,what,you,have,in,your,grasp,[END]
an,impregnable,position,in,the,world,for,yourself,and,your,daughter,[END]
it's,unprecedented,but,i,have,the,power,to,overthrow,precedent,even,law,if,i,choose,[END]
i,shall,arrange,an,adoption,and,cat,will,become,the,lady,catherine,[END]
katie',is,of,course,out,of,the,question,it's,a,kitchen,maid's,name,[END]
as,my,daughter,she,will,have,immediate,and,unquestioned,access,to,the,best,of,everything,she,will,ever,need,or,want,[END]
friends,ultimately,marriage,she,will,have,only,to,choose,[END]
i,will,never,harm,her,she's,too,valuable,to,me,as,a,model,for,son,to,follow,[END]
can,you,deny,all,that,to,her,because,your,lower-class,yearning,for,romance,is,unfulfilled,[END]
i,don't,think,so,[END]
cat,doesn't,need,your,precious,titles,and,best,of,everything,',milord,and,neither,do,i,we've,done,very,well,without,you,and,we'll,keep,on,the,way,we,are,[END]
for,how,long,scarlett,[END]
don't,rely,on,your,success,in,dublin,too,much,[END]
you,were,a,novelty,and,novelties,have,short,spans,of,life,[END]
an,orangutan,could,be,the,toast,of,a,provincial,setting,like,dublin,if,it,were,well,dressed,[END]
you,have,one,more,season,two,at,the,most,and,then,you,will,be,forgotten,[END]
cat,needs,the,protection,of,a,name,and,a,father,[END]
i'm,one,of,a,very,few,men,with,the,power,to,remove,the,taint,from,a,bastard,child,no,save,your,protests,i,don't,care,what,tale,you,concoct,[END]
you,would,not,be,in,this,godforsaken,corner,of,ireland,if,you,and,your,child,were,welcome,in,america,[END]
enough,of,this,[END]
it's,beginning,to,bore,me,and,i,detest,being,bored,[END]
send,word,when,you've,come,to,your,senses,scarlett,[END]
you'll,agree,to,my,bargain,[END]
i,always,get,what,i,want,[END]
fenton,began,to,walk,to,the,door,[END]
scarlett,called,to,him,to,stop,[END]
there,was,one,thing,she,had,to,know,[END]
you,can't,force,everything,in,the,world,to,do,what,you,want,fenton,[END]
did,it,ever,cross,your,mind,that,your,brood,mare,wife,might,give,birth,to,a,girl-child,and,not,a,boy,[END]
fenton,turned,to,face,her,[END]
you're,a,strong,healthy,woman,[END]
i,should,get,a,male,child,eventually,[END]
but,even,at,the,worst,if,you,give,me,only,girls,i'll,arrange,that,one,of,them,marry,a,man,willing,to,give,up,his,name,and,take,hers,[END]
then,my,blood,will,still,inherit,the,title,and,continue,the,line,[END]
my,obligation,will,be,satisfied,[END]
scarlett's,coldness,was,the,equal,of,his,[END]
you,think,of,everything,don't,you,[END]
suppose,i,was,barren,[END]
or,you,couldn't,father,a,child,[END]
fenton,smiled,[END]
my,manhood,is,proven,by,the,bastards,i've,scattered,through,all,the,cities,of,europe,so,your,attempted,insult,doesn't,touch,me,[END]
as,for,you,there's,cat,[END]
a,look,of,surprise,crossed,his,face,and,he,strode,back,toward,scarlett,making,her,shrink,from,his,sudden,approach,[END]
come,now,scarlett,don't,be,dramatic,[END]
haven't,i,just,told,you,i,only,break,mistresses,not,wives,[END]
i,have,no,desire,to,touch,you,now,[END]

when,she,was,alone,she,picked,at,the,memory,like,a,half-healed,scab,punishing,herself,with,the,pain,of,it,[END]
what,a,fool,she'd,been,to,imagine,a,happy,life,as,a,family,to,build,a,future,on,that,one,breakfast,when,cat,divided,the,eggs,on,their,three,plates,[END]

one,farmer,on,each,estate,would,pay,all,the,others,would,refuse,and,if,the,landlord,evicted,all,would,go,to,live,at,the,cottage,where,the,rent,was,paid,up,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,see,the,reason,for,that,[END]
the,landlord,would,just,rent,to,someone,else,[END]

they'd,force,everyone,else,to,stay,away,and,without,farmers,the,landlord,would,lose,his,rents,and,also,his,newly,planted,crops,because,there'd,be,no,one,to,tend,them,[END]
it,was,the,idea,of,a,genius,he,was,only,sorry,he,hadn't,thought,of,it,himself,[END]
scarlett,went,to,her,cousins,and,pressured,them,to,join,the,land,league,[END]

they,keep,them,in,the,bible,with,the,prayer,cards,and,pictures,of,the,saints,[END]
on,saint,brigid's,day,there,was,a,light,rain,[END]
scarlett,said,the,ritual,prayers,for,a,good,farm,year,with,a,fervor,no,other,prayer,had,ever,held,and,she,had,tears,on,her,cheeks,when,she,turned,the,first,sod,[END]

no,one,could,stand,another,year,like,the,last,one,[END]
scarlett,returned,to,the,house,and,removed,her,muddy,boots,[END]
then,she,invited,cat,to,have,cocoa,in,her,room,while,she,got,her,things,organized,to,be,packed,for,dublin,[END]
she,would,be,leaving,in,less,than,a,week,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,go,luke,would,be,there,and,how,could,she,face,him,[END]
with,her,head,held,high,it,was,the,only,way,[END]
her,people,expected,it,of,her,[END]
scarlett's,second,season,in,dublin,was,an,even,greater,triumph,than,her,first,[END]
invitations,awaited,her,at,the,shelbourne,for,all,the,castle,events,plus,five,small,dances,and,two,late-night,suppers,in,the,viceregal,private,apartments,[END]
she,also,found,in,a,sealed,envelope,the,most,coveted,invitation,of,all,her,carriage,would,be,admitted,through,the,special,entrance,behind,the,castle,[END]
there'd,be,no,more,waiting,in,line,for,hours,on,dame,street,while,carriages,were,allowed,into,the,castle,yard,four,at,a,time,to,put,down,guests,[END]
there,were,also,cards,requesting,her,presence,at,parties,and,dinners,in,private,houses,[END]
these,were,reputed,to,be,much,more,entertaining,than,the,castle,events,with,their,hundreds,of,people,[END]
scarlett,laughed,deep,in,her,throat,[END]
an,orangutan,in,fine,clothes,was,she,[END]
no,she,was,not,and,the,pile,of,invitations,proved,it,[END]
she,was,the,o'hara,of,ballyhara,irish,and,proud,of,it,[END]
she,was,an,original,[END]
it,made,no,difference,that,luke,was,in,dublin,[END]
let,him,sneer,all,he,liked,[END]
she,could,look,him,in,the,eye,without,fear,or,shame,and,be,damned,to,him,[END]
she,sorted,through,the,pile,picking,and,choosing,and,a,tiny,bubble,of,excitement,rose,in,her,heart,[END]
it,was,nice,to,be,wanted,nice,to,wear,pretty,gowns,and,dance,in,pretty,rooms,[END]
so,what,if,the,social,world,of,dublin,was,anglo,[END]
she,knew,enough,now,to,recognize,that,society's,smiles,and,frowns,rules,and,transgressions,honors,and,ostracisms,triumphs,and,losses,were,all,part,of,a,game,[END]
none,of,it,was,important,none,of,it,mattered,to,the,world,of,reality,outside,the,gilded,ballrooms,[END]
but,games,were,made,to,be,played,and,she,was,a,good,player,[END]
she,was,glad,after,all,that,she'd,come,to,dublin,[END]
she,liked,to,win,[END]
scarlett,learned,immediately,that,the,earl,of,fenton's,presence,in,dublin,had,set,off,a,frenzy,of,excitement,and,speculation,[END]
my,dear,said,may,taplow,even,in,london,people,can,talk,of,nothing,else,[END]
everyone,knows,fenton,considers,dublin,a,thirdrate,provincial,outpost,[END]
his,house,hasn't,been,opened,for,decades,[END]
why,in,the,world,is,he,here,[END]
i,can't,imagine,scarlett,replied,relishing,the,thought,of,may's,reaction,if,she,told,her,[END]
fenton,seemed,to,turn,up,every,place,she,went,[END]
scarlett,greeted,him,with,cool,good,manners,and,ignored,the,expression,of,contemptuous,confidence,in,his,eyes,[END]
after,the,first,encounter,she,didn't,even,fill,with,anger,when,she,chanced,to,meet,his,gaze,[END]
he,had,no,power,to,hurt,her,any,more,[END]
not,as,himself,[END]
but,she,was,pierced,by,pain,again,and,again,when,she,glimpsed,the,back,of,a,tall,dark-haired,man,clad,in,velvet,or,brocade,and,it,turned,out,to,be,fenton,[END]
for,scarlett,looked,for,rhett,in,every,crowd,[END]
he'd,been,at,the,castle,the,year,before,why,not,this,year,[END]
this,night,[END]
this,room,[END]
but,it,was,always,fenton,[END]
everywhere,she,looked,in,the,talk,of,everyone,around,her,in,the,columns,of,every,newspaper,she,read,[END]
she,could,at,least,be,thankful,that,he,paid,no,special,attention,to,her,then,the,gossips,would,have,pursued,her,as,well,[END]
but,she,wished,to,heaven,that,his,name,was,not,on,every,tongue,every,day,[END]
rumors,gradually,coalesced,into,two,theories,he,had,readied,his,neglected,house,for,a,surreptitious,unofficial,visit,from,the,of,prince,of,wales,or,he,had,fallen,under,the,spell,of,lady,sophia,dudley,who,had,been,the,talk,of,london's,season,in,may,and,was,repeating,her,success,now,in,dublin,[END]
it,was,the,oldest,story,in,the,world,a,man,sows,his,wild,oats,and,resists,the,snares,of,women,for,years,and,years,until,bang,when,he's,forty,he,loses,his,head,and,his,heart,to,beauty,and,innocence,[END]
lady,sophia,dudley,was,seventeen,[END]
she,had,hair,the,gold,of,ripe,hay,and,eyes,as,blue,as,the,summer,sky,and,a,pink-and-white,complexion,that,put,porcelain,to,shame,[END]
at,least,so,said,the,ballads,that,were,written,about,her,and,sold,on,all,the,street,corners,for,a,penny,[END]
she,was,in,fact,a,beautiful,shy,girl,who,was,very,much,under,her,ambitious,mother's,control,and,who,blushed,often,and,attractively,because,of,all,the,attention,and,gallantries,paid,her,[END]
scarlett,saw,quite,a,bit,of,her,[END]
sophia's,private,drawing,room,was,next,to,scarlett's,[END]
it,was,second,best,in,terms,of,furnishings,and,the,view,of,saint,stephen's,green,but,first,in,terms,of,people,vying,for,admission,[END]
not,that,scarlett's,was,by,any,means,unattended,a,rich,and,well-received,widow,with,fascinating,green,eyes,would,always,be,in,demand,[END]
why,should,i,be,surprised,thought,scarlett,[END]
i'm,twice,her,age,and,i,had,my,turn,last,year,[END]
but,sometimes,she,had,trouble,holding,her,tongue,when,sophia's,name,was,linked,with,luke's,[END]
it,was,common,knowledge,that,a,duke,had,asked,for,sophia's,hand,but,everyone,agreed,that,she'd,do,better,to,take,fenton,[END]
a,duke,had,precedence,over,an,earl,but,fenton,was,forty,times,richer,and,a,hundred,times,handsomer,than,the,duke,[END]
and,he's,mine,if,i,want,him,scarlett,longed,to,say,[END]
who'd,they,be,writing,ballads,about,then,[END]
she,scolded,herself,for,her,pettiness,[END]
she,told,herself,she,was,a,fool,for,thinking,of,fenton's,prediction,that,she,would,be,forgotten,after,a,year,or,two,[END]
and,she,tried,not,to,worry,about,the,little,lines,in,the,skin,beside,her,eyes,[END]
scarlett,returned,to,ballyhara,for,her,first,sunday,office,hours,thankful,to,get,away,from,dublin,[END]
the,final,weeks,of,the,season,seemed,endless,[END]
it,was,good,to,be,home,good,to,be,thinking,about,something,real,like,paddy,o'faolain's,request,for,a,bigger,allocation,of,peat,instead,of,what,to,wear,to,the,next,party,[END]
and,it,was,pure,heaven,to,have,cat's,strong,little,arms,nearly,strangle,her,with,a,fierce,hug,of,welcome,[END]
when,the,last,dispute,had,been,settled,the,last,request,granted,scarlett,went,to,the,morning,room,for,tea,with,cat,[END]
i,saved,your,half,cat,said,[END]
her,mouth,was,smeared,with,chocolate,from,the,éclairs,scarlett,had,brought,from,dublin,[END]
it's,a,funny,thing,kitty,cat,but,i'm,not,real,hungry,[END]

yes,[END]
yes,thank,you,[END]
yes,thank,you,[END]
may,i,eat,them,now,[END]
yes,you,may,miss,pig,[END]
the,éclairs,were,gone,before,scarlett's,cup,was,empty,[END]
cat,was,dedicated,when,it,came,to,éclairs,[END]
where,shall,we,go,for,our,walk,[END]
scarlett,asked,her,[END]
cat,said,she'd,like,to,go,visit,grainne,[END]
she,likes,you,momma,[END]
she,likes,me,more,but,she,likes,you,a,lot,[END]
that,would,be,nice,said,scarlett,[END]
she'd,be,glad,to,go,to,the,tower,[END]
it,gave,her,a,feeling,of,serenity,and,there,was,little,serenity,in,her,heart,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,eyes,and,rested,her,cheek,on,the,ancient,smooth,stones,for,a,long,moment,[END]
cat,fidgeted,[END]
then,scarlett,pulled,on,the,rope,ladder,to,the,high,door,to,test,it,[END]
it,was,weathered,and,stained,[END]
it,felt,strong,enough,[END]
still,she,thought,she'd,better,see,about,having,a,new,one,made,[END]
if,it,broke,and,cat,fell,she,couldn't,bear,to,think,of,it,[END]
she,did,so,wish,that,cat,would,invite,her,up,into,her,room,[END]
she,tugged,at,the,ladder,again,hinting,[END]
grainne,will,be,expecting,us,momma,[END]
we,made,a,lot,of,noise,[END]
all,right,honey,i'm,coming,[END]
the,wise,woman,looked,no,older,no,different,from,the,first,time,scarlett,had,seen,her,[END]
i'd,even,be,willing,to,bet,those,are,the,same,shawls,she,was,wearing,scarlett,thought,[END]
cat,busied,herself,in,the,small,dark,cottage,getting,cups,from,their,shelf,raking,the,ancient-smelling,burning,peat,into,a,mound,of,glowing,embers,for,the,kettle,[END]
she,was,very,much,at,home,[END]
i'll,fill,the,kettle,at,the,spring,she,said,as,she,carried,it,outside,[END]

dara,visits,me,often,said,the,wise,woman,[END]
it's,her,kindness,to,a,lonely,soul,[END]
i,haven't,the,heart,to,send,her,away,for,she,sees,the,right,of,it,[END]
lonely,knows,lonely,[END]
scarlett,bristled,[END]
she,likes,to,be,alone,she,doesn't,have,to,be,lonely,[END]
i've,asked,her,time,and,again,if,she'd,like,to,have,children,come,play,and,she,always,says,no,[END]
it's,a,wise,child,[END]
they,try,to,stone,her,but,dara,is,too,quick,for,them,[END]
scarlett,couldn't,believe,she'd,heard,right,[END]
they,do,what,[END]
the,children,from,the,town,grainne,said,placidly,hunted,through,the,woods,for,dara,like,a,beast,[END]
she,heard,them,though,long,before,they,got,to,her,[END]
only,the,biggest,ever,came,near,enough,to,throw,the,stones,they,carried,[END]
and,those,came,near,only,because,they,could,run,faster,than,dara,on,longer,older,legs,[END]
she,knew,how,to,escape,even,them,[END]
they,wouldn't,dare,chase,her,into,her,tower,they,were,afraid,of,it,haunted,as,it,was,by,the,ghost,of,the,young,hanged,lord,[END]
scarlett,was,aghast,[END]
her,precious,cat,tormented,by,the,children,of,ballyhara,[END]
she'd,whip,every,single,one,of,them,with,her,own,hands,she'd,evict,their,parents,and,break,every,stick,of,their,furniture,into,splinters,[END]
she,started,up,out,of,her,chair,[END]
you,will,burden,the,child,with,the,ruin,of,ballyhara,[END]

sit,you,down,woman,[END]
others,would,be,the,same,[END]
they,fear,anyone,different,to,themselves,[END]
what,they,fear,they,try,to,drive,away,[END]
scarlett,sank,back,onto,the,chair,[END]
she,knew,the,wise,woman,was,right,[END]
she'd,paid,the,price,for,being,different,herself,again,and,again,[END]
her,stones,had,been,coldness,criticism,ostracism,[END]
but,she,had,brought,it,on,herself,[END]
cat,was,only,a,little,girl,[END]
she,was,innocent,[END]
and,she,was,in,danger,[END]
i,can't,just,do,nothing,[END]
scarlett,cried,[END]
it's,intolerable,[END]
i've,got,to,make,them,stop,[END]
ach,there's,no,stopping,ignorance,[END]
dara,has,found,her,own,way,and,it,is,enough,for,her,[END]

the,two,of,them,watched,silently,while,cat,methodically,set,the,kettle,on,the,iron,hook,over,the,coals,then,raked,more,coals,into,a,heap,below,it,[END]
scarlett,had,to,turn,her,head,[END]

now,i,know,it,without,a,doubt,[END]
she,sent,to,dublin,for,picture,books,of,london,and,wrote,to,mrs,sims,asking,for,an,appointment,[END]
she,had,to,order,a,wedding,gown,[END]
a,few,days,later,a,messenger,from,fenton,came,with,a,letter,and,a,package,[END]
in,the,letter,he,said,that,he,would,be,in,england,until,the,week,of,the,wedding,[END]
the,announcement,would,not,appear,until,after,the,london,season,[END]
and,scarlett,should,have,her,gown,designed,to,complement,the,jewels,sent,by,the,same,messenger,as,the,letter,[END]
she,still,had,three,months,to,herself,[END]
no,one,would,press,her,with,questions,or,invitations,until,the,news,of,the,engagement,was,released,[END]
inside,the,package,she,found,a,square,shallow,box,of,oxblood,leather,finely,tooled,in,gold,[END]
the,hinged,top,lifted,and,scarlett,gasped,[END]
the,case,was,lined,in,padded,gray,velvet,shaped,and,compartmented,to,display,a,necklace,two,bracelets,and,a,pair,of,earrings,[END]
the,settings,were,fashioned,of,heavy,old,gold,with,a,dull,almost,bronze,finish,[END]
the,jewels,were,pigeon's,blood,rubies,matched,stones,each,as,large,as,her,thumb,nail,[END]
the,earrings,were,single,oval,ruby,drops,from,an,intricately,shaped,boss,[END]
bracelets,held,a,dozen,stones,each,and,the,necklace,was,made,up,of,two,rows,of,stones,linked,by,swagged,thick,chains,[END]
for,the,first,time,scarlett,understood,the,difference,between,jewelry,and,jewels,[END]
no,one,would,ever,refer,to,these,rubies,as,jewelry,[END]
they,were,too,exceptional,and,too,valuable,[END]
they,were,without,doubt,jewels,[END]
her,fingers,were,trembling,when,she,clasped,the,bracelets,on,her,wrists,[END]
she,couldn't,do,the,necklace,by,herself,she,had,to,ring,for,peggy,quinn,[END]
when,she,saw,herself,in,the,looking,glass,scarlett,drew,in,a,long,breath,[END]
her,skin,looked,like,alabaster,with,the,dark,richness,of,the,rubies,against,it,[END]
her,hair,was,in,some,way,darker,and,more,lustrous,[END]
she,tried,to,remember,what,the,tiara,looked,like,[END]
it,too,was,set,with,rubies,[END]
she,would,look,like,a,queen,when,she,was,presented,to,the,queen,[END]
her,green,eyes,narrowed,slightly,[END]
london,was,going,to,be,a,much,more,challenging,game,than,dublin,[END]

in,her,heart,she,would,forever,be,the,o'hara,[END]
and,someday,cat,could,return,when,she,was,grown,and,could,protect,herself,[END]

there,was,just,time,enough,in,the,morning,to,dash,to,mrs,sims',workshop,calm,her,down,gather,the,specifics,of,yardage,and,pattern,of,lace,ordered,and,race,to,the,station,for,the,early,train,to,galway,[END]
scarlett,settled,herself,comfortably,and,opened,the,newspaper,[END]
my,grief,there,it,is,[END]
the,irish,times,had,printed,the,announcement,of,the,wedding,plans,on,the,front,page,[END]
scarlett,darted,looks,at,the,other,passengers,in,the,compartment,to,see,if,any,of,them,were,reading,the,paper,[END]
the,tweed-suited,sportsman,was,engrossed,in,a,sporting,magazine,the,nicely,dressed,mother,and,son,were,playing,cribbage,[END]
she,read,about,herself,again,[END]
the,times,had,added,a,great,deal,of,its,own,commentary,to,the,formal,announcement,[END]
scarlett,smiled,at,the,part,about,the,o'hara,of,ballyhara,a,beautiful,ornament,to,the,innermost,circles,of,viceregal,society,and,exquisite,and,dashing,equestrienne,[END]
she,had,brought,only,a,single,small,case,with,her,for,her,stay,in,dublin,and,galway,so,she,needed,only,one,porter,to,accompany,her,from,the,station,to,the,nearby,hotel,[END]
the,reception,area,was,jammed,with,people,[END]
what,the,devil,[END]
said,scarlett,[END]
the,races,said,the,porter,[END]
you,didn't,do,something,so,foolish,as,to,come,to,galway,not,knowing,did,you,[END]
you'll,find,no,room,to,sleep,in,here,[END]
impertinent,thought,scarlett,see,if,you,get,a,tip,[END]
wait,here,she,said,[END]
she,weaved,her,way,to,the,reception,desk,[END]
i'd,like,to,speak,to,the,manager,[END]
the,harassed,desk,clerk,looked,her,up,and,down,then,said,yes,of,course,madam,one,moment,and,vanished,behind,an,etched-glass,screen,[END]
he,returned,with,a,balding,man,in,a,black,frock,coat,and,striped,trousers,[END]
is,there,some,complaint,madam,[END]
i'm,afraid,that,the,hotel's,service,does,become,less,ah,flawless,shall,we,say,when,the,races,are,in,progress,[END]
whatever,inconvenience,[END]
scarlett,interrupted,him,[END]
i,remember,the,service,as,flawless,[END]
she,smiled,winningly,[END]
that's,why,i,like,to,stay,at,the,railway,[END]
i'll,need,a,room,tonight,[END]
i,am,mrs,o'hara,of,ballyhara,[END]
the,manager's,unctuousness,evaporated,like,august,dew,[END]
a,room,tonight,[END]
it's,quite,out,of,the,desk,clerk,was,pulling,at,his,arm,[END]
the,manager,glared,at,him,[END]
the,clerk,murmured,in,his,ear,jabbed,his,finger,at,a,times,on,the,desk,[END]
the,hotel,manager,bowed,to,scarlett,[END]
his,smile,was,quivering,with,the,will,to,please,[END]
such,an,honor,for,us,mrs,o'hara,[END]
i,trust,you'll,accept,a,very,particular,suite,the,finest,in,galway,as,the,guest,of,the,management,[END]
do,you,have,baggage,[END]
a,man,will,take,it,up,[END]
scarlett,gestured,to,the,porter,[END]
there,was,really,a,lot,to,be,said,for,marrying,an,earl,[END]
send,this,to,my,rooms,[END]
i'll,be,back,later,[END]
at,once,mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
in,truth,scarlett,didn't,expect,to,need,the,rooms,at,all,[END]
she,hoped,she'd,be,able,to,get,the,afternoon,train,back,to,dublin,maybe,even,the,early,afternoon,train,then,she'd,have,time,to,connect,for,the,evening,journey,back,up,to,trim,[END]
thank,heavens,for,the,long,days,[END]
i'll,have,until,ten,tonight,if,i,need,it,[END]
now,let's,see,if,the,nuns,are,as,impressed,by,the,earl,of,fenton,as,the,hotel,manager,was,[END]
too,bad,he's,protestant,[END]
i,guess,i,shouldn't,have,made,daisy,sims,swear,to,keep,everything,a,secret,[END]
scarlett,started,toward,the,door,to,the,square,[END]
phew,what,a,smelly,crowd,[END]
it,must,be,raining,on,their,tweeds,at,the,track,[END]
scarlett,edged,between,two,gesticulating,red-faced,men,[END]
she,bumped,headlong,into,sir,john,morland,and,hardly,recognized,him,[END]
he,looked,as,if,he,were,extremely,ill,there,was,no,color,in,his,normally,ruddy,face,and,no,light,in,his,usually,warm,interested,eyes,[END]
bart,my,dear,[END]
are,you,all,right,[END]
he,seemed,to,have,trouble,bringing,her,face,into,focus,[END]
oh,sorry,scarlett,[END]
not,quite,myself,[END]
one,too,many,and,all,that,kind,of,thing,[END]
at,this,hour,of,the,day,[END]
it,wasn't,like,john,morland,to,drink,too,much,at,any,time,and,certainly,not,before,luncheon,[END]
she,took,firm,hold,of,his,arm,[END]
come,along,bart,[END]
you're,going,to,have,coffee,with,me,and,then,something,to,eat,[END]
scarlett,walked,him,to,the,dining,room,[END]
morland's,steps,were,unsteady,[END]
i,guess,i'll,be,needing,my,room,after,all,she,thought,but,bart's,a,lot,more,important,than,rushing,off,after,some,lace,[END]
what,on,earth,could,have,happened,to,him,[END]
after,a,great,deal,of,coffee,she,found,out,[END]
john,morland,broke,down,and,cried,when,he,told,her,[END]
they,burned,my,stables,scarlett,they,burned,my,stables,[END]
i'd,taken,dijon,to,race,at,balbriggan,not,a,big,race,at,all,i,thought,she,might,like,a,run,on,the,sands,and,when,we,came,home,the,stables,were,just,black,ruins,[END]
my,god,the,smell,[END]
my,god,[END]
i,hear,the,horses,screaming,in,my,dreams,in,my,head,even,when,i,don't,sleep,[END]
scarlett,felt,herself,gagging,[END]
she,put,down,her,cup,[END]
it,couldn't,be,[END]
no,one,would,do,such,a,horrible,thing,[END]
it,had,to,be,an,accident,[END]
it,was,my,tenants,[END]
because,of,the,rents,you,see,[END]
how,could,they,hate,me,so,much,[END]
i,tried,to,be,a,good,landlord,i,always,tried,[END]
why,couldn't,they,burn,the,house,[END]
at,edmund,barrows',place,they,burned,the,house,[END]
they,could,have,burned,me,in,it,i,wouldn't,care,[END]
not,if,they'd,spared,the,horses,[END]
name,of,god,scarlett,[END]
what,had,my,poor,burned,horses,ever,done,to,them,[END]
there,was,nothing,she,could,say,[END]
all,bart's,heart,was,in,his,stables,[END]
wait,he'd,been,away,with,dijon,[END]
his,special,pride,and,joy,[END]
you've,got,dijon,bart,[END]
you,can,start,over,breed,her,[END]
she's,such,a,wonderful,horse,the,most,beautiful,i've,ever,seen,[END]
you,can,have,the,stables,at,ballyhara,[END]
don't,you,remember,[END]
you,told,me,they,were,like,a,cathedral,[END]
we'll,put,in,an,organ,[END]
you,can,raise,your,new,foals,on,bach,[END]
you,can't,let,things,beat,you,bart,you've,got,to,keep,going,on,[END]
i,know,i've,been,down,to,the,bottom,myself,[END]
you,can't,give,up,you,just,can't,[END]
john,morland's,eyes,were,like,cold,embers,[END]
i'm,going,to,england,tonight,on,the,eight,o'clock,boat,[END]
i,never,want,to,see,an,irish,face,or,hear,an,irish,voice,again,[END]
i,put,dijon,in,a,safe,place,while,i,sold,up,[END]
she's,entered,in,the,claiming,race,this,afternoon,and,when,it's,over,so,is,ireland,for,me,[END]
his,tragic,eyes,were,at,least,steady,[END]
and,dry,[END]
scarlett,almost,wished,he,would,begin,to,cry,again,[END]
at,least,he'd,felt,something,then,[END]
now,he,looked,as,if,he,would,never,be,able,to,feel,anything,ever,again,[END]
he,looked,dead,[END]
then,as,she,watched,a,transformation,took,place,[END]
sir,john,morland,baronet,came,back,to,life,by,effort,of,will,[END]
his,shoulders,firmed,and,his,mouth,curved,in,a,smile,[END]
his,eyes,even,had,a,hint,of,laughter,in,them,[END]
poor,scarlett,i,fear,i,rather,put,you,through,the,wringer,[END]
it,was,beastly,of,me,[END]
do,forgive,me,[END]
i'll,soldier,on,[END]
one,does,[END]
finish,your,coffee,there's,a,good,girl,and,come,along,to,the,track,with,me,[END]
i'll,put,a,fiver,on,dijon,for,you,and,you,can,buy,the,champagne,with,your,winnings,when,she,shows,her,heels,to,the,rest,of,the,field,[END]
scarlett,had,never,in,her,life,respected,anyone,as,much,as,she,did,bart,morland,at,that,moment,[END]
she,found,a,smile,to,meet,his,[END]
i'll,match,your,fiver,with,one,of,my,own,bart,and,we'll,have,champagne,too,[END]
done,[END]
she,spit,in,her,palm,held,it,out,[END]
morland,spat,slapped,smiled,[END]
good,girl,he,said,[END]
on,the,way,to,the,race,course,scarlett,tried,to,dredge,up,from,her,memory,what,she'd,heard,about,claiming,races,[END]
all,the,horses,running,were,for,sale,their,prices,set,by,their,owners,[END]
at,the,end,of,the,race,anyone,could,claim,any,one,of,the,horses,and,the,owner,was,obliged,to,sell,for,the,price,he'd,set,[END]
unlike,every,other,horse,sale,in,ireland,there,was,no,bargaining,[END]
unclaimed,horses,had,to,be,reclaimed,by,their,owners,[END]
scarlett,didn't,believe,for,a,minute,that,horses,couldn't,be,bought,before,the,race,began,no,matter,what,the,rules,were,[END]
when,they,reached,the,race,course,she,asked,bart,for,the,number,of,his,box,[END]
she,wanted,she,said,to,tidy,up,[END]
as,soon,as,he,was,gone,she,found,a,steward,and,got,directions,to,the,officials',office,where,the,claiming,would,take,place,[END]
she,hoped,bart,had,put,a,whopping,big,price,on,dijon,[END]
she,intended,to,buy,her,and,send,her,to,him,later,when,he,was,settled,in,england,[END]
what,do,you,mean,dijon's,already,been,claimed,[END]
that's,not,supposed,to,happen,until,after,the,race,[END]
the,top-hatted,official,was,careful,not,to,smile,[END]
you're,not,the,only,one,with,foresight,madam,[END]
it,must,be,an,american,trait,[END]
the,gentleman,who,put,in,the,claim,was,american,too,[END]
i'll,double,it,[END]
it,cannot,be,done,mrs,[END]
o'hara,[END]
suppose,i,bought,dijon,from,the,baronet,before,the,race,began,[END]
impossible,[END]
scarlett,felt,desperate,[END]
she,had,to,have,that,horse,for,bart,[END]
i,might,suggest,one,thing,[END]
oh,please,[END]
what,can,i,do,[END]
it's,really,awfully,important,[END]
you,might,ask,the,new,owner,if,he,would,be,willing,to,sell,[END]
yes,[END]
i'll,do,that,[END]
she'd,pay,the,man,a,king's,ransom,if,need,be,[END]
american,the,official,said,[END]
good,[END]
money,talks,in,america,[END]
will,you,point,him,out,to,me,[END]
the,top-hatted,man,consulted,a,sheet,of,paper,[END]
you,might,find,him,at,jury's,hotel,[END]
he's,listed,that,as,his,address,[END]
his,name,is,butler,[END]
scarlett,had,half-turned,to,leave,[END]
she,stumbled,to,get,her,balance,[END]
her,voice,was,strangely,thin,when,she,spoke,[END]
that,wouldn't,by,any,chance,be,mr,rhett,butler,[END]
it,seemed,to,take,an,eternity,for,the,man's,eyes,to,return,to,the,page,in,his,hand,for,him,to,read,for,him,to,speak,[END]
yes,that,is,the,name,[END]
rhett,[END]
here,[END]
bart,must,have,written,him,about,the,stables,about,selling,up,about,dijon,[END]
he,must,be,doing,what,i,was,going,to,do,[END]
he,came,all,the,way,from,america,to,help,a,friend,[END]
or,to,get,a,winner,for,the,next,charleston,races,[END]
it,doesn't,matter,[END]
even,poor,dear,tragic,bart,doesn't,matter,may,god,forgive,me,[END]
i'm,going,to,see,rhett,[END]
scarlett,realized,that,she,was,running,running,pushing,people,aside,without,apology,[END]
to,the,devil,with,everyone,everything,[END]
rhett,was,here,only,a,few,hundred,yards,away,[END]
box,eight,she,gasped,at,a,steward,[END]
he,gestured,[END]
scarlett,forced,herself,to,breathe,slowly,until,she,thought,she,must,appear,normal,[END]
no,one,could,see,her,heart,pounding,could,they,[END]
she,climbed,the,two,steps,into,the,bunting-trimmed,box,[END]
out,on,the,great,turfed,oval,twelve,brightly,shirted,riders,were,whipping,their,horses,towards,the,finish,[END]
all,around,scarlett,people,were,shouting,urging,on,the,horses,[END]
she,didn't,hear,a,thing,[END]
rhett,was,watching,the,race,through,field,glasses,[END]
even,ten,feet,away,she,could,smell,the,whiskey,on,him,[END]
he,was,rocking,on,his,feet,[END]
drunk,[END]
not,rhett,[END]
he,could,always,hold,his,liquor,[END]
had,bart's,disaster,upset,him,that,much,[END]
look,at,me,her,heart,begged,[END]
put,the,glasses,down,and,look,at,me,[END]
say,my,name,[END]
let,me,see,your,eyes,when,you,say,my,name,[END]
let,me,see,something,for,me,in,your,eyes,[END]
you,loved,me,once,[END]
cheering,and,groans,hailed,the,end,of,the,race,[END]
rhett,lowered,the,glasses,with,a,shaky,hand,[END]
damn,bart,that's,my,fourth,loser,in,a,row,he,laughed,[END]
hello,rhett,she,said,[END]
his,head,snapped,and,she,saw,his,dark,eyes,[END]
they,held,nothing,for,her,nothing,but,anger,[END]
why,hello,countess,[END]
his,eyes,raked,her,from,her,kidskin,boots,to,her,egret-plumed,hat,[END]
you,are,certainly,looking,expensive,[END]
he,turned,abruptly,towards,john,morland,[END]
you,should,have,warned,me,bart,so,i,could,stay,in,the,bar,[END]
let,me,by,[END]
and,he,sent,morland,staggering,as,he,pushed,out,of,the,box,on,the,side,away,from,scarlett,[END]
her,eyes,followed,him,hopelessly,as,he,plunged,into,the,crowds,[END]
then,they,filled,with,tears,[END]
john,morland,patted,her,shoulder,clumsily,[END]
i,say,scarlett,i,apologize,for,rhett,[END]
he's,had,too,much,to,drink,[END]
that's,two,of,us,you've,had,to,deal,with,today,[END]
not,much,fun,for,you,[END]
not,much,fun,[END]
is,that,what,bart,called,it,[END]
not,much,fun,to,be,trampled,on,[END]
i,wasn't,asking,for,much,[END]
just,to,say,hello,say,my,name,[END]
what,gives,rhett,the,right,to,be,angry,and,insulting,[END]
can't,i,marry,again,after,he,threw,me,out,like,trash,[END]
damn,him,[END]
damn,him,straight,to,hell,[END]
why,is,it,fine,and,dandy,for,him,to,divorce,me,so,he,can,marry,a,proper,charleston,girl,and,have,proper,charleston,babies,to,grow,up,into,more,proper,charlestonians,but,it's,oh-so-disgraceful,for,me,to,marry,again,and,give,his,child,all,the,things,that,he,should,be,the,one,to,give,her,[END]
i,hope,he,falls,over,his,own,drunken,feet,and,breaks,his,neck,she,said,to,bart,morland,[END]
don't,be,too,hard,on,rhett,scarlett,[END]
he,had,a,real,tragedy,last,spring,[END]
i'm,ashamed,to,feel,so,sorry,for,myself,about,the,stables,when,there,are,people,like,rhett,with,troubles,like,his,[END]
i,told,you,about,the,baby,didn't,i,[END]
beastly,awful,thing,happened,[END]
his,wife,died,having,it,then,the,baby,only,lived,for,four,days,[END]
what,[END]
what,[END]
say,that,again,[END]
she,shook,his,arm,so,fiercely,that,morland's,hat,fell,off,[END]
he,looked,at,her,with,confused,dismay,almost,fear,[END]
there,was,something,so,savage,about,her,something,stronger,than,anything,in,his,experience,[END]
he,repeated,that,rhett's,wife,and,child,were,dead,[END]
where,did,he,go,[END]
scarlett,cried,[END]
bart,you,must,know,you,must,have,some,idea,where,would,rhett,be,likely,to,go,[END]
i,don't,know,scarlett,[END]
the,bar,his,hotel,any,bar,anywhere,[END]

did,you,know,he,was,on,safari,with,the,viceroy,once,[END]
some,maharajah,fellow,was,host,[END]
i,must,say,i'm,surprised,he,got,so,drunk,[END]
i,don't,remember,him,even,keeping,up,with,me,[END]
he,took,me,to,my,hotel,last,night,put,me,to,bed,and,all,that,[END]
was,in,fine,fettle,a,strong,arm,to,lean,on,[END]
i,was,counting,on,him,actually,to,get,me,through,the,day,[END]
but,when,i,came,downstairs,this,morning,the,porter,fellow,told,me,rhett,had,ordered,coffee,and,a,newspaper,while,he,waited,for,me,then,suddenly,bolted,without,even,paying,[END]

he,loves,me,[END]
he,loves,me,[END]
that's,the,rightest,most,perfect,thing,i,could,hear,[END]
rhett,came,after,me,[END]
that's,why,he,came,to,ireland,[END]
not,for,bart's,horse,he,could,have,bought,her,and,all,the,rest,of,it,by,mail,[END]
he,came,for,me,as,soon,as,he,was,free,again,[END]

she,was,gone,[END]
americans,[END]
fascinating,types,but,he'd,never,understand,them,[END]
she'd,missed,the,through,train,to,dublin,by,ten,minutes,[END]
the,next,one,wouldn't,leave,until,four,[END]
scarlett,bit,her,lip,in,frustration,[END]
when,is,the,next,train,east,to,anywhere,[END]
the,man,behind,the,brass,grille,was,maddeningly,slow,[END]
you,could,go,to,ennis,now,if,you,had,a,mind,to,[END]

madam,[END]
scarlett,was,shedding,tears,all,over,the,uniform,of,the,man,at,the,barrier,to,the,track,[END]
i,only,got,the,telegram,two,minutes,ago,my,husband's,been,run,over,by,a,milk,dray,i've,got,to,get,that,train,to,kildare,[END]
it,would,take,her,more,than,halfway,to,trim,and,ballyhara,[END]
she'd,walk,the,rest,of,the,way,if,she,had,to,[END]
every,stop,was,torture,[END]
why,couldn't,they,hurry,[END]
hurry,hurry,hurry,said,her,mind,with,the,clack-clack,of,the,wheels,[END]
her,case,was,in,the,best,suite,in,galway's,railway,motel,in,the,convent,sore-eyed,nuns,were,putting,the,final,tiny,stitches,into,exquisite,lace,[END]
none,of,it,mattered,[END]
she,must,be,home,waiting,when,rhett,arrived,[END]
if,only,john,morland,hadn't,taken,so,long,to,tell,her,about,everything,she,could,have,been,on,the,dublin,train,[END]

scarlett,raced,to,the,tunnel,while,rhett,calmed,the,horses,[END]

how,frightened,she,must,be,my,fearless,little,cat,[END]
she's,never,nestled,close,to,me,this,way,in,her,life,[END]
scarlett,blew,softly,on,cat's,neck,aroon,aroon,and,rocked,her,baby,in,her,lap,from,side,to,side,as,if,her,arms,were,the,safe,tall,sides,of,a,sturdy,cradle,[END]

scarlett,held,her,breath,[END]
the,voices,were,so,close,so,inhuman,so,like,the,yowling,of,wild,beasts,[END]
she,looked,at,the,outline,of,rhett's,shadow,in,the,darkness,beside,the,opening,to,the,ladder,[END]
she,sensed,his,controlled,alertness,[END]
he,could,kill,any,man,who,dared,to,climb,the,ladder,but,what,could,stop,a,bullet,if,he,showed,himself,[END]
rhett,[END]
oh,rhett,be,careful,[END]
scarlett,felt,a,flooding,tingling,happiness,in,every,part,of,her,[END]
rhett,had,come,[END]
he,loved,her,[END]
the,mob,reached,the,tower,and,stopped,[END]
the,tower,[END]
they're,in,the,tower,[END]
the,shouts,were,like,the,baying,of,hounds,at,the,death,of,the,fox,[END]
scarlett's,heart,hammered,in,her,ears,[END]
then,o'neill's,voice,cut,through,the,others,[END]
not,there,see,the,rope,still,hanging,down,[END]
the,o'hara's,clever,she'd,be,tricking,us,that,way,another,argued,and,then,all,joined,in,[END]

the,changeling,talks,with,the,ghost,up,there,they,do,be,saying,[END]
he's,hanging,still,his,eyes,open,cutting,right,through,you,like,a,knife,[END]
me,old,mother,saw,him,walking,on,all,hallows',the,rope,was,dragging,behind,blighting,all,it,touched,to,shrivelled,backness,[END]
i,feel,a,cold,wind,down,my,back,i'm,leaving,this,haunted,place,[END]
but,if,they're,up,there,the,o'hara,and,the,changeling,[END]
we,need,to,kill,them,for,the,ill,they've,done,us,[END]
ach,isn't,slow,starving,a,death,as,good,as,burning,[END]
put,your,torches,to,the,ropes,then,lads,[END]
they'll,not,get,down,without,breaking,their,necks,[END]
scarlett,smelled,the,rope,burning,and,she,wanted,to,shout,in,jubilation,[END]
they,were,safe,[END]
no,one,could,come,up,now,[END]
tomorrow,she,could,make,a,rope,from,strips,of,the,quilts,on,the,floor,beneath,her,[END]
it,was,over,[END]
they'd,make,their,way,to,trim,somehow,when,daylight,came,[END]
they,were,safe,[END]
she,bit,her,lips,to,stop,herself,from,laughing,from,crying,from,calling,rhett's,name,so,she,could,feel,it,in,her,throat,hear,it,in,the,air,hear,his,deep,sure,laughing,response,hear,his,voice,speak,her,name,[END]
it,was,a,long,time,before,the,voices,and,the,sound,of,trampling,boots,faded,completely,away,[END]
even,then,rhett,did,not,speak,[END]
he,came,to,her,and,to,cat,and,held,them,both,in,his,strong,embrace,[END]
it,was,enough,[END]
scarlett,rested,her,head,against,him,and,it,was,all,she,wanted,[END]
much,later,when,cat's,heavy,looseness,told,of,deep,sleep,scarlett,laid,her,down,and,covered,her,with,a,quilt,[END]
then,she,turned,to,rhett,[END]
her,arms,circled,his,neck,and,his,lips,found,hers,[END]
so,that's,what,it,means,she,whispered,shakily,when,the,kiss,ended,[END]
why,mr,butler,you,fairly,take,my,breath,away,[END]
muted,laughter,rumbled,in,his,chest,[END]
he,unlocked,her,embrace,and,gently,separated,them,[END]
come,away,from,the,baby,[END]
we,have,to,talk,[END]
his,low,quiet,words,did,not,make,cat,stir,[END]
rhett,tucked,the,quilt,closely,around,her,[END]
over,here,scarlett,he,said,[END]
he,backed,out,of,the,niche,and,walked,to,a,window,[END]
his,profile,was,like,a,hawk's,against,the,fire-lit,sky,[END]
scarlett,followed,him,[END]
she,felt,as,if,she,could,follow,him,to,the,ends,of,the,earth,[END]
he,had,only,to,call,her,name,[END]
no,one,had,ever,said,her,name,quite,the,way,rhett,did,[END]
we'll,get,away,she,said,confidently,when,she,was,beside,him,[END]
there's,a,hidden,path,from,the,witch's,cottage,[END]
from,what,[END]
she's,not,really,a,witch,at,least,i,don't,think,so,and,it,doesn't,matter,anyhow,[END]
she'll,show,us,the,path,[END]
or,cat,will,know,one,she's,in,the,woods,all,the,time,[END]
is,there,anything,cat,doesn't,know,[END]
she,doesn't,know,you're,her,father,[END]
scarlett,saw,the,muscles,tighten,in,his,jaw,[END]
some,day,i'll,beat,you,black,and,blue,for,not,telling,me,[END]
i,was,going,to,but,you,fixed,it,so,i,couldn't,[END]
scarlett,said,hotly,[END]
you,divorced,me,when,it,was,supposed,to,be,impossible,and,then,before,i,could,turn,around,you,had,gone,and,gotten,married,[END]
what,was,i,supposed,to,do,[END]
hang,around,your,front,door,with,my,baby,wrapped,in,my,shawl,like,some,kind,of,fallen,woman,[END]
how,could,you,do,such,a,thing,[END]
that,was,rotten,of,you,rhett,[END]
rotten,of,me,[END]
after,you,went,charging,off,to,god,knows,where,without,a,word,to,anybody,[END]
my,mother,was,worried,sick,literally,ill,until,your,aunt,eulalie,told,her,you,were,in,savannah,[END]
but,i,left,her,a,note,[END]
i,wouldn't,upset,your,mother,for,the,world,[END]
i,love,miss,eleanor,[END]
rhett,caught,her,chin,in,his,hand,turned,and,held,her,face,in,the,uneven,garish,light,from,the,window,[END]
suddenly,he,kissed,her,then,he,put,his,arms,around,her,and,held,her,to,him,[END]
it,happened,again,he,said,[END]
my,darling,hot-tempered,pigheaded,wonderful,infuriating,scarlett,do,you,realize,we've,been,through,this,before,[END]
missed,signals,missed,chances,misunderstandings,that,need,never,have,happened,[END]
we've,got,to,stop,it,[END]
i'm,too,old,for,all,this,drama,[END]
he,buried,his,lips,and,his,laughter,in,her,tangled,hair,[END]
scarlett,closed,her,eyes,and,rested,against,his,broad,chest,[END]
safe,in,the,tower,safe,in,rhett's,embrace,she,could,afford,her,fatigue,and,relief,[END]
luxurious,weak,tears,of,exhaustion,ran,down,her,cheeks,and,her,shoulders,slumped,[END]
rhett,held,her,close,and,stroked,her,back,[END]
after,a,long,time,his,arms,tightened,with,demand,and,scarlett,felt,new,thrilling,energy,race,through,her,veins,[END]
she,lifted,her,face,to,his,and,there,was,neither,rest,nor,safety,in,the,blinding,ecstasy,she,felt,when,their,lips,met,[END]
her,fingers,combed,his,big,hair,grabbed,held,his,head,down,and,his,mouth,on,hers,until,she,felt,faint,and,at,the,same,time,strong,and,fully,alive,[END]
only,the,fear,of,waking,cat,kept,the,wild,cry,of,joy,from,bursting,out,of,her,throat,[END]
when,their,kisses,grew,too,urgent,rhett,broke,away,[END]
he,gripped,the,stone,sill,of,the,window,with,corded,white-knuckled,hands,[END]
his,breathing,was,ragged,[END]
there,are,limits,to,a,man's,control,my,pet,he,said,and,the,one,thing,i,can,think,of,that's,more,uncomfortable,than,a,wet,beach,is,a,stone,floor,[END]
tell,me,you,love,me,scarlett,demanded,[END]
rhett,grinned,[END]
what,makes,you,think,that,[END]
i,come,to,ireland,on,those,damned,clanking,chugging,steamships,so,often,because,i,like,the,climate,here,so,much,[END]
she,laughed,[END]
then,she,hit,him,on,the,shoulder,with,both,fists,[END]
tell,me,you,love,me,[END]
rhett,trapped,her,wrists,in,a,circle,of,his,fingers,[END]
i,love,you,you,abusive,wench,[END]
his,expression,hardened,[END]
and,i'll,kill,that,bastard,fenton,if,he,tries,to,take,you,from,me,[END]
oh,rhett,don't,be,silly,[END]
i,don't,even,like,luke,[END]
he's,a,horrible,cold-blooded,monster,[END]
i,was,only,going,to,marry,him,because,i,couldn't,have,you,[END]
rhett's,skeptical,raised,eyebrows,forced,scarlett,to,continue,[END]
well,i,did,sort,of,like,the,idea,of,london,[END]
and,being,a,countess,[END]
and,paying,him,back,for,insulting,me,by,marrying,him,and,getting,all,his,money,for,cat,[END]
rhett's,black,eyes,glinted,with,amusement,[END]
he,kissed,scarlett's,imprisoned,hands,[END]
i've,missed,you,he,said,[END]
they,talked,through,the,night,sitting,close,together,on,the,cold,floor,with,their,hands,clasped,[END]
rhett,could,not,get,enough,of,learning,about,cat,and,scarlett,delighted,in,telling,him,delighted,in,his,pride,in,what,he,learned,[END]
i'll,do,my,best,to,make,her,love,me,more,than,you,he,warned,[END]
you,don't,stand,a,chance,scarlett,said,confidently,[END]
we,understand,each,other,cat,and,i,and,she,won't,put,up,with,babying,and,spoiling,from,you,[END]
how,about,adoring,[END]

i,did,the,matchmaking,[END]
i,sent,billy's,mother,to,atlanta,[END]
the,story,of,harriet,kelly,led,to,the,news,that,india,wilkes,had,finally,found,a,husband,which,led,to,the,news,that,rosemary,was,still,a,spinster,[END]
and,likely,to,stay,one,rhett,said,[END]
she,is,at,dunmore,landing,plowing,money,into,restoring,the,rice,fields,and,getting,to,be,more,like,julia,ashley,every,day,[END]
is,she,happy,[END]
she,glows,with,it,[END]
she,would,have,packed,my,things,herself,if,it,would,have,hurried,my,departure,[END]
scarlett's,eyes,questioned,him,[END]
yes,rhett,said,he,had,left,charleston,[END]
it,had,been,a,mistake,to,think,that,he,could,ever,be,content,there,[END]
i'll,go,back,[END]
charleston,never,gets,out,of,the,blood,of,a,charlestonian,but,i'll,go,to,visit,not,to,stay,[END]
he,had,tried,he'd,told,himself,that,he,wanted,the,stability,of,family,and,tradition,[END]
but,in,the,end,he,began,to,feel,the,nagging,pain,where,his,wings,had,been,clipped,[END]
he,couldn't,fly,[END]
he,was,earthbound,ancestor,saint,cecilia,bound,charleston-bound,[END]
he,loved,charleston,god,how,he,loved,it,its,beauty,and,its,grace,and,its,soft-scented,salt,breezes,and,its,courage,in,the,face,of,loss,and,ruin,[END]
but,it,wasn't,enough,[END]
he,needed,challenge,risk,some,kind,of,blockade,to,be,run,[END]
scarlett,breathed,a,quiet,sigh,[END]
she,hated,charleston,and,she,was,sure,cat,would,too,[END]
thank,heaven,rhett,wasn't,going,to,take,them,back,there,[END]
in,a,quiet,voice,she,asked,about,anne,[END]
rhett,was,silent,for,what,seemed,to,her,a,very,long,time,[END]
then,he,spoke,and,his,voice,was,heavy,with,sorrow,[END]
she,deserved,better,than,me,better,than,life,granted,her,[END]
anne,had,a,quiet,bravery,and,strength,that,puts,every,so-called,hero,to,shame,[END]
i,was,more,than,half,crazy,about,that,time,[END]
you'd,gone,and,no,one,knew,where,you,were,[END]
i,believed,you,were,punishing,me,so,to,punish,you,and,to,prove,that,i,didn't,care,about,your,leaving,i,got,the,divorce,[END]
an,amputation,[END]
rhett,stared,into,space,unseeing,[END]
scarlett,waited,[END]
he,prayed,he,hadn't,hurt,anne,he,said,[END]
he'd,searched,his,memory,and,his,soul,and,he,could,find,no,willful,hurt,[END]
she,was,too,young,and,she,loved,him,too,much,to,suspect,that,tenderness,and,affection,were,only,the,shadows,of,a,man's,loving,[END]
he,would,never,know,what,blame,he,should,take,for,marrying,her,[END]
she'd,been,happy,[END]
one,of,the,injustices,of,the,world,was,that,it,was,so,easy,to,make,the,innocent,and,caring,ones,happy,with,so,little,[END]
scarlett,put,her,head,on,his,shoulder,[END]
it's,a,lot,making,somebody,happy,she,said,[END]
i,didn't,understand,that,until,cat,was,born,[END]
i,didn't,understand,a,lot,of,things,[END]
somehow,i,learned,from,her,[END]
rhett,rested,his,cheek,on,her,head,[END]
you've,changed,scarlett,[END]

stop,laughing,at,me,rhett,butler,no,don't,[END]
i,like,it,even,when,it,makes,me,mad,[END]
she,sniffed,the,air,[END]
it's,raining,[END]
that,should,finish,off,the,fires,[END]
when,the,sun,comes,up,we'll,be,able,to,see,if,anything's,left,[END]
we,should,try,and,get,some,sleep,[END]
we're,going,to,be,very,busy,in,a,few,hours,[END]
she,nestled,her,head,into,the,hollow,of,his,neck,and,yawned,[END]
while,she,slept,rhett,moved,her,lifted,her,into,his,arms,and,sat,down,again,holding,her,as,she,had,held,cat,[END]
the,gentle,irish,rain,made,a,curtain,of,soft,silence,around,the,old,stone,tower,[END]
at,sunrise,scarlett,stirred,and,woke,[END]
when,she,opened,her,eyes,the,first,thing,she,saw,was,rhett's,beard-shadowed,hollow-eyed,face,and,she,smiled,contentedly,[END]
then,she,stretched,moaning,softly,[END]
i,hurt,all,over,scarlett,complained,[END]
her,brow,wrinkled,[END]
and,i'm,starving,to,death,[END]
consistency,thy,name,is,woman,murmured,rhett,[END]
get,up,my,love,you're,breaking,my,legs,[END]
they,walked,carefully,to,cat's,hideaway,[END]
it,was,dark,but,they,could,hear,her,soft,snoring,[END]
