chapter,i
scarlett,o'hara,was,not,beautiful,but,men,seldom,realized,it,when,caught,by,her,charm,as,the,tarleton,twins,were
in,her,face,were,too,sharply,blended,the,delicate,features,of,her,mother,a,coast,aristocrat,of,french,descent,and,the,heavy,ones,of,her,florid,irish,father
but,it,was,an,arresting,face,pointed,of,chin,square,of,jaw
her,eyes,were,pale,green,without,a,touch,of,hazel,starred,with,bristly,black,lashes,and,slightly,tilted,at,the,ends
above,them,her,thick,black,brows,slanted,upward,cutting,a,startling,oblique,line,in,her,magnolia-white,skin,that,skin,so,prized,by,southern,women,and,so,carefully,guarded,with,bonnets,veils,and,mittens,against,hot,georgia,suns
seated,with,stuart,and,brent,tarleton,in,the,cool,shade,of,the,porch,of,tara,her,father's,plantation,that,bright,april,afternoon,of,1861,she,made,a,pretty,picture
her,new,green,flowered-muslin,dress,spread,its,twelve,yards,of,billowing,material,over,her,hoops,and,exactly,matched,the,flat-heeled,green,morocco,slippers,her,father,had,recently,brought,her,from,atlanta
the,dress,set,off,to,perfection,the,seventeen-inch,waist,the,smallest,in,three,counties,and,the,tightly,fitting,basque,showed,breasts,well,matured,for,her,sixteen,years
but,for,all,the,modesty,of,her,spreading,skirts,the,demureness,of,hair,netted,smoothly,into,a,chignon,and,the,quietness,of,small,white,hands,folded,in,her,lap,her,true,self,was,poorly,concealed
the,green,eyes,in,the,carefully,sweet,face,were,turbulent,willful,lusty,with,life,distinctly,at,variance,with,her,decorous,demeanor
her,manners,had,been,imposed,upon,her,by,her,mother's,gentle,admonitions,and,the,sterner,discipline,of,her,mammy,her,eyes,were,her,own
on,either,side,of,her,the,twins,lounged,easily,in,their,chairs,squinting,at,the,sunlight,through,tall,mint-garnished,glasses,as,they,laughed,and,talked,their,long,legs,booted,to,the,knee,and,thick,with,saddle,muscles,crossed,negligently
nineteen,years,old,six,feet,two,inches,tall,long,of,bone,and,hard,of,muscle,with,sunburned,faces,and,deep,auburn,hair,their,eyes,merry,and,arrogant,their,bodies,clothed,in,identical,blue,coats,and,mustard-colored,breeches,they,were,as,much,alike,as,two,bolls,of,cotton
outside,the,late,afternoon,sun,slanted,down,in,the,yard,throwing,into,gleaming,brightness,the,dogwood,trees,that,were,solid,masses,of,white,blossoms,against,the,background,of,new,green
the,twins',horses,were,hitched,in,the,driveway,big,animals,red,as,their,masters',hair,and,around,the,horses',legs,quarreled,the,pack,of,lean,nervous,possum,hounds,that,accompanied,stuart,and,brent,wherever,they,went
a,little,aloof,as,became,an,aristocrat,lay,a,black-spotted,carriage,dog,muzzle,on,paws,patiently,waiting,for,the,boys,to,go,home,to,supper
between,the,hounds,and,the,horses,and,the,twins,there,was,a,kinship,deeper,than,that,of,their,constant,companionship
they,were,all,healthy,thoughtless,young,animals,sleek,graceful,high-spirited,the,boys,as,mettlesome,as,the,horses,they,rode,mettlesome,and,dangerous,but,withal,sweet-tempered,to,those,who,knew,how,to,handle,them
although,born,to,the,ease,of,plantation,life,waited,on,hand,and,foot,since,infancy,the,faces,of,the,three,on,the,porch,were,neither,slack,nor,soft
they,had,the,vigor,and,alertness,of,country,people,who,have,spent,all,their,lives,in,the,open,and,troubled,their,heads,very,little,with,dull,things,in,books
life,in,the,north,georgia,county,of,clayton,was,still,new,and,according,to,the,standards,of,augusta,savannah,and,charleston,a,little,crude
the,more,sedate,and,older,sections,of,the,south,looked,down,their,noses,at,the,up-country,georgians,but,here,in,north,georgia,a,lack,of,the,niceties,of,classical,education,carried,no,shame,provided,a,man,was,smart,in,the,things,that,mattered
and,raising,good,cotton,riding,well,shooting,straight,dancing,lightly,squiring,the,ladies,with,elegance,and,carrying,one's,liquor,like,a,gentleman,were,the,things,that,mattered
in,these,accomplishments,the,twins,excelled,and,they,were,equally,outstanding,in,their,notorious,inability,to,learn,anything,contained,between,the,covers,of,books
their,family,had,more,money,more,horses,more,slaves,than,any,one,else,in,the,county,but,the,boys,had,less,grammar,than,most,of,their,poor,cracker,neighbors
it,was,for,this,precise,reason,that,stuart,and,brent,were,idling,on,the,porch,of,tara,this,april,afternoon
they,had,just,been,expelled,from,the,university,of,georgia,the,fourth,university,that,had,thrown,them,out,in,two,years,and,their,older,brothers,tom,and,boyd,had,come,home,with,them,because,they,refused,to,remain,at,an,institution,where,the,twins,were,not,welcome
stuart,and,brent,considered,their,latest,expulsion,a,fine,joke,and,scarlett,who,had,not,willingly,opened,a,book,since,leaving,the,fayetteville,female,academy,the,year,before,thought,it,just,as,amusing,as,they,did
i,know,you,two,don't,care,about,being,expelled,or,tom,either,she,said
but,what,about,boyd
he's,kind,of,set,on,getting,an,education,and,you,two,have,pulled,him,out,of,the,university,of,virginia,and,alabama,and,south,carolina,and,now,georgia
he'll,never,get,finished,at,this,rate
oh,he,can,read,law,in,judge,parmalee's,office,over,in,fayetteville,answered,brent,carelessly
besides,it,don't,matter,much
we'd,have,had,to,come,home,before,the,term,was,out,anyway
why
the,war,goose
the,war's,going,to,start,any,day,and,you,don't,suppose,any,of,us,would,stay,in,college,with,a,war,going,on,do,you
you,know,there,isn't,going,to,be,any,war,said,scarlett,bored
it's,all,just,talk
why,ashley,wilkes,and,his,father,told,pa,just,last,week,that,our,commissioners,in,washington,would,come,to,to,an,amicable,agreement,with,mr,lincoln,about,the,confederacy
and,anyway,the,yankees,are,too,scared,of,us,to,fight
there,won't,be,any,war,and,i'm,tired,of,hearing,about,it
not,going,to,be,any,war
cried,the,twins,indignantly,as,though,they,had,been,defrauded
why,honey,of,course,there's,going,to,be,a,war,said,stuart
the,yankees,may,be,scared,of,us,but,after,the,way,general,beauregard,shelled,them,out,of,fort,sumter,day,before,yesterday,they'll,have,to,fight,or,stand,branded,as,cowards,before,the,whole,world
why,the,confederacy
scarlett,made,a,mouth,of,bored,impatience
if,you,say,'war',just,once,more,i'll,go,in,the,house,and,shut,the,door
i've,never,gotten,so,tired,of,any,one,word,in,my,life,as,'war,',unless,it's,'secession,'
pa,talks,war,morning,noon,and,night,and,all,the,gentlemen,who,come,to,see,him,shout,about,fort,sumter,and,states',rights,and,abe,lincoln,till,i,get,so,bored,i,could,scream
and,that's,all,the,boys,talk,about,too,that,and,their,old,troop
there,hasn't,been,any,fun,at,any,party,this,spring,because,the,boys,can't,talk,about,anything,else
i'm,mighty,glad,georgia,waited,till,after,christmas,before,it,seceded,or,it,would,have,ruined,the,christmas,parties,too
if,you,say,'war',again,i'll,go,in,the,house
she,meant,what,she,said,for,she,could,never,long,endure,any,conversation,of,which,she,was,not,the,chief,subject
but,she,smiled,when,she,spoke,consciously,deepening,her,dimple,and,fluttering,her,bristly,black,lashes,as,swiftly,as,butterflies',wings
the,boys,were,enchanted,as,she,had,intended,them,to,be,and,they,hastened,to,apologize,for,boring,her
they,thought,none,the,less,of,her,for,her,lack,of,interest
indeed,they,thought,more
war,was,men's,business,not,ladies',and,they,took,her,attitude,as,evidence,of,her,femininity
having,maneuvered,them,away,from,the,boring,subject,of,war,she,went,back,with,interest,to,their,immediate,situation
what,did,your,mother,say,about,you,two,being,expelled,again
the,boys,looked,uncomfortable,recalling,their,mother's,conduct,three,months,ago,when,they,had,come,home,by,request,from,the,university,of,virginia
well,said,stuart,she,hasn't,had,a,chance,to,say,anything,yet
tom,and,us,left,home,early,this,morning,before,she,got,up,and,tom's,laying,out,over,at,the,fontaines',while,we,came,over,here
didn't,she,say,anything,when,you,got,home,last,night
we,were,in,luck,last,night
just,before,we,got,home,that,new,stallion,ma,got,in,kentucky,last,month,was,brought,in,and,the,place,was,in,a,stew
the,big,brute,he's,a,grand,horse,scarlett,you,must,tell,your,pa,to,come,over,and,see,him,right,away,he'd,already,bitten,a,hunk,out,of,his,groom,on,the,way,down,here,and,he'd,trampled,two,of,ma's,darkies,who,met,the,train,at,jonesboro
and,just,before,we,got,home,he'd,about,kicked,the,stable,down,and,half-killed,strawberry,ma's,old,stallion
when,we,got,home,ma,was,out,in,the,stable,with,a,sackful,of,sugar,smoothing,him,down,and,doing,it,mighty,well,too
the,darkies,were,hanging,from,the,rafters,popeyed,they,were,so,scared,but,ma,was,talking,to,the,horse,like,he,was,folks,and,he,was,eating,out,of,her,hand
there,ain't,nobody,like,ma,with,a,horse
and,when,she,saw,us,she,said,'in,heaven's,name,what,are,you,four,doing,home,again
you're,worse,than,the,plagues,of,egypt,'
and,then,the,horse,began,snorting,and,rearing,and,she,said,'get,out,of,here
can't,you,see,he's,nervous,the,big,darling
i'll,tend,to,you,four,in,the,morning,'
so,we,went,to,bed,and,this,morning,we,got,away,before,she,could,catch,us,and,left,boyd,to,handle,her
do,you,suppose,she'll,hit,boyd
scarlett,like,the,rest,of,the,county,could,never,get,used,to,the,way,small,mrs,tarleton,bullied,her,grown,sons,and,laid,her,riding,crop,on,their,backs,if,the,occasion,seemed,to,warrant,it
beatrice,tarleton,was,a,busy,woman,having,on,her,hands,not,only,a,large,cotton,plantation,a,hundred,negroes,and,eight,children,but,the,largest,horse-breeding,farm,in,the,state,as,well
she,was,hot-tempered,and,easily,plagued,by,the,frequent,scrapes,of,her,four,sons,and,while,no,one,was,permitted,to,whip,a,horse,or,a,slave,she,felt,that,a,lick,now,and,then,didn't,do,the,boys,any,harm
of,course,she,won't,hit,boyd
she,never,did,beat,boyd,much,because,he's,the,oldest,and,besides,he's,the,runt,of,the,litter,said,stuart,proud,of,his,six,feet,two
that's,why,we,left,him,at,home,to,explain,things,to,her
god'lmighty,ma,ought,to,stop,licking,us
we're,nineteen,and,tom's,twenty-one,and,she,acts,like,we're,six,years,old
will,your,mother,ride,the,new,horse,to,the,wilkes,barbecue,tomorrow
she,wants,to,but,pa,says,he's,too,dangerous
and,anyway,the,girls,won't,let,her
they,said,they,were,going,to,have,her,go,to,one,party,at,least,like,a,lady,riding,in,the,carriage
i,hope,it,doesn't,rain,tomorrow,said,scarlett
it's,rained,nearly,every,day,for,a,week
there's,nothing,worse,than,a,barbecue,turned,into,an,indoor,picnic
oh,it'll,be,clear,tomorrow,and,hot,as,june,said,stuart
look,at,that,sunset
i,never,saw,one,redder
you,can,always,tell,weather,by,sunsets
they,looked,out,across,the,endless,acres,of,gerald,o'hara's,newly,plowed,cotton,fields,toward,the,red,horizon
now,that,the,sun,was,setting,in,a,welter,of,crimson,behind,the,hills,across,the,flint,river,the,warmth,of,the,april,day,was,ebbing,into,a,faint,but,balmy,chill
spring,had,come,early,that,year,with,warm,quick,rains,and,sudden,frothing,of,pink,peach,blossoms,and,dogwood,dappling,with,white,stars,the,dark,river,swamp,and,far-off,hills
already,the,plowing,was,nearly,finished,and,the,bloody,glory,of,the,sunset,colored,the,fresh-cut,furrows,of,red,georgia,clay,to,even,redder,hues
the,moist,hungry,earth,waiting,upturned,for,the,cotton,seeds,showed,pinkish,on,the,sandy,tops,of,furrows,vermilion,and,scarlet,and,maroon,where,shadows,lay,along,the,sides,of,the,trenches
the,whitewashed,brick,plantation,house,seemed,an,island,set,in,a,wild,red,sea,a,sea,of,spiraling,curving,crescent,billows,petrified,suddenly,at,the,moment,when,the,pink-tipped,waves,were,breaking,into,surf
for,here,were,no,long,straight,furrows,such,as,could,be,seen,in,the,yellow,clay,fields,of,the,flat,middle,georgia,country,or,in,the,lush,black,earth,of,the,coastal,plantations
the,rolling,foothill,country,of,north,georgia,was,plowed,in,a,million,curves,to,keep,the,rich,earth,from,washing,down,into,the,river,bottoms
it,was,a,savagely,red,land,blood-colored,after,rains,brick,dust,in,droughts,the,best,cotton,land,in,the,world
it,was,a,pleasant,land,of,white,houses,peaceful,plowed,fields,and,sluggish,yellow,rivers,but,a,land,of,contrasts,of,brightest,sun,glare,and,densest,shade
the,plantation,clearings,and,miles,of,cotton,fields,smiled,up,to,a,warm,sun,placid,complacent
at,their,edges,rose,the,virgin,forests,dark,and,cool,even,in,the,hottest,noons,mysterious,a,little,sinister,the,soughing,pines,seeming,to,wait,with,an,age-old,patience,to,threaten,with,soft,sighs,be,careful
be,careful
we,had,you,once
we,can,take,you,back,again
to,the,ears,of,the,three,on,the,porch,came,the,sounds,of,hooves,the,jingling,of,harness,chains,and,the,shrill,careless,laughter,of,negro,voices,as,the,field,hands,and,mules,came,in,from,the,fields
from,within,the,house,floated,the,soft,voice,of,scarlett's,mother,ellen,o'hara,as,she,called,to,the,little,black,girl,who,carried,her,basket,of,keys
the,high-pitched,childish,voice,answered,yas'm,and,there,were,sounds,of,footsteps,going,out,the,back,way,toward,the,smokehouse,where,ellen,would,ration,out,the,food,to,the,home-coming,hands
there,was,the,click,of,china,and,the,rattle,of,silver,as,pork,the,valet-butler,of,tara,laid,the,table,for,supper
at,these,last,sounds,the,twins,realized,it,was,time,they,were,starting,home
but,they,were,loath,to,face,their,mother,and,they,lingered,on,the,porch,of,tara,momentarily,expecting,scarlett,to,give,them,an,invitation,to,supper
look,scarlett
about,tomorrow,said,brent
just,because,we've,been,away,and,didn't,know,about,the,barbecue,and,the,ball,that's,no,reason,why,we,shouldn't,get,plenty,of,dances,tomorrow,night
you,haven't,promised,them,all,have,you
well,i,have
how,did,i,know,you,all,would,be,home
i,couldn't,risk,being,a,wallflower,just,waiting,on,you,two

the,boys,laughed,uproariously
look,honey
you've,got,to,give,me,the,first,waltz,and,stu,the,last,one,and,you've,got,to,eat,supper,with,us
we'll,sit,on,the,stair,landing,like,we,did,at,the,last,ball,and,get,mammy,jincy,to,come,tell,our,fortunes,again
i,don't,like,mammy,jincy's,fortunes
you,know,she,said,i,was,going,to,marry,a,gentleman,with,jet-black,hair,and,a,long,black,mustache,and,i,don't,like,black-haired,gentlemen

grinned,brent
now,come,on,promise,us,all,the,waltzes,and,the,supper
if,you'll,promise,we'll,tell,you,a,secret,said,stuart
what
cried,scarlett,alert,as,a,child,at,the,word

i,do,and,a,sillier,old,lady,i,never,met,in,all,my,life
well,when,we,were,in,atlanta,yesterday,waiting,for,the,home,train,her,carriage,went,by,the,depot,and,she,stopped,and,talked,to,us,and,she,told,us,there,was,going,to,be,an,engagement,announced,tomorrow,night,at,the,wilkes,ball
oh
i,know,about,that,said,scarlett,in,disappointment
that,silly,nephew,of,hers,charlie,hamilton,and,honey,wilkes
everybody's,known,for,years,that,they'd,get,married,some,time,even,if,he,did,seem,kind,of,lukewarm,about,it
do,you,think,he's,silly
questioned,brent
last,christmas,you,sure,let,him,buzz,round,you,plenty
i,couldn't,help,him,buzzing,scarlett,shrugged,negligently
i,think,he's,an,awful,sissy
besides,it,isn't,his,engagement,that's,going,to,be,announced,said,stuart,triumphantly
it's,ashley's,to,charlie's,sister,miss,melanie
scarlett's,face,did,not,change,but,her,lips,went,white,like,a,person,who,has,received,a,stunning,blow,without,warning,and,who,in,the,first,moments,of,shock,does,not,realize,what,has,happened
so,still,was,her,face,as,she,stared,at,stuart,that,he,never,analytic,took,it,for,granted,that,she,was,merely,surprised,and,very,interested
miss,pitty,told,us,they,hadn't,intended,announcing,it,till,next,year,because,miss,melly,hasn't,been,very,well,but,with,all,the,war,talk,going,around,everybody,in,both,families,thought,it,would,be,better,to,get,married,soon
so,it's,to,be,announced,tomorrow,night,at,the,supper,intermission
now,scarlett,we've,told,you,the,secret,so,you've,got,to,promise,to,eat,supper,with,us
of,course,i,will,scarlett,said,automatically
and,all,the,waltzes

i'll,bet,the,other,boys,will,be,hopping,mad
let,'em,be,mad,said,brent
we,two,can,handle,'em
look,scarlett
sit,with,us,at,the,barbecue,in,the,morning
what
stuart,repeated,his,request
of,course
the,twins,looked,at,each,other,jubilantly,but,with,some,surprise
although,they,considered,themselves,scarlett's,favored,suitors,they,had,never,before,gained,tokens,of,this,favor,so,easily
usually,she,made,them,beg,and,plead,while,she,put,them,off,refusing,to,give,a,yes,or,no,answer,laughing,if,they,sulked,growing,cool,if,they,became,angry
and,here,she,had,practically,promised,them,the,whole,of,tomorrow,seats,by,her,at,the,barbecue,all,the,waltzes,and,they'd,see,to,it,that,the,dances,were,all,waltzes
and,the,supper,intermission
this,was,worth,getting,expelled,from,the,university
filled,with,new,enthusiasm,by,their,success,they,lingered,on,talking,about,the,barbecue,and,the,ball,and,ashley,wilkes,and,melanie,hamilton,interrupting,each,other,making,jokes,and,laughing,at,them,hinting,broadly,for,invitations,to,supper
some,time,had,passed,before,they,realized,that,scarlett,was,having,very,little,to,say
the,atmosphere,had,somehow,changed
just,how,the,twins,did,not,know,but,the,fine,glow,had,gone,out,of,the,afternoon
scarlett,seemed,to,be,paying,little,attention,to,what,they,said,although,she,made,the,correct,answers
sensing,something,they,could,not,understand,baffled,and,annoyed,by,it,the,twins,struggled,along,for,a,while,and,then,rose,reluctantly,looking,at,their,watches
the,sun,was,low,across,the,new-plowed,fields,and,the,tall,woods,across,the,river,were,looming,blackly,in,silhouette
chimney,swallows,were,darting,swiftly,across,the,yard,and,chickens,ducks,and,turkeys,were,waddling,and,strutting,and,straggling,in,from,the,fields
stuart,bellowed,jeems
and,after,an,interval,a,tall,black,boy,of,their,own,age,ran,breathlessly,around,the,house,and,out,toward,the,tethered,horses
jeems,was,their,body,servant,and,like,the,dogs,accompanied,them,everywhere
he,had,been,their,childhood,playmate,and,had,been,given,to,the,twins,for,their,own,on,their,tenth,birthday
at,the,sight,of,him,the,tarleton,hounds,rose,up,out,of,the,red,dust,and,stood,waiting,expectantly,for,their,masters
the,boys,bowed,shook,hands,and,told,scarlett,they'd,be,over,at,the,wilkeses',early,in,the,morning,waiting,for,her
then,they,were,off,down,the,walk,at,a,rush,mounted,their,horses,and,followed,by,jeems,went,down,the,avenue,of,cedars,at,a,gallop,waving,their,hats,and,yelling,back,to,her
when,they,had,rounded,the,curve,of,the,dusty,road,that,hid,them,from,tara,brent,drew,his,horse,to,a,stop,under,a,clump,of,dogwood
stuart,halted,too,and,the,darky,boy,pulled,up,a,few,paces,behind,them
the,horses,feeling,slack,reins,stretched,down,their,necks,to,crop,the,tender,spring,grass,and,the,patient,hounds,lay,down,again,in,the,soft,red,dust,and,looked,up,longingly,at,the,chimney,swallows,circling,in,the,gathering,dusk
brent's,wide,ingenuous,face,was,puzzled,and,mildly,indignant
look,he,said
don't,it,look,to,you,like,she,would,of,asked,us,to,stay,for,supper
i,thought,she,would,said,stuart
i,kept,waiting,for,her,to,do,it,but,she,didn't
what,do,you,make,of,it
i,don't,make,anything,of,it
but,it,just,looks,to,me,like,she,might,of
after,all,it's,our,first,day,home,and,she,hasn't,seen,us,in,quite,a,spell
and,we,had,lots,more,things,to,tell,her

she,don't,hold,herself,in,like,some,girls,do
yes,that's,what,i,like,about,her
she,don't,go,around,being,cold,and,hateful,when,she's,mad,she,tells,you,about,it
but,it,was,something,we,did,or,said,that,made,her,shut,up,talking,and,look,sort,of,sick
i,could,swear,she,was,glad,to,see,us,when,we,came,and,was,aiming,to,ask,us,to,supper
you,don't,suppose,it's,because,we,got,expelled
hell,no

girls,set,a,big,store,on,knowing,such,things,first
well,maybe
but,what,if,he,hadn't,told,her,it,was,tomorrow
it,was,supposed,to,be,a,secret,and,a,surprise,and,a,man's,got,a,right,to,keep,his,own,engagement,quiet,hasn't,he

why,we've,known,it,for,years
the,wilkes,and,hamiltons,always,marry,their,own,cousins
everybody,knew,he'd,probably,marry,her,some,day,just,like,honey,wilkes,is,going,to,marry,miss,melly's,brother,charles

but,i'm,sorry,she,didn't,ask,us,to,supper
i,swear,i,don't,want,to,go,home,and,listen,to,ma,take,on,about,us,being,expelled
it,isn't,as,if,this,was,the,first,time
maybe,boyd,will,have,smoothed,her,down,by,now
you,know,what,a,slick,talker,that,little,varmint,is
you,know,he,always,can,smooth,her,down
yes,he,can,do,it,but,it,takes,boyd,time
he,has,to,talk,around,in,circles,till,ma,gets,so,confused,that,she,gives,up,and,tells,him,to,save,his,voice,for,his,law,practice
but,he,ain't,had,time,to,get,good,started,yet
why,i'll,bet,you,ma,is,still,so,excited,about,the,new,horse,that,she'll,never,even,realize,we're,home,again,till,she,sits,down,to,supper,tonight,and,sees,boyd
and,before,supper,is,over,she'll,be,going,strong,and,breathing,fire
and,it'll,be,ten,o'clock,before,boyd,gets,a,chance,to,tell,her,that,it,wouldn't,have,been,honorable,for,any,of,us,to,stay,in,college,after,the,way,the,chancellor,talked,to,you,and,me
and,it'll,be,midnight,before,he,gets,her,turned,around,to,where,she's,so,mad,at,the,chancellor,she'll,be,asking,boyd,why,he,didn't,shoot,him
no,we,can't,go,home,till,after,midnight
the,twins,looked,at,each,other,glumly
they,were,completely,fearless,of,wild,horses,shooting,affrays,and,the,indignation,of,their,neighbors,but,they,had,a,wholesome,fear,of,their,red-haired,mother's,outspoken,remarks,and,the,riding,crop,that,she,did,not,scruple,to,lay,across,their,breeches
well,look,said,brent
let's,go,over,to,the,wilkes
ashley,and,the,girls'll,be,glad,to,have,us,for,supper
stuart,looked,a,little,discomforted
no,don't,let's,go,there
they'll,be,in,a,stew,getting,ready,for,the,barbecue,tomorrow,and,besides
oh,i,forgot,about,that,said,brent,hastily
no,don't,let's,go,there
they,clucked,to,their,horses,and,rode,along,in,silence,for,a,while,a,flush,of,embarrassment,on,stuart's,brown,cheeks
until,the,previous,summer,stuart,had,courted,india,wilkes,with,the,approbation,of,both,families,and,the,entire,county
the,county,felt,that,perhaps,the,cool,and,contained,india,wilkes,would,have,a,quieting,effect,on,him
they,fervently,hoped,so,at,any,rate
and,stuart,might,have,made,the,match,but,brent,had,not,been,satisfied
brent,liked,india,but,he,thought,her,mighty,plain,and,tame,and,he,simply,could,not,fall,in,love,with,her,himself,to,keep,stuart,company
that,was,the,first,time,the,twins',interest,had,ever,diverged,and,brent,was,resentful,of,his,brother's,attentions,to,a,girl,who,seemed,to,him,not,at,all,remarkable
then,last,summer,at,a,political,speaking,in,a,grove,of,oak,trees,at,jonesboro,they,both,suddenly,became,aware,of,scarlett,o'hara
they,had,known,her,for,years,and,since,their,childhood,she,had,been,a,favorite,playmate,for,she,could,ride,horses,and,climb,trees,almost,as,well,as,they
but,now,to,their,amazement,she,had,become,a,grown-up,young,lady,and,quite,the,most,charming,one,in,all,the,world
they,noticed,for,the,first,time,how,her,green,eyes,danced,how,deep,her,dimples,were,when,she,laughed,how,tiny,her,hands,and,feet,and,what,a,small,waist,she,had
their,clever,remarks,sent,her,into,merry,peals,of,laughter,and,inspired,by,the,thought,that,she,considered,them,a,remarkable,pair,they,fairly,outdid,themselves
it,was,a,memorable,day,in,the,life,of,the,twins
thereafter,when,they,talked,it,over,they,always,wondered,just,why,they,had,failed,to,notice,scarlett's,charms,before
they,never,arrived,at,the,correct,answer,which,was,that,scarlett,on,that,day,had,decided,to,make,them,notice
she,was,constitutionally,unable,to,endure,any,man,being,in,love,with,any,woman,not,herself,and,the,sight,of,india,wilkes,and,stuart,at,the,speaking,had,been,too,much,for,her,predatory,nature
not,content,with,stuart,alone,she,had,set,her,cap,for,brent,as,well,and,with,a,thoroughness,that,overwhelmed,the,two,of,them
now,they,were,both,in,love,with,her,and,india,wilkes,and,letty,munroe,from,lovejoy,whom,brent,had,been,half-heartedly,courting,were,far,in,the,back,of,their,minds
just,what,the,loser,would,do,should,scarlett,accept,either,one,of,them,the,twins,did,not,ask
they,would,cross,that,bridge,when,they,came,to,it
for,the,present,they,were,quite,satisfied,to,be,in,accord,again,about,one,girl,for,they,had,no,jealousies,between,them
it,was,a,situation,which,interested,the,neighbors,and,annoyed,their,mother,who,had,no,liking,for,scarlett
it,will,serve,you,right,if,that,sly,piece,does,accept,one,of,you,she,said
or,maybe,she'll,accept,both,of,you,and,then,you'll,have,to,move,to,utah,if,the,mormons'll,have,you,which,i,doubt
all,that,bothers,me,is,that,some,one,of,these,days,you're,both,going,to,get,lickered,up,and,jealous,of,each,other,about,that,two-faced,little,green-eyed,baggage,and,you'll,shoot,each,other
but,that,might,not,be,a,bad,idea,either
since,the,day,of,the,speaking,stuart,had,been,uncomfortable,in,india's,presence
not,that,india,ever,reproached,him,or,even,indicated,by,look,or,gesture,that,she,was,aware,of,his,abruptly,changed,allegiance
she,was,too,much,of,a,lady
but,stuart,felt,guilty,and,ill,at,ease,with,her
he,knew,he,had,made,india,love,him,and,he,knew,that,she,still,loved,him,and,deep,in,his,heart,he,had,the,feeling,that,he,had,not,played,the,gentleman
he,still,liked,her,tremendously,and,respected,her,for,her,cool,good,breeding,her,book,learning,and,all,the,sterling,qualities,she,possessed
but,damn,it,she,was,just,so,pallid,and,uninteresting,and,always,the,same,beside,scarlett's,bright,and,changeable,charm
you,always,knew,where,you,stood,with,india,and,you,never,had,the,slightest,notion,with,scarlett
that,was,enough,to,drive,a,man,to,distraction,but,it,had,its,charm
well,let's,go,over,to,cade,calvert's,and,have,supper
scarlett,said,cathleen,was,home,from,charleston
maybe,she'll,have,some,news,about,fort,sumter,that,we,haven't,heard
not,cathleen
i'll,lay,you,two,to,one,she,didn't,even,know,the,fort,was,out,there,in,the,harbor,much,less,that,it,was,full,of,yankees,until,we,shelled,them,out
all,she'll,know,about,is,the,balls,she,went,to,and,the,beaux,she,collected
well,it's,fun,to,hear,her,gabble
and,it'll,be,somewhere,to,hide,out,till,ma,has,gone,to,bed
well,hell
i,like,cathleen,and,she,is,fun,and,i'd,like,to,hear,about,caro,rhett,and,the,rest,of,the,charleston,folks,but,i'm,damned,if,i,can,stand,sitting,through,another,meal,with,that,yankee,stepmother,of,hers
don't,be,too,hard,on,her,stuart
she,means,well
i'm,not,being,hard,on,her
i,feel,sorry,for,her,but,i,don't,like,people,i've,got,to,feel,sorry,for
and,she,fusses,around,so,much,trying,to,do,the,right,thing,and,make,you,feel,at,home,that,she,always,manages,to,say,and,do,just,exactly,the,wrong,thing
she,gives,me,the,fidgets
and,she,thinks,southerners,are,wild,barbarians
she,even,told,ma,so
she's,afraid,of,southerners
whenever,we're,there,she,always,looks,scared,to,death
she,reminds,me,of,a,skinny,hen,perched,on,a,chair,her,eyes,kind,of,bright,and,blank,and,scared,all,ready,to,flap,and,squawk,at,the,slightest,move,anybody,makes
well,you,can't,blame,her
you,did,shoot,cade,in,the,leg
well,i,was,lickered,up,or,i,wouldn't,have,done,it,said,stuart
and,cade,never,had,any,hard,feelings
neither,did,cathleen,or,raiford,or,mr,calvert
it,was,just,that,yankee,stepmother,who,squalled,and,said,i,was,a,wild,barbarian,and,decent,people,weren't,safe,around,uncivilized,southerners
well,you,can't,blame,her
she's,a,yankee,and,ain't,got,very,good,manners,and,after,all,you,did,shoot,him,and,he,is,her,stepson
well,hell
that's,no,excuse,for,insulting,me
you,are,ma's,own,blood,son,but,did,she,take,on,that,time,tony,fontaine,shot,you,in,the,leg
no,she,just,sent,for,old,doc,fontaine,to,dress,it,and,asked,the,doctor,what,ailed,tony's,aim
said,she,guessed,licker,was,spoiling,his,marksmanship
remember,how,mad,that,made,tony
both,boys,yelled,with,laughter
ma's,a,card
said,brent,with,loving,approval
you,can,always,count,on,her,to,do,the,right,thing,and,not,embarrass,you,in,front,of,folks
yes,but,she's,mighty,liable,to,talk,embarrassing,in,front,of,father,and,the,girls,when,we,get,home,tonight,said,stuart,gloomily
look,brent
i,guess,this,means,we,don't,go,to,europe
you,know,mother,said,if,we,got,expelled,from,another,college,we,couldn't,have,our,grand,tour
well,hell
we,don't,care,do,we

i'll,bet,those,foreigners,can't,show,us,a,thing,we,haven't,got,right,here,in,georgia
i'll,bet,their,horses,aren't,as,fast,or,their,girls,as,pretty,and,i,know,damn,well,they,haven't,got,any,rye,whisky,that,can,touch,father's
ashley,wilkes,said,they,had,an,awful,lot,of,scenery,and,music
ashley,liked,europe
he's,always,talking,about,it
well,you,know,how,the,wilkes,are
they,are,kind,of,queer,about,music,and,books,and,scenery
mother,says,it's,because,their,grandfather,came,from,virginia
she,says,virginians,set,quite,a,store,by,such,things
they,can,have,'em
give,me,a,good,horse,to,ride,and,some,good,licker,to,drink,and,a,good,girl,to,court,and,a,bad,girl,to,have,fun,with,and,anybody,can,have,their,europe
what,do,we,care,about,missing,the,tour
suppose,we,were,in,europe,now,with,the,war,coming,on
we,couldn't,get,home,soon,enough
i'd,heap,rather,go,to,a,war,than,go,to,europe
so,would,i,any,day
look,brent
i,know,where,we,can,go,for,supper
let's,ride,across,the,swamp,to,abel,wynder's,place,and,tell,him,we're,all,four,home,again,and,ready,for,drill
that's,an,idea
cried,brent,with,enthusiasm
and,we,can,hear,all,the,news,of,the,troop,and,find,out,what,color,they,finally,decided,on,for,the,uniforms
if,it's,zouave,i'm,damned,if,i'll,go,in,the,troop
i'd,feel,like,a,sissy,in,those,baggy,red,pants

there,was,frank,contempt,in,jeems',voice
his,own,social,status,was,assured,because,the,tarletons,owned,a,hundred,negroes,and,like,all,slaves,of,large,planters,he,looked,down,on,small,farmers,whose,slaves,were,few
i'm,going,to,beat,your,hide,off,for,that,cried,stuart,fiercely
don't,you,call,abel,wynder,'po',white,'

able,just,ain't,rich
he's,a,small,farmer,not,a,big,planter,and,if,the,boys,thought,enough,of,him,to,elect,him,lieutenant,then,it's,not,for,any,darky,to,talk,impudent,about,him
the,troop,knows,what,it's,doing
the,troop,of,cavalry,had,been,organized,three,months,before,the,very,day,that,georgia,seceded,from,the,union,and,since,then,the,recruits,had,been,whistling,for,war
the,outfit,was,as,yet,unnamed,though,not,for,want,of,suggestions
everyone,had,his,own,idea,on,that,subject,and,was,loath,to,relinquish,it,just,as,everyone,had,ideas,about,the,color,and,cut,of,the,uniforms
clayton,wild,cats,fire,eaters,north,georgia,hussars,zouaves,the,inland,rifles,although,the,troop,was,to,be,armed,with,pistols,sabers,and,bowie,knives,and,not,with,rifles,the,clayton,grays,the,blood,and,thunderers,the,rough,and,readys,all,had,their,adherents
until,matters,were,settled,everyone,referred,to,the,organization,as,the,troop,and,despite,the,high-sounding,name,finally,adopted,they,were,known,to,the,end,of,their,usefulness,simply,as,the,troop
the,officers,were,elected,by,the,members,for,no,one,in,the,county,had,had,any,military,experience,except,a,few,veterans,of,the,mexican,and,seminole,wars,and,besides,the,troop,would,have,scorned,a,veteran,as,a,leader,if,they,had,not,personally,liked,him,and,trusted,him
everyone,liked,the,four,tarleton,boys,and,the,three,fontaines,but,regretfully,refused,to,elect,them,because,the,tarletons,got,lickered,up,too,quickly,and,liked,to,skylark,and,the,fontaines,had,such,quick,murderous,tempers
ashley,wilkes,was,elected,captain,because,he,was,the,best,rider,in,the,county,and,because,his,cool,head,was,counted,on,to,keep,some,semblance,of,order
raiford,calvert,was,made,first,lieutenant,because,everybody,liked,raif,and,able,wynder,son,of,a,swamp,trapper,himself,a,small,farmer,was,elected,second,lieutenant
abel,was,a,shrewd,grave,giant,illiterate,kind,of,heart,older,than,the,other,boys,and,with,as,good,or,better,manners,in,the,presence,of,ladies
there,was,little,snobbery,in,the,troop
too,many,of,their,fathers,and,grandfathers,had,come,up,to,wealth,from,the,small,farmer,class,for,that
moreover,able,was,the,best,shot,in,the,troop,a,real,sharpshooter,who,could,pick,out,the,eye,of,a,squirrel,at,seventy-five,yards,and,too,he,knew,all,about,living,outdoors,building,fires,in,the,rain,tracking,animals,and,finding,water
the,troop,bowed,to,real,worth,and,moreover,because,they,liked,him,they,made,him,an,officer
he,bore,the,honor,gravely,and,with,no,untoward,conceit,as,though,it,were,only,his,due
but,the,planters',ladies,and,the,planters',slaves,could,not,overlook,the,fact,that,he,was,not,born,a,gentleman,even,if,their,men,folks,could
in,the,beginning,the,troop,had,been,recruited,exclusively,from,the,sons,of,planters,a,gentleman's,outfit,each,man,supplying,his,own,horse,arms,equipment,uniform,and,body,servant
but,rich,planters,were,few,in,the,young,county,of,clayton,and,in,order,to,muster,a,full-strength,troop,it,had,been,necessary,to,raise,more,recruits,among,the,sons,of,small,farmers,hunters,in,the,backwoods,swamp,trappers,crackers,and,in,a,very,few,cases,even,poor,whites,if,they,were,above,the,average,of,their,class
these,latter,young,men,were,as,anxious,to,fight,the,yankees,should,war,come,as,were,their,richer,neighbors,but,the,delicate,question,of,money,arose
few,small,farmers,owned,horses
they,carried,on,their,farm,operations,with,mules,and,they,had,no,surplus,of,these,seldom,more,than,four
the,mules,could,not,be,spared,to,go,off,to,war,even,if,they,had,been,acceptable,for,the,troop,which,they,emphatically,were,not
as,for,the,poor,whites,they,considered,themselves,well,off,if,they,owned,one,mule
the,backwoods,folks,and,the,swamp,dwellers,owned,neither,horses,nor,mules
they,lived,entirely,off,the,produce,of,their,lands,and,the,game,in,the,swamp,conducting,their,business,generally,by,the,barter,system,and,seldom,seeing,five,dollars,in,cash,a,year,and,horses,and,uniforms,were,out,of,their,reach
but,they,were,as,fiercely,proud,in,their,poverty,as,the,planters,were,in,their,wealth,and,they,would,accept,nothing,that,smacked,of,charity,from,their,rich,neighbors
so,to,save,the,feelings,of,all,and,to,bring,the,troop,up,to,full,strength,scarlett's,father,john,wilkes,buck,munroe,jim,tarleton,hugh,calvert,in,fact,every,large,planter,in,the,county,with,the,one,exception,of,angus,macintosh,had,contributed,money,to,completely,outfit,the,troop,horse,and,man
the,upshot,of,the,matter,was,that,every,planter,agreed,to,pay,for,equipping,his,own,sons,and,a,certain,number,of,the,others,but,the,manner,of,handling,the,arrangements,was,such,that,the,less,wealthy,members,of,the,outfit,could,accept,horses,and,uniforms,without,offense,to,their,honor
the,troop,met,twice,a,week,in,jonesboro,to,drill,and,to,pray,for,the,war,to,begin
arrangements,had,not,yet,been,completed,for,obtaining,the,full,quota,of,horses,but,those,who,had,horses,performed,what,they,imagined,to,be,cavalry,maneuvers,in,the,field,behind,the,courthouse,kicked,up,a,great,deal,of,dust,yelled,themselves,hoarse,and,waved,the,revolutionary-war,swords,that,had,been,taken,down,from,parlor,walls
those,who,as,yet,had,no,horses,sat,on,the,curb,in,front,of,bullard's,store,and,watched,their,mounted,comrades,chewed,tobacco,and,told,yarns
or,else,engaged,in,shooting,matches
there,was,no,need,to,teach,any,of,the,men,to,shoot

when,the,twins,left,scarlett,standing,on,the,porch,of,tara,and,the,last,sound,of,flying,hooves,had,died,away,she,went,back,to,her,chair,like,a,sleepwalker
her,face,felt,stiff,as,from,pain,and,her,mouth,actually,hurt,from,having,stretched,it,unwillingly,in,smiles,to,prevent,the,twins,from,learning,her,secret
she,sat,down,wearily,tucking,one,foot,under,her,and,her,heart,swelled,up,with,misery,until,it,felt,too,large,for,her,bosom
it,beat,with,odd,little,jerks,her,hands,were,cold,and,a,feeling,of,disaster,oppressed,her
there,were,pain,and,bewilderment,in,her,face,the,bewilderment,of,a,pampered,child,who,has,always,had,her,own,way,for,the,asking,and,who,now,for,the,first,time,was,in,contact,with,the,unpleasantness,of,life
ashley,to,marry,melanie,hamilton
oh,it,couldn't,be,true
the,twins,were,mistaken
they,were,playing,one,of,their,jokes,on,her
ashley,couldn't,couldn't,be,in,love,with,her
nobody,could,not,with,a,mousy,little,person,like,melanie
scarlett,recalled,with,contempt,melanie's,thin,childish,figure,her,serious,heart-shaped,face,that,was,plain,almost,to,homeliness
and,ashley,couldn't,have,seen,her,in,months
he,hadn't,been,in,atlanta,more,than,twice,since,the,house,party,he,gave,last,year,at,twelve,oaks
no,ashley,couldn't,be,in,love,with,melanie,because,oh,she,couldn't,be,mistaken,because,he,was,in,love,with,her
she,scarlett,was,the,one,he,loved,she,knew,it
scarlett,heard,mammy's,lumbering,tread,shaking,the,floor,of,the,hall,and,she,hastily,untucked,her,foot,and,tried,to,rearrange,her,face,in,more,placid,lines
it,would,never,do,for,mammy,to,suspect,that,anything,was,wrong
mammy,felt,that,she,owned,the,o'haras,body,and,soul,that,their,secrets,were,her,secrets,and,even,a,hint,of,a,mystery,was,enough,to,set,her,upon,the,trail,as,relentlessly,as,a,bloodhound
scarlett,knew,from,experience,that,if,mammy's,curiosity,were,not,immediately,satisfied,she,would,take,up,the,matter,with,ellen,and,then,scarlett,would,be,forced,to,reveal,everything,to,her,mother,or,think,up,some,plausible,lie
mammy,emerged,from,the,hall,a,huge,old,woman,with,the,small,shrewd,eyes,of,an,elephant
she,was,shining,black,pure,african,devoted,to,her,last,drop,of,blood,to,the,o'haras,ellen's,mainstay,the,despair,of,her,three,daughters,the,terror,of,the,other,house,servants
mammy,was,black,but,her,code,of,conduct,and,her,sense,of,pride,were,as,high,as,or,higher,than,those,of,her,owners
she,had,been,raised,in,the,bedroom,of,solange,robillard,ellen,o'hara's,mother,a,dainty,cold,high-nosed,french-woman,who,spared,neither,her,children,nor,her,servants,their,just,punishment,for,any,infringement,of,decorum
she,had,been,ellen's,mammy,and,had,come,with,her,from,savannah,to,the,up-country,when,she,married
whom,mammy,loved,she,chastened
and,as,her,love,for,scarlett,and,her,pride,in,her,were,enormous,the,chastening,process,was,practically,continuous

scarlett,heard,the,stairs,groan,and,she,got,softly,to,her,feet
when,mammy,returned,she,would,resume,her,lecture,on,scarlett's,breach,of,hospitality,and,scarlett,felt,that,she,could,not,endure,prating,about,such,a,trivial,matter,when,her,heart,was,breaking
as,she,stood,hesitant,wondering,where,she,could,hide,until,the,ache,in,her,breast,subsided,a,little,a,thought,came,to,her,bringing,a,small,ray,of,hope
her,father,had,ridden,over,to,twelve,oaks,the,wilkes,plantation,that,afternoon,to,offer,to,buy,dilcey,the,broad,wife,of,his,valet,pork
dilcey,was,head,woman,and,midwife,at,twelve,oaks,and,since,the,marriage,six,months,ago,pork,had,deviled,his,master,night,and,day,to,buy,dilcey,so,the,two,could,live,on,the,same,plantation
that,afternoon,gerald,his,resistance,worn,thin,had,set,out,to,make,an,offer,for,dilcey
surely,thought,scarlett,pa,will,know,whether,this,awful,story,is,true
even,if,he,hasn't,actually,heard,anything,this,afternoon,perhaps,he's,noticed,something,sensed,some,excitement,in,the,wilkes,family
if,i,can,just,see,him,privately,before,supper,perhaps,i'll,find,out,the,truth,that,it's,just,one,of,the,twins',nasty,practical,jokes
it,was,time,for,gerald's,return,and,if,she,expected,to,see,him,alone,there,was,nothing,for,her,to,do,except,meet,him,where,the,driveway,entered,the,road
she,went,quietly,down,the,front,steps,looking,carefully,over,her,shoulder,to,make,sure,mammy,was,not,observing,her,from,the,upstairs,windows
seeing,no,broad,black,face,turbaned,in,snowy,white,peering,disapprovingly,from,between,fluttering,curtains,she,boldly,snatched,up,her,green,flowered,skirts,and,sped,down,the,path,toward,the,driveway,as,fast,as,her,small,ribbon-laced,slippers,would,carry,her
the,dark,cedars,on,either,side,of,the,graveled,drive,met,in,an,arch,overhead,turning,the,long,avenue,into,a,dim,tunnel
as,soon,as,she,was,beneath,the,gnarled,arms,of,the,cedars,she,knew,she,was,safe,from,observation,from,the,house,and,she,slowed,her,swift,pace
she,was,panting,for,her,stays,were,laced,too,tightly,to,permit,much,running,but,she,walked,on,as,rapidly,as,she,could
soon,she,was,at,the,end,of,the,driveway,and,out,on,the,main,road,but,she,did,not,stop,until,she,had,rounded,a,curve,that,put,a,large,clump,of,trees,between,her,and,the,house
flushed,and,breathing,hard,she,sat,down,on,a,stump,to,wait,for,her,father
it,was,past,time,for,him,to,come,home,but,she,was,glad,that,he,was,late
the,delay,would,give,her,time,to,quiet,her,breathing,and,calm,her,face,so,that,his,suspicions,would,not,be,aroused
every,moment,she,expected,to,hear,the,pounding,of,his,horse's,hooves,and,see,him,come,charging,up,the,hill,at,his,usual,breakneck,speed
but,the,minutes,slipped,by,and,gerald,did,not,come
she,looked,down,the,road,for,him,the,pain,in,her,heart,swelling,up,again
oh,it,can't,be,true
she,thought
why,doesn't,he,come
her,eyes,followed,the,winding,road,blood-red,now,after,the,morning,rain
in,her,thought,she,traced,its,course,as,it,ran,down,the,hill,to,the,sluggish,flint,river,through,the,tangled,swampy,bottoms,and,up,the,next,hill,to,twelve,oaks,where,ashley,lived
that,was,all,the,road,meant,now,a,road,to,ashley,and,the,beautiful,white-columned,house,that,crowned,the,hill,like,a,greek,temple
oh,ashley
ashley
she,thought,and,her,heart,beat,faster
some,of,the,cold,sense,of,bewilderment,and,disaster,that,had,weighted,her,down,since,the,tarleton,boys,told,her,their,gossip,was,pushed,into,the,background,of,her,mind,and,in,its,place,crept,the,fever,that,had,possessed,her,for,two,years
it,seemed,strange,now,that,when,she,was,growing,up,ashley,had,never,seemed,so,very,attractive,to,her
in,childhood,days,she,had,seen,him,come,and,go,and,never,given,him,a,thought
but,since,that,day,two,years,ago,when,ashley,newly,home,from,his,three,years',grand,tour,in,europe,had,called,to,pay,his,respects,she,had,loved,him
it,was,as,simple,as,that
she,had,been,on,the,front,porch,and,he,had,ridden,up,the,long,avenue,dressed,in,gray,broadcloth,with,a,wide,black,cravat,setting,off,his,frilled,shirt,to,perfection
even,now,she,could,recall,each,detail,of,his,dress,how,brightly,his,boots,shone,the,head,of,a,medusa,in,cameo,on,his,cravat,pin,the,wide,panama,hat,that,was,instantly,in,his,hand,when,he,saw,her
he,had,alighted,and,tossed,his,bridle,reins,to,a,pickaninny,and,stood,looking,up,at,her,his,drowsy,gray,eyes,wide,with,a,smile,and,the,sun,so,bright,on,his,blond,hair,that,it,seemed,like,a,cap,of,shining,silver
and,he,said,so,you've,grown,up,scarlett
and,coming,lightly,up,the,steps,he,had,kissed,her,hand
and,his,voice
she,would,never,forget,the,leap,of,her,heart,as,she,heard,it,as,if,for,the,first,time,drawling,resonant,musical
she,had,wanted,him,in,that,first,instant,wanted,him,as,simply,and,unreasoningly,as,she,wanted,food,to,eat,horses,to,ride,and,a,soft,bed,on,which,to,lay,herself
for,two,years,he,had,squired,her,about,the,county,to,balls,fish,fries,picnics,and,court,days,never,so,often,as,the,tarleton,twins,or,cade,calvert,never,so,importunate,as,the,younger,fontaine,boys,but,still,never,the,week,went,by,that,ashley,did,not,come,calling,at,tara
true,he,never,made,love,to,her,nor,did,the,clear,gray,eyes,ever,glow,with,that,hot,light,scarlett,knew,so,well,in,other,men
and,yet,and,yet,she,knew,he,loved,her
she,could,not,be,mistaken,about,it
instinct,stronger,than,reason,and,knowledge,born,of,experience,told,her,that,he,loved,her
too,often,she,had,surprised,him,when,his,eyes,were,neither,drowsy,nor,remote,when,he,looked,at,her,with,a,yearning,and,a,sadness,which,puzzled,her
she,knew,he,loved,her
why,did,he,not,tell,her,so
that,she,could,not,understand
but,there,were,so,many,things,about,him,that,she,did,not,understand
he,was,courteous,always,but,aloof,remote
no,one,could,ever,tell,what,he,was,thinking,about,scarlett,least,of,all
in,a,neighborhood,where,everyone,said,exactly,what,he,thought,as,soon,as,he,thought,it,ashley's,quality,of,reserve,was,exasperating
he,was,as,proficient,as,any,of,the,other,young,men,in,the,usual,county,diversions,hunting,gambling,dancing,and,politics,and,was,the,best,rider,of,them,all,but,he,differed,from,all,the,rest,in,that,these,pleasant,activities,were,not,the,end,and,aim,of,life,to,him
and,he,stood,alone,in,his,interest,in,books,and,music,and,his,fondness,for,writing,poetry
oh,why,was,he,so,handsomely,blond,so,courteously,aloof,so,maddeningly,boring,with,his,talk,about,europe,and,books,and,music,and,poetry,and,things,that,interested,her,not,at,all,and,yet,so,desirable
night,after,night,when,scarlett,went,to,bed,after,sitting,on,the,front,porch,in,the,semi-darkness,with,him,she,tossed,restlessly,for,hours,and,comforted,herself,only,with,the,thought,that,the,very,next,time,he,saw,her,he,certainly,would,propose
but,the,next,time,came,and,went,and,the,result,was,nothing,nothing,except,that,the,fever,possessing,her,rose,higher,and,hotter
she,loved,him,and,she,wanted,him,and,she,did,not,understand,him
she,was,as,forthright,and,simple,as,the,winds,that,blew,over,tara,and,the,yellow,river,that,wound,about,it,and,to,the,end,of,her,days,she,would,never,be,able,to,understand,a,complexity
and,now,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,was,facing,a,complex,nature
for,ashley,was,born,of,a,line,of,men,who,used,their,leisure,for,thinking,not,doing,for,spinning,brightly,colored,dreams,that,had,in,them,no,touch,of,reality
he,moved,in,an,inner,world,that,was,more,beautiful,than,georgia,and,came,back,to,reality,with,reluctance
he,looked,on,people,and,he,neither,liked,nor,disliked,them
he,looked,on,life,and,was,neither,heartened,nor,saddened
he,accepted,the,universe,and,his,place,in,it,for,what,they,were,and,shrugging,turned,to,his,music,and,books,and,his,better,world
why,he,should,have,captivated,scarlett,when,his,mind,was,a,stranger,to,hers,she,did,not,know
the,very,mystery,of,him,excited,her,curiosity,like,a,door,that,had,neither,lock,nor,key
the,things,about,him,which,she,could,not,understand,only,made,her,love,him,more,and,his,odd,restrained,courtship,only,served,to,increase,her,determination,to,have,him,for,her,own
that,he,would,propose,some,day,she,had,never,doubted,for,she,was,too,young,and,too,spoiled,ever,to,have,known,defeat
and,now,like,a,thunderclap,had,come,this,horrible,news
ashley,to,marry,melanie
it,couldn't,be,true
why,only,last,week,when,they,were,riding,home,at,twilight,from,fairhill,he,had,said,scarlett,i,have,something,so,important,to,tell,you,that,i,hardly,know,how,to,say,it
she,had,cast,down,her,eyes,demurely,her,heart,beating,with,wild,pleasure,thinking,the,happy,moment,had,come
then,he,had,said,not,now
we're,nearly,home,and,there,isn't,time
oh,scarlett,what,a,coward,i,am
and,putting,spurs,to,his,horse,he,had,raced,her,up,the,hill,to,tara
scarlett,sitting,on,the,stump,thought,of,those,words,which,had,made,her,so,happy,and,suddenly,they,took,on,another,meaning,a,hideous,meaning
suppose,it,was,the,news,of,his,engagement,he,had,intended,to,tell,her
oh,if,pa,would,only,come,home
she,could,not,endure,the,suspense,another,moment
she,looked,impatiently,down,the,road,again,and,again,she,was,disappointed
the,sun,was,now,below,the,horizon,and,the,red,glow,at,the,rim,of,the,world,faded,into,pink
the,sky,above,turned,slowly,from,azure,to,the,delicate,blue-green,of,a,robin's,egg,and,the,unearthly,stillness,of,rural,twilight,came,stealthily,down,about,her
shadowy,dimness,crept,over,the,countryside
the,red,furrows,and,the,gashed,red,road,lost,their,magical,blood,color,and,became,plain,brown,earth
across,the,road,in,the,pasture,the,horses,mules,and,cows,stood,quietly,with,heads,over,the,split-rail,fence,waiting,to,be,driven,to,the,stables,and,supper
they,did,not,like,the,dark,shade,of,the,thickets,hedging,the,pasture,creek,and,they,twitched,their,ears,at,scarlett,as,if,appreciative,of,human,companionship
in,the,strange,half-light,the,tall,pines,of,the,river,swamp,so,warmly,green,in,the,sunshine,were,black,against,the,pastel,sky,an,impenetrable,row,of,black,giants,hiding,the,slow,yellow,water,at,their,feet
on,the,hill,across,the,river,the,tall,white,chimneys,of,the,wilkes',home,faded,gradually,into,the,darkness,of,the,thick,oaks,surrounding,them,and,only,far-off,pin,points,of,supper,lamps,showed,that,a,house,was,here
the,warm,damp,balminess,of,spring,encompassed,her,sweetly,with,the,moist,smells,of,new-plowed,earth,and,all,the,fresh,green,things,pushing,up,to,the,air
sunset,and,spring,and,new-fledged,greenery,were,no,miracle,to,scarlett
their,beauty,she,accepted,as,casually,as,the,air,she,breathed,and,the,water,she,drank,for,she,had,never,consciously,seen,beauty,in,anything,but,women's,faces,horses,silk,dresses,and,like,tangible,things
yet,the,serene,half-light,over,tara's,well-kept,acres,brought,a,measure,of,quiet,to,her,disturbed,mind
she,loved,this,land,so,much,without,even,knowing,she,loved,it,loved,it,as,she,loved,her,mother's,face,under,the,lamp,at,prayer,time
still,there,was,no,sign,of,gerald,on,the,quiet,winding,road
if,she,had,to,wait,much,longer,mammy,would,certainly,come,in,search,of,her,and,bully,her,into,the,house
but,even,as,she,strained,her,eyes,down,the,darkening,road,she,heard,a,pounding,of,hooves,at,the,bottom,of,the,pasture,hill,and,saw,the,horses,and,cows,scatter,in,fright
gerald,o'hara,was,coming,home,across,country,and,at,top,speed
he,came,up,the,hill,at,a,gallop,on,his,thick-barreled,long-legged,hunter,appearing,in,the,distance,like,a,boy,on,a,too,large,horse
his,long,white,hair,standing,out,behind,him,he,urged,the,horse,forward,with,crop,and,loud,cries
filled,with,her,own,anxieties,she,nevertheless,watched,him,with,affectionate,pride,for,gerald,was,an,excellent,horseman
i,wonder,why,he,always,wants,to,jump,fences,when,he's,had,a,few,drinks,she,thought
and,after,that,fall,he,had,right,here,last,year,when,he,broke,his,knee
you'd,think,he'd,learn
especially,when,he,promised,mother,on,oath,he'd,never,jump,again
scarlett,had,no,awe,of,her,father,and,felt,him,more,her,contemporary,than,her,sisters,for,jumping,fences,and,keeping,it,a,secret,from,his,wife,gave,him,a,boyish,pride,and,guilty,glee,that,matched,her,own,pleasure,in,outwitting,mammy
she,rose,from,her,seat,to,watch,him
the,big,horse,reached,the,fence,gathered,himself,and,soared,over,as,effortlessly,as,a,bird,his,rider,yelling,enthusiastically,his,crop,beating,the,air,his,white,curls,jerking,out,behind,him
gerald,did,not,see,his,daughter,in,the,shadow,of,the,trees,and,he,drew,rein,in,the,road,patting,his,horse's,neck,with,approbation
there's,none,in,the,county,can,touch,you,nor,in,the,state,he,informed,his,mount,with,pride,the,brogue,of,county,meath,still,heavy,on,his,tongue,in,spite,of,thirty-nine,years,in,america
then,he,hastily,set,about,smoothing,his,hair,and,settling,his,ruffled,shirt,and,his,cravat,which,had,slipped,awry,behind,one,ear
scarlett,knew,these,hurried,preenings,were,being,made,with,an,eye,toward,meeting,his,wife,with,the,appearance,of,a,gentleman,who,had,ridden,sedately,home,from,a,call,on,a,neighbor
she,knew,also,that,he,was,presenting,her,with,just,the,opportunity,she,wanted,for,opening,the,conversation,without,revealing,her,true,purpose
she,laughed,aloud
as,she,had,intended,gerald,was,startled,by,the,sound,then,he,recognized,her,and,a,look,both,sheepish,and,defiant,came,over,his,florid,face
he,dismounted,with,difficulty,because,his,knee,was,stiff,and,slipping,the,reins,over,his,arm,stumped,toward,her
well,missy,he,said,pinching,her,cheek,so,you've,been,spying,on,me,and,like,your,sister,suellen,last,week,you'll,be,telling,your,mother,on,me
there,was,indignation,in,his,hoarse,bass,voice,but,also,a,wheedling,note,and,scarlett,teasingly,clicked,her,tongue,against,her,teeth,as,she,reached,out,to,pull,his,cravat,into,place
his,breath,in,her,face,was,strong,with,bourbon,whisky,mingled,with,a,faint,fragrance,of,mint
accompanying,him,also,were,the,smells,of,chewing,tobacco,well-oiled,leather,and,horses,a,combination,of,odors,that,she,always,associated,with,her,father,and,instinctively,liked,in,other,men
no,pa,i'm,no,tattletale,like,suellen,she,assured,him,standing,off,to,view,his,rearranged,attire,with,a,judicious,air
gerald,was,a,small,man,little,more,than,five,feet,tall,but,so,heavy,of,barrel,and,thick,of,neck,that,his,appearance,when,seated,led,strangers,to,think,him,a,larger,man
his,thickset,torso,was,supported,by,short,sturdy,legs,always,incased,in,the,finest,leather,boots,procurable,and,always,planted,wide,apart,like,a,swaggering,small,boy's
most,small,people,who,take,themselves,seriously,are,a,little,ridiculous,but,the,bantam,cock,is,respected,in,the,barnyard,and,so,it,was,with,gerald
no,one,would,ever,have,the,temerity,to,think,of,gerald,o'hara,as,a,ridiculous,little,figure
he,was,sixty,years,old,and,his,crisp,curly,hair,was,silver-white,but,his,shrewd,face,was,unlined,and,his,hard,little,blue,eyes,were,young,with,the,unworried,youthfulness,of,one,who,has,never,taxed,his,brain,with,problems,more,abstract,than,how,many,cards,to,draw,in,a,poker,game
his,was,as,irish,a,face,as,could,be,found,in,the,length,and,breadth,of,the,homeland,he,had,left,so,long,ago,round,high,colored,short,nosed,wide,mouthed,and,belligerent
beneath,his,choleric,exterior,gerald,o'hara,had,the,tenderest,of,hearts
he,could,not,bear,to,see,a,slave,pouting,under,a,reprimand,no,matter,how,well,deserved,or,hear,a,kitten,mewing,or,a,child,crying,but,he,had,a,horror,of,having,this,weakness,discovered
that,everyone,who,met,him,did,discover,his,kindly,heart,within,five,minutes,was,unknown,to,him,and,his,vanity,would,have,suffered,tremendously,if,he,had,found,it,out,for,he,liked,to,think,that,when,he,bawled,orders,at,the,top,of,his,voice,everyone,trembled,and,obeyed
it,had,never,occurred,to,him,that,only,one,voice,was,obeyed,on,the,plantation,the,soft,voice,of,his,wife,ellen
it,was,a,secret,he,would,never,learn,for,everyone,from,ellen,down,to,the,stupidest,field,hand,was,in,a,tacit,and,kindly,conspiracy,to,keep,him,believing,that,his,word,was,law
scarlett,was,impressed,less,than,anyone,else,by,his,tempers,and,his,roarings
she,was,his,oldest,child,and,now,that,gerald,knew,there,would,be,no,more,sons,to,follow,the,three,who,lay,in,the,family,burying,ground,he,had,drifted,into,a,habit,of,treating,her,in,a,man-to-man,manner,which,she,found,most,pleasant
she,was,more,like,her,father,than,her,younger,sisters,for,carreen,who,had,been,born,caroline,irene,was,delicate,and,dreamy,and,suellen,christened,susan,elinor,prided,herself,on,her,elegance,and,ladylike,deportment
moreover,scarlett,and,her,father,were,bound,together,by,a,mutual,suppression,agreement
if,gerald,caught,her,climbing,a,fence,instead,of,walking,half,a,mile,to,a,gate,or,sitting,too,late,on,the,front,steps,with,a,beau,he,castigated,her,personally,and,with,vehemence,but,he,did,not,mention,the,fact,to,ellen,or,to,mammy
and,when,scarlett,discovered,him,jumping,fences,after,his,solemn,promise,to,his,wife,or,learned,the,exact,amount,of,his,losses,at,poker,as,she,always,did,from,county,gossip,she,refrained,from,mentioning,the,fact,at,the,supper,table,in,the,artfully,artless,manner,suellen,had
scarlett,and,her,father,each,assured,the,other,solemnly,that,to,bring,such,matters,to,the,ears,of,ellen,would,only,hurt,her,and,nothing,would,induce,them,to,wound,her,gentleness
scarlett,looked,at,her,father,in,the,fading,light,and,without,knowing,why,she,found,it,comforting,to,be,in,his,presence
there,was,something,vital,and,earthy,and,coarse,about,him,that,appealed,to,her
being,the,least,analytic,of,people,she,did,not,realize,that,this,was,because,she,possessed,in,some,degree,these,same,qualities,despite,sixteen,years,of,effort,on,the,part,of,ellen,and,mammy,to,obliterate,them
you,look,very,presentable,now,she,said,and,i,don't,think,anyone,will,suspect,you've,been,up,to,your,tricks,unless,you,brag,about,them
but,it,does,seem,to,me,that,after,you,broke,your,knee,last,year,jumping,that,same,fence
well,may,i,be,damned,if,i'll,have,me,own,daughter,telling,me,what,i,shall,jump,and,not,jump,he,shouted,giving,her,cheek,another,pinch
it's,me,own,neck,so,it,is
and,besides,missy,what,are,you,doing,out,here,without,your,shawl
seeing,that,he,was,employing,familiar,maneuvers,to,extricate,himself,from,unpleasant,conversation,she,slipped,her,arm,through,his,and,said,i,was,waiting,for,you
i,didn't,know,you,would,be,so,late
i,just,wondered,if,you,had,bought,dilcey
bought,her,i,did,and,the,price,has,ruined,me
bought,her,and,her,little,wench,prissy
john,wilkes,was,for,almost,giving,them,away,but,never,will,i,have,it,said,that,gerald,o'hara,used,friendship,in,a,trade
i,made,him,take,three,thousand,for,the,two,of,them
in,the,name,of,heaven,pa,three,thousand
and,you,didn't,need,to,buy,prissy
has,the,time,come,when,me,own,daughters,sit,in,judgment,on,me
shouted,gerald,rhetorically
prissy,is,a,likely,little,wench,and,so
i,know,her
she's,a,sly,stupid,creature,scarlett,rejoined,calmly,unimpressed,by,his,uproar
and,the,only,reason,you,bought,her,was,because,dilcey,asked,you,to,buy,her
gerald,looked,crestfallen,and,embarrassed,as,always,when,caught,in,a,kind,deed,and,scarlett,laughed,outright,at,his,transparency
well,what,if,i,did
was,there,any,use,buying,dilcey,if,she,was,going,to,mope,about,the,child
well,never,again,will,i,let,a,darky,on,this,place,marry,off,it
it's,too,expensive
well,come,on,puss,let's,go,in,to,supper
the,shadows,were,falling,thicker,now,the,last,greenish,tinge,had,left,the,sky,and,a,slight,chill,was,displacing,the,balminess,of,spring
but,scarlett,loitered,wondering,how,to,bring,up,the,subject,of,ashley,without,permitting,gerald,to,suspect,her,motive
this,was,difficult,for,scarlett,had,not,a,subtle,bone,in,her,body,and,gerald,was,so,much,like,her,he,never,failed,to,penetrate,her,weak,subterfuges,even,as,she,penetrated,his
and,he,was,seldom,tactful,in,doing,it
how,are,they,all,over,at,twelve,oaks
about,as,usual
cade,calvert,was,there,and,after,i,settled,about,dilcey,we,all,set,on,the,gallery,and,had,several,toddies
cade,has,just,come,from,atlanta,and,it's,all,upset,they,are,there,and,talking,war,and
scarlett,sighed
if,gerald,once,got,on,the,subject,of,war,and,secession,it,would,be,hours,before,he,relinquished,it
she,broke,in,with,another,line
did,they,say,anything,about,the,barbecue,tomorrow
now,that,i,think,of,it,they,did
miss,what's-her-name,the,sweet,little,thing,who,was,here,last,year,you,know,ashley's,cousin,oh,yes,miss,melanie,hamilton,that's,the,name,she,and,her,brother,charles,have,already,come,from,atlanta,and
oh,so,she,did,come
she,did,and,a,sweet,quiet,thing,she,is,with,never,a,word,to,say,for,herself,like,a,woman,should,be
come,now,daughter,don't,lag
your,mother,will,be,hunting,for,us
scarlett's,heart,sank,at,the,news
she,had,hoped,against,hope,that,something,would,keep,melanie,hamilton,in,atlanta,where,she,belonged,and,the,knowledge,that,even,her,father,approved,of,her,sweet,quiet,nature,so,different,from,her,own,forced,her,into,the,open
was,ashley,there,too
he,was
gerald,let,go,of,his,daughter's,arm,and,turned,peering,sharply,into,her,face
and,if,that's,why,you,came,out,here,to,wait,for,me,why,didn't,you,say,so,without,beating,around,the,bush
scarlett,could,think,of,nothing,to,say,and,she,felt,her,face,growing,red,with,annoyance
well,speak,up
still,she,said,nothing,wishing,that,it,was,permissible,to,shake,one's,father,and,tell,him,to,hush,his,mouth
he,was,there,and,he,asked,most,kindly,after,you,as,did,his,sisters,and,said,they,hoped,nothing,would,keep,you,from,the,barbecue,tomorrow
i'll,warrant,nothing,will,he,said,shrewdly
and,now,daughter,what's,all,this,about,you,and,ashley
there,is,nothing,she,said,shortly,tugging,at,his,arm
let's,go,in,pa
so,now,'tis,you,wanting,to,go,in,he,observed
but,here,i'm,going,to,stand,till,i'm,understanding,you
now,that,i,think,of,it,'tis,strange,you've,been,recently
has,he,been,trifling,with,you
has,he,asked,to,marry,you
no,she,said,shortly
nor,will,he,said,gerald
fury,flamed,in,her,but,gerald,waved,her,quiet,with,a,hand
hold,your,tongue,miss
i,had,it,from,john,wilkes,this,afternoon,in,the,strictest,confidence,that,ashley's,to,marry,miss,melanie
it's,to,be,announced,tomorrow
scarlett's,hand,fell,from,his,arm
so,it,was,true
a,pain,slashed,at,her,heart,as,savagely,as,a,wild,animal's,fangs
through,it,all,she,felt,her,father's,eyes,on,her,a,little,pitying,a,little,annoyed,at,being,faced,with,a,problem,for,which,he,knew,no,answer
he,loved,scarlett,but,it,made,him,uncomfortable,to,have,her,forcing,her,childish,problems,on,him,for,a,solution
ellen,knew,all,the,answers
scarlett,should,have,taken,her,troubles,to,her
is,it,a,spectacle,you've,been,making,of,yourself,of,all,of,us
he,bawled,his,voice,rising,as,always,in,moments,of,excitement
have,you,been,running,after,a,man,who's,not,in,love,with,you,when,you,could,have,any,of,the,bucks,in,the,county
anger,and,hurt,pride,drove,out,some,of,the,pain
i,haven't,been,running,after,him
it,it,just,surprised,me
it's,lying,you,are
said,gerald,and,then,peering,at,her,stricken,face,he,added,in,a,burst,of,kindliness,i'm,sorry,daughter
but,after,all,you,are,nothing,but,a,child,and,there's,lots,of,other,beaux
mother,was,only,fifteen,when,she,married,you,and,i'm,sixteen,said,scarlett,her,voice,muffled
your,mother,was,different,said,gerald
she,was,never,flighty,like,you
now,come,daughter,cheer,up,and,i'll,take,you,to,charleston,next,week,to,visit,your,aunt,eulalie,and,what,with,all,the,hullabaloo,they,are,having,over,there,about,fort,sumter,you'll,be,forgetting,about,ashley,in,a,week
he,thinks,i'm,a,child,thought,scarlett,grief,and,anger,choking,utterance,and,he's,only,got,to,dangle,a,new,toy,and,i'll,forget,my,bumps
now,don't,be,jerking,your,chin,at,me,warned,gerald
if,you,had,any,sense,you'd,have,married,stuart,or,brent,tarleton,long,ago
think,it,over,daughter
marry,one,of,the,twins,and,then,the,plantations,will,run,together,and,jim,tarleton,and,i,will,build,you,a,fine,house,right,where,they,join,in,that,big,pine,grove,and
will,you,stop,treating,me,like,a,child
cried,scarlett
i,don't,want,to,go,to,charleston,or,have,a,house,or,marry,the,twins
i,only,want,she,caught,herself,but,not,in,time
gerald's,voice,was,strangely,quiet,and,he,spoke,slowly,as,if,drawing,his,words,from,a,store,of,thought,seldom,used
it's,only,ashley,you're,wanting,and,you'll,not,be,having,him
and,if,he,wanted,to,marry,you,'twould,be,with,misgivings,that,i'd,say,yes,for,all,the,fine,friendship,that's,between,me,and,john,wilkes
and,seeing,her,startled,look,he,continued,i,want,my,girl,to,be,happy,and,you,wouldn't,be,happy,with,him
oh,i,would
i,would
that,you,would,not,daughter
only,when,like,marries,like,can,there,be,any,happiness
scarlett,had,a,sudden,treacherous,desire,to,cry,out,but,you've,been,happy,and,you,and,mother,aren't,alike,but,she,repressed,it,fearing,that,he,would,box,her,ears,for,her,impertinence
our,people,and,the,wilkes,are,different,he,went,on,slowly,fumbling,for,words
the,wilkes,are,different,from,any,of,our,neighbors,different,from,any,family,i,ever,knew
they,are,queer,folk,and,it's,best,that,they,marry,their,cousins,and,keep,their,queerness,to,themselves
why,pa,ashley,is,not
hold,your,whist,puss
i,said,nothing,against,the,lad,for,i,like,him
and,when,i,say,queer,it's,not,crazy,i'm,meaning
he's,not,queer,like,the,calverts,who'd,gamble,everything,they,have,on,a,horse,or,the,tarletons,who,turn,out,a,drunkard,or,two,in,every,litter,or,the,fontaines,who,are,hot-headed,little,brutes,and,after,murdering,a,man,for,a,fancied,slight
that,kind,of,queerness,is,easy,to,understand,for,sure,and,but,for,the,grace,of,god,gerald,o'hara,would,be,having,all,those,faults
and,i,don't,mean,that,ashley,would,run,off,with,another,woman,if,you,were,his,wife,or,beat,you
you'd,be,happier,if,he,did,for,at,least,you'd,be,understanding,that
but,he's,queer,in,other,ways,and,there's,no,understanding,him,at,all
i,like,him,but,it's,neither,heads,nor,tails,i,can,make,of,most,he,says
now,puss,tell,me,true,do,you,understand,his,folderol,about,books,and,poetry,and,music,and,oil,paintings,and,such,foolishness
oh,pa,cried,scarlett,impatiently,if,i,married,him,i'd,change,all,that
oh,you,would,would,you,now
said,gerald,testily,shooting,a,sharp,look,at,her
then,it's,little,enough,you,are,knowing,of,any,man,living,let,alone,ashley
no,wife,has,ever,changed,a,husband,one,whit,and,don't,you,be,forgetting,that
and,as,for,changing,a,wilkes,god's,nightgown,daughter
the,whole,family,is,that,way,and,they've,always,been,that,way
and,probably,always,will
i,tell,you,they're,born,queer
look,at,the,way,they,go,tearing,up,to,new,york,and,boston,to,hear,operas,and,see,oil,paintings
and,ordering,french,and,german,books,by,the,crate,from,the,yankees
and,there,they,sit,reading,and,dreaming,the,dear,god,knows,what,when,they'd,be,better,spending,their,time,hunting,and,playing,poker,as,proper,men,should
there's,nobody,in,the,county,sits,a,horse,better,than,ashley,said,scarlett,furious,at,the,slur,of,effeminacy,flung,on,ashley,nobody,except,maybe,his,father
and,as,for,poker,didn't,ashley,take,two,hundred,dollars,away,from,you,just,last,week,in,jonesboro
the,calvert,boys,have,been,blabbing,again,gerald,said,resignedly,else,you'd,not,be,knowing,the,amount
ashley,can,ride,with,the,best,and,play,poker,with,the,best,that's,me,puss
and,i'm,not,denying,that,when,he,sets,out,to,drink,he,can,put,even,the,tarletons,under,the,table
he,can,do,all,those,things,but,his,heart's,not,in,it
that's,why,i,say,he's,queer
scarlett,was,silent,and,her,heart,sank
she,could,think,of,no,defense,for,this,last,for,she,knew,gerald,was,right
ashley's,heart,was,in,none,of,the,pleasant,things,he,did,so,well
he,was,never,more,than,politely,interested,in,any,of,the,things,that,vitally,interested,every,one,else
rightly,interpreting,her,silence,gerald,patted,her,arm,and,said,triumphantly,there,now,scarlett
you,admit,'tis,true
what,would,you,be,doing,with,a,husband,like,ashley
'tis,moonstruck,they,all,are,all,the,wilkes
and,then,in,a,wheedling,tone,when,i,was,mentioning,the,tarletons,the,while,ago,i,wasn't,pushing,them
they're,fine,lads,but,if,it's,cade,calvert,you're,setting,your,cap,after,why,'tis,the,same,with,me
the,calverts,are,good,folk,all,of,them,for,all,the,old,man,marrying,a,yankee
and,when,i'm,gone,whist,darlin',listen,to,me
i'll,leave,tara,to,you,and,cade
i,wouldn't,have,cade,on,a,silver,tray,cried,scarlett,in,fury
and,i,wish,you'd,quit,pushing,him,at,me
i,don't,want,tara,or,any,old,plantation
plantations,don't,amount,to,anything,when
she,was,going,to,say,when,you,haven't,the,man,you,want,but,gerald,incensed,by,the,cavalier,way,in,which,she,treated,his,proffered,gift,the,thing,which,next,to,ellen,he,loved,best,in,the,whole,world,uttered,a,roar
do,you,stand,there,scarlett,o'hara,and,tell,me,that,tara,that,land,doesn't,amount,to,anything
scarlett,nodded,obstinately
her,heart,was,too,sore,to,care,whether,or,not,she,put,her,father,in,a,temper
land,is,the,only,thing,in,the,world,that,amounts,to,anything,he,shouted,his,thick,short,arms,making,wide,gestures,of,indignation,for,'tis,the,only,thing,in,this,world,that,lasts,and,don't,you,be,forgetting,it
'tis,the,only,thing,worth,working,for,worth,fighting,for,worth,dying,for
oh,pa,she,said,disgustedly,you,talk,like,an,irishman
have,i,ever,been,ashamed,of,it
no,'tis,proud,i,am
and,don't,be,forgetting,that,you,are,half,irish,miss
and,to,anyone,with,a,drop,of,irish,blood,in,them,the,land,they,live,on,is,like,their,mother
'tis,ashamed,of,you,i,am,this,minute
i,offer,you,the,most,beautiful,land,in,the,world,saving,county,meath,in,the,old,country,and,what,do,you,do
you,sniff
gerald,had,begun,to,work,himself,up,into,a,pleasurable,shouting,rage,when,something,in,scarlett's,woebegone,face,stopped,him
but,there,you're,young
'twill,come,to,you,this,love,of,land
there's,no,getting,away,from,it,if,you're,irish
you're,just,a,child,and,bothered,about,your,beaux
when,you're,older,you'll,be,seeing,how,'tis
now,do,you,be,making,up,your,mind,about,cade,or,the,twins,or,one,of,evan,munroe's,young,bucks,and,see,how,fine,i,turn,you,out
oh,pa
by,this,time,gerald,was,thoroughly,tired,of,the,conversation,and,thoroughly,annoyed,that,the,problem,should,be,upon,his,shoulders
he,felt,aggrieved,moreover,that,scarlett,should,still,look,desolate,after,being,offered,the,best,of,the,county,boys,and,tara,too
gerald,liked,his,gifts,to,be,received,with,clapping,of,hands,and,kisses
now,none,of,your,pouts,miss

all,this,american,business,of,running,around,marrying,for,love,like,servants,like,yankees
the,best,marriages,are,when,the,parents,choose,for,the,girl
for,how,can,a,silly,piece,like,yourself,tell,a,good,man,from,a,scoundrel

it's,not,crying,you,are
he,questioned,fumbling,clumsily,at,her,chin,trying,to,turn,her,face,upward,his,own,face,furrowed,with,pity

i'll,not,be,worrying,your,mother,with,this,nor,do,you,do,it,either
blow,your,nose,daughter
scarlett,blew,her,nose,on,her,torn,handkerchief,and,they,started,up,the,dark,drive,arm,in,arm,the,horse,following,slowly
near,the,house,scarlett,was,at,the,point,of,speaking,again,when,she,saw,her,mother,in,the,dim,shadows,of,the,porch
she,had,on,her,bonnet,shawl,and,mittens,and,behind,her,was,mammy,her,face,like,a,thundercloud,holding,in,her,hand,the,black,leather,bag,in,which,ellen,o'hara,always,carried,the,bandages,and,medicines,she,used,in,doctoring,the,slaves
mammy's,lips,were,large,and,pendulous,and,when,indignant,she,could,push,out,her,lower,one,to,twice,its,normal,length
it,was,pushed,out,now,and,scarlett,knew,that,mammy,was,seething,over,something,of,which,she,did,not,approve
mr,o'hara,called,ellen,as,she,saw,the,two,coming,up,the,driveway,ellen,belonged,to,a,generation,that,was,formal,even,after,seventeen,years,of,wedlock,and,the,bearing,of,six,children,mr,o'hara,there,is,illness,at,the,slattery,house
emmie's,baby,has,been,born,and,is,dying,and,must,be,baptized
i,am,going,there,with,mammy,to,see,what,i,can,do
her,voice,was,raised,questioningly,as,though,she,hung,on,gerald's,assent,to,her,plan,a,mere,formality,but,one,dear,to,the,heart,of,gerald
in,the,name,of,god
blustered,gerald
why,should,those,white,trash,take,you,away,just,at,your,supper,hour,and,just,when,i'm,wanting,to,tell,you,about,the,war,talk,that's,going,on,in,atlanta
go,mrs,o'hara
you'd,not,rest,easy,on,your,pillow,the,night,if,there,was,trouble,abroad,and,you,not,there,to,help
she,doan,never,git,no,res',on,her,piller,fer,hoppin',up,at,night,time,nursin',niggers,an,po',w'ite,trash,dat,could,ten',to,deyseff,grumbled,mammy,in,a,monotone,as,she,went,down,the,stairs,toward,the,carriage,which,was,waiting,in,the,side,drive
take,my,place,at,the,table,dear,said,ellen,patting,scarlett's,cheek,softly,with,a,mittened,hand
in,spite,of,her,choked-back,tears,scarlett,thrilled,to,the,never-,failing,magic,of,her,mother's,touch,to,the,faint,fragrance,of,lemon,verbena,sachet,that,came,from,her,rustling,silk,dress
to,scarlett,there,was,something,breath-taking,about,ellen,o'hara,a,miracle,that,lived,in,the,house,with,her,and,awed,her,and,charmed,and,soothed,her
gerald,helped,his,wife,into,the,carriage,and,gave,orders,to,the,coachman,to,drive,carefully
toby,who,had,handled,gerald's,horses,for,twenty,years,pushed,out,his,lips,in,mute,indignation,at,being,told,how,to,conduct,his,own,business
driving,off,with,mammy,beside,him,each,was,a,perfect,picture,of,pouting,african,disapproval
if,i,didn't,do,so,much,for,those,trashy,slatterys,that,they'd,have,to,pay,money,for,elsewhere,fumed,gerald,they'd,be,willing,to,sell,me,their,miserable,few,acres,of,swamp,bottom,and,the,county,would,be,well,rid,of,them
then,brightening,in,anticipation,of,one,of,his,practical,jokes,come,daughter,let's,go,tell,pork,that,instead,of,buying,dilcey,i've,sold,him,to,john,wilkes
he,tossed,the,reins,of,his,horse,to,a,small,pickaninny,standing,near,and,started,up,the,steps
he,had,already,forgotten,scarlett's,heartbreak,and,his,mind,was,only,on,plaguing,his,valet
scarlett,slowly,climbed,the,steps,after,him,her,feet,leaden
she,thought,that,after,all,a,mating,between,herself,and,ashley,could,be,no,queerer,than,that,of,her,father,and,ellen,robillard,o'hara
as,always,she,wondered,how,her,loud,insensitive,father,had,managed,to,marry,a,woman,like,her,mother,for,never,were,two,people,further,apart,in,birth,breeding,and,habits,of,mind
chapter,iii
ellen,o'hara,was,thirty-two,years,old,and,according,to,the,standards,of,her,day,she,was,a,middle-aged,woman,one,who,had,borne,six,children,and,buried,three
she,was,a,tall,woman,standing,a,head,higher,than,her,fiery,little,husband,but,she,moved,with,such,quiet,grace,in,her,swaying,hoops,that,the,height,attracted,no,attention,to,itself
her,neck,rising,from,the,black,taffeta,sheath,of,her,basque,was,creamy-skinned,rounded,and,slender,and,it,seemed,always,tilted,slightly,backward,by,the,weight,of,her,luxuriant,hair,in,its,net,at,the,back,of,her,head
from,her,french,mother,whose,parents,had,fled,haiti,in,the,revolution,of,1791,had,come,her,slanting,dark,eyes,shadowed,by,inky,lashes,and,her,black,hair,and,from,her,father,a,soldier,of,napoleon,she,had,her,long,straight,nose,and,her,square-cut,jaw,that,was,softened,by,the,gentle,curving,of,her,cheeks
but,only,from,life,could,ellen's,face,have,acquired,its,look,of,pride,that,had,no,haughtiness,its,graciousness,its,melancholy,and,its,utter,lack,of,humor
she,would,have,been,a,strikingly,beautiful,woman,had,there,been,any,glow,in,her,eyes,any,responsive,warmth,in,her,smile,or,any,spontaneity,in,her,voice,that,fell,with,gentle,melody,on,the,ears,of,her,family,and,her,servants
she,spoke,in,the,soft,slurring,voice,of,the,coastal,georgian,liquid,of,vowels,kind,to,consonants,and,with,the,barest,trace,of,french,accent
it,was,a,voice,never,raised,in,command,to,a,servant,or,reproof,to,a,child,but,a,voice,that,was,obeyed,instantly,at,tara,where,her,husband's,blustering,and,roaring,were,quietly,disregarded
as,far,back,as,scarlett,could,remember,her,mother,had,always,been,the,same,her,voice,soft,and,sweet,whether,in,praising,or,in,reproving,her,manner,efficient,and,unruffled,despite,the,daily,emergencies,of,gerald's,turbulent,household,her,spirit,always,calm,and,her,back,unbowed,even,in,the,deaths,of,her,three,baby,sons
scarlett,had,never,seen,her,mother's,back,touch,the,back,of,any,chair,on,which,she,sat
nor,had,she,ever,seen,her,sit,down,without,a,bit,of,needlework,in,her,hands,except,at,mealtime,while,attending,the,sick,or,while,working,at,the,bookkeeping,of,the,plantation
it,was,delicate,embroidery,if,company,were,present,but,at,other,times,her,hands,were,occupied,with,gerald's,ruffled,shirts,the,girls',dresses,or,garments,for,the,slaves
scarlett,could,not,imagine,her,mother's,hands,without,her,gold,thimble,or,her,rustling,figure,unaccompanied,by,the,small,negro,girl,whose,sole,function,in,life,was,to,remove,basting,threads,and,carry,the,rosewood,sewing,box,from,room,to,room,as,ellen,moved,about,the,house,superintending,the,cooking,the,cleaning,and,the,wholesale,clothes-making,for,the,plantation
she,had,never,seen,her,mother,stirred,from,her,austere,placidity,nor,her,personal,appointments,anything,but,perfect,no,matter,what,the,hour,of,day,or,night
when,ellen,was,dressing,for,a,ball,or,for,guests,or,even,to,go,to,jonesboro,for,court,day,it,frequently,required,two,hours,two,maids,and,mammy,to,turn,her,out,to,her,own,satisfaction,but,her,swift,toilets,in,times,of,emergency,were,amazing
scarlett,whose,room,lay,across,the,hall,from,her,mother's,knew,from,babyhood,the,soft,sound,of,scurrying,bare,black,feet,on,the,hardwood,floor,in,the,hours,of,dawn,the,urgent,tappings,on,her,mother's,door,and,the,muffled,frightened,negro,voices,that,whispered,of,sickness,and,birth,and,death,in,the,long,row,of,whitewashed,cabins,in,the,quarters
as,a,child,she,often,had,crept,to,the,door,and,peeping,through,the,tiniest,crack,had,seen,ellen,emerge,from,the,dark,room,where,gerald's,snores,were,rhythmic,and,untroubled,into,the,flickering,light,of,an,upheld,candle,her,medicine,case,under,her,arm,her,hair,smoothed,neatly,place,and,no,button,on,her,basque,unlooped
it,had,always,been,so,soothing,to,scarlett,to,hear,her,mother,whisper,firmly,but,compassionately,as,she,tiptoed,down,the,hall,hush,not,so,loudly
you,will,wake,mr,o'hara
they,are,not,sick,enough,to,die
yes,it,was,good,to,creep,back,into,bed,and,know,that,ellen,was,abroad,in,the,night,and,everything,was,right
in,the,mornings,after,all-night,sessions,at,births,and,deaths,when,old,dr,fontaine,and,young,dr,fontaine,were,both,out,on,calls,and,could,not,be,found,to,help,her,ellen,presided,at,the,breakfast,table,as,usual,her,dark,eyes,circled,with,weariness,but,her,voice,and,manner,revealing,none,of,the,strain
there,was,a,steely,quality,under,her,stately,gentleness,that,awed,the,whole,household,gerald,as,well,as,the,girls,though,he,would,have,died,rather,than,admit,it
sometimes,when,scarlett,tiptoed,at,night,to,kiss,her,tall,mother's,cheek,she,looked,up,at,the,mouth,with,its,too,short,too,tender,upper,lip,a,mouth,too,easily,hurt,by,the,world,and,wondered,if,it,had,ever,curved,in,silly,girlish,giggling,or,whispered,secrets,through,long,nights,to,intimate,girl,friends
but,no,that,wasn't,possible
mother,had,always,been,just,as,she,was,a,pillar,of,strength,a,fount,of,wisdom,the,one,person,who,knew,the,answers,to,everything
but,scarlett,was,wrong,for,years,before,ellen,robillard,of,savannah,had,giggled,as,inexplicably,as,any,fifteen-year-old,in,that,charming,coastal,city,and,whispered,the,long,nights,through,with,friends,exchanging,confidences,telling,all,secrets,but,one
that,was,the,year,when,gerald,o'hara,twenty-eight,years,older,than,she,came,into,her,life,the,year,too,when,youth,and,her,black-eyed,cousin,philippe,robillard,went,out,of,it
for,when,philippe,with,his,snapping,eyes,and,his,wild,ways,left,savannah,forever,he,took,with,him,the,glow,that,was,in,ellen's,heart,and,left,for,the,bandy-legged,little,irishman,who,married,her,only,a,gentle,shell
but,that,was,enough,for,gerald,overwhelmed,at,his,unbelievable,luck,in,actually,marrying,her
and,if,anything,was,gone,from,her,he,never,missed,it
shrewd,man,that,he,was,he,knew,that,it,was,no,less,than,a,miracle,that,he,an,irishman,with,nothing,of,family,and,wealth,to,recommend,him,should,win,the,daughter,of,one,of,the,wealthiest,and,proudest,families,on,the,coast
for,gerald,was,a,self-made,man
gerald,had,come,to,america,from,ireland,when,he,was,twenty-one
he,had,come,hastily,as,many,a,better,and,worse,irishman,before,and,since,with,the,clothes,he,had,on,his,back,two,shillings,above,his,passage,money,and,a,price,on,his,head,that,he,felt,was,larger,than,his,misdeed,warranted
there,was,no,orangeman,this,side,of,hell,worth,a,hundred,pounds,to,the,british,government,or,to,the,devil,himself,but,if,the,government,felt,so,strongly,about,the,death,of,an,english,absentee,landlord's,rent,agent,it,was,time,for,gerald,o'hara,to,be,leaving,and,leaving,suddenly
true,he,had,called,the,rent,agent,a,bastard,of,an,orangeman,but,that,according,to,gerald's,way,of,looking,at,it,did,not,give,the,man,any,right,to,insult,him,by,whistling,the,opening,bars,of,the,boyne,water
the,battle,of,the,boyne,had,been,fought,more,than,a,hundred,years,before,but,to,the,o'haras,and,their,neighbors,it,might,have,been,yesterday,when,their,hopes,and,their,dreams,as,well,as,their,lands,and,wealth,went,off,in,the,same,cloud,of,dust,that,enveloped,a,frightened,and,fleeing,stuart,prince,leaving,william,of,orange,and,his,hated,troops,with,their,orange,cockades,to,cut,down,the,irish,adherents,of,the,stuarts
for,this,and,other,reasons,gerald's,family,was,not,inclined,to,view,the,fatal,outcome,of,this,quarrel,as,anything,very,serious,except,for,the,fact,that,it,was,charged,with,serious,consequences
for,years,the,o'haras,had,been,in,bad,odor,with,the,english,constabulary,on,account,of,suspected,activities,against,the,government,and,gerald,was,not,the,first,o'hara,to,take,his,foot,in,his,hand,and,quit,ireland,between,dawn,and,morning
his,two,oldest,brothers,james,and,andrew,he,hardly,remembered,save,as,close-lipped,youths,who,came,and,went,at,odd,hours,of,the,night,on,mysterious,errands,or,disappeared,for,weeks,at,a,time,to,their,mother's,gnawing,anxiety
they,had,come,to,america,years,before,after,the,discovery,of,a,small,arsenal,of,rifles,buried,under,the,o'hara,pigsty
now,they,were,successful,merchants,in,savannah,though,the,dear,god,alone,knows,where,that,may,be,as,their,mother,always,interpolated,when,mentioning,the,two,oldest,of,her,male,brood,and,it,was,to,them,that,young,gerald,was,sent
he,left,home,with,his,mother's,hasty,kiss,on,his,cheek,and,her,fervent,catholic,blessing,in,his,ears,and,his,father's,parting,admonition,remember,who,ye,are,and,don't,be,taking,nothing,off,no,man
his,five,tall,brothers,gave,him,good-by,with,admiring,but,slightly,patronizing,smiles,for,gerald,was,the,baby,and,the,little,one,of,a,brawny,family
his,five,brothers,and,their,father,stood,six,feet,and,over,and,broad,in,proportion,but,little,gerald,at,twenty-one,knew,that,five,feet,four,and,a,half,inches,was,as,much,as,the,lord,in,his,wisdom,was,going,to,allow,him
it,was,like,gerald,that,he,never,wasted,regrets,on,his,lack,of,height,and,never,found,it,an,obstacle,to,his,acquisition,of,anything,he,wanted
rather,it,was,gerald's,compact,smallness,that,made,him,what,he,was,for,he,had,learned,early,that,little,people,must,be,hardy,to,survive,among,large,ones
and,gerald,was,hardy
his,tall,brothers,were,a,grim,quiet,lot,in,whom,the,family,tradition,of,past,glories,lost,forever,rankled,in,unspoken,hate,and,crackled,out,in,bitter,humor
had,gerald,been,brawny,he,would,have,gone,the,way,of,the,other,o'haras,and,moved,quietly,and,darkly,among,the,rebels,against,the,government
but,gerald,was,loud-mouthed,and,bullheaded,as,his,mother,fondly,phrased,it,hair,trigger,of,temper,quick,with,his,fists,and,possessed,of,a,chip,on,his,shoulder,so,large,as,to,be,almost,visible,to,the,naked,eye
he,swaggered,among,the,tall,o'haras,like,a,strutting,bantam,in,a,barnyard,of,giant,cochin,roosters,and,they,loved,him,baited,him,affectionately,to,hear,him,roar,and,hammered,on,him,with,their,large,fists,no,more,than,was,necessary,to,keep,a,baby,brother,in,his,proper,place
if,the,educational,equipment,which,gerald,brought,to,america,was,scant,he,did,not,even,know,it
nor,would,he,have,cared,if,he,had,been,told
his,mother,had,taught,him,to,read,and,to,write,a,clear,hand
he,was,adept,at,ciphering
and,there,his,book,knowledge,stopped
the,only,latin,he,knew,was,the,responses,of,the,mass,and,the,only,history,the,manifold,wrongs,of,ireland
he,knew,no,poetry,save,that,of,moore,and,no,music,except,the,songs,of,ireland,that,had,come,down,through,the,years
while,he,entertained,the,liveliest,respect,for,those,who,had,more,book,learning,than,he,he,never,felt,his,own,lack
and,what,need,had,he,of,these,things,in,a,new,country,where,the,most,ignorant,of,bogtrotters,had,made,great,fortunes
in,this,country,which,asked,only,that,a,man,be,strong,and,unafraid,of,work
nor,did,james,and,andrew,who,took,him,into,their,store,in,savannah,regret,his,lack,of,education
his,clear,hand,his,accurate,figures,and,his,shrewd,ability,in,bargaining,won,their,respect,where,a,knowledge,of,literature,and,a,fine,appreciation,of,music,had,young,gerald,possessed,them,would,have,moved,them,to,snorts,of,contempt
america,in,the,early,years,of,the,century,had,been,kind,to,the,irish
james,and,andrew,who,had,begun,by,hauling,goods,in,covered,wagons,from,savannah,to,georgia's,inland,towns,had,prospered,into,a,store,of,their,own,and,gerald,prospered,with,them
he,liked,the,south,and,he,soon,became,in,his,own,opinion,a,southerner
there,was,much,about,the,south,and,southerners,that,he,would,never,comprehend,but,with,the,wholeheartedness,that,was,his,nature,he,adopted,its,ideas,and,customs,as,he,understood,them,for,his,own,poker,and,horse,racing,red-hot,politics,and,the,code,duello,states',rights,and,damnation,to,all,yankees,slavery,and,king,cotton,contempt,for,white,trash,and,exaggerated,courtesy,to,women
he,even,learned,to,chew,tobacco
there,was,no,need,for,him,to,acquire,a,good,head,for,whisky,he,had,been,born,with,one
but,gerald,remained,gerald
his,habits,of,living,and,his,ideas,changed,but,his,manners,he,would,not,change,even,had,he,been,able,to,change,them
he,admired,the,drawling,elegance,of,the,wealthy,rice,and,cotton,planters,who,rode,into,savannah,from,their,moss-hung,kingdoms,mounted,on,thoroughbred,horses,and,followed,by,the,carriages,of,their,equally,elegant,ladies,and,the,wagons,of,their,slaves
but,gerald,could,never,attain,elegance
their,lazy,blurred,voices,fell,pleasantly,on,his,ears,but,his,own,brisk,brogue,clung,to,his,tongue
he,liked,the,casual,grace,with,which,they,conducted,affairs,of,importance,risking,a,fortune,a,plantation,or,a,slave,on,the,turn,of,a,card,and,writing,off,their,losses,with,careless,good,humor,and,no,more,ado,than,when,they,scattered,pennies,to,pickaninnies
but,gerald,had,known,poverty,and,he,could,never,learn,to,lose,money,with,good,humor,or,good,grace
they,were,a,pleasant,race,these,coastal,georgians,with,their,soft-voiced,quick,rages,and,their,charming,inconsistencies,and,gerald,liked,them
but,there,was,a,brisk,and,restless,vitality,about,the,young,irishman,fresh,from,a,country,where,winds,blew,wet,and,chill,where,misty,swamps,held,no,fevers,that,set,him,apart,from,these,indolent,gentlefolk,of,semi-tropical,weather,and,malarial,marshes
from,them,he,learned,what,he,found,useful,and,the,rest,he,dismissed
he,found,poker,the,most,useful,of,all,southern,customs,poker,and,a,steady,head,for,whisky,and,it,was,his,natural,aptitude,for,cards,and,amber,liquor,that,brought,to,gerald,two,of,his,three,most,prized,possessions,his,valet,and,his,plantation
the,other,was,his,wife,and,he,could,only,attribute,her,to,the,mysterious,kindness,of,god
the,valet,pork,by,name,shining,black,dignified,and,trained,in,all,the,arts,of,sartorial,elegance,was,the,result,of,an,all-night,poker,game,with,a,planter,from,st,simons,island,whose,courage,in,a,bluff,equaled,gerald's,but,whose,head,for,new,orleans,rum,did,not
though,pork's,former,owner,later,offered,to,buy,him,back,at,twice,his,value,gerald,obstinately,refused,for,the,possession,of,his,first,slave,and,that,slave,the,best,damn,valet,on,the,coast,was,the,first,step,upward,toward,his,heart's,desire,gerald,wanted,to,be,a,slave,owner,and,a,landed,gentleman
his,mind,was,made,up,that,he,was,not,going,to,spend,all,of,his,days,like,james,and,andrew,in,bargaining,or,all,his,nights,by,candlelight,over,long,columns,of,figures
he,felt,keenly,as,his,brothers,did,not,the,social,stigma,attached,to,those,in,trade
gerald,wanted,to,be,a,planter
with,the,deep,hunger,of,an,irishman,who,has,been,a,tenant,on,the,lands,his,people,once,had,owned,and,hunted,he,wanted,to,see,his,own,acres,stretching,green,before,his,eyes
with,a,ruthless,singleness,of,purpose,he,desired,his,own,house,his,own,plantation,his,own,horse,his,own,slaves
and,here,in,this,new,country,safe,from,the,twin,perils,of,the,land,he,had,left,taxation,that,ate,up,crops,and,barns,and,the,ever-present,threat,of,sudden,confiscation,he,intended,to,have,them
but,having,that,ambition,and,bringing,it,to,realization,were,two,different,matters,he,discovered,as,time,went,by
coastal,georgia,was,too,firmly,held,by,an,entrenched,aristocracy,for,him,ever,to,hope,to,win,the,place,he,intended,to,have
then,the,hand,of,fate,and,a,hand,of,poker,combined,to,give,him,the,plantation,which,he,afterwards,called,tara,and,at,the,same,time,moved,him,out,of,the,coast,into,the,upland,country,of,north,georgia
it,was,in,a,saloon,in,savannah,on,a,hot,night,in,spring,when,the,chance,conversation,of,a,stranger,sitting,near,by,made,gerald,prick,up,his,ears
the,stranger,a,native,of,savannah,had,just,returned,after,twelve,years,in,the,inland,country
he,had,been,one,of,the,winners,in,the,land,lottery,conducted,by,the,state,to,divide,up,the,vast,area,in,middle,georgia,ceded,by,the,indians,the,year,before,gerald,came,to,america
he,had,gone,up,there,and,established,a,plantation,but,now,the,house,had,burned,down,he,was,tired,of,the,accursed,place,and,would,be,most,happy,to,get,it,off,his,hands
gerald,his,mind,never,free,of,the,thought,of,owning,a,plantation,of,his,own,arranged,an,introduction,and,his,interest,grew,as,the,stranger,told,how,the,northern,section,of,the,state,was,filling,up,with,newcomers,from,the,carolinas,and,virginia
gerald,had,lived,in,savannah,long,enough,to,acquire,a,viewpoint,of,the,coast,that,all,of,the,rest,of,the,state,was,backwoods,with,an,indian,lurking,in,every,thicket
in,transacting,business,for,o'hara,brothers,he,had,visited,augusta,a,hundred,miles,up,the,savannah,river,and,he,had,traveled,inland,far,enough,to,visit,the,old,towns,westward,from,that,city
he,knew,that,section,to,be,as,well,settled,as,the,coast,but,from,the,stranger's,description,his,plantation,was,more,than,two,hundred,and,fifty,miles,inland,from,savannah,to,the,north,and,west,and,not,many,miles,south,of,the,chattahoochee,river
gerald,knew,that,northward,beyond,that,stream,the,land,was,still,held,by,the,cherokees,so,it,was,with,amazement,that,he,heard,the,stranger,jeer,at,suggestions,of,trouble,with,the,indians,and,narrate,how,thriving,towns,were,growing,up,and,plantations,prospering,in,the,new,country
an,hour,later,when,the,conversation,began,to,lag,gerald,with,a,guile,that,belied,the,wide,innocence,of,his,bright,blue,eyes,proposed,a,game
as,the,night,wore,on,and,the,drinks,went,round,there,came,a,time,when,all,the,others,in,the,game,laid,down,their,hands,and,gerald,and,the,stranger,were,battling,alone
the,stranger,shoved,in,all,his,chips,and,followed,with,the,deed,to,his,plantation
gerald,shoved,in,all,his,chips,and,laid,on,top,of,them,his,wallet
if,the,money,it,contained,happened,to,belong,to,the,firm,of,o'hara,brothers,gerald's,conscience,was,not,sufficiently,troubled,to,confess,it,before,mass,the,following,morning
he,knew,what,he,wanted,and,when,gerald,wanted,something,he,gained,it,by,taking,the,most,direct,route
moreover,such,was,his,faith,in,his,destiny,and,four,deuces,that,he,never,for,a,moment,wondered,just,how,the,money,would,be,paid,back,should,a,higher,hand,be,laid,down,across,the,table
it's,no,bargain,you're,getting,and,i,am,glad,not,to,have,to,pay,more,taxes,on,the,place,sighed,the,possessor,of,an,ace,full,as,he,called,for,pen,and,ink
the,big,house,burned,a,year,ago,and,the,fields,are,growing,up,in,brush,and,seedling,pine
but,it's,yours
never,mix,cards,and,whisky,unless,you,were,weaned,on,irish,poteen,gerald,told,pork,gravely,the,same,evening,as,pork,assisted,him,to,bed
and,the,valet,who,had,begun,to,attempt,a,brogue,out,of,admiration,for,his,new,master,made,requisite,answer,in,a,combination,of,geechee,and,county,meath,that,would,have,puzzled,anyone,except,those,two,alone
the,muddy,flint,river,running,silently,between,walls,of,pine,and,water,oak,covered,with,tangled,vines,wrapped,about,gerald's,new,land,like,a,curving,arm,and,embraced,it,on,two,sides
to,gerald,standing,on,the,small,knoll,where,the,house,had,been,this,tall,barrier,of,green,was,as,visible,and,pleasing,an,evidence,of,ownership,as,though,it,were,a,fence,that,he,himself,had,built,to,mark,his,own
he,stood,on,the,blackened,foundation,stones,of,the,burned,building,looked,down,the,long,avenue,of,trees,leading,toward,the,road,and,swore,lustily,with,a,joy,too,deep,for,thankful,prayer
these,twin,lines,of,somber,trees,were,his,his,the,abandoned,lawn,waist,high,in,weeds,under,white-starred,young,magnolia,trees
the,uncultivated,fields,studded,with,tiny,pines,and,underbrush,that,stretched,their,rolling,red-clay,surface,away,into,the,distance,on,four,sides,belonged,to,gerald,o'hara,were,all,his,because,he,had,an,unbefuddled,irish,head,and,the,courage,to,stake,everything,on,a,hand,of,cards
gerald,closed,his,eyes,and,in,the,stillness,of,the,unworked,acres,he,felt,that,he,had,come,home
here,under,his,feet,would,rise,a,house,of,whitewashed,brick
across,the,road,would,be,new,rail,fences,inclosing,fat,cattle,and,blooded,horses,and,the,red,earth,that,rolled,down,the,hillside,to,the,rich,river,bottom,land,would,gleam,white,as,eiderdown,in,the,sun,cotton,acres,and,acres,of,cotton
the,fortunes,of,the,o'haras,would,rise,again
with,his,own,small,stake,what,he,could,borrow,from,his,unenthusiastic,brothers,and,a,neat,sum,from,mortgaging,the,land,gerald,bought,his,first,field,hands,and,came,to,tara,to,live,in,bachelor,solitude,in,the,four-room,overseer's,house,till,such,a,time,as,the,white,walls,of,tara,should,rise
he,cleared,the,fields,and,planted,cotton,and,borrowed,more,money,from,james,and,andrew,to,buy,more,slaves
the,o'haras,were,a,clannish,tribe,clinging,to,one,another,in,prosperity,as,well,as,in,adversity,not,for,any,overweening,family,affection,but,because,they,had,learned,through,grim,years,that,to,survive,a,family,must,present,an,unbroken,front,to,the,world
they,lent,gerald,the,money,and,in,the,years,that,followed,the,money,came,back,to,them,with,interest
gradually,the,plantation,widened,out,as,gerald,bought,more,acres,lying,near,him,and,in,time,the,white,house,became,a,reality,instead,of,a,dream
it,was,built,by,slave,labor,a,clumsy,sprawling,building,that,crowned,the,rise,of,ground,overlooking,the,green,incline,of,pasture,land,running,down,to,the,river,and,it,pleased,gerald,greatly,for,even,when,new,it,wore,a,look,of,mellowed,years
the,old,oaks,which,had,seen,indians,pass,under,their,limbs,hugged,the,house,closely,with,their,great,trunks,and,towered,their,branches,over,the,roof,in,dense,shade
the,lawn,reclaimed,from,weeds,grew,thick,with,clover,and,bermuda,grass,and,gerald,saw,to,it,that,it,was,well,kept
from,the,avenue,of,cedars,to,the,row,of,white,cabins,in,the,slave,quarters,there,was,an,air,of,solidness,of,stability,and,permanence,about,tara,and,whenever,gerald,galloped,around,the,bend,in,the,road,and,saw,his,own,roof,rising,through,green,branches,his,heart,swelled,with,pride,as,though,each,sight,of,it,were,the,first,sight
he,had,done,it,all,little,hard-headed,blustering,gerald
gerald,was,on,excellent,terms,with,all,his,neighbors,in,the,county,except,the,macintoshes,whose,land,adjoined,his,on,the,left,and,the,slatterys,whose,meager,three,acres,stretched,on,his,right,along,the,swamp,bottoms,between,the,river,and,john,wilkes',plantation
the,macintoshes,were,scotch-irish,and,orangemen,and,had,they,possessed,all,the,saintly,qualities,of,the,catholic,calendar,this,ancestry,would,have,damned,them,forever,in,gerald's,eyes
true,they,had,lived,in,georgia,for,seventy,years,and,before,that,had,spent,a,generation,in,the,carolinas,but,the,first,of,the,family,who,set,foot,on,american,shores,had,come,from,ulster,and,that,was,enough,for,gerald
they,were,a,close-mouthed,and,stiff-necked,family,who,kept,strictly,to,themselves,and,intermarried,with,their,carolina,relatives,and,gerald,was,not,alone,in,disliking,them,for,the,county,people,were,neighborly,and,sociable,and,none,too,tolerant,of,anyone,lacking,in,those,same,qualities
rumors,of,abolitionist,sympathies,did,not,enhance,the,popularity,of,the,macintoshes
old,angus,had,never,manumitted,a,single,slave,and,had,committed,the,unpardonable,social,breach,of,selling,some,of,his,negroes,to,passing,slave,traders,en,route,to,the,cane,fields,of,louisiana,but,the,rumors,persisted
he's,an,abolitionist,no,doubt,observed,gerald,to,john,wilkes
but,in,an,orangeman,when,a,principle,comes,up,against,scotch,tightness,the,principle,fares,ill
the,slatterys,were,another,affair
being,poor,white,they,were,not,even,accorded,the,grudging,respect,that,angus,macintosh's,dour,independence,wrung,from,neighboring,families
old,slattery,who,clung,persistently,to,his,few,acres,in,spite,of,repeated,offers,from,gerald,and,john,wilkes,was,shiftless,and,whining
his,wife,was,a,snarly-haired,woman,sickly,and,washed-out,of,appearance,the,mother,of,a,brood,of,sullen,and,rabbity-looking,children,a,brood,which,was,increased,regularly,every,year
tom,slattery,owned,no,slaves,and,he,and,his,two,oldest,boys,spasmodically,worked,their,few,acres,of,cotton,while,the,wife,and,younger,children,tended,what,was,supposed,to,be,a,vegetable,garden
but,somehow,the,cotton,always,failed,and,the,garden,due,to,mrs,slattery's,constant,childbearing,seldom,furnished,enough,to,feed,her,flock
the,sight,of,tom,slattery,dawdling,on,his,neighbors',porches,begging,cotton,seed,for,planting,or,a,side,of,bacon,to,tide,him,over,was,a,familiar,one
slattery,hated,his,neighbors,with,what,little,energy,he,possessed,sensing,their,contempt,beneath,their,courtesy,and,especially,did,he,hate,rich,folks',uppity,niggers
the,house,negroes,of,the,county,considered,themselves,superior,to,white,trash,and,their,unconcealed,scorn,stung,him,while,their,more,secure,position,in,life,stirred,his,envy
by,contrast,with,his,own,miserable,existence,they,were,well-fed,well-clothed,and,looked,after,in,sickness,and,old,age
they,were,proud,of,the,good,names,of,their,owners,and,for,the,most,part,proud,to,belong,to,people,who,were,quality,while,he,was,despised,by,all
tom,slattery,could,have,sold,his,farm,for,three,times,its,value,to,any,of,the,planters,in,the,county
they,would,have,considered,it,money,well,spent,to,rid,the,community,of,an,eyesore,but,he,was,well,satisfied,to,remain,and,to,subsist,miserably,on,the,proceeds,of,a,bale,of,cotton,a,year,and,the,charity,of,his,neighbors
with,all,the,rest,of,the,county,gerald,was,on,terms,of,amity,and,some,intimacy
the,wilkeses,the,calverts,the,tarletons,the,fontaines,all,smiled,when,the,small,figure,on,the,big,white,horse,galloped,up,their,driveways,smiled,and,signaled,for,tall,glasses,in,which,a,pony,of,bourbon,had,been,poured,over,a,teaspoon,of,sugar,and,a,sprig,of,crushed,mint
gerald,was,likable,and,the,neighbors,learned,in,time,what,the,children,negroes,and,dogs,discovered,at,first,sight,that,a,kind,heart,a,ready,and,sympathetic,ear,and,an,open,pocketbook,lurked,just,behind,his,bawling,voice,and,his,truculent,manner
his,arrival,was,always,amid,a,bedlam,of,hounds,barking,and,small,black,children,shouting,as,they,raced,to,meet,him,quarreling,for,the,privilege,of,holding,his,horse,and,squirming,and,grinning,under,his,good-natured,insults
the,white,children,clamored,to,sit,on,his,knee,and,be,trotted,while,he,denounced,to,their,elders,the,infamy,of,yankee,politicians,the,daughters,of,his,friends,took,him,into,their,confidence,about,their,love,affairs,and,the,youths,of,the,neighborhood,fearful,of,confessing,debts,of,honor,upon,the,carpets,of,their,fathers,found,him,a,friend,in,need
so,you've,been,owning,this,for,a,month,you,young,rascal
he,would,shout
and,in,god's,name,why,haven't,you,been,asking,me,for,the,money,before,this
his,rough,manner,of,speech,was,too,well,known,to,give,offense,and,it,only,made,the,young,men,grin,sheepishly,and,reply,well,sir,i,hated,to,trouble,you,and,my,father
your,father's,a,good,man,and,no,denying,it,but,strict,and,so,take,this,and,let's,be,hearing,no,more,of,it
the,planters',ladies,were,the,last,to,capitulate
but,when,mrs,wilkes,a,great,lady,and,with,a,rare,gift,for,silence,as,gerald,characterized,her,told,her,husband,one,evening,after,gerald's,horse,had,pounded,down,the,driveway
he,has,a,rough,tongue,but,he,is,a,gentleman,gerald,had,definitely,arrived
he,did,not,know,that,he,had,taken,nearly,ten,years,to,arrive,for,it,never,occurred,to,him,that,his,neighbors,had,eyed,him,askance,at,first
in,his,own,mind,there,had,never,been,any,doubt,that,he,belonged,from,the,moment,he,first,set,foot,on,tara
when,gerald,was,forty-three,so,thickset,of,body,and,florid,of,face,that,he,looked,like,a,hunting,squire,out,of,a,sporting,print,it,came,to,him,that,tara,dear,though,it,was,and,the,county,folk,with,their,open,hearts,and,open,houses,were,not,enough
he,wanted,a,wife
tara,cried,out,for,a,mistress
the,fat,cook,a,yard,negro,elevated,by,necessity,to,the,kitchen,never,had,the,meals,on,time,and,the,chambermaid,formerly,a,field,hand,let,dust,accumulate,on,the,furniture,and,never,seemed,to,have,clean,linen,on,hand,so,that,the,arrival,of,guests,was,always,the,occasion,of,much,stirring,and,to-do
pork,the,only,trained,house,negro,on,the,place,had,general,supervision,over,the,other,servants,but,even,he,had,grown,slack,and,careless,after,several,years,of,exposure,to,gerald's,happy-go-lucky,mode,of,living
as,valet,he,kept,gerald's,bedroom,in,order,and,as,butler,he,served,the,meals,with,dignity,and,style,but,otherwise,he,pretty,well,let,matters,follow,their,own,course
with,unerring,african,instinct,the,negroes,had,all,discovered,that,gerald,had,a,loud,bark,and,no,bite,at,all,and,they,took,shameless,advantage,of,him
the,air,was,always,thick,with,threats,of,selling,slaves,south,and,of,direful,whippings,but,there,never,had,been,a,slave,sold,from,tara,and,only,one,whipping,and,that,administered,for,not,grooming,down,gerald's,pet,horse,after,a,long,day's,hunting
gerald's,sharp,blue,eyes,noticed,how,efficiently,his,neighbors',houses,were,run,and,with,what,ease,the,smooth-haired,wives,in,rustling,skirts,managed,their,servants
he,had,no,knowledge,of,the,dawn-till-midnight,activities,of,these,women,chained,to,supervision,of,cooking,nursing,sewing,and,laundering
he,only,saw,the,outward,results,and,those,results,impressed,him
the,urgent,need,of,a,wife,became,clear,to,him,one,morning,when,he,was,dressing,to,ride,to,town,for,court,day
pork,brought,forth,his,favorite,ruffled,shirt,so,inexpertly,mended,by,the,chambermaid,as,to,be,unwearable,by,anyone,except,his,valet
mist',gerald,said,pork,gratefully,rolling,up,the,shirt,as,gerald,fumed,whut,you,needs,is,a,wife,and,a,wife,whut,has,got,plen'y,of,house,niggers
gerald,upbraided,pork,for,his,impertinence,but,he,knew,that,he,was,right
he,wanted,a,wife,and,he,wanted,children,and,if,he,did,not,acquire,them,soon,it,would,be,too,late
but,he,was,not,going,to,marry,just,anyone,as,mr,calvert,had,done,taking,to,wife,the,yankee,governess,of,his,motherless,children
his,wife,must,be,a,lady,and,a,lady,of,blood,with,as,many,airs,and,graces,as,mrs,wilkes,and,the,ability,to,manage,tara,as,well,as,mrs,wilkes,ordered,her,own,domain
but,there,were,two,difficulties,in,the,way,of,marriage,into,the,county,families
the,first,was,the,scarcity,of,girls,of,marriageable,age
the,second,and,more,serious,one,was,that,gerald,was,a,new,man,despite,his,nearly,ten,years',residence,and,a,foreigner
no,one,knew,anything,about,his,family
while,the,society,of,up-country,georgia,was,not,so,impregnable,as,that,of,the,coast,aristocrats,no,family,wanted,a,daughter,to,wed,a,man,about,whose,grandfather,nothing,was,known
gerald,knew,that,despite,the,genuine,liking,of,the,county,men,with,whom,he,hunted,drank,and,talked,politics,there,was,hardly,one,whose,daughter,he,could,marry
and,he,did,not,intend,to,have,it,gossiped,about,over,supper,tables,that,this,that,or,the,other,father,had,regretfully,refused,to,let,gerald,o'hara,pay,court,to,his,daughter
this,knowledge,did,not,make,gerald,feel,inferior,to,his,neighbors
nothing,could,ever,make,gerald,feel,that,he,was,inferior,in,any,way,to,anyone
it,was,merely,a,quaint,custom,of,the,county,that,daughters,only,married,into,families,who,had,lived,in,the,south,much,longer,than,twenty-two,years,had,owned,land,and,slaves,and,been,addicted,only,to,the,fashionable,vices,during,that,time
pack,up
we're,going,to,savannah,he,told,pork
and,if,i,hear,you,say,'whist,'
or,'faith,'
but,once,it's,selling,you,i'll,be,doing,for,they,are,words,i,seldom,say,meself
james,and,andrew,might,have,some,advice,to,offer,on,this,subject,of,marriage,and,there,might,be,daughters,among,their,old,friends,who,would,both,meet,his,requirements,and,find,him,acceptable,as,a,husband
james,and,andrew,listened,to,his,story,patiently,but,they,gave,him,little,encouragement
they,had,no,savannah,relatives,to,whom,they,might,look,for,assistance,for,they,had,been,married,when,they,came,to,america
and,the,daughters,of,their,old,friends,had,long,since,married,and,were,raising,small,children,of,their,own
you're,not,a,rich,man,and,you,haven't,a,great,family,said,james
i've,made,me,money,and,i,can,make,a,great,family
and,i,won't,be,marrying,just,anyone
you,fly,high,observed,andrew,dryly
but,they,did,their,best,for,gerald
james,and,andrew,were,old,men,and,they,stood,well,in,savannah
they,had,many,friends,and,for,a,month,they,carried,gerald,from,home,to,home,to,suppers,dances,and,picnics
there's,only,one,who,takes,me,eye,gerald,said,finally
and,she,not,even,born,when,i,landed,here
and,who,is,it,takes,your,eye
miss,ellen,robillard,said,gerald,trying,to,speak,casually,for,the,slightly,tilting,dark,eyes,of,ellen,robillard,had,taken,more,than,his,eye
despite,a,mystifying,listlessness,of,manner,so,strange,in,a,girl,of,fifteen,she,charmed,him
moreover,there,was,a,haunting,look,of,despair,about,her,that,went,to,his,heart,and,made,him,more,gentle,with,her,than,he,had,ever,been,with,any,person,in,all,the,world
and,you,old,enough,to,be,her,father
and,me,in,me,prime
cried,gerald,stung
james,spoke,gently
jerry,there's,no,girl,in,savannah,you'd,have,less,chance,of,marrying
her,father,is,a,robillard,and,those,french,are,proud,as,lucifer
and,her,mother,god,rest,her,soul,was,a,very,great,lady
i,care,not,said,gerald,heatedly
besides,her,mother,is,dead,and,old,man,robillard,likes,me
as,a,man,yes,but,as,a,son-in-law,no
the,girl,wouldn't,have,you,anyway,interposed,andrew
she's,been,in,love,with,that,wild,buck,of,a,cousin,of,hers,philippe,robillard,for,a,year,now,despite,her,family,being,at,her,morning,and,night,to,give,him,up
he's,been,gone,to,louisiana,this,month,now,said,gerald
and,how,do,you,know
i,know,answered,gerald,who,did,not,care,to,disclose,that,pork,had,supplied,this,valuable,bit,of,information,or,that,philippe,had,departed,for,the,west,at,the,express,desire,of,his,family
and,i,do,not,think,she's,been,so,much,in,love,with,him,that,she,won't,forget,him
fifteen,is,too,young,to,know,much,about,love
they'd,rather,have,that,breakneck,cousin,for,her,than,you
so,james,and,andrew,were,as,startled,as,anyone,when,the,news,came,out,that,the,daughter,of,pierre,robillard,was,to,marry,the,little,irishman,from,up,the,country
savannah,buzzed,behind,its,doors,and,speculated,about,philippe,robillard,who,had,gone,west,but,the,gossiping,brought,no,answer
why,the,loveliest,of,the,robillard,daughters,should,marry,a,loud-voiced,red-faced,little,man,who,came,hardly,up,to,her,ears,remained,a,mystery,to,all
gerald,himself,never,quite,knew,how,it,all,came,about
he,only,knew,that,a,miracle,had,happened
and,for,once,in,his,life,he,was,utterly,humble,when,ellen,very,white,but,very,calm,put,a,light,hand,on,his,arm,and,said,i,will,marry,you,mr
o'hara
the,thunderstruck,robillards,knew,the,answer,in,part,but,only,ellen,and,her,mammy,ever,knew,the,whole,story,of,the,night,when,the,girl,sobbed,till,the,dawn,like,a,broken-hearted,child,and,rose,up,in,the,morning,a,woman,with,her,mind,made,up
with,foreboding,mammy,had,brought,her,young,mistress,a,small,package,addressed,in,a,strange,hand,from,new,orleans,a,package,containing,a,miniature,of,ellen,which,she,flung,to,the,floor,with,a,cry,four,letters,in,her,own,handwriting,to,philippe,robillard,and,a,brief,letter,from,a,new,orleans,priest,announcing,the,death,of,her,cousin,in,a,barroom,brawl
they,drove,him,away,father,and,pauline,and,eulalie
they,drove,him,away
i,hate,them
i,hate,them,all
i,never,want,to,see,them,again
i,want,to,get,away
i,will,go,away,where,i'll,never,see,them,again,or,this,town,or,anyone,who,reminds,me,of,of,him
and,when,the,night,was,nearly,spent,mammy,who,had,cried,herself,out,over,her,mistress',dark,head,protested,but,honey,you,kain,do,dat
i,will,do,it
he,is,a,kind,man
i,will,do,it,or,go,into,the,convent,at,charleston
it,was,the,threat,of,the,convent,that,finally,won,the,assent,of,bewildered,and,heartstricken,pierre,robillard
he,was,staunchly,presbyterian,even,though,his,family,were,catholic,and,the,thought,of,his,daughter,becoming,a,nun,was,even,worse,than,that,of,her,marrying,gerald,o'hara
after,all,the,man,had,nothing,against,him,but,a,lack,of,family
so,ellen,no,longer,robillard,turned,her,back,on,savannah,never,to,see,it,again,and,with,a,middle-aged,husband,mammy,and,twenty,house,niggers,journeyed,toward,tara
the,next,year,their,first,child,was,born,and,they,named,her,katie,scarlett,after,gerald's,mother
gerald,was,disappointed,for,he,had,wanted,a,son,but,he,nevertheless,was,pleased,enough,over,his,small,black-haired,daughter,to,serve,rum,to,every,slave,at,tara,and,to,get,roaringly,happily,drunk,himself
if,ellen,had,ever,regretted,her,sudden,decision,to,marry,him,no,one,ever,knew,it,certainly,not,gerald,who,almost,burst,with,pride,whenever,he,looked,at,her
she,had,put,savannah,and,its,memories,behind,her,when,she,left,that,gently,mannered,city,by,the,sea,and,from,the,moment,of,her,arrival,in,the,county,north,georgia,was,her,home
when,she,departed,from,her,father's,house,forever,she,had,left,a,home,whose,lines,were,as,beautiful,and,flowing,as,a,woman's,body,as,a,ship,in,full,sail,a,pale,pink,stucco,house,built,in,the,french,colonial,style,set,high,from,the,ground,in,a,dainty,manner,approached,by,swirling,stairs,banistered,with,wrought,iron,as,delicate,as,lace,a,dim,rich,house,gracious,but,aloof
she,had,left,not,only,that,graceful,dwelling,but,also,the,entire,civilization,that,was,behind,the,building,of,it,and,she,found,herself,in,a,world,that,was,as,strange,and,different,as,if,she,had,crossed,a,continent
here,in,north,georgia,was,a,rugged,section,held,by,a,hardy,people
high,up,on,the,plateau,at,the,foot,of,the,blue,ridge,mountains,she,saw,rolling,red,hills,wherever,she,looked,with,huge,outcroppings,of,the,underlying,granite,and,gaunt,pines,towering,somberly,everywhere
it,all,seemed,wild,and,untamed,to,her,coast-,bred,eyes,accustomed,to,the,quiet,jungle,beauty,of,the,sea,islands,draped,in,their,gray,moss,and,tangled,green,the,white,stretches,of,beach,hot,beneath,a,semitropic,sun,the,long,flat,vistas,of,sandy,land,studded,with,palmetto,and,palm
this,was,a,section,that,knew,the,chill,of,winter,as,well,as,the,heat,of,summer,and,there,was,a,vigor,and,energy,in,the,people,that,was,strange,to,her
they,were,a,kindly,people,courteous,generous,filled,with,abounding,good,nature,but,sturdy,virile,easy,to,anger
the,people,of,the,coast,which,she,had,left,might,pride,themselves,on,taking,all,their,affairs,even,their,duels,and,their,feuds,with,a,careless,air,but,these,north,georgia,people,had,a,streak,of,violence,in,them
on,the,coast,life,had,mellowed,here,it,was,young,and,lusty,and,new
all,the,people,ellen,had,known,in,savannah,might,have,been,cast,from,the,same,mold,so,similar,were,their,view,points,and,traditions,but,here,was,a,variety,of,people
north,georgia's,settlers,were,coming,in,from,many,different,places,from,other,parts,of,georgia,from,the,carolinas,and,virginia,from,europe,and,the,north
some,of,them,like,gerald,were,new,people,seeking,their,fortunes
some,like,ellen,were,members,of,old,families,who,had,found,life,intolerable,in,their,former,homes,and,sought,haven,in,a,distant,land
many,had,moved,for,no,reason,at,all,except,that,the,restless,blood,of,pioneering,fathers,still,quickened,in,their,veins
these,people,drawn,from,many,different,places,and,with,many,different,backgrounds,gave,the,whole,life,of,the,county,an,informality,that,was,new,to,ellen,an,informality,to,which,she,never,quite,accustomed,herself
she,instinctively,knew,how,coast,people,would,act,in,any,circumstance
there,was,never,any,telling,what,north,georgians,would,do
and,quickening,all,of,the,affairs,of,the,section,was,the,high,tide,of,prosperity,then,rolling,over,the,south
all,of,the,world,was,crying,out,for,cotton,and,the,new,land,of,the,county,unworn,and,fertile,produced,it,abundantly
cotton,was,the,heartbeat,of,the,section,the,planting,and,the,picking,were,the,diastole,and,systole,of,the,red,earth
wealth,came,out,of,the,curving,furrows,and,arrogance,came,too,arrogance,built,on,green,bushes,and,the,acres,of,fleecy,white
if,cotton,could,make,them,rich,in,one,generation,how,much,richer,they,would,be,in,the,next
this,certainty,of,the,morrow,gave,zest,and,enthusiasm,to,life,and,the,county,people,enjoyed,life,with,a,heartiness,that,ellen,could,never,understand
they,had,money,enough,and,slaves,enough,to,give,them,time,to,play,and,they,liked,to,play
they,seemed,never,too,busy,to,drop,work,for,a,fish,fry,a,hunt,or,a,horse,race,and,scarcely,a,week,went,by,without,its,barbecue,or,ball
ellen,never,would,or,could,quite,become,one,of,them,she,had,left,too,much,of,herself,in,savannah,but,she,respected,them,and,in,time,learned,to,admire,the,frankness,and,forthrightness,of,these,people,who,had,few,reticences,and,who,valued,a,man,for,what,he,was
she,became,the,best-loved,neighbor,in,the,county
she,was,a,thrifty,and,kind,mistress,a,good,mother,and,a,devoted,wife
the,heartbreak,and,selflessness,that,she,would,have,dedicated,to,the,church,were,devoted,instead,to,the,service,of,her,child,her,household,and,the,man,who,had,taken,her,out,of,savannah,and,its,memories,and,had,never,asked,any,questions
when,scarlett,was,a,year,old,and,more,healthy,and,vigorous,than,a,girl,baby,had,any,right,to,be,in,mammy's,opinion,ellen's,second,child,named,susan,elinor,but,always,called,suellen,was,born,and,in,due,time,came,carreen,listed,in,the,family,bible,as,caroline,irene
then,followed,three,little,boys,each,of,whom,died,before,he,had,learned,to,walk,three,little,boys,who,now,lay,under,the,twisted,cedars,in,the,burying,ground,a,hundred,yards,from,the,house,beneath,three,stones,each,bearing,the,name,of,gerald,o'hara,jr
from,the,day,when,ellen,first,came,to,tara,the,place,had,been,transformed
if,she,was,only,fifteen,years,old,she,was,nevertheless,ready,for,the,responsibilities,of,the,mistress,of,a,plantation
before,marriage,young,girls,must,be,above,all,other,things,sweet,gentle,beautiful,and,ornamental,but,after,marriage,they,were,expected,to,manage,households,that,numbered,a,hundred,people,or,more,white,and,black,and,they,were,trained,with,that,in,view
ellen,had,been,given,this,preparation,for,marriage,which,any,well-,brought-up,young,lady,received,and,she,also,had,mammy,who,could,galvanize,the,most,shiftless,negro,into,energy
she,quickly,brought,order,dignity,and,grace,into,gerald's,household,and,she,gave,tara,a,beauty,it,had,never,had,before
the,house,had,been,built,according,to,no,architectural,plan,whatever,with,extra,rooms,added,where,and,when,it,seemed,convenient,but,with,ellen's,care,and,attention,it,gained,a,charm,that,made,up,for,its,lack,of,design
the,avenue,of,cedars,leading,from,the,main,road,to,the,house,that,avenue,of,cedars,without,which,no,georgia,planter's,home,could,be,complete,had,a,cool,dark,shadiness,that,gave,a,brighter,tinge,by,contrast,to,the,green,of,the,other,trees
the,wistaria,tumbling,over,the,verandas,showed,bright,against,the,whitewashed,brick,and,it,joined,with,the,pink,crepe,myrtle,bushes,by,the,door,and,the,white-blossomed,magnolias,in,the,yard,to,disguise,some,of,the,awkward,lines,of,the,house
in,spring,time,and,summer,the,bermuda,grass,and,clover,on,the,lawn,became,emerald,so,enticing,an,emerald,that,it,presented,an,irresistible,temptation,to,the,flocks,of,turkeys,and,white,geese,that,were,supposed,to,roam,only,the,regions,in,the,rear,of,the,house
the,elders,of,the,flocks,continually,led,stealthy,advances,into,the,front,yard,lured,on,by,the,green,of,the,grass,and,the,luscious,promise,of,the,cape,jessamine,buds,and,the,zinnia,beds
against,their,depredations,a,small,black,sentinel,was,stationed,on,the,front,porch
armed,with,a,ragged,towel,the,little,negro,boy,sitting,on,the,steps,was,part,of,the,picture,of,tara,and,an,unhappy,one,for,he,was,forbidden,to,chunk,the,fowls,and,could,only,flap,the,towel,at,them,and,shoo,them
ellen,set,dozens,of,little,black,boys,to,this,task,the,first,position,of,responsibility,a,male,slave,had,at,tara
after,they,had,passed,their,tenth,year,they,were,sent,to,old,daddy,the,plantation,cobbler,to,learn,his,trade,or,to,amos,the,wheelwright,and,carpenter,or,philip,the,cow,man,or,cuffee,the,mule,boy
if,they,showed,no,aptitude,for,any,of,these,trades,they,became,field,hands,and,in,the,opinion,of,the,negroes,they,had,lost,their,claim,to,any,social,standing,at,all
ellen's,life,was,not,easy,nor,was,it,happy,but,she,did,not,expect,life,to,be,easy,and,if,it,was,not,happy,that,was,woman's,lot
it,was,a,man's,world,and,she,accepted,it,as,such
the,man,owned,the,property,and,the,woman,managed,it
the,man,took,the,credit,for,the,management,and,the,woman,praised,his,cleverness
the,man,roared,like,a,bull,when,a,splinter,was,in,his,finger,and,the,woman,muffled,the,moans,of,childbirth,lest,she,disturb,him
men,were,rough,of,speech,and,often,drunk
women,ignored,the,lapses,of,speech,and,put,the,drunkards,to,bed,without,bitter,words
men,were,rude,and,outspoken,women,were,always,kind,gracious,and,forgiving
she,had,been,reared,in,the,tradition,of,great,ladies,which,had,taught,her,how,to,carry,her,burden,and,still,retain,her,charm,and,she,intended,that,her,three,daughters,should,be,great,ladies,also
with,her,younger,daughters,she,had,success,for,suellen,was,so,anxious,to,be,attractive,she,lent,an,attentive,and,obedient,ear,to,her,mother's,teachings,and,carreen,was,shy,and,easily,led
but,scarlett,child,of,gerald,found,the,road,to,ladyhood,hard
to,mammy's,indignation,her,preferred,playmates,were,not,her,demure,sisters,or,the,well-brought-up,wilkes,girls,but,the,negro,children,on,the,plantation,and,the,boys,of,the,neighborhood,and,she,could,climb,a,tree,or,throw,a,rock,as,well,as,any,of,them
mammy,was,greatly,perturbed,that,ellen's,daughter,should,display,such,traits,and,frequently,adjured,her,to,ack,lak,a,lil,lady
but,ellen,took,a,more,tolerant,and,long-sighted,view,of,the,matter
she,knew,that,from,childhood,playmates,grew,beaux,in,later,years,and,the,first,duty,of,a,girl,was,to,get,married
she,told,herself,that,the,child,was,merely,full,of,life,and,there,was,still,time,in,which,to,teach,her,the,arts,and,graces,of,being,attractive,to,men
to,this,end,ellen,and,mammy,bent,their,efforts,and,as,scarlett,grew,older,she,became,an,apt,pupil,in,this,subject,even,though,she,learned,little,else
despite,a,succession,of,governesses,and,two,years,at,the,near-by,fayetteville,female,academy,her,education,was,sketchy,but,no,girl,in,the,county,danced,more,gracefully,than,she
she,knew,how,to,smile,so,that,her,dimples,leaped,how,to,walk,pigeon-toed,so,that,her,wide,hoop,skirts,swayed,entrancingly,how,to,look,up,into,a,man's,face,and,then,drop,her,eyes,and,bat,the,lids,rapidly,so,that,she,seemed,a-,tremble,with,gentle,emotion
most,of,all,she,learned,how,to,conceal,from,men,a,sharp,intelligence,beneath,a,face,as,sweet,and,bland,as,a,baby's
ellen,by,soft-voiced,admonition,and,mammy,by,constant,carping,labored,to,inculcate,in,her,the,qualities,that,would,make,her,truly,desirable,as,a,wife
you,must,be,more,gentle,dear,more,sedate,ellen,told,her,daughter
you,must,not,interrupt,gentlemen,when,they,are,speaking,even,if,you,do,think,you,know,more,about,matters,than,they,do
gentlemen,do,not,like,forward,girls
young,misses,whut,frowns,an,pushes,out,dey,chins,an',says,'ah,will',and,'ah,woan',mos',gener'ly,doan,ketch,husbands,prophesied,mammy,gloomily
young,misses,should,cas',down,dey,eyes,an',say,'well,suh,ah,mout',an','jes',as,you,say,suh,'
between,them,they,taught,her,all,that,a,gentlewoman,should,know,but,she,learned,only,the,outward,signs,of,gentility
the,inner,grace,from,which,these,signs,should,spring,she,never,learned,nor,did,she,see,any,reason,for,learning,it
appearances,were,enough,for,the,appearances,of,ladyhood,won,her,popularity,and,that,was,all,she,wanted
gerald,bragged,that,she,was,the,belle,of,five,counties,and,with,some,truth,for,she,had,received,proposals,from,nearly,all,the,young,men,in,the,neighborhood,and,many,from,places,as,far,away,as,atlanta,and,savannah
at,sixteen,thanks,to,mammy,and,ellen,she,looked,sweet,charming,and,giddy,but,she,was,in,reality,self-willed,vain,and,obstinate
she,had,the,easily,stirred,passions,of,her,irish,father,and,nothing,except,the,thinnest,veneer,of,her,mother's,unselfish,and,forbearing,nature
ellen,never,fully,realized,that,it,was,only,a,veneer,for,scarlett,always,showed,her,best,face,to,her,mother,concealing,her,escapades,curbing,her,temper,and,appearing,as,sweet-natured,as,she,could,in,ellen's,presence,for,her,mother,could,shame,her,to,tears,with,a,reproachful,glance
but,mammy,was,under,no,illusions,about,her,and,was,constantly,alert,for,breaks,in,the,veneer
mammy's,eyes,were,sharper,than,ellen's,and,scarlett,could,never,recall,in,all,her,life,having,fooled,mammy,for,long
it,was,not,that,these,two,loving,mentors,deplored,scarlett's,high,spirits,vivacity,and,charm
these,were,traits,of,which,southern,women,were,proud
it,was,gerald's,headstrong,and,impetuous,nature,in,her,that,gave,them,concern,and,they,sometimes,feared,they,would,not,be,able,to,conceal,her,damaging,qualities,until,she,had,made,a,good,match
but,scarlett,intended,to,marry,and,marry,ashley,and,she,was,willing,to,appear,demure,pliable,and,scatterbrained,if,those,were,the,qualities,that,attracted,men
just,why,men,should,be,this,way,she,did,not,know
she,only,knew,that,such,methods,worked
it,never,interested,her,enough,to,try,to,think,out,the,reason,for,it,for,she,knew,nothing,of,the,inner,workings,of,any,human,being's,mind,not,even,her,own
she,knew,only,that,if,she,did,or,said,thus-and-so,men,would,unerringly,respond,with,the,complementary,thus-and-so
it,was,like,a,mathematical,formula,and,no,more,difficult,for,mathematics,was,the,one,subject,that,had,come,easy,to,scarlett,in,her,schooldays
if,she,knew,little,about,men's,minds,she,knew,even,less,about,the,minds,of,women,for,they,interested,her,less
she,had,never,had,a,girl,friend,and,she,never,felt,any,lack,on,that,account
to,her,all,women,including,her,two,sisters,were,natural,enemies,in,pursuit,of,the,same,prey,man
all,women,with,the,one,exception,of,her,mother
ellen,o'hara,was,different,and,scarlett,regarded,her,as,something,holy,and,apart,from,all,the,rest,of,humankind
when,scarlett,was,a,child,she,had,confused,her,mother,with,the,virgin,mary,and,now,that,she,was,older,she,saw,no,reason,for,changing,her,opinion
to,her,ellen,represented,the,utter,security,that,only,heaven,or,a,mother,can,give
she,knew,that,her,mother,was,the,embodiment,of,justice,truth,loving,tenderness,and,profound,wisdom,a,great,lady
scarlett,wanted,very,much,to,be,like,her,mother
the,only,difficulty,was,that,by,being,just,and,truthful,and,tender,and,unselfish,one,missed,most,of,the,joys,of,life,and,certainly,many,beaux
and,life,was,too,short,to,miss,such,pleasant,things
some,day,when,she,was,married,to,ashley,and,old,some,day,when,she,had,time,for,it,she,intended,to,be,like,ellen
but,until,then
chapter,iv
that,night,at,supper,scarlett,went,through,the,motions,of,presiding,over,the,table,in,her,mother's,absence,but,her,mind,was,in,a,ferment,over,the,dreadful,news,she,had,heard,about,ashley,and,melanie
desperately,she,longed,for,her,mother's,return,from,the,slatterys',for,without,her,she,felt,lost,and,alone
what,right,had,the,slatterys,and,their,everlasting,sickness,to,take,ellen,away,from,home,just,at,this,time,when,she,scarlett,needed,her,so,much
throughout,the,dismal,meal,gerald's,booming,voice,battered,against,her,ears,until,she,thought,she,could,endure,it,no,longer
he,had,forgotten,completely,about,his,conversation,with,her,that,afternoon,and,was,carrying,on,a,monologue,about,the,latest,news,from,fort,sumter,which,he,punctuated,by,hammering,his,fist,on,the,table,and,waving,his,arms,in,the,air
gerald,made,a,habit,of,dominating,the,conversation,at,mealtimes,and,usually,scarlett,occupied,with,her,own,thoughts,scarcely,heard,him,but,tonight,she,could,not,shut,out,his,voice,no,matter,how,much,she,strained,to,listen,for,the,sound,of,carriage,wheels,that,would,herald,ellen's,return
of,course,she,did,not,intend,to,tell,her,mother,what,was,so,heavy,on,her,heart,for,ellen,would,be,shocked,and,grieved,to,know,that,a,daughter,of,hers,wanted,a,man,who,was,engaged,to,another,girl
but,in,the,depths,of,the,first,tragedy,she,had,ever,known,she,wanted,the,very,comfort,of,her,mother's,presence
she,always,felt,secure,when,ellen,was,by,her,for,there,was,nothing,so,bad,that,ellen,could,not,better,it,simply,by,being,there
she,rose,suddenly,from,her,chair,at,the,sound,of,creaking,wheels,in,the,driveway,and,then,sank,down,again,as,they,went,on,around,the,house,to,the,back,yard
it,could,not,be,ellen,for,she,would,alight,at,the,front,steps
then,there,was,an,excited,babble,of,negro,voices,in,the,darkness,of,the,yard,and,high-pitched,negro,laughter
looking,out,the,window,scarlett,saw,pork,who,had,left,the,room,a,moment,before,holding,high,a,flaring,pine,knot,while,indistinguishable,figures,descended,from,a,wagon
the,laughter,and,talking,rose,and,fell,in,the,dark,night,air,pleasant,homely,carefree,sounds,gutturally,soft,musically,shrill
then,feet,shuffled,up,the,back-porch,stairs,and,into,the,passageway,leading,to,the,main,house,stopping,in,the,hall,just,outside,the,dining,room
there,was,a,brief,interval,of,whispering,and,pork,entered,his,usual,dignity,gone,his,eyes,rolling,and,his,teeth,a-gleam

she,was,a,brown,little,creature,with,skinny,legs,like,a,bird,and,a,myriad,of,pigtails,carefully,wrapped,with,twine,sticking,stiffly,out,from,her,head

the,supper,things,cleared,away,gerald,resumed,his,oration,but,with,little,satisfaction,to,himself,and,none,at,all,to,his,audience
his,thunderous,predictions,of,immediate,war,and,his,rhetorical,questions,as,to,whether,the,south,would,stand,for,further,insults,from,the,yankees,only,produced,faintly,bored,yes,papas,and,no,pas
carreen,sitting,on,a,hassock,under,the,big,lamp,was,deep,in,the,romance,of,a,girl,who,had,taken,the,veil,after,her,lover's,death,and,with,silent,tears,of,enjoyment,oozing,from,her,eyes,was,pleasurably,picturing,herself,in,a,white,coif
suellen,embroidering,on,what,she,gigglingly,called,her,hope,chest,was,wondering,if,she,could,possibly,detach,stuart,tarleton,from,her,sister's,side,at,the,barbecue,tomorrow,and,fascinate,him,with,the,sweet,womanly,qualities,which,she,possessed,and,scarlett,did,not
and,scarlett,was,in,a,tumult,about,ashley
how,could,pa,talk,on,and,on,about,fort,sumter,and,the,yankees,when,he,knew,her,heart,was,breaking
as,usual,in,the,very,young,she,marveled,that,people,could,be,so,selfishly,oblivious,to,her,pain,and,the,world,rock,along,just,the,same,in,spite,of,her,heartbreak
her,mind,was,as,if,a,cyclone,had,gone,through,it,and,it,seemed,strange,that,the,dining,room,where,they,sat,should,be,so,placid,so,unchanged,from,what,it,had,always,been
the,heavy,mahogany,table,and,sideboards,the,massive,silver,the,bright,rag,rugs,on,the,shining,floor,were,all,in,their,accustomed,places,just,as,if,nothing,had,happened
it,was,a,friendly,and,comfortable,room,and,ordinarily,scarlett,loved,the,quiet,hours,which,the,family,spent,there,after,supper,but,tonight,she,hated,the,sight,of,it,and,if,she,had,not,feared,her,father's,loudly,bawled,questions,she,would,have,slipped,away,down,the,dark,hall,to,ellen's,little,office,and,cried,out,her,sorrow,on,the,old,sofa
that,was,the,room,that,scarlett,liked,the,best,in,all,the,house
there,ellen,sat,before,her,tall,secretary,each,morning,keeping,the,accounts,of,the,plantation,and,listening,to,the,reports,of,jonas,wilkerson,the,overseer
there,also,the,family,idled,while,ellen's,quill,scratched,across,her,ledgers
gerald,in,the,old,rocker,the,girls,on,the,sagging,cushions,of,the,sofa,that,was,too,battered,and,worn,for,the,front,of,the,house
scarlett,longed,to,be,there,now,alone,with,ellen,so,she,could,put,her,head,in,her,mother's,lap,and,cry,in,peace
wouldn't,mother,ever,come,home
then,wheels,ground,sharply,on,the,graveled,driveway,and,the,soft,murmur,of,ellen's,voice,dismissing,the,coachman,floated,into,the,room
the,whole,group,looked,up,eagerly,as,she,entered,rapidly,her,hoops,swaying,her,face,tired,and,sad
there,entered,with,her,the,faint,fragrance,of,lemon,verbena,sachet,which,seemed,always,to,creep,from,the,folds,of,her,dresses,a,fragrance,that,was,always,linked,in,scarlett's,mind,with,her,mother
mammy,followed,at,a,few,paces,the,leather,bag,in,her,hand,her,underlip,pushed,out,and,her,brow,lowering
mammy,muttered,darkly,to,herself,as,she,waddled,taking,care,that,her,remarks,were,pitched,too,low,to,be,understood,but,loud,enough,to,register,her,unqualified,disapproval
i,am,sorry,i,am,so,late,said,ellen,slipping,her,plaid,shawl,from,drooping,shoulders,and,handing,it,to,scarlett,whose,cheek,she,patted,in,passing
gerald's,face,had,brightened,as,if,by,magic,at,her,entrance
is,the,brat,baptized
he,questioned
yes,and,dead,poor,thing,said,ellen
i,feared,emmie,would,die,too,but,i,think,she,will,live
the,girls',faces,turned,to,her,startled,and,questioning,and,gerald,wagged,his,head,philosophically
well,'tis,better,so,that,the,brat,is,dead,no,doubt,poor,fatherle
it,is,late
we,had,better,have,prayers,now,interrupted,ellen,so,smoothly,that,if,scarlett,had,not,known,her,mother,well,the,interruption,would,have,passed,unnoticed
it,would,be,interesting,to,know,who,was,the,father,of,emmie,slattery's,baby,but,scarlett,knew,she,would,never,learn,the,truth,of,the,matter,if,she,waited,to,hear,it,from,her,mother
scarlett,suspected,jonas,wilkerson,for,she,had,frequently,seen,him,walking,down,the,road,with,emmie,at,nightfall
jonas,was,a,yankee,and,a,bachelor,and,the,fact,that,he,was,an,overseer,forever,barred,him,from,any,contact,with,the,county,social,life
there,was,no,family,of,any,standing,into,which,he,could,marry,no,people,with,whom,he,could,associate,except,the,slatterys,and,riffraff,like,them
as,he,was,several,cuts,above,the,slatterys,in,education,it,was,only,natural,that,he,should,not,want,to,marry,emmie,no,matter,how,often,he,might,walk,with,her,in,the,twilight
scarlett,sighed,for,her,curiosity,was,sharp
things,were,always,happening,under,her,mother's,eyes,which,she,noticed,no,more,than,if,they,had,not,happened,at,all
ellen,ignored,all,things,contrary,to,her,ideas,of,propriety,and,tried,to,teach,scarlett,to,do,the,same,but,with,poor,success
ellen,had,stepped,to,the,mantel,to,take,her,rosary,beads,from,the,small,inlaid,casket,in,which,they,always,reposed,when,mammy,spoke,up,with,firmness

mammy,had,her,own,method,of,letting,her,owners,know,exactly,where,she,stood,on,all,matters
she,knew,it,was,beneath,the,dignity,of,quality,white,folks,to,pay,the,slightest,attention,to,what,a,darky,said,when,she,was,just,grumbling,to,herself
she,knew,that,to,uphold,this,dignity,they,must,ignore,what,she,said,even,if,she,stood,in,the,next,room,and,almost,shouted
it,protected,her,from,reproof,and,it,left,no,doubt,in,anyone's,mind,as,to,her,exact,views,on,any,subject
pork,entered,the,room,bearing,a,plate,silver,and,a,napkin
he,was,followed,closely,by,jack,a,black,little,boy,of,ten,hastily,buttoning,a,white,linen,jacket,with,one,hand,and,bearing,in,the,other,a,fly-swisher,made,of,thin,strips,of,newspaper,tied,to,a,reed,longer,than,he,was
ellen,had,a,beautiful,peacock-feather,fly-brusher,but,it,was,used,only,on,very,special,occasions,and,then,only,after,domestic,struggle,due,to,the,obstinate,conviction,of,pork,cookie,and,mammy,that,peacock,feathers,were,bad,luck
ellen,sat,down,in,the,chair,which,gerald,pulled,out,for,her,and,four,voices,attacked,her
mother,the,lace,is,loose,on,my,new,ball,dress,and,i,want,to,wear,it,tomorrow,night,at,twelve,oaks

and,he,says,the,news,from,charleston,is,that,they,will,be,putting,up,with,no,more,yankee,insults
ellen's,tired,mouth,smiled,into,the,tumult,as,she,addressed,herself,first,to,her,husband,as,a,wife,should
if,the,nice,people,of,charleston,feel,that,way,i'm,sure,we,will,all,feel,the,same,way,soon,she,said,for,she,had,a,deeply,rooted,belief,that,excepting,only,savannah,most,of,the,gentle,blood,of,the,whole,continent,could,be,found,in,that,small,seaport,city,a,belief,shared,largely,by,charlestonians

suellen,behind,her,mother's,hack,wrinkled,her,nose,triumphantly,at,scarlett,who,had,been,planning,to,beg,the,necklace,for,herself
scarlett,put,out,her,tongue,at,her
suellen,was,an,annoying,sister,with,her,whining,and,selfishness,and,had,it,not,been,for,ellen's,restraining,hand,scarlett,would,frequently,have,boxed,her,ears
now,mr,o'hara,tell,me,more,about,what,mr,calvert,said,about,charleston,said,ellen
scarlett,knew,her,mother,cared,nothing,at,all,about,war,and,politics,and,thought,them,masculine,matters,about,which,no,lady,could,intelligently,concern,herself
but,it,gave,gerald,pleasure,to,air,his,views,and,ellen,was,unfailingly,thoughtful,of,her,husband's,pleasure
while,gerald,launched,forth,on,his,news,mammy,set,the,plates,before,her,mistress,golden-topped,biscuits,breast,of,fried,chicken,and,a,yellow,yam,open,and,steaming,with,melted,butter,dripping,from,it
mammy,pinched,small,jack,and,he,hastened,to,his,business,of,slowly,swishing,the,paper,ribbons,back,and,forth,behind,ellen
mammy,stood,beside,the,table,watching,every,forkful,that,traveled,from,plate,to,mouth,as,though,she,intended,to,force,the,food,down,ellen's,throat,should,she,see,signs,of,flagging
ellen,ate,diligently,but,scarlett,could,see,that,she,was,too,tired,to,know,what,she,was,eating
only,mammy's,implacable,face,forced,her,to,it
when,the,dish,was,empty,and,gerald,only,midway,in,his,remarks,on,the,thievishness,of,yankees,who,wanted,to,free,darkies,and,yet,offered,no,penny,to,pay,for,their,freedom,ellen,rose
we'll,be,having,prayers
he,questioned,reluctantly
yes
it,is,so,late,why,it,is,actually,ten,o'clock,as,the,clock,with,coughing,and,tinny,thumps,marked,the,hour
carreen,should,have,been,asleep,long,ago
the,lamp,please,pork,and,my,prayer,book,mammy
prompted,by,mammy's,hoarse,whisper,jack,set,his,fly-brush,in,the,corner,and,removed,the,dishes,while,mammy,fumbled,in,the,sideboard,drawer,for,ellen's,worn,prayer,book
pork,tiptoeing,reached,the,ring,in,the,chain,and,drew,the,lamp,slowly,down,until,the,table,top,was,brightly,bathed,in,light,and,the,ceiling,receded,into,shadows
ellen,arranged,her,skirts,and,sank,to,the,floor,on,her,knees,laying,the,open,prayer,book,on,the,table,before,her,and,clasping,her,hands,upon,it
gerald,knelt,beside,her,and,scarlett,and,suellen,took,their,accustomed,places,on,the,opposite,side,of,the,table,folding,their,voluminous,petticoats,in,pads,under,their,knees,so,they,would,ache,less,from,contact,with,the,hard,floor
carreen,who,was,small,for,her,age,could,not,kneel,comfortably,at,the,table,and,so,knelt,facing,a,chair,her,elbows,on,the,seat
she,liked,this,position,for,she,seldom,failed,to,go,to,sleep,during,prayers,and,in,this,postures,it,escaped,her,mother's,notice
the,house,servants,shuffled,and,rustled,in,the,hall,to,kneel,by,the,doorway,mammy,groaning,aloud,as,she,sank,down,pork,straight,as,a,ramrod,rosa,and,teena,the,maids,graceful,in,their,spreading,bright,calicoes,cookie,gaunt,and,yellow,beneath,her,snowy,head,rag,and,jack,stupid,with,sleep,as,far,away,from,mammy's,pinching,fingers,as,possible
their,dark,eyes,gleamed,expectantly,for,praying,with,their,white,folks,was,one,of,the,events,of,the,day
the,old,and,colorful,phrases,of,the,litany,with,its,oriental,imagery,meant,little,to,them,but,it,satisfied,something,in,their,hearts,and,they,always,swayed,when,they,chanted,the,responses,lord,have,mercy,on,us,christ,have,mercy,on,us
ellen,closed,her,eyes,and,began,praying,her,voice,rising,and,falling,lulling,and,soothing
heads,bowed,in,the,circle,of,yellow,light,as,ellen,thanked,god,for,the,health,and,happiness,of,her,home,her,family,and,her,negroes
when,she,had,finished,her,prayers,for,those,beneath,the,roof,of,tara,her,father,mother,sisters,three,dead,babies,and,all,the,poor,souls,in,purgatory,she,clasped,her,white,beads,between,long,fingers,and,began,the,rosary
like,the,rushing,of,a,soft,wind,the,responses,from,black,throats,and,white,throats,rolled,back
holy,mary,mother,of,god,pray,for,us,sinners,now,and,at,the,hour,of,our,death
despite,her,heartache,and,the,pain,of,unshed,tears,a,deep,sense,of,quiet,and,peace,fell,upon,scarlett,as,it,always,did,at,this,hour
some,of,the,disappointment,of,the,day,and,the,dread,of,the,morrow,departed,from,her,leaving,a,feeling,of,hope
it,was,not,the,lifting,up,of,her,heart,to,god,that,brought,this,balm,for,religion,went,no,more,than,lip,deep,with,her
it,was,the,sight,of,her,mother's,serene,face,upturned,to,the,throne,of,god,and,his,saints,and,angels,praying,for,blessings,on,those,whom,she,loved
when,ellen,intervened,with,heaven,scarlett,felt,certain,that,heaven,heard
ellen,finished,and,gerald,who,could,never,find,his,beads,at,prayer,time,began,furtively,counting,his,decade,on,his,fingers
as,his,voice,droned,on,scarlett's,thoughts,strayed,in,spite,of,herself
she,knew,she,should,be,examining,her,conscience
ellen,had,taught,her,that,at,the,end,of,each,day,it,was,her,duty,to,examine,her,conscience,thoroughly,to,admit,her,numerous,faults,and,pray,to,god,for,forgiveness,and,strength,never,to,repeat,them
but,scarlett,was,examining,her,heart
she,dropped,her,head,upon,her,folded,hands,so,that,her,mother,could,not,see,her,face,and,her,thoughts,went,sadly,back,to,ashley
how,could,he,be,planning,to,marry,melanie,when,he,really,loved,her,scarlett
and,when,he,knew,how,much,she,loved,him
how,could,he,deliberately,break,her,heart
then,suddenly,an,idea,shining,and,new,flashed,like,a,comet,through,her,brain
why,ashley,hasn't,an,idea,that,i'm,in,love,with,him
she,almost,gasped,aloud,in,the,shock,of,its,unexpectedness
her,mind,stood,still,as,if,paralyzed,for,a,long,breathless,instant,and,then,raced,forward
how,could,he,know
i've,always,acted,so,prissy,and,ladylike,and,touch-me-not,around,him,he,probably,thinks,i,don't,care,a,thing,about,him,except,as,a,friend
yes,that's,why,he's,never,spoken
he,thinks,his,love,is,hopeless
and,that's,why,he's,looked,so
her,mind,went,swiftly,back,to,those,times,when,she,had,caught,him,looking,at,her,in,that,strange,manner,when,the,gray,eyes,that,were,such,perfect,curtains,for,his,thoughts,had,been,wide,and,naked,and,had,in,them,a,look,of,torment,and,despair
he's,been,broken,hearted,because,he,thinks,i'm,in,love,with,brent,or,stuart,or,cade
and,probably,he,thinks,that,if,he,can't,have,me,he,might,as,well,please,his,family,and,marry,melanie
but,if,he,knew,i,did,love,him
her,volatile,spirits,shot,up,from,deepest,depression,to,excited,happiness
this,was,the,answer,to,ashley's,reticence,to,his,strange,conduct
he,didn't,know
her,vanity,leaped,to,the,aid,of,her,desire,to,believe,making,belief,a,certainty
if,he,knew,she,loved,him,he,would,hasten,to,her,side
she,had,only,to
oh
she,thought,rapturously,digging,her,fingers,into,her,lowered,brow
what,a,fool,i've,been,not,to,think,of,this,till,now
i,must,think,of,some,way,to,let,him,know
he,wouldn't,marry,her,if,he,knew,i,loved,him
how,could,he
with,a,start,she,realized,that,gerald,had,finished,and,her,mother's,eyes,were,on,her
hastily,she,began,her,decade,telling,off,the,beads,automatically,but,with,a,depth,of,emotion,in,her,voice,that,caused,mammy,to,open,her,eyes,and,shoot,a,searching,glance,at,her
as,she,finished,her,prayers,and,suellen,then,carreen,began,their,decades,her,mind,was,still,speeding,onward,with,her,entrancing,new,thought
even,now,it,wasn't,too,late
too,often,the,county,had,been,scandalized,by,elopements,when,one,or,the,other,of,the,participating,parties,was,practically,at,the,altar,with,a,third
and,ashley's,engagement,had,not,even,been,announced,yet
yes,there,was,plenty,of,time
if,no,love,lay,between,ashley,and,melanie,but,only,a,promise,given,long,ago,then,why,wasn't,it,possible,for,him,to,break,that,promise,and,marry,her
surely,he,would,do,it,if,he,knew,that,she,scarlett,loved,him
she,must,find,some,way,to,let,him,know
she,would,find,some,way
and,then
scarlett,came,abruptly,out,of,her,dream,of,delight,for,she,had,neglected,to,make,the,responses,and,her,mother,was,looking,at,her,reprovingly
as,she,resumed,the,ritual,she,opened,her,eyes,briefly,and,cast,a,quick,glance,around,the,room
the,kneeling,figures,the,soft,glow,of,the,lamp,the,dim,shadows,where,the,negroes,swayed,even,the,familiar,objects,that,had,been,so,hateful,to,her,sight,an,hour,ago,in,an,instant,took,on,the,color,of,her,own,emotions,and,the,room,seemed,once,more,a,lovely,place
she,would,never,forget,this,moment,or,this,scene
virgin,most,faithful,her,mother,intoned
the,litany,of,the,virgin,was,beginning,and,obediently,scarlett,responded,pray,for,us,as,ellen,praised,in,soft,contralto,the,attributes,of,the,mother,of,god
as,always,since,childhood,this,was,for,scarlett,a,moment,for,adoration,of,ellen,rather,than,the,virgin
sacrilegious,though,it,might,be,scarlett,always,saw,through,her,closed,eyes,the,upturned,face,of,ellen,and,not,the,blessed,virgin,as,the,ancient,phrases,were,repeated
health,of,the,sick,seat,of,wisdom,refuge,of,sinners,mystical,rose,they,were,beautiful,because,they,were,the,attributes,of,ellen
but,tonight,because,of,the,exaltation,of,her,own,spirit,scarlett,found,in,the,whole,ceremonial,the,softly,spoken,words,the,murmur,of,the,responses,a,surpassing,beauty,beyond,any,that,she,had,ever,experienced,before
and,her,heart,went,up,to,god,in,sincere,thankfulness,that,a,pathway,for,her,feet,had,been,opened,out,of,her,misery,and,straight,to,the,arms,of,ashley
when,the,last,amen,sounded,they,all,rose,somewhat,stiffly,mammy,being,hauled,to,her,feet,by,the,combined,efforts,of,teena,and,rosa
pork,took,a,long,spiller,from,the,mantelpiece,lit,it,from,the,lamp,flame,and,went,into,the,hall
opposite,the,winding,stair,stood,a,walnut,sideboard,too,large,for,use,in,the,dining,room,bearing,on,its,wide,top,several,lamps,and,a,long,row,of,candles,in,candlesticks
pork,lit,one,lamp,and,three,candles,and,with,the,pompous,dignity,of,a,first,chamberlain,of,the,royal,bedchamber,lighting,a,king,and,queen,to,their,rooms,he,led,the,procession,up,the,stairs,holding,the,light,high,above,his,head
ellen,on,gerald's,arm,followed,him,and,the,girls,each,taking,her,own,candlestick,mounted,after,them
scarlett,entered,her,room,set,the,candle,on,the,tall,chest,of,drawers,and,fumbled,in,the,dark,closet,for,the,dancing,dress,that,needed,stitching
throwing,it,across,her,arm,she,crossed,the,hall,quietly
the,door,of,her,parents',bedroom,was,slightly,ajar,and,before,she,could,knock,ellen's,voice,low,but,stern,came,to,her,ears
mr,o'hara,you,must,dismiss,jonas,wilkerson
gerald,exploded
and,where,will,i,be,getting,another,overseer,who,wouldn't,be,cheating,me,out,of,my,eyeteeth
he,must,be,dismissed,immediately,tomorrow,morning
big,sam,is,a,good,foreman,and,he,can,take,over,the,duties,until,you,can,hire,another,overseer
ah,ha
came,gerald's,voice
so,i,understand
then,the,worthy,jonas,sired,the
he,must,be,dismissed
so,he,is,the,father,of,emmie,slattery's,baby,thought,scarlett
oh,well,what,else,can,you,expect,from,a,yankee,man,and,a,white-,trash,girl
then,after,a,discreet,pause,which,gave,gerald's,splutterings,time,to,die,away,she,knocked,on,the,door,and,handed,the,dress,to,her,mother
by,the,time,scarlett,had,undressed,and,blown,out,the,candle,her,plan,for,tomorrow,had,worked,itself,out,in,every,detail
it,was,a,simple,plan,for,with,gerald's,single-mindedness,of,purpose,her,eyes,were,centered,on,the,goal,and,she,thought,only,of,the,most,direct,steps,by,which,to,reach,it
first,she,would,be,prideful,as,gerald,had,commanded
from,the,moment,she,arrived,at,twelve,oaks,she,would,be,her,gayest,most,spirited,self
no,one,would,suspect,that,she,had,ever,been,downhearted,because,of,ashley,and,melanie
and,she,would,flirt,with,every,man,there
that,would,be,cruel,to,ashley,but,it,would,make,him,yearn,for,her,all,the,more
she,wouldn't,overlook,a,man,of,marriageable,age,from,ginger-whiskered,old,frank,kennedy,who,was,suellen's,beau,on,down,to,shy,quiet,blushing,charles,hamilton,melanie's,brother
they,would,swarm,around,her,like,bees,around,a,hive,and,certainly,ashley,would,be,drawn,from,melanie,to,join,the,circle,of,her,admirers
then,somehow,she,would,maneuver,to,get,a,few,minutes,alone,with,him,away,from,the,crowd
she,hoped,everything,would,work,out,that,way,because,it,would,be,more,difficult,otherwise
but,if,ashley,didn't,make,the,first,move,she,would,simply,have,to,do,it,herself
when,they,were,finally,alone,he,would,have,fresh,in,his,mind,the,picture,of,the,other,men,thronging,about,her,he,would,be,newly,impressed,with,the,fact,that,every,one,of,them,wanted,her,and,that,look,of,sadness,and,despair,would,be,in,his,eyes
then,she,would,make,him,happy,again,by,letting,him,discover,that,popular,though,she,was,she,preferred,him,above,any,other,man,in,all,the,world
and,when,she,admitted,it,modestly,and,sweetly,she,would,look,a,thousand,things,more
of,course,she,would,do,it,all,in,a,ladylike,way
she,wouldn't,even,dream,of,saying,to,him,boldly,that,she,loved,him,that,would,never,do
but,the,manner,of,telling,him,was,a,detail,that,troubled,her,not,at,all
she,had,managed,such,situations,before,and,she,could,do,it,again
lying,in,the,bed,with,the,moonlight,streaming,dimly,over,her,she,pictured,the,whole,scene,in,her,mind
she,saw,the,look,of,surprise,and,happiness,that,would,come,over,his,face,when,he,realized,that,she,really,loved,him,and,she,heard,the,words,he,would,say,asking,her,to,be,his,wife
naturally,she,would,have,to,say,then,that,she,simply,couldn't,think,of,marrying,a,man,when,he,was,engaged,to,another,girl,but,he,would,insist,and,finally,she,would,let,herself,be,persuaded
then,they,would,decide,to,run,off,to,jonesboro,that,very,afternoon,and
why,by,this,time,tomorrow,night,she,might,be,mrs,ashley,wilkes
she,sat,up,in,bed,hugging,her,knees,and,for,a,long,happy,moment,she,was,mrs,ashley,wilkes,ashley's,bride
then,a,slight,chill,entered,her,heart
suppose,it,didn't,work,out,this,way
suppose,ashley,didn't,beg,her,to,run,away,with,him
resolutely,she,pushed,the,thought,from,her,mind
i,won't,think,of,that,now,she,said,firmly
if,i,think,of,it,now,it,will,upset,me
there's,no,reason,why,things,won't,come,out,the,way,i,want,them,if,he,loves,me
and,i,know,he,does
she,raised,her,chin,and,her,pale,black-fringed,eyes,sparkled,in,the,moonlight
ellen,had,never,told,her,that,desire,and,attainment,were,two,different,matters,life,had,not,taught,her,that,the,race,was,not,to,the,swift
she,lay,in,the,silvery,shadows,with,courage,rising,and,made,the,plans,that,a,sixteen-,year-old,makes,when,life,has,been,so,pleasant,that,defeat,is,an,impossibility,and,a,pretty,dress,and,a,clear,complexion,are,weapons,to,vanquish,fate
chapter,v
it,was,ten,o'clock,in,the,morning
the,day,was,warm,for,april,and,the,golden,sunlight,streamed,brilliantly,into,scarlett's,room,through,the,blue,curtains,of,the,wide,windows
the,cream-colored,walls,glowed,with,light,and,the,depths,of,the,mahogany,furniture,gleamed,deep,red,like,wine,while,the,floor,glistened,as,if,it,were,glass,except,where,the,rag,rugs,covered,it,and,they,were,spots,of,gay,color
already,summer,was,in,the,air,the,first,hint,of,georgia,summer,when,the,high,tide,of,spring,gives,way,reluctantly,before,a,fiercer,heat
a,balmy,soft,warmth,poured,into,the,room,heavy,with,velvety,smells,redolent,of,many,blossoms,of,newly,fledged,trees,and,of,the,moist,freshly,turned,red,earth
through,the,window,scarlett,could,see,the,bright,riot,of,the,twin,lanes,of,daffodils,bordering,the,graveled,driveway,and,the,golden,masses,of,yellow,jessamine,spreading,flowery,sprangles,modestly,to,the,earth,like,crinolines
the,mockingbirds,and,the,jays,engaged,in,their,old,feud,for,possession,of,the,magnolia,tree,beneath,her,window,were,bickering,the,jays,strident,acrimonious,the,mockers,sweet,voiced,and,plaintive
such,a,glowing,morning,usually,called,scarlett,to,the,window,to,lean,arms,on,the,broad,sill,and,drink,in,the,scents,and,sounds,of,tara
but,today,she,had,no,eye,for,sun,or,azure,sky,beyond,a,hasty,thought,thank,god,it,isn't,raining
on,the,bed,lay,the,apple-green,watered-silk,ball,dress,with,its,festoons,of,ecru,lace,neatly,packed,in,a,large,cardboard,box
it,was,ready,to,be,carried,to,twelve,oaks,to,be,donned,before,the,dancing,began,but,scarlett,shrugged,at,the,sight,of,it
if,her,plans,were,successful,she,would,not,wear,that,dress,tonight
long,before,the,ball,began,she,and,ashley,would,be,on,their,way,to,jonesboro,to,be,married
the,troublesome,question,was,what,dress,should,she,wear,to,the,barbecue
what,dress,would,best,set,off,her,charms,and,make,her,most,irresistible,to,ashley
since,eight,o'clock,she,had,been,trying,on,and,rejecting,dresses,and,now,she,stood,dejected,and,irritable,in,lace,pantalets,linen,corset,cover,and,three,billowing,lace,and,linen,petticoats
discarded,garments,lay,about,her,on,the,floor,the,bed,the,chairs,in,bright,heaps,of,color,and,straying,ribbons
the,rose,organdie,with,long,pink,sash,was,becoming,but,she,had,worn,it,last,summer,when,melanie,visited,twelve,oaks,and,she'd,be,sure,to,remember,it
and,might,be,catty,enough,to,mention,it
the,black,bombazine,with,its,puffed,sleeves,and,princess,lace,collar,set,off,her,white,skin,superbly,but,it,did,make,her,look,a,trifle,elderly
scarlett,peered,anxiously,in,the,mirror,at,her,sixteen-year-old,face,as,if,expecting,to,see,wrinkles,and,sagging,chin,muscles
it,would,never,do,to,appear,sedate,and,elderly,before,melanie's,sweet,youthfulness
the,lavender,barred,muslin,was,beautiful,with,those,wide,insets,of,lace,and,net,about,the,hem,but,it,had,never,suited,her,type
it,would,suit,carreen's,delicate,profile,and,wishy-washy,expression,perfectly,but,scarlett,felt,that,it,made,her,look,like,a,schoolgirl
it,would,never,do,to,appear,schoolgirlish,beside,melanie's,poised,self
the,green,plaid,taffeta,frothing,with,flounces,and,each,flounce,edged,in,green,velvet,ribbon,was,most,becoming,in,fact,her,favorite,dress,for,it,darkened,her,eyes,to,emerald
but,there,was,unmistakably,a,grease,spot,on,the,front,of,the,basque
of,course,her,brooch,could,be,pinned,over,the,spot,but,perhaps,melanie,had,sharp,eyes
there,remained,varicolored,cotton,dresses,which,scarlett,felt,were,not,festive,enough,for,the,occasion,ball,dresses,and,the,green,sprigged,muslin,she,had,worn,yesterday
but,it,was,an,afternoon,dress
it,was,not,suitable,for,a,barbecue,for,it,had,only,tiny,puffed,sleeves,and,the,neck,was,low,enough,for,a,dancing,dress
but,there,was,nothing,else,to,do,but,wear,it
after,all,she,was,not,ashamed,of,her,neck,and,arms,and,bosom,even,if,it,was,not,correct,to,show,them,in,the,morning
as,she,stood,before,the,mirror,and,twisted,herself,about,to,get,a,side,view,she,thought,that,there,was,absolutely,nothing,about,her,figure,to,cause,her,shame
her,neck,was,short,but,rounded,and,her,arms,plump,and,enticing
her,breasts,pushed,high,by,her,stays,were,very,nice,breasts
she,had,never,had,to,sew,tiny,rows,of,silk,ruffles,in,the,lining,of,her,basques,as,most,sixteen-year-,old,girls,did,to,give,their,figures,the,desired,curves,and,fullness
she,was,glad,she,had,inherited,ellen's,slender,white,hands,and,tiny,feet,and,she,wished,she,had,ellen's,height,too,but,her,own,height,pleased,her,very,well
what,a,pity,legs,could,not,be,shown,she,thought,pulling,up,her,petticoats,and,regretfully,viewing,them,plump,and,neat,under,pantalets
she,had,such,nice,legs
even,the,girls,at,the,fayetteville,academy,had,admitted,as,much
and,as,for,her,waist,there,was,no,one,in,fayetteville,jonesboro,or,in,three,counties,for,that,matter,who,had,so,small,a,waist
the,thought,of,her,waist,brought,her,back,to,practical,matters
the,green,muslin,measured,seventeen,inches,about,the,waist,and,mammy,had,laced,her,for,the,eighteen-inch,bombazine
mammy,would,have,to,lace,her,tighter
she,pushed,open,the,door,listened,and,heard,mammy's,heavy,tread,in,the,downstairs,hall
she,shouted,for,her,impatiently,knowing,she,could,raise,her,voice,with,impunity,as,ellen,was,in,the,smokehouse,measuring,out,the,day's,food,to,cookie
some,folks,thinks,as,how,ah,kin,fly,grumbled,mammy,shuffling,up,the,stairs
she,entered,puffing,with,the,expression,of,one,who,expects,battle,and,welcomes,it
in,her,large,black,hands,was,a,tray,upon,which,food,smoked,two,large,yams,covered,with,butter,a,pile,of,buckwheat,cakes,dripping,syrup,and,a,large,slice,of,ham,swimming,in,gravy
catching,sight,of,mammy's,burden,scarlett's,expression,changed,from,one,of,minor,irritation,to,obstinate,belligerency
in,the,excitement,of,trying,on,dresses,she,had,forgotten,mammy's,ironclad,rule,that,before,going,to,any,party,the,o'hara,girls,must,be,crammed,so,full,of,food,at,home,they,would,be,unable,to,eat,any,refreshments,at,the,party
it's,no,use
i,won't,eat,it

at,this,defiant,heresy,mammy's,brow,lowered,with,indignation
what,a,young,miss,could,do,and,what,she,could,not,do,were,as,different,as,black,and,white,in,mammy's,mind,there,was,no,middle,ground,of,deportment,between
suellen,and,carreen,were,clay,in,her,powerful,hands,and,harkened,respectfully,to,her,warning
but,it,had,always,been,a,struggle,to,teach,scarlett,that,most,of,her,natural,impulses,were,unladylike

there,must,be,something,in,it,for,ellen,said,the,same,things,in,different,and,more,delicate,words
in,fact,the,mothers,of,all,her,girl,friends,impressed,on,their,daughters,the,necessity,of,being,helpless,clinging,doe-eyed,creatures
really,it,took,a,lot,of,sense,to,cultivate,and,hold,such,a,pose
perhaps,she,had,been,too,brash
occasionally,she,had,argued,with,ashley,and,frankly,aired,her,opinions
perhaps,this,and,her,healthy,enjoyment,of,walking,and,riding,had,turned,him,from,her,to,the,frail,melanie
perhaps,if,she,changed,her,tactics,but,she,felt,that,if,ashley,succumbed,to,premeditated,feminine,tricks,she,could,never,respect,him,as,she,now,did
any,man,who,was,fool,enough,to,fall,for,a,simper,a,faint,and,an,oh,how,wonderful,you,are
wasn't,worth,having
but,they,all,seemed,to,like,it
if,she,had,used,the,wrong,tactics,with,ashley,in,the,past,well,that,was,the,past,and,done,with
today,she,would,use,different,ones,the,right,ones
she,wanted,him,and,she,had,only,a,few,hours,in,which,to,get,him
if,fainting,or,pretending,to,faint,would,do,the,trick,then,she,would,faint
if,simpering,coquetry,or,empty-headedness,would,attract,him,she,would,gladly,play,the,flirt,and,be,more,empty-headed,than,even,cathleen,calvert
and,if,bolder,measures,were,necessary,she,would,take,them
today,was,the,day
there,was,no,one,to,tell,scarlett,that,her,own,personality,frighteningly,vital,though,it,was,was,more,attractive,than,any,masquerade,she,might,adopt
had,she,been,told,she,would,have,been,pleased,but,unbelieving
and,the,civilization,of,which,she,was,a,part,would,have,been,unbelieving,too,for,at,no,time,before,or,since,had,so,low,a,premium,been,placed,on,feminine,naturalness
as,the,carriage,bore,her,down,the,red,road,toward,the,wilkes,plantation,scarlett,had,a,feeling,of,guilty,pleasure,that,neither,her,mother,nor,mammy,was,with,the,party
there,would,be,no,one,at,the,barbecue,who,by,delicately,lifted,brows,or,out-thrust,underlip,could,interfere,with,her,plan,of,action
of,course,suellen,would,be,certain,to,tell,tales,tomorrow,but,if,all,went,as,scarlett,hoped,the,excitement,of,the,family,over,her,engagement,to,ashley,or,her,elopement,would,more,than,overbalance,their,displeasure
yes,she,was,very,glad,ellen,had,been,forced,to,stay,at,home
gerald,primed,with,brandy,had,given,jonas,wilkerson,his,dismissal,that,morning,and,ellen,had,remained,at,tara,to,go,over,the,accounts,of,the,plantation,before,he,took,his,departure
scarlett,had,kissed,her,mother,good-by,in,the,little,office,where,she,sat,before,the,tall,secretary,with,its,paper-stuffed,pigeonholes
jonas,wilkerson,hat,in,hand,stood,beside,her,his,sallow,tight-skinned,face,hardly,concealing,the,fury,of,hate,that,possessed,him,at,being,so,unceremoniously,turned,out,of,the,best,overseer's,job,in,the,county
and,all,because,of,a,bit,of,minor,philandering
he,had,told,gerald,over,and,over,that,emmie,slattery's,baby,might,have,been,fathered,by,any,one,of,a,dozen,men,as,easily,as,himself,an,idea,in,which,gerald,concurred,but,that,had,not,altered,his,case,so,far,as,ellen,was,concerned
jonas,hated,all,southerners
he,hated,their,cool,courtesy,to,him,and,their,contempt,for,his,social,status,so,inadequately,covered,by,their,courtesy
he,hated,ellen,o'hara,above,anyone,else,for,she,was,the,epitome,of,all,that,he,hated,in,southerners
mammy,as,head,woman,of,the,plantation,had,remained,to,help,ellen,and,it,was,dilcey,who,rode,on,the,driver's,seat,beside,toby,the,girls',dancing,dresses,in,a,long,box,across,her,lap
gerald,rode,beside,the,carriage,on,his,big,hunter,warm,with,brandy,and,pleased,with,himself,for,having,gotten,through,with,the,unpleasant,business,of,wilkerson,so,speedily
he,had,shoved,the,responsibility,onto,ellen,and,her,disappointment,at,missing,the,barbecue,and,the,gathering,of,her,friends,did,not,enter,his,mind,for,it,was,a,fine,spring,day,and,his,fields,were,beautiful,and,the,birds,were,singing,and,he,felt,too,young,and,frolicsome,to,think,of,anyone,else
occasionally,he,burst,out,with,peg,in,a,low-,backed,car,and,other,irish,ditties,or,the,more,lugubrious,lament,for,robert,emmet,she,is,far,from,the,land,where,her,young,hero,sleeps
he,was,happy,pleasantly,excited,over,the,prospect,of,spending,the,day,shouting,about,the,yankees,and,the,war,and,proud,of,his,three,pretty,daughters,in,their,bright,spreading,hoop,skirts,beneath,foolish,little,lace,parasols
he,gave,no,thought,to,his,conversation,of,the,day,before,with,scarlett,for,it,had,completely,slipped,his,mind
he,only,thought,that,she,was,pretty,and,a,great,credit,to,him,and,that,today,her,eyes,were,as,green,as,the,hills,of,ireland
the,last,thought,made,him,think,better,of,himself,for,it,had,a,certain,poetic,ring,to,it,and,so,he,favored,the,girls,with,a,loud,and,slightly,off-key,rendition,of,the,wearin',o',the,green
scarlett,looking,at,him,with,the,affectionate,contempt,that,mothers,feel,for,small,swaggering,sons,knew,that,he,would,be,very,drunk,by,sundown
coming,home,in,the,dark,he,would,try,as,usual,to,jump,every,fence,between,twelve,oaks,and,tara,and,she,hoped,by,the,mercy,of,providence,and,the,good,sense,of,his,horse,would,escape,breaking,his,neck
he,would,disdain,the,bridge,and,swim,his,horse,through,the,river,and,come,home,roaring,to,be,put,to,bed,on,the,sofa,in,the,office,by,pork,who,always,waited,up,with,a,lamp,in,the,front,hall,on,such,occasions
he,would,ruin,his,new,gray,broadcloth,suit,which,would,cause,him,to,swear,horribly,in,the,morning,and,tell,ellen,at,great,length,how,his,horse,fell,off,the,bridge,in,the,darkness,a,palpable,lie,which,would,fool,no,one,but,which,would,be,accepted,by,all,and,make,him,feel,very,clever
pa,is,a,sweet,selfish,irresponsible,darling,scarlett,thought,with,a,surge,of,affection,for,him
she,felt,so,excited,and,happy,this,morning,that,she,included,the,whole,world,as,well,as,gerald,in,her,affection
she,was,pretty,and,she,knew,it,she,would,have,ashley,for,her,own,before,the,day,was,over,the,sun,was,warm,and,tender,and,the,glory,of,the,georgia,spring,was,spread,before,her,eyes
along,the,roadside,the,blackberry,brambles,were,concealing,with,softest,green,the,savage,red,gulches,cut,by,the,winter's,rains,and,the,bare,granite,boulders,pushing,up,through,the,red,earth,were,being,draped,with,sprangles,of,cherokee,roses,and,compassed,about,by,wild,violets,of,palest,purple,hue
upon,the,wooded,hills,above,the,river,the,dogwood,blossoms,lay,glistening,and,white,as,if,snow,still,lingered,among,the,greenery
the,flowering,crab,trees,were,bursting,their,buds,and,rioting,from,delicate,white,to,deepest,pink,and,beneath,the,trees,where,the,sunshine,dappled,the,pine,straw,the,wild,honeysuckle,made,a,varicolored,carpet,of,scarlet,and,orange,and,rose
there,was,a,faint,wild,fragrance,of,sweet,shrub,on,the,breeze,and,the,world,smelled,good,enough,to,eat
i'll,remember,how,beautiful,this,day,is,till,i,die,thought,scarlett
perhaps,it,will,be,my,wedding,day
and,she,thought,with,a,tingling,in,her,heart,how,she,and,ashley,might,ride,swiftly,through,this,beauty,of,blossom,and,greenery,this,very,afternoon,or,tonight,by,moonlight,toward,jonesboro,and,a,preacher
of,course,she,would,have,to,be,remarried,by,a,priest,from,atlanta,but,that,would,be,something,for,ellen,and,gerald,to,worry,about
she,quailed,a,little,as,she,thought,how,white,with,mortification,ellen,would,be,at,hearing,that,her,daughter,had,eloped,with,another,girl's,fiance,but,she,knew,ellen,would,forgive,her,when,she,saw,her,happiness
and,gerald,would,scold,and,bawl,but,for,all,his,remarks,of,yesterday,about,not,wanting,her,to,marry,ashley,he,would,be,pleased,beyond,words,at,an,alliance,between,his,family,and,the,wilkes
but,that'll,be,something,to,worry,about,after,i'm,married,she,thought,tossing,the,worry,from,her
it,was,impossible,to,feel,anything,but,palpitating,joy,in,this,warm,sun,in,this,spring,with,the,chimneys,of,twelve,oaks,just,beginning,to,show,on,the,hill,across,the,river
i'll,live,there,all,my,life,and,i'll,see,fifty,springs,like,this,and,maybe,more,and,i'll,tell,my,children,and,my,grandchildren,how,beautiful,this,spring,was,lovelier,than,any,they'll,ever,see
she,was,so,happy,at,this,thought,that,she,joined,in,the,last,chorus,of,the,wearin',o',the,green,and,won,gerald's,shouted,approval
i,don't,know,why,you're,so,happy,this,morning,said,suellen,crossly,for,the,thought,still,rankled,in,her,mind,that,she,would,look,far,better,in,scarlett's,green,silk,dancing,frock,than,its,rightful,owner,would
and,why,was,scarlett,always,so,selfish,about,lending,her,clothes,and,bonnets
and,why,did,mother,always,back,her,up,declaring,green,was,not,suellen's,color
you,know,as,well,as,i,do,that,ashley's,engagement,is,going,to,be,announced,tonight
pa,said,so,this,morning
and,i,know,you've,been,sweet,on,him,for,months
that's,all,you,know,said,scarlett,putting,out,her,tongue,and,refusing,to,lose,her,good,humor
how,surprised,miss,sue,would,be,by,this,time,tomorrow,morning
susie,you,know,that's,not,so,protested,carreen,shocked
it's,brent,that,scarlett,cares,about
scarlett,turned,smiling,green,eyes,upon,her,younger,sister,wondering,how,anyone,could,be,so,sweet
the,whole,family,knew,that,carreen's,thirteen-year-old,heart,was,set,upon,brent,tarleton,who,never,gave,her,a,thought,except,as,scarlett's,baby,sister
when,ellen,was,not,present,the,o'haras,teased,her,to,tears,about,him
darling,i,don't,care,a,thing,about,brent,declared,scarlett,happy,enough,to,be,generous
and,he,doesn't,care,a,thing,about,me
why,he's,waiting,for,you,to,grow,up
carreen's,round,little,face,became,pink,as,pleasure,struggled,with,incredulity
oh,scarlett,really
scarlett,you,know,mother,said,carreen,was,too,young,to,think,about,beaux,yet,and,there,you,go,putting,ideas,in,her,head
well,go,and,tattle,and,see,if,i,care,replied,scarlett
you,want,to,hold,sissy,back,because,you,know,she's,going,to,be,prettier,than,you,in,a,year,or,so

now,whist
is,it,wheels,i'm,hearing
that'll,be,the,tarletons,or,the,fontaines
as,they,neared,the,intersecting,road,that,came,down,the,thickly,wooded,hill,from,mimosa,and,fairhill,the,sound,of,hooves,and,carriage,wheels,became,plainer,and,clamorous,feminine,voices,raised,in,pleasant,dispute,sounded,from,behind,the,screen,of,trees
gerald,riding,ahead,pulled,up,his,horse,and,signed,to,toby,to,stop,the,carriage,where,the,two,roads,met
'tis,the,tarleton,ladies,he,announced,to,his,daughters,his,florid,face,abeam,for,excepting,ellen,there,was,no,lady,in,the,county,he,liked,more,than,the,red-haired,mrs,tarleton
and,'tis,herself,at,the,reins
ah,there's,a,woman,with,fine,hands,for,a,horse
feather,light,and,strong,as,rawhide,and,pretty,enough,to,kiss,for,all,that
more's,the,pity,none,of,you,have,such,hands,he,added,casting,fond,but,reproving,glances,at,his,girls
with,carreen,afraid,of,the,poor,beasts,and,sue,with,hands,like,sadirons,when,it,comes,to,reins,and,you,puss
well,at,any,rate,i've,never,been,thrown,cried,scarlett,indignantly
and,mrs,tarleton,takes,a,toss,at,every,hunt
and,breaks,a,collar,bone,like,a,man,said,gerald
no,fainting,no,fussing
now,no,more,of,it,for,here,she,comes
he,stood,up,in,his,stirrups,and,took,off,his,hat,with,a,sweep,as,the,tarleton,carriage,overflowing,with,girls,in,bright,dresses,and,parasols,and,fluttering,veils,came,into,view,with,mrs,tarleton,on,the,box,as,gerald,had,said
with,her,four,daughters,their,mammy,and,their,ball,dresses,in,long,cardboard,boxes,crowding,the,carriage,there,was,no,room,for,the,coachman
and,besides,beatrice,tarleton,never,willingly,permitted,anyone,black,or,white,to,hold,reins,when,her,arms,were,out,of,slings
frail,fine-boned,so,white,of,skin,that,her,flaming,hair,seemed,to,have,drawn,all,the,color,from,her,face,into,its,vital,burnished,mass,she,was,nevertheless,possessed,of,exuberant,health,and,untiring,energy
she,had,borne,eight,children,as,red,of,hair,and,as,full,of,life,as,she,and,had,raised,them,most,successfully,so,the,county,said,because,she,gave,them,all,the,loving,neglect,and,the,stern,discipline,she,gave,the,colts,she,bred
curb,them,but,don't,break,their,spirits,was,mrs,tarleton's,motto
she,loved,horses,and,talked,horses,constantly
she,understood,them,and,handled,them,better,than,any,man,in,the,county
colts,overflowed,the,paddock,onto,the,front,lawn,even,as,her,eight,children,overflowed,the,rambling,house,on,the,hill,and,colts,and,sons,and,daughters,and,hunting,dogs,tagged,after,her,as,she,went,about,the,plantation
she,credited,her,horses,especially,her,red,mare,nellie,with,human,intelligence,and,if,the,cares,of,the,house,kept,her,busy,beyond,the,time,when,she,expected,to,take,her,daily,ride,she,put,the,sugar,bowl,in,the,hands,of,some,small,pickaninny,and,said,give,nellie,a,handful,and,tell,her,i'll,be,out,terrectly
except,on,rare,occasions,she,always,wore,her,riding,habit,for,whether,she,rode,or,not,she,always,expected,to,ride,and,in,that,expectation,put,on,her,habit,upon,arising
each,morning,rain,or,shine,nellie,was,saddled,and,walked,up,and,down,in,front,of,the,house,waiting,for,the,time,when,mrs,tarleton,could,spare,an,hour,away,from,her,duties
but,fairhill,was,a,difficult,plantation,to,manage,and,spare,time,hard,to,get,and,more,often,than,not,nellie,walked,up,and,down,riderless,hour,after,hour,while,beatrice,tarleton,went,through,the,day,with,the,skirt,of,her,habit,absently,looped,over,her,arm,and,six,inches,of,shining,boot,showing,below,it
today,dressed,in,dull,black,silk,over,unfashionably,narrow,hoops,she,still,looked,as,though,in,her,habit,for,the,dress,was,as,severely,tailored,as,her,riding,costume,and,the,small,black,hat,with,its,long,black,plume,perched,over,one,warm,twinkling,brown,eye,was,a,replica,of,the,battered,old,hat,she,used,for,hunting
she,waved,her,whip,when,she,saw,gerald,and,drew,her,dancing,pair,of,red,horses,to,a,halt,and,the,four,girls,in,the,back,of,the,carriage,leaned,out,and,gave,such,vociferous,cries,of,greeting,that,the,team,pranced,in,alarm
to,a,casual,observer,it,would,seem,that,years,had,passed,since,the,tarletons,had,seen,the,o'haras,instead,of,only,two,days
but,they,were,a,sociable,family,and,liked,their,neighbors,especially,the,o'hara,girls
that,is,they,liked,suellen,and,carreen
no,girl,in,the,county,with,the,possible,exception,of,the,empty-headed,cathleen,calvert,really,liked,scarlett
in,summers,the,county,averaged,a,barbecue,and,ball,nearly,every,week,but,to,the,red-haired,tarletons,with,their,enormous,capacity,for,enjoying,themselves,each,barbecue,and,each,ball,was,as,exciting,as,if,it,were,the,first,they,had,ever,attended
they,were,a,pretty,buxom,quartette,so,crammed,into,the,carriage,that,their,hoops,and,flounces,overlapped,and,their,parasols,nudged,and,bumped,together,above,their,wide,leghorn,sun,hats,crowned,with,roses,and,dangling,with,black,velvet,chin,ribbons
all,shades,of,red,hair,were,represented,beneath,these,hats,hetty's,plain,red,hair,camilla's,strawberry,blonde,randa's,coppery,auburn,and,small,betsy's,carrot,top
that's,a,fine,bevy,ma'm,said,gerald,gallantly,reining,his,horse,alongside,the,carriage
but,it's,far,they'll,go,to,beat,their,mother
mrs,tarleton,rolled,her,red-brown,eyes,and,sucked,in,her,lower,lip,in,burlesqued,appreciation,and,the,girls,cried,ma,stop,making,eyes,or,we'll,tell,pa
i,vow,mr,o'hara,she,never,gives,us,a,chance,when,there's,a,handsome,man,like,you,around
scarlett,laughed,with,the,rest,at,these,sallies,but,as,always,the,freedom,with,which,the,tarletons,treated,their,mother,came,as,a,shock
they,acted,as,if,she,were,one,of,themselves,and,not,a,day,over,sixteen
to,scarlett,the,very,idea,of,saying,such,things,to,her,own,mother,was,almost,sacrilegious
and,yet,and,yet,there,was,something,very,pleasant,about,the,tarleton,girls',relations,with,their,mother,and,they,adored,her,for,all,that,they,criticized,and,scolded,and,teased,her
not,scarlett,loyally,hastened,to,tell,herself,that,she,would,prefer,a,mother,like,mrs,tarleton,to,ellen,but,still,it,would,be,fun,to,romp,with,a,mother
she,knew,that,even,that,thought,was,disrespectful,to,ellen,and,felt,ashamed,of,it
she,knew,no,such,troublesome,thoughts,ever,disturbed,the,brains,under,the,four,flaming,thatches,in,the,carriage,and,as,always,when,she,felt,herself,different,from,her,neighbors,an,irritated,confusion,fell,upon,her
quick,though,her,brain,was,it,was,not,made,for,analysis,but,she,half-consciously,realized,that,for,all,the,tarleton,girls,were,as,unruly,as,colts,and,wild,as,march,hares,there,was,an,unworried,single-mindedness,about,them,that,was,part,of,their,inheritance
on,both,their,mother's,and,their,father's,side,they,were,georgians,north,georgians,only,a,generation,away,from,pioneers
they,were,sure,of,themselves,and,of,their,environment
they,knew,instinctively,what,they,were,about,as,did,the,wilkeses,though,in,widely,divergent,ways,and,in,them,there,was,no,such,conflict,as,frequently,raged,in,scarlett's,bosom,where,the,blood,of,a,soft-,voiced,overbred,coast,aristocrat,mingled,with,the,shrewd,earthy,blood,of,an,irish,peasant
scarlett,wanted,to,respect,and,adore,her,mother,like,an,idol,and,to,rumple,her,hair,and,tease,her,too
and,she,knew,she,should,be,altogether,one,way,or,the,other
it,was,the,same,conflicting,emotion,that,made,her,desire,to,appear,a,delicate,and,high-bred,lady,with,boys,and,to,be,as,well,a,hoyden,who,was,not,above,a,few,kisses
where's,ellen,this,morning
asked,mrs,tarleton
she's,after,discharging,our,overseer,and,stayed,home,to,go,over,the,accounts,with,him
where's,himself,and,the,lads
oh,they,rode,over,to,twelve,oaks,hours,ago,to,sample,the,punch,and,see,if,it,was,strong,enough,i,dare,say,as,if,they,wouldn't,have,from,now,till,tomorrow,morning,to,do,it
i'm,going,to,ask,john,wilkes,to,keep,them,overnight,even,if,he,has,to,bed,them,down,in,the,stable
five,men,in,their,cups,are,just,too,much,for,me
up,to,three,i,do,very,well,but
gerald,hastily,interrupted,to,change,the,subject
he,could,feel,his,own,daughters,snickering,behind,his,back,as,they,remembered,in,what,condition,he,had,come,home,from,the,wilkeses',last,barbecue,the,autumn,before
and,why,aren't,you,riding,today,mrs,tarleton

cried,gerald,with,real,interest,his,irishman's,passion,for,horses,shining,in,his,eyes,and,scarlett,again,felt,the,sense,of,shock,in,comparing,her,mother,with,mrs,tarleton
to,ellen,mares,never,foaled,nor,cows,calved
in,fact,hens,almost,didn't,lay,eggs
ellen,ignored,these,matters,completely
but,mrs,tarleton,had,no,such,reticences
a,little,filly,was,it
no,a,fine,little,stallion,with,legs,two,yards,long
you,must,ride,over,and,see,him,mr,o'hara

my,fillies,are,feeling,their,oats,this,morning,said,mrs,tarleton

our,cook,is,the,broad,wife,of,the,wilkes,butler,and,he,was,over,last,night,with,the,news,that,the,engagement,would,be,announced,tonight,and,cookie,told,us,this,morning
the,girls,are,all,excited,about,it,though,i,can't,see,why
everybody's,known,for,years,that,ashley,would,marry,her,that,is,if,he,didn't,marry,one,of,his,burr,cousins,from,macon
just,like,honey,wilkes,is,going,to,marry,melanie's,brother,charles
now,tell,me,mr,o'hara,is,it,illegal,for,the,wilkes,to,marry,outside,of,their,family
because,if
scarlett,did,not,hear,the,rest,of,the,laughing,words
for,one,short,instant,it,was,as,though,the,sun,had,ducked,behind,a,cool,cloud,leaving,the,world,in,shadow,taking,the,color,out,of,things
the,freshly,green,foliage,looked,sickly,the,dogwood,pallid,and,the,flowering,crab,so,beautifully,pink,a,moment,ago,faded,and,dreary
scarlett,dug,her,fingers,into,the,upholstery,of,the,carriage,and,for,a,moment,her,parasol,wavered
it,was,one,thing,to,know,that,ashley,was,engaged,but,it,was,another,to,hear,people,talk,about,it,so,casually
then,her,courage,flowed,strongly,back,and,the,sun,came,out,again,and,the,landscape,glowed,anew
she,knew,ashley,loved,her
that,was,certain
and,she,smiled,as,she,thought,how,surprised,mrs,tarleton,would,be,when,no,engagement,was,announced,that,night,how,surprised,if,there,were,an,elopement
and,she'd,tell,neighbors,what,a,sly,boots,scarlett,was,to,sit,there,and,listen,to,her,talk,about,melanie,when,all,the,time,she,and,ashley,she,dimpled,at,her,own,thoughts,and,betty,who,had,been,watching,sharply,the,effect,of,her,mother's,words,sank,back,with,a,small,puzzled,frown
i,don't,care,what,you,say,mr,o'hara,mrs,tarleton,was,saying,emphatically
it's,all,wrong,this,marrying,of,cousins
it's,bad,enough,for,ashley,to,be,marrying,the,hamilton,child,but,for,honey,to,be,marrying,that,pale-looking,charles,hamilton
honey'll,never,catch,anybody,else,if,she,doesn't,marry,charlie,said,randa,cruel,and,secure,in,her,own,popularity
she's,never,had,another,beau,except,him
and,he's,never,acted,very,sweet,on,her,for,all,that,they're,engaged
scarlett,you,remember,how,he,ran,after,you,last,christmas
don't,be,a,cat,miss,said,her,mother
cousins,shouldn't,marry,even,second,cousins
it,weakens,the,strain
it,isn't,like,horses
you,can,breed,a,mare,to,a,brother,or,a,sire,to,a,daughter,and,get,good,results,if,you,know,your,blood,strains,but,in,people,it,just,doesn't,work
you,get,good,lines,perhaps,but,no,stamina
you
now,ma'm,i'm,taking,issue,with,you,on,that
can,you,name,me,better,people,than,the,wilkes
and,they've,been,intermarrying,since,brian,boru,was,a,boy
and,high,time,they,stopped,it,for,it's,beginning,to,show
oh,not,ashley,so,much,for,he's,a,good-looking,devil,though,even,he,but,look,at,those,two,washed-out-looking,wilkes,girls,poor,things
nice,girls,of,course,but,washed,out
and,look,at,little,miss,melanie
thin,as,a,rail,and,delicate,enough,for,the,wind,to,blow,away,and,no,spirit,at,all
not,a,notion,of,her,own
'no,ma'm,'
'yes,ma'm,'
that's,all,she,has,to,say
you,see,what,i,mean
that,family,needs,new,blood,fine,vigorous,blood,like,my,red,heads,or,your,scarlett
now,don't,misunderstand,me
the,wilkes,are,fine,folks,in,their,way,and,you,know,i'm,fond,of,them,all,but,be,frank
they,are,overbred,and,inbred,too,aren't,they
they'll,do,fine,on,a,dry,track,a,fast,track,but,mark,my,words,i,don't,believe,the,wilkes,can,run,on,a,mud,track
i,believe,the,stamina,has,been,bred,out,of,them,and,when,the,emergency,arises,i,don't,believe,they,can,run,against,odds
dry-weather,stock
give,me,a,big,horse,who,can,run,in,any,weather
and,their,intermarrying,has,made,them,different,from,other,folks,around,here
always,fiddling,with,the,piano,or,sticking,their,heads,in,a,book
i,do,believe,ashley,would,rather,read,than,hunt
yes,i,honestly,believe,that,mr,o'hara
and,just,look,at,the,bones,on,them
too,slender
they,need,dams,and,sires,with,strength
ah-ah-hum,said,gerald,suddenly,and,guiltily,aware,that,the,conversation,a,most,interesting,and,entirely,proper,one,to,him,would,seem,quite,otherwise,to,ellen
in,fact,he,knew,she,would,never,recover,should,she,learn,that,her,daughters,had,been,exposed,to,so,frank,a,conversation
but,mrs,tarleton,was,as,usual,deaf,to,all,other,ideas,when,pursuing,her,favorite,topic,breeding,whether,it,be,horses,or,humans
i,know,what,i'm,talking,about,because,i,had,some,cousins,who,married,each,other,and,i,give,you,my,word,their,children,all,turned,out,as,popeyed,as,bullfrogs,poor,things
and,when,my,family,wanted,me,to,marry,a,second,cousin,i,bucked,like,a,colt
i,said,'no,ma
not,for,me
my,children,will,all,have,spavins,and,heaves,'
well,ma,fainted,when,i,said,that,about,spavins,but,i,stood,firm,and,grandma,backed,me,up
she,knew,a,lot,about,horse,breeding,too,you,see,and,said,i,was,right
and,she,helped,me,run,away,with,mr,tarleton
and,look,at,my,children
big,and,healthy,and,not,a,sickly,one,or,a,runt,among,them,though,boyd,is,only,five,feet,ten
now,the,wilkes
not,meaning,to,change,the,subject,ma'm,broke,in,gerald,hurriedly,for,he,had,noticed,carreen's,bewildered,look,and,the,avid,curiosity,on,suellen's,face,and,feared,lest,they,might,ask,ellen,embarrassing,questions,which,would,reveal,how,inadequate,a,chaperon,he,was
puss,he,was,glad,to,notice,appeared,to,be,thinking,of,other,matters,as,a,lady,should
betty,tarleton,rescued,him,from,his,predicament
good,heavens,ma,do,let's,get,on
she,cried,impatiently
this,sun,is,broiling,me,and,i,can,just,hear,freckles,popping,out,on,my,neck
just,a,minute,ma'm,before,you,go,said,gerald
but,what,have,you,decided,to,do,about,selling,us,the,horses,for,the,troop
war,may,break,any,day,now,and,the,boys,want,the,matter,settled
it's,a,clayton,county,troop,and,it's,clayton,county,horses,we,want,for,them
but,you,obstinate,creature,that,you,are,are,still,refusing,to,sell,us,your,fine,beasts
maybe,there,won't,be,any,war,mrs,tarleton,temporized,her,mind,diverted,completely,from,the,wilkeses',odd,marriage,habits
why,ma'm,you,can't
ma,betty,interrupted,again,can't,you,and,mr,o'hara,talk,about,the,horses,at,twelve,oaks,as,well,as,here
that's,just,it,miss,betty,said,gerald
and,i,won't,be,keeping,you,but,one,minute,by,the,clock
we'll,be,getting,to,twelve,oaks,in,a,little,bit,and,every,man,there,old,and,young,wanting,to,know,about,the,horses
ah,but,it's,breaking,me,heart,to,see,such,a,fine,pretty,lady,as,your,mother,so,stingy,with,her,beasts
now,where's,your,patriotism,mrs,tarleton
does,the,confederacy,mean,nothing,to,you,at,all
ma,cried,small,betsy,randa's,sitting,on,my,dress,and,i'm,getting,all,wrinkled
well,push,randa,off,you,betsy,and,hush
now,listen,to,me,gerald,o'hara,she,retorted,her,eyes,beginning,to,snap
don't,you,go,throwing,the,confederacy,in,my,face
i,reckon,the,confederacy,means,as,much,to,me,as,it,does,to,you,me,with,four,boys,in,the,troop,and,you,with,none
but,my,boys,can,take,care,of,themselves,and,my,horses,can't
i'd,gladly,give,the,horses,free,of,charge,if,i,knew,they,were,going,to,be,ridden,by,boys,i,know,gentlemen,used,to,thoroughbreds
no,i,wouldn't,hesitate,a,minute
but,let,my,beauties,be,at,the,mercy,of,back-woodsmen,and,crackers,who,are,used,to,riding,mules
no,sir
i'd,have,nightmares,thinking,they,were,being,ridden,with,saddle,galls,and,not,groomed,properly
do,you,think,i'd,let,ignorant,fools,ride,my,tender-mouthed,darlings,and,saw,their,mouths,to,pieces,and,beat,them,till,their,spirits,were,broken
why,i've,got,goose,flesh,this,minute,just,thinking,about,it
no,mr,o'hara,you're,mighty,nice,to,want,my,horses,but,you'd,better,go,to,atlanta,and,buy,some,old,plugs,for,your,clodhoppers
they'll,never,know,the,difference
ma,can't,we,please,go,on
asked,camilla,joining,the,impatient,chorus
you,know,mighty,well,you're,going,to,end,up,giving,them,your,darlings,anyhow
when,pa,and,the,boys,get,through,talking,about,the,confederacy,needing,them,and,so,on,you'll,cry,and,let,them,go
mrs,tarleton,grinned,and,shook,the,lines
i'll,do,no,such,thing,she,said,touching,the,horses,lightly,with,the,whip
the,carriage,went,off,swiftly
that's,a,fine,woman,said,gerald,putting,on,his,hat,and,taking,his,place,beside,his,own,carriage
drive,on,toby
we'll,wear,her,down,and,get,the,horses,yet
of,course,she's,right
she's,right
if,a,man's,not,a,gentleman,he's,no,business,on,a,horse
the,infantry,is,the,place,for,him
but,more's,the,pity,there's,not,enough,planters',sons,in,this,county,to,make,up,a,full,troop
what,did,you,say,puss
pa,please,ride,behind,us,or,in,front,of,us
you,kick,up,such,a,heap,of,dust,that,we're,choking,said,scarlett,who,felt,that,she,could,endure,conversation,no,longer
it,distracted,her,from,her,thoughts,and,she,was,very,anxious,to,arrange,both,her,thoughts,and,her,face,in,attractive,lines,before,reaching,twelve,oaks
gerald,obediently,put,spurs,to,his,horse,and,was,off,in,a,red,cloud,after,the,tarleton,carriage,where,he,could,continue,his,horsy,conversation
chapter,vi
they,crossed,the,river,and,the,carriage,mounted,the,hill
even,before,twelve,oaks,came,into,view,scarlett,saw,a,haze,of,smoke,hanging,lazily,in,the,tops,of,the,tall,trees,and,smelled,the,mingled,savory,odors,of,burning,hickory,logs,and,roasting,pork,and,mutton
the,barbecue,pits,which,had,been,slowly,burning,since,last,night,would,now,be,long,troughs,of,rose-red,embers,with,the,meats,turning,on,spits,above,them,and,the,juices,trickling,down,and,hissing,into,the,coals
scarlett,knew,that,the,fragrance,carried,on,the,faint,breeze,came,from,the,grove,of,great,oaks,in,the,rear,of,the,big,house
john,wilkes,always,held,his,barbecues,there,on,the,gentle,slope,leading,down,to,the,rose,garden,a,pleasant,shady,place,and,a,far,pleasanter,place,for,instance,than,that,used,by,the,calverts
mrs,calvert,did,not,like,barbecue,food,and,declared,that,the,smells,remained,in,the,house,for,days,so,her,guests,always,sweltered,on,a,flat,unshaded,spot,a,quarter,of,a,mile,from,the,house
but,john,wilkes,famed,throughout,the,state,for,his,hospitality,really,knew,how,to,give,a,barbecue
the,long,trestled,picnic,tables,covered,with,the,finest,of,the,wilkeses',linen,always,stood,under,the,thickest,shade,with,backless,benches,on,either,side,and,chairs,hassocks,and,cushions,from,the,house,were,scattered,about,the,glade,for,those,who,did,not,fancy,the,benches
at,a,distance,great,enough,to,keep,the,smoke,away,from,the,guests,were,the,long,pits,where,the,meats,cooked,and,the,huge,iron,wash-pots,from,which,the,succulent,odors,of,barbecue,sauce,and,brunswick,stew,floated
mr,wilkes,always,had,at,least,a,dozen,darkies,busy,running,back,and,forth,with,trays,to,serve,the,guests
over,behind,the,barns,there,was,always,another,barbecue,pit,where,the,house,servants,and,the,coachmen,and,maids,of,the,guests,had,their,own,feast,of,hoecakes,and,yams,and,chitterlings,that,dish,of,hog,entrails,so,dear,to,negro,hearts,and,in,season,watermelons,enough,to,satiate
as,the,smell,of,crisp,fresh,pork,came,to,her,scarlett,wrinkled,her,nose,appreciatively,hoping,that,by,the,time,it,was,cooked,she,would,feel,some,appetite
as,it,was,she,was,so,full,of,food,and,so,tightly,laced,that,she,feared,every,moment,she,was,going,to,belch
that,would,be,fatal,as,only,old,men,and,very,old,ladies,could,belch,without,fear,of,social,disapproval
they,topped,the,rise,and,the,white,house,reared,its,perfect,symmetry,before,her,tall,of,columns,wide,of,verandas,flat,of,roof,beautiful,as,a,woman,is,beautiful,who,is,so,sure,of,her,charm,that,she,can,be,generous,and,gracious,to,all
scarlett,loved,twelve,oaks,even,more,than,tara,for,it,had,a,stately,beauty,a,mellowed,dignity,that,gerald's,house,did,not,possess
the,wide,curving,driveway,was,full,of,saddle,horses,and,carriages,and,guests,alighting,and,calling,greetings,to,friends
grinning,negroes,excited,as,always,at,a,party,were,leading,the,animals,to,the,barnyard,to,be,unharnessed,and,unsaddled,for,the,day
swarms,of,children,black,and,white,ran,yelling,about,the,newly,green,lawn,playing,hopscotch,and,tag,and,boasting,how,much,they,were,going,to,eat
the,wide,hall,which,ran,from,front,to,back,of,the,house,was,swarming,with,people,and,as,the,o'hara,carriage,drew,up,at,the,front,steps,scarlett,saw,girls,in,crinolines,bright,as,butterflies,going,up,and,coming,down,the,stairs,from,the,second,floor,arms,about,each,other's,waists,stopping,to,lean,over,the,delicate,handrail,of,the,banisters,laughing,and,calling,to,young,men,in,the,hall,below,them
through,the,open,french,windows,she,caught,glimpses,of,the,older,women,seated,in,the,drawing,room,sedate,in,dark,silks,as,they,sat,fanning,themselves,and,talking,of,babies,and,sicknesses,and,who,had,married,whom,and,why
the,wilkes,butler,tom,was,hurrying,through,the,halls,a,silver,tray,in,his,hands,bowing,and,grinning,as,he,offered,tall,glasses,to,young,men,in,fawn,and,gray,trousers,and,fine,ruffled,linen,shirts
the,sunny,front,veranda,was,thronged,with,guests
yes,the,whole,county,was,here,thought,scarlett
the,four,tarleton,boys,and,their,father,leaned,against,the,tall,columns,the,twins,stuart,and,brent,side,by,side,inseparable,as,usual,boyd,and,tom,with,their,father,james,tarleton
mr,calvert,was,standing,close,by,the,side,of,his,yankee,wife,who,even,after,fifteen,years,in,georgia,never,seemed,to,quite,belong,anywhere
everyone,was,very,polite,and,kind,to,her,because,he,felt,sorry,for,her,but,no,one,could,forget,that,she,had,compounded,her,initial,error,of,birth,by,being,the,governess,of,mr,calvert's,children
the,two,calvert,boys,raiford,and,cade,were,there,with,their,dashing,blonde,sister,cathleen,teasing,the,dark-faced,joe,fontaine,and,sally,munroe,his,pretty,bride-to-be
alex,and,tony,fontaine,were,whispering,in,the,ears,of,dimity,munroe,and,sending,her,into,gales,of,giggles
there,were,families,from,as,far,as,lovejoy,ten,miles,away,and,from,fayetteville,and,jonesboro,a,few,even,from,atlanta,and,macon
the,house,seemed,bursting,with,the,crowd,and,a,ceaseless,babble,of,talking,and,laughter,and,giggles,and,shrill,feminine,squeaks,and,screams,rose,and,fell
on,the,porch,steps,stood,john,wilkes,silver-haired,erect,radiating,the,quiet,charm,and,hospitality,that,was,as,warm,and,never,failing,as,the,sun,of,georgia,summer
beside,him,honey,wilkes,so,called,because,she,indiscriminately,addressed,everyone,from,her,father,to,the,field,hands,by,that,endearment,fidgeted,and,giggled,as,she,called,greetings,to,the,arriving,guests
honey's,nervously,obvious,desire,to,be,attractive,to,every,man,in,sight,contrasted,sharply,with,her,father's,poise,and,scarlett,had,the,thought,that,perhaps,there,was,something,in,what,mrs,tarleton,said,after,all
certainly,the,wilkes,men,got,the,family,looks
the,thick,deep-gold,lashes,that,set,off,the,gray,eyes,of,john,wilkes,and,ashley,were,sparse,and,colorless,in,the,faces,of,honey,and,her,sister,india
honey,had,the,odd,lashless,look,of,a,rabbit,and,india,could,be,described,by,no,other,word,than,plain
india,was,nowhere,to,be,seen,but,scarlett,knew,she,probably,was,in,the,kitchen,giving,final,instructions,to,the,servants
poor,india,thought,scarlett,she's,had,so,much,trouble,keeping,house,since,her,mother,died,that,she's,never,had,the,chance,to,catch,any,beau,except,stuart,tarleton,and,it,certainly,wasn't,my,fault,if,he,thought,i,was,prettier,than,she
john,wilkes,came,down,the,steps,to,offer,his,arm,to,scarlett
as,she,descended,from,the,carriage,she,saw,suellen,smirk,and,knew,that,she,must,have,picked,out,frank,kennedy,in,the,crowd
if,i,couldn't,catch,a,better,beau,than,that,old,maid,in,britches
she,thought,contemptuously,as,she,stepped,to,the,ground,and,smiled,her,thanks,to,john,wilkes
frank,kennedy,was,hurrying,to,the,carriage,to,assist,suellen,and,suellen,was,bridling,in,a,way,that,made,scarlett,want,to,slap,her
frank,kennedy,might,own,more,land,than,anyone,in,the,county,and,he,might,have,a,very,kind,heart,but,these,things,counted,for,nothing,against,the,fact,that,he,was,forty,slight,and,nervous,and,had,a,thin,ginger-colored,beard,and,an,old-maidish,fussy,way,about,him
however,remembering,her,plan,scarlett,smothered,her,contempt,and,cast,such,a,flashing,smile,of,greeting,at,him,that,he,stopped,short,his,arm,outheld,to,suellen,and,goggled,at,scarlett,in,pleased,bewilderment
scarlett's,eyes,searched,the,crowd,for,ashley,even,while,she,made,pleasant,small,talk,with,john,wilkes,but,he,was,not,on,the,porch
there,were,cries,of,greeting,from,a,dozen,voices,and,stuart,and,brent,tarleton,moved,toward,her
the,munroe,girls,rushed,up,to,exclaim,over,her,dress,and,she,was,speedily,the,center,of,a,circle,of,voices,that,rose,higher,and,higher,in,efforts,to,be,heard,above,the,din
but,where,was,ashley
and,melanie,and,charles
she,tried,not,to,be,obvious,as,she,looked,about,and,peered,down,the,hall,into,the,laughing,group,inside
as,she,chattered,and,laughed,and,cast,quick,glances,into,the,house,and,the,yard,her,eyes,fell,on,a,stranger,standing,alone,in,the,hall,staring,at,her,in,a,cool,impertinent,way,that,brought,her,up,sharply,with,a,mingled,feeling,of,feminine,pleasure,that,she,had,attracted,a,man,and,an,embarrassed,sensation,that,her,dress,was,too,low,in,the,bosom
he,looked,quite,old,at,least,thirty-five
he,was,a,tall,man,and,powerfully,built
scarlett,thought,she,had,never,seen,a,man,with,such,wide,shoulders,so,heavy,with,muscles,almost,too,heavy,for,gentility
when,her,eye,caught,his,he,smiled,showing,animal-white,teeth,below,a,close-clipped,black,mustache
he,was,dark,of,face,swarthy,as,a,pirate,and,his,eyes,were,as,bold,and,black,as,any,pirate's,appraising,a,galleon,to,be,scuttled,or,a,maiden,to,be,ravished
there,was,a,cool,recklessness,in,his,face,and,a,cynical,humor,in,his,mouth,as,he,smiled,at,her,and,scarlett,caught,her,breath
she,felt,that,she,should,be,insulted,by,such,a,look,and,was,annoyed,with,herself,because,she,did,not,feel,insulted
she,did,not,know,who,he,could,be,but,there,was,undeniably,a,look,of,good,blood,in,his,dark,face
it,showed,in,the,thin,hawk,nose,over,the,full,red,lips,the,high,forehead,and,the,wide-set,eyes
she,dragged,her,eyes,away,from,his,without,smiling,back,and,he,turned,as,someone,called,rhett
rhett,butler
come,here
i,want,you,to,meet,the,most,hardhearted,girl,in,georgia
rhett,butler
the,name,had,a,familiar,sound,somehow,connected,with,something,pleasantly,scandalous,but,her,mind,was,on,ashley,and,she,dismissed,the,thought
i,must,run,upstairs,and,smooth,my,hair,she,told,stuart,and,brent,who,were,trying,to,get,her,cornered,from,the,crowd
you,boys,wait,for,me,and,don't,run,off,with,any,other,girl,or,i'll,be,furious
she,could,see,that,stuart,was,going,to,be,difficult,to,handle,today,if,she,flirted,with,anyone,else
he,had,been,drinking,and,wore,the,arrogant,looking-for-a-fight,expression,that,she,knew,from,experience,meant,trouble
she,paused,in,the,hall,to,speak,to,friends,and,to,greet,india,who,was,emerging,from,the,back,of,the,house,her,hair,untidy,and,tiny,beads,of,perspiration,on,her,forehead
poor,india
it,would,be,bad,enough,to,have,pale,hair,and,eyelashes,and,a,jutting,chin,that,meant,a,stubborn,disposition,without,being,twenty,years,old,and,an,old,maid,in,the,bargain
she,wondered,if,india,resented,very,much,her,taking,stuart,away,from,her
lots,of,people,said,she,was,still,in,love,with,him,but,then,you,could,never,tell,what,a,wilkes,was,thinking,about
if,she,did,resent,it,she,never,gave,any,sign,of,it,treating,scarlett,with,the,same,slightly,aloof,kindly,courtesy,she,had,always,shown,her
scarlett,spoke,pleasantly,to,her,and,started,up,the,wide,stairs
as,she,did,a,shy,voice,behind,her,called,her,name,and,turning,she,saw,charles,hamilton
he,was,a,nice-looking,boy,with,a,riot,of,soft,brown,curls,on,his,white,forehead,and,eyes,as,deep,brown,as,clean,and,as,gentle,as,a,collie,dog's
he,was,well,turned,out,in,mustard-colored,trousers,and,black,coat,and,his,pleated,shirt,was,topped,by,the,widest,and,most,fashionable,of,black,cravats
a,faint,blush,was,creeping,over,his,face,as,she,turned,for,he,was,timid,with,girls
like,most,shy,men,he,greatly,admired,airy,vivacious,always-at-ease,girls,like,scarlett
she,had,never,given,him,more,than,perfunctory,courtesy,before,and,so,the,beaming,smile,of,pleasure,with,which,she,greeted,him,and,the,two,hands,outstretched,to,his,almost,took,his,breath,away
why,charles,hamilton,you,handsome,old,thing,you
i'll,bet,you,came,all,the,way,down,here,from,atlanta,just,to,break,my,poor,heart
charles,almost,stuttered,with,excitement,holding,her,warm,little,hands,in,his,and,looking,into,the,dancing,green,eyes
this,was,the,way,girls,talked,to,other,boys,but,never,to,him
he,never,knew,why,but,girls,always,treated,him,like,a,younger,brother,and,were,very,kind,but,never,bothered,to,tease,him
he,had,always,wanted,girls,to,flirt,and,frolic,with,him,as,they,did,with,boys,much,less,handsome,and,less,endowed,with,this,world's,goods,than,he
but,on,the,few,occasions,when,this,had,happened,he,could,never,think,of,anything,to,say,and,he,suffered,agonies,of,embarrassment,at,his,dumbness
then,he,lay,awake,at,night,thinking,of,all,the,charming,gallantries,he,might,have,employed,but,he,rarely,got,a,second,chance,for,the,girls,left,him,alone,after,a,trial,or,two
even,with,honey,with,whom,he,had,an,unspoken,understanding,of,marriage,when,he,came,into,his,property,next,fall,he,was,diffident,and,silent
at,times,he,had,an,ungallant,feeling,that,honey's,coquetries,and,proprietary,airs,were,no,credit,to,him,for,she,was,so,boy-crazy,he,imagined,she,would,use,them,on,any,man,who,gave,her,the,opportunity
charles,was,not,excited,over,the,prospect,of,marrying,her,for,she,stirred,in,him,none,of,the,emotions,of,wild,romance,that,his,beloved,books,had,assured,him,were,proper,for,a,lover
he,had,always,yearned,to,be,loved,by,some,beautiful,dashing,creature,full,of,fire,and,mischief
and,here,was,scarlett,o'hara,teasing,him,about,breaking,her,heart
he,tried,to,think,of,something,to,say,and,couldn't,and,silently,he,blessed,her,because,she,kept,up,a,steady,chatter,which,relieved,him,of,any,necessity,for,conversation
it,was,too,good,to,be,true
now,you,wait,right,here,till,i,come,back,for,i,want,to,eat,barbecue,with,you
and,don't,you,go,off,philandering,with,those,other,girls,because,i'm,mighty,jealous,came,the,incredible,words,from,red,lips,with,a,dimple,on,each,side,and,briskly,black,lashes,swept,demurely,over,green,eyes
i,won't,he,finally,managed,to,breathe,never,dreaming,that,she,was,thinking,he,looked,like,a,calf,waiting,for,the,butcher
tapping,him,lightly,on,the,arm,with,her,folded,fan,she,turned,to,start,up,the,stairs,and,her,eyes,again,fell,on,the,man,called,rhett,butler,who,stood,alone,a,few,feet,away,from,charles
evidently,he,had,overheard,the,whole,conversation,for,he,grinned,up,at,her,as,maliciously,as,a,tomcat,and,again,his,eyes,went,over,her,in,a,gaze,totally,devoid,of,the,deference,she,was,accustomed,to
god's,nightgown
said,scarlett,to,herself,in,indignation,using,gerald's,favorite,oath
he,looks,as,if,as,if,he,knew,what,i,looked,like,without,my,shimmy,and,tossing,her,head,she,went,up,the,steps
in,the,bedroom,where,the,wraps,were,laid,she,found,cathleen,calvert,preening,before,the,mirror,and,biting,her,lips,to,make,them,look,redder
there,were,fresh,roses,in,her,sash,that,matched,her,cheeks,and,her,cornflower-blue,eyes,were,dancing,with,excitement
cathleen,said,scarlett,trying,to,pull,the,corsage,of,her,dress,higher,who,is,that,nasty,man,downstairs,named,butler
my,dear,don't,you,know
whispered,cathleen,excitedly,a,weather,eye,on,the,next,room,where,dilcey,and,the,wilkes,girls',mammy,were,gossiping
i,can't,imagine,how,mr,wilkes,must,feel,having,him,here,but,he,was,visiting,mr,kennedy,in,jonesboro,something,about,buying,cotton,and,of,course,mr,kennedy,had,to,bring,him,along,with,him
he,couldn't,just,go,off,and,leave,him
what,is,the,matter,with,him
my,dear,he,isn't,received
not,really
no
scarlett,digested,this,in,silence,for,she,had,never,before,been,under,the,same,roof,with,anyone,who,was,not,received
it,was,very,exciting
what,did,he,do
oh,scarlett,he,has,the,most,terrible,reputation
his,name,is,rhett,butler,and,he's,from,charleston,and,his,folks,are,some,of,the,nicest,people,there,but,they,won't,even,speak,to,him
caro,rhett,told,me,about,him,last,summer
he,isn't,any,kin,to,her,family,but,she,knows,all,about,him,everybody,does
he,was,expelled,from,west,point
imagine
and,for,things,too,bad,for,caro,to,know
and,then,there,was,that,business,about,the,girl,he,didn't,marry
do,tell,me
darling,don't,you,know,anything
caro,told,me,all,about,it,last,summer,and,her,mama,would,die,if,she,thought,caro,even,knew,about,it
well,this,mr,butler,took,a,charleston,girl,out,buggy,riding
i,never,did,know,who,she,was,but,i've,got,my,suspicions
she,couldn't,have,been,very,nice,or,she,wouldn't,have,gone,out,with,him,in,the,late,afternoon,without,a,chaperon
and,my,dear,they,stayed,out,nearly,all,night,and,walked,home,finally,saying,the,horse,had,run,away,and,smashed,the,buggy,and,they,had,gotten,lost,in,the,woods
and,guess,what
i,can't,guess
tell,me,said,scarlett,enthusiastically,hoping,for,the,worst
he,refused,to,marry,her,the,next,day
oh,said,scarlett,her,hopes,dashed
he,said,he,hadn't,er,done,anything,to,her,and,he,didn't,see,why,he,should,marry,her
and,of,course,her,brother,called,him,out,and,mr,butler,said,he'd,rather,be,shot,than,marry,a,stupid,fool
and,so,they,fought,a,duel,and,mr,butler,shot,the,girl's,brother,and,he,died,and,mr,butler,had,to,leave,charleston,and,now,nobody,receives,him,finished,cathleen,triumphantly,and,just,in,time,for,dilcey,came,back,into,the,room,to,oversee,the,toilet,of,her,charge
did,she,have,a,baby
whispered,scarlett,in,cathleen's,ear
cathleen,shook,her,head,violently
but,she,was,ruined,just,the,same,she,hissed,back
i,wish,i,had,gotten,ashley,to,compromise,me,thought,scarlett,suddenly
he'd,be,too,much,of,a,gentleman,not,to,marry,me
but,somehow,unbidden,she,had,a,feeling,of,respect,for,rhett,butler,for,refusing,to,marry,a,girl,who,was,a,fool
scarlett,sat,on,a,high,rosewood,ottoman,under,the,shade,of,a,huge,oak,in,the,rear,of,the,house,her,flounces,and,ruffles,billowing,about,her,and,two,inches,of,green,morocco,slippers,all,that,a,lady,could,show,and,still,remain,a,lady,peeping,from,beneath,them
she,had,scarcely,touched,plate,in,her,hands,and,seven,cavaliers,about,her
the,barbecue,had,reached,its,peak,and,the,warm,air,was,full,of,laughter,and,talk,the,click,of,silver,on,porcelain,and,the,rich,heavy,smells,of,roasting,meats,and,redolent,gravies
occasionally,when,the,slight,breeze,veered,puffs,of,smoke,from,the,long,barbecue,pits,floated,over,the,crowd,and,were,greeted,with,squeals,of,mock,dismay,from,the,ladies,and,violent,flappings,of,palmetto,fans
most,of,the,young,ladies,were,seated,with,partners,on,the,long,benches,that,faced,the,tables,but,scarlett,realizing,that,a,girl,has,only,two,sides,and,only,one,man,can,sit,on,each,of,these,sides,had,elected,to,sit,apart,so,she,could,gather,about,her,as,many,men,as,possible
under,the,arbor,sat,the,married,women,their,dark,dresses,decorous,notes,in,the,surrounding,color,and,gaiety
matrons,regardless,of,their,ages,always,grouped,together,apart,from,the,bright-eyed,girls,beaux,and,laughter,for,there,were,no,married,belles,in,the,south
from,grandma,fontaine,who,was,belching,frankly,with,the,privilege,of,her,age,to,seventeen-year-old,alice,munroe,struggling,against,the,nausea,of,a,first,pregnancy,they,had,their,heads,together,in,the,endless,genealogical,and,obstetrical,discussions,that,made,such,gatherings,very,pleasant,and,instructive,affairs
casting,contemptuous,glances,at,them,scarlett,thought,that,they,looked,like,a,clump,of,fat,crows
married,women,never,had,any,fun
it,did,not,occur,to,her,that,if,she,married,ashley,she,would,automatically,be,relegated,to,arbors,and,front,parlors,with,staid,matrons,in,dull,silks,as,staid,and,dull,as,they,and,not,a,part,of,the,fun,and,frolicking
like,most,girls,her,imagination,carried,her,just,as,far,as,the,altar,and,no,further
besides,she,was,too,unhappy,now,to,pursue,an,abstraction
she,dropped,her,eyes,to,her,plate,and,nibbled,daintily,on,a,beaten,biscuit,with,an,elegance,and,an,utter,lack,of,appetite,that,would,have,won,mammy's,approval
for,all,that,she,had,a,superfluity,of,beaux,she,had,never,been,more,miserable,in,her,life
in,some,way,that,she,could,not,understand,her,plans,of,last,night,had,failed,utterly,so,far,as,ashley,was,concerned
she,had,attracted,other,beaux,by,the,dozens,but,not,ashley,and,all,the,fears,of,yesterday,afternoon,were,sweeping,back,upon,her,making,her,heart,beat,fast,and,then,slow,and,color,flame,and,whiten,in,her,cheeks
ashley,had,made,no,attempt,to,join,the,circle,about,her,in,fact,she,had,not,had,a,word,alone,with,him,since,arriving,or,even,spoken,to,him,since,their,first,greeting
he,had,come,forward,to,welcome,her,when,she,came,into,the,back,garden,but,melanie,had,been,on,his,arm,then,melanie,who,hardly,came,up,to,his,shoulder
she,was,a,tiny,frailly,built,girl,who,gave,the,appearance,of,a,child,masquerading,in,her,mother's,enormous,hoop,skirts,an,illusion,that,was,heightened,by,the,shy,almost,frightened,look,in,her,too,large,brown,eyes
she,had,a,cloud,of,curly,dark,hair,which,was,so,sternly,repressed,beneath,its,net,that,no,vagrant,tendrils,escaped,and,this,dark,mass,with,its,long,widow's,peak,accentuated,the,heart,shape,of,her,face
too,wide,across,the,cheek,bones,too,pointed,at,the,chin,it,was,a,sweet,timid,face,but,a,plain,face,and,she,had,no,feminine,tricks,of,allure,to,make,observers,forget,its,plainness
she,looked,and,was,as,simple,as,earth,as,good,as,bread,as,transparent,as,spring,water
but,for,all,her,plainness,of,feature,and,smallness,of,stature,there,was,a,sedate,dignity,about,her,movements,that,was,oddly,touching,and,far,older,than,her,seventeen,years
her,gray,organdie,dress,with,its,cherry-colored,satin,sash,disguised,with,its,billows,and,ruffles,how,childishly,undeveloped,her,body,was,and,the,yellow,hat,with,long,cherry,streamers,made,her,creamy,skin,glow
her,heavy,earbobs,with,their,long,gold,fringe,hung,down,from,loops,of,tidily,netted,hair,swinging,close,to,her,brown,eyes,eyes,that,had,the,still,gleam,of,a,forest,pool,in,winter,when,brown,leaves,shine,up,through,quiet,water
she,had,smiled,with,timid,liking,when,she,greeted,scarlett,and,told,her,how,pretty,her,green,dress,was,and,scarlett,had,been,hard,put,to,be,even,civil,in,reply,so,violently,did,she,want,to,speak,alone,with,ashley
since,then,ashley,had,sat,on,a,stool,at,melanie's,feet,apart,from,the,other,guests,and,talked,quietly,with,her,smiling,the,slow,drowsy,smile,that,scarlett,loved
what,made,matters,worse,was,that,under,his,smile,a,little,sparkle,had,come,into,melanie's,eyes,so,that,even,scarlett,had,to,admit,that,she,looked,almost,pretty
as,melanie,looked,at,ashley,her,plain,face,lit,up,as,with,an,inner,fire,for,if,ever,a,loving,heart,showed,itself,upon,a,face,it,was,showing,now,on,melanie,hamilton's
scarlett,tried,to,keep,her,eyes,from,these,two,but,could,not,and,after,each,glance,she,redoubled,her,gaiety,with,her,cavaliers,laughing,saying,daring,things,teasing,tossing,her,head,at,their,compliments,until,her,earrings,danced
she,said,fiddle-dee-dee,many,times,declared,that,the,truth,wasn't,in,any,of,them,and,vowed,that,she'd,never,believe,anything,any,man,told,her
but,ashley,did,not,seem,to,notice,her,at,all
he,only,looked,up,at,melanie,and,talked,on,and,melanie,looked,down,at,him,with,an,expression,that,radiated,the,fact,that,she,belonged,to,him
so,scarlett,was,miserable
to,the,outward,eye,never,had,a,girl,less,cause,to,be,miserable
she,was,undoubtedly,the,belle,of,the,barbecue,the,center,of,attention
the,furore,she,was,causing,among,the,men,coupled,with,the,heart,burnings,of,the,other,girls,would,have,pleased,her,enormously,at,any,other,time
charles,hamilton,emboldened,by,her,notice,was,firmly,planted,on,her,right,refusing,to,be,dislodged,by,the,combined,efforts,of,the,tarleton,twins
he,held,her,fan,in,one,hand,and,his,untouched,plate,of,barbecue,in,the,other,and,stubbornly,refused,to,meet,the,eyes,of,honey,who,seemed,on,the,verge,of,an,outburst,of,tears
cade,lounged,gracefully,on,her,left,plucking,at,her,skirt,to,attract,her,attention,and,staring,up,with,smoldering,eyes,at,stuart
already,the,air,was,electric,between,him,and,the,twins,and,rude,words,had,passed
frank,kennedy,fussed,about,like,a,hen,with,one,chick,running,back,and,forth,from,the,shade,of,the,oak,to,the,tables,to,fetch,dainties,to,tempt,scarlett,as,if,there,were,not,a,dozen,servants,there,for,that,purpose
as,a,result,suellen's,sullen,resentment,had,passed,beyond,the,point,of,ladylike,concealment,and,she,glowered,at,scarlett
small,carreen,could,have,cried,because,for,all,scarlett's,encouraging,words,that,morning,brent,had,done,no,more,than,say,hello,sis,and,jerk,her,hair,ribbon,before,turning,his,full,attention,to,scarlett
usually,he,was,so,kind,and,treated,her,with,a,careless,deference,that,made,her,feel,grown,up,and,carreen,secretly,dreamed,of,the,day,when,she,would,put,her,hair,up,and,her,skirts,down,and,receive,him,as,a,real,beau
and,now,it,seemed,that,scarlett,had,him
the,munroe,girls,were,concealing,their,chagrin,at,the,defection,of,the,swarthy,fontaine,boys,but,they,were,annoyed,at,the,way,tony,and,alex,stood,about,the,circle,jockeying,for,a,position,near,scarlett,should,any,of,the,others,arise,from,their,places
they,telegraphed,their,disapproval,of,scarlett's,conduct,to,hetty,tarleton,by,delicately,raised,eyebrows
fast,was,the,only,word,for,scarlett
simultaneously,the,three,young,ladies,raised,lacy,parasols,said,they,had,had,quite,enough,to,eat,thank,you,and,laying,light,fingers,on,the,arms,of,the,men,nearest,them,clamored,sweetly,to,see,the,rose,garden,the,spring,and,the,summerhouse
this,strategic,retreat,in,good,order,was,not,lost,on,a,woman,present,or,observed,by,a,man
scarlett,giggled,as,she,saw,three,men,dragged,out,of,the,line,of,her,charms,to,investigate,landmarks,familiar,to,the,girls,from,childhood,and,cut,her,eye,sharply,to,see,if,ashley,had,taken,note
but,he,was,playing,with,the,ends,of,melanie's,sash,and,smiling,up,at,her
pain,twisted,scarlett's,heart
she,felt,that,she,could,claw,melanie's,ivory,skin,till,the,blood,ran,and,take,pleasure,in,doing,it
as,her,eyes,wandered,from,melanie,she,caught,the,gaze,of,rhett,butler,who,was,not,mixing,with,the,crowd,but,standing,apart,talking,to,john,wilkes
he,had,been,watching,her,and,when,she,looked,at,him,he,laughed,outright
scarlett,had,an,uneasy,feeling,that,this,man,who,was,not,received,was,the,only,one,present,who,knew,what,lay,behind,her,wild,gaiety,and,that,it,was,affording,him,sardonic,amusement
she,could,have,clawed,him,with,pleasure,too
if,i,can,just,live,through,this,barbecue,till,this,afternoon,she,thought,all,the,girls,will,go,upstairs,to,take,naps,to,be,fresh,for,tonight,and,i'll,stay,downstairs,and,get,to,talk,to,ashley
surely,he,must,have,noticed,how,popular,i,am
she,soothed,her,heart,with,another,hope,of,course,he,has,to,be,attentive,to,melanie,because,after,all,she,is,his,cousin,and,she,isn't,popular,at,all,and,if,he,didn't,look,out,for,her,she'd,just,be,a,wallflower
she,took,new,courage,at,this,thought,and,redoubled,her,efforts,in,the,direction,of,charles,whose,brown,eyes,glowed,down,eagerly,at,her
it,was,a,wonderful,day,for,charles,a,dream,day,and,he,had,fallen,in,love,with,scarlett,with,no,effort,at,all
before,this,new,emotion,honey,receded,into,a,dim,haze
honey,was,a,shrill-,voiced,sparrow,and,scarlett,a,gleaming,hummingbird
she,teased,him,and,favored,him,and,asked,him,questions,and,answered,them,herself,so,that,he,appeared,very,clever,without,having,to,say,a,word
the,other,boys,were,puzzled,and,annoyed,by,her,obvious,interest,in,him,for,they,knew,charles,was,too,shy,to,hitch,two,consecutive,words,together,and,politeness,was,being,severely,strained,to,conceal,their,growing,rage
everyone,was,smoldering,and,it,would,have,been,a,positive,triumph,for,scarlett,except,for,ashley
when,the,last,forkful,of,pork,and,chicken,and,mutton,had,been,eaten,scarlett,hoped,the,time,had,come,when,india,would,rise,and,suggest,that,the,ladies,retire,to,the,house
it,was,two,o'clock,and,the,sun,was,warm,overhead,but,india,wearied,with,the,three-,day,preparations,for,the,barbecue,was,only,too,glad,to,remain,sitting,beneath,the,arbor,shouting,remarks,to,a,deaf,old,gentleman,from,fayetteville
a,lazy,somnolence,descended,on,the,crowd
the,negroes,idled,about,clearing,the,long,tables,on,which,the,food,had,been,laid
the,laughter,and,talking,became,less,animated,and,groups,here,and,there,fell,silent
all,were,waiting,for,their,hostess,to,signal,the,end,of,the,morning's,festivities
palmetto,fans,were,wagging,more,slowly,and,several,gentlemen,were,nodding,from,the,heat,and,overloaded,stomachs
the,barbecue,was,over,and,all,were,content,to,take,their,ease,while,sun,was,at,its,height
in,this,interval,between,the,morning,party,and,the,evening's,ball,they,seemed,a,placid,peaceful,lot
only,the,young,men,retained,the,restless,energy,which,had,filled,the,whole,throng,a,short,while,before
moving,from,group,to,group,drawling,in,their,soft,voices,they,were,as,handsome,as,blooded,stallions,and,as,dangerous
the,languor,of,midday,had,taken,hold,of,the,gathering,but,underneath,lurked,tempers,that,could,rise,to,killing,heights,in,a,second,and,flare,out,as,quickly
men,and,women,they,were,beautiful,and,wild,all,a,little,violent,under,their,pleasant,ways,and,only,a,little,tamed
some,time,dragged,by,while,the,sun,grew,hotter,and,scarlett,and,others,looked,again,toward,india
conversation,was,dying,out,when,in,the,lull,everyone,in,the,grove,heard,gerald's,voice,raised,in,furious,accents
standing,some,little,distance,away,from,the,barbecue,tables,he,was,at,the,peak,of,an,argument,with,john,wilkes
god's,nightgown,man
pray,for,a,peaceable,settlement,with,the,yankees,after,we've,fired,on,the,rascals,at,fort,sumter
peaceable
the,south,should,show,by,arms,that,she,cannot,be,insulted,and,that,she,is,not,leaving,the,union,by,the,union's,kindness,but,by,her,own,strength
oh,my,god
thought,scarlett
he's,done,it
now,we'll,all,sit,here,till,midnight
in,an,instant,the,somnolence,had,fled,from,the,lounging,throng,and,something,electric,went,snapping,through,the,air
the,men,sprang,from,benches,and,chairs,arms,in,wide,gestures,voices,clashing,for,the,right,to,be,heard,above,other,voices
there,had,been,no,talk,of,politics,or,impending,war,all,during,the,morning,because,of,mr,wilkes',request,that,the,ladies,should,not,be,bored
but,now,gerald,had,bawled,the,words,fort,sumter,and,every,man,present,forgot,his,host's,admonition
of,course,we'll,fight,yankee,thieves,we,could,lick,them,in,a,month,why,one,southerner,can,lick,twenty,yankees,teach,them,a,lesson,they,won't,soon,forget,peaceably
they,won't,let,us,go,in,peace,no,look,how,mr,lincoln,insulted,our,commissioners
yes,kept,them,hanging,around,for,weeks,swearing,he'd,have,sumter,evacuated
they,want,war,we'll,make,them,sick,of,war,and,above,all,the,voices,gerald's,boomed
all,scarlett,could,hear,was,states',rights,by,god
shouted,over,and,over
gerald,was,having,an,excellent,time,but,not,his,daughter
secession,war,these,words,long,since,had,become,acutely,boring,to,scarlett,from,much,repetition,but,now,she,hated,the,sound,of,them,for,they,meant,that,the,men,would,stand,there,for,hours,haranguing,one,another,and,she,would,have,no,chance,to,corner,ashley
of,course,there,would,be,no,war,and,the,men,all,knew,it
they,just,loved,to,talk,and,hear,themselves,talk
charles,hamilton,had,not,risen,with,the,others,and,finding,himself,comparatively,alone,with,scarlett,he,leaned,closer,and,with,the,daring,born,of,new,love,whispered,a,confession
miss,o'hara,i,i,had,already,decided,that,if,we,did,fight,i'd,go,over,to,south,carolina,and,join,a,troop,there
it's,said,that,mr,wade,hampton,is,organizing,a,cavalry,troop,and,of,course,i,would,want,to,go,with,him
he's,a,splendid,person,and,was,my,father's,best,friend
scarlett,thought,what,am,i,supposed,to,do,give,three,cheers
for,charles',expression,showed,that,he,was,baring,his,heart's,secrets,to,her
she,could,think,of,nothing,to,say,and,so,merely,looked,at,him,wondering,why,men,were,such,fools,as,to,think,women,interested,in,such,matters
he,took,her,expression,to,mean,stunned,approbation,and,went,on,rapidly,daringly
if,i,went,would,would,you,be,sorry,miss,o'hara
i,should,cry,into,my,pillow,every,night,said,scarlett,meaning,to,be,flippant,but,he,took,the,statement,at,face,value,and,went,red,with,pleasure
her,hand,was,concealed,in,the,folds,of,her,dress,and,he,cautiously,wormed,his,hand,to,it,and,squeezed,it,overwhelmed,at,his,own,boldness,and,at,her,acquiescence
would,you,pray,for,me
what,a,fool
thought,scarlett,bitterly,casting,a,surreptitious,glance,about,her,in,the,hope,of,being,rescued,from,the,conversation
would,you
oh,yes,indeed,mr,hamilton
three,rosaries,a,night,at,least
charles,gave,a,swift,look,about,him,drew,in,his,breath,stiffened,the,muscles,of,his,stomach
they,were,practically,alone,and,he,might,never,get,another,such,opportunity
and,even,given,another,such,godsent,occasion,his,courage,might,fail,him
miss,o'hara,i,must,tell,you,something
i,i,love,you
um
said,scarlett,absently,trying,to,peer,through,the,crowd,of,arguing,men,to,where,ashley,still,sat,talking,at,melanie's,feet
yes
whispered,charles,in,a,rapture,that,she,had,neither,laughed,screamed,nor,fainted,as,he,had,always,imagined,young,girls,did,under,such,circumstances
i,love,you
you,are,the,most,the,most,and,he,found,his,tongue,for,the,first,time,in,his,life
the,most,beautiful,girl,i've,ever,known,and,the,sweetest,and,the,kindest,and,you,have,the,dearest,ways,and,i,love,you,with,all,my,heart
i,cannot,hope,that,you,could,love,anyone,like,me,but,my,dear,miss,o'hara,if,you,can,give,me,any,encouragement,i,will,do,anything,in,the,world,to,make,you,love,me
i,will
charles,stopped,for,he,couldn't,think,of,anything,difficult,enough,of,accomplishment,to,really,prove,to,scarlett,the,depth,of,his,feeling,so,he,said,simply,i,want,to,marry,you
scarlett,came,back,to,earth,with,a,jerk,at,the,sound,of,the,word,marry
she,had,been,thinking,of,marriage,and,of,ashley,and,she,looked,at,charles,with,poorly,concealed,irritation
why,must,this,calf-like,fool,intrude,his,feelings,on,this,particular,day,when,she,was,so,worried,she,was,about,to,lose,her,mind
she,looked,into,the,pleading,brown,eyes,and,she,saw,none,of,the,beauty,of,a,shy,boy's,first,love,of,the,adoration,of,an,ideal,come,true,or,the,wild,happiness,and,tenderness,that,were,sweeping,through,him,like,a,flame
scarlett,was,used,to,men,asking,her,to,marry,them,men,much,more,attractive,than,charles,hamilton,and,men,who,had,more,finesse,than,to,propose,at,a,barbecue,when,she,had,more,important,matters,on,her,mind
she,only,saw,a,boy,of,twenty,red,as,a,beet,and,looking,very,silly
she,wished,that,she,could,tell,him,how,silly,he,looked
but,automatically,the,words,ellen,had,taught,her,to,say,in,such,emergencies,rose,to,her,lips,and,casting,down,her,eyes,from,force,of,long,habit,she,murmured,mr,hamilton,i,am,not,unaware,of,the,honor,you,have,bestowed,on,me,in,wanting,me,to,become,your,wife,but,this,is,all,so,sudden,that,i,do,not,know,what,to,say
that,was,a,neat,way,of,smoothing,a,man's,vanity,and,yet,keeping,him,on,the,string,and,charles,rose,to,it,as,though,such,bait,were,new,and,he,the,first,to,swallow,it
i,would,wait,forever
i,wouldn't,want,you,unless,you,were,quite,sure
please,miss,o'hara,tell,me,that,i,may,hope
um,said,scarlett,her,sharp,eyes,noting,that,ashley,who,had,not,risen,to,take,part,in,the,war,talk,was,smiling,up,at,melanie
if,this,fool,who,was,grappling,for,her,hand,would,only,keep,quiet,for,a,moment,perhaps,she,could,hear,what,they,were,saying
she,must,hear,what,they,said
what,did,melanie,say,to,him,that,brought,that,look,of,interest,to,his,eyes
charles',words,blurred,the,voices,she,strained,to,hear
oh,hush
she,hissed,at,him,pinching,his,hand,and,not,even,looking,at,him
startled,at,first,abashed,charles,blushed,at,the,rebuff,and,then,seeing,how,her,eyes,were,fastened,on,his,sister,he,smiled
scarlett,was,afraid,someone,might,hear,his,words
she,was,naturally,embarrassed,and,shy,and,in,agony,lest,they,be,overheard
charles,felt,a,surge,of,masculinity,such,as,he,had,never,experienced,for,this,was,the,first,time,in,his,life,that,he,had,ever,embarrassed,any,girl
the,thrill,was,intoxicating
he,arranged,his,face,in,what,he,fancied,was,an,expression,of,careless,unconcern,and,cautiously,returned,scarlett's,pinch,to,show,that,he,was,man,of,the,world,enough,to,understand,and,accept,her,reproof
she,did,not,even,feel,his,pinch,for,she,could,hear,clearly,the,sweet,voice,that,was,melanie's,chief,charm,i,fear,i,cannot,agree,with,you,about,mr,thackeray's,works
he,is,a,cynic
i,fear,he,is,not,the,gentleman,mr,dickens,is
what,a,silly,thing,to,say,to,a,man,thought,scarlett,ready,to,giggle,with,relief
why,she's,no,more,than,a,bluestocking,and,everyone,knows,what,men,think,of,bluestockings
the,way,to,get,a,man,interested,and,to,hold,his,interest,was,to,talk,about,him,and,then,gradually,lead,the,conversation,around,to,yourself,and,keep,it,there
scarlett,would,have,felt,some,cause,for,alarm,if,melanie,had,been,saying,how,wonderful,you,are
or,how,do,you,ever,think,of,such,things
my,little,ole,brain,would,bust,if,i,even,tried,to,think,about,them
but,here,she,was,with,a,man,at,her,feet,talking,as,seriously,as,if,she,were,in,church
the,prospect,looked,brighter,to,scarlett,so,bright,in,fact,that,she,turned,beaming,eyes,on,charles,and,smiled,from,pure,joy
enraptured,at,this,evidence,of,her,affection,he,grabbed,up,her,fan,and,plied,it,so,enthusiastically,her,hair,began,to,blow,about,untidily
ashley,you,have,not,favored,us,with,your,opinion,said,jim,tarleton,turning,from,the,group,of,shouting,men,and,with,an,apology,ashley,excused,himself,and,rose
there,was,no,one,there,so,handsome,thought,scarlett,as,she,marked,how,graceful,was,his,negligent,pose,and,how,the,sun,gleamed,on,his,gold,hair,and,mustache
even,the,older,men,stopped,to,listen,to,his,words
why,gentlemen,if,georgia,fights,i'll,go,with,her
why,else,would,i,have,joined,the,troop
he,said
his,gray,eyes,opened,wide,and,their,drowsiness,disappeared,in,an,intensity,that,scarlett,had,never,seen,before
but,like,father,i,hope,the,yankees,will,let,us,go,in,peace,and,that,there,will,be,no,fighting,he,held,up,his,hand,with,a,smile,as,a,babel,of,voices,from,the,fontaine,and,tarleton,boys,began
yes,yes,i,know,we've,been,insulted,and,lied,to,but,if,we'd,been,in,the,yankees',shoes,and,they,were,trying,to,leave,the,union,how,would,we,have,acted
pretty,much,the,same
we,wouldn't,have,liked,it
there,he,goes,again,thought,scarlett
always,putting,himself,in,the,other,fellow's,shoes
to,her,there,was,never,but,one,fair,side,to,an,argument
sometimes,there,was,no,understanding,ashley
let's,don't,be,too,hot,headed,and,let's,don't,have,any,war
most,of,the,misery,of,the,world,has,been,caused,by,wars
and,when,the,wars,were,over,no,one,ever,knew,what,they,were,all,about
scarlett,sniffed
lucky,for,ashley,that,he,had,an,unassailable,reputation,for,courage,or,else,there'd,be,trouble
as,she,thought,this,the,clamor,of,dissenting,voices,rose,up,about,ashley,indignant,fiery
under,the,arbor,the,deaf,old,gentleman,from,fayetteville,punched,india
what's,it,all,about
what,are,they,saying
war
shouted,india,cupping,her,hand,to,his,ear
they,want,to,fight,the,yankees
war,is,it
he,cried,fumbling,about,him,for,his,cane,and,heaving,himself,out,of,his,chair,with,more,energy,than,he,had,shown,in,years
i'll,tell,'um,about,war
i've,been,there
it,was,not,often,that,mr,mcrae,had,the,opportunity,to,talk,about,war,the,way,his,women,folks,shushed,him
he,stumped,rapidly,to,the,group,waving,his,cane,and,shouting,and,because,he,could,not,hear,the,voices,about,him,he,soon,had,undisputed,possession,of,the,field
you,fire-eating,young,bucks,listen,to,me
you,don't,want,to,fight
i,fought,and,i,know
went,out,in,the,seminole,war,and,was,a,big,enough,fool,to,go,to,the,mexican,war,too
you,all,don't,know,what,war,is
you,think,it's,riding,a,pretty,horse,and,having,the,girls,throw,flowers,at,you,and,coming,home,a,hero
well,it,ain't
no,sir
it's,going,hungry,and,getting,the,measles,and,pneumonia,from,sleeping,in,the,wet
and,if,it,ain't,measles,and,pneumonia,it's,your,bowels
yes,sir,what,war,does,to,a,man's,bowels,dysentery,and,things,like,that
the,ladies,were,pink,with,blushes
mr,mcrae,was,a,reminder,of,a,cruder,era,like,grandma,fontaine,and,her,embarrassingly,loud,belches,an,era,everyone,would,like,to,forget
run,get,your,grandpa,hissed,one,of,the,old,gentleman's,daughters,to,a,young,girl,standing,near,by
i,declare,she,whispered,to,the,fluttering,matrons,about,her,he,gets,worse,every,day
would,you,believe,it,this,very,morning,he,said,to,mary,and,she's,only,sixteen,'now,missy
'
and,the,voice,went,off,into,a,whisper,as,the,granddaughter,slipped,out,to,try,to,induce,mr,mcrae,to,return,to,his,seat,in,the,shade
of,all,the,group,that,milled,about,under,the,trees,girls,smiling,excitedly,men,talking,impassionedly,there,was,only,one,who,seemed,calm
scarlett's,eyes,turned,to,rhett,butler,who,leaned,against,a,tree,his,hands,shoved,deep,in,his,trouser,pockets
he,stood,alone,since,mr,wilkes,had,left,his,side,and,had,uttered,no,word,as,the,conversation,grew,hotter
the,red,lips,under,the,close-clipped,black,mustache,curled,down,and,there,was,a,glint,of,amused,contempt,in,his,black,eyes,contempt,as,if,he,listened,to,the,braggings,of,children
a,very,disagreeable,smile,scarlett,thought
he,listened,quietly,until,stuart,tarleton,his,red,hair,tousled,and,his,eyes,gleaming,repeated,why,we,could,lick,them,in,a,month
gentlemen,always,fight,better,than,rabble
a,month,why,one,battle
gentlemen,said,rhett,butler,in,a,flat,drawl,that,bespoke,his,charleston,birth,not,moving,from,his,position,against,the,tree,or,taking,his,hands,from,his,pockets,may,i,say,a,word
there,was,contempt,in,his,manner,as,in,his,eyes,contempt,overlaid,with,an,air,of,courtesy,that,somehow,burlesqued,their,own,manners
the,group,turned,toward,him,and,accorded,him,the,politeness,always,due,an,outsider
has,any,one,of,you,gentlemen,ever,thought,that,there's,not,a,cannon,factory,south,of,the,mason-dixon,line
or,how,few,iron,foundries,there,are,in,the,south
or,woolen,mills,or,cotton,factories,or,tanneries
have,you,thought,that,we,would,not,have,a,single,warship,and,that,the,yankee,fleet,could,bottle,up,our,harbors,in,a,week,so,that,we,could,not,sell,our,cotton,abroad
but,of,course,you,gentlemen,have,thought,of,these,things
why,he,means,the,boys,are,a,passel,of,fools
thought,scarlett,indignantly,the,hot,blood,coming,to,her,cheeks
evidently,she,was,not,the,only,one,to,whom,this,idea,occurred,for,several,of,the,boys,were,beginning,to,stick,out,their,chins
john,wilkes,casually,but,swiftly,came,back,to,his,place,beside,the,speaker,as,if,to,impress,on,all,present,that,this,man,was,his,guest,and,that,moreover,there,were,ladies,present
the,trouble,with,most,of,us,southerners,continued,rhett,butler,is,that,we,either,don't,travel,enough,or,we,don't,profit,enough,by,our,travels
now,of,course,all,you,gentlemen,are,well,traveled
but,what,have,you,seen
europe,and,new,york,and,philadelphia,and,of,course,the,ladies,have,been,to,saratoga,he,bowed,slightly,to,the,group,under,the,arbor
you've,seen,the,hotels,and,the,museums,and,the,balls,and,the,gambling,houses
and,you've,come,home,believing,that,there's,no,place,like,the,south
as,for,me,i,was,charleston,born,but,i,have,spent,the,last,few,years,in,the,north
his,white,teeth,showed,in,a,grin,as,though,he,realized,that,everyone,present,knew,just,why,he,no,longer,lived,in,charleston,and,cared,not,at,all,if,they,did,know
i,have,seen,many,things,that,you,all,have,not,seen
the,thousands,of,immigrants,who'd,be,glad,to,fight,for,the,yankees,for,food,and,a,few,dollars,the,factories,the,foundries,the,shipyards,the,iron,and,coal,mines,all,the,things,we,haven't,got
why,all,we,have,is,cotton,and,slaves,and,arrogance
they'd,lick,us,in,a,month
for,a,tense,moment,there,was,silence
rhett,butler,removed,a,fine,linen,handkerchief,from,his,coat,pocket,and,idly,flicked,dust,from,his,sleeve
then,an,ominous,murmuring,arose,in,the,crowd,and,from,under,the,arbor,came,a,humming,as,unmistakable,as,that,of,a,hive,of,newly,disturbed,bees
even,while,she,felt,the,hot,blood,of,wrath,still,in,her,cheeks,something,in,scarlett's,practical,mind,prompted,the,thought,that,what,this,man,said,was,right,and,it,sounded,like,common,sense
why,she'd,never,even,seen,a,factory,or,known,anyone,who,had,seen,a,factory
but,even,if,it,were,true,he,was,no,gentleman,to,make,such,a,statement,and,at,a,party,too,where,everyone,was,having,a,good,time
stuart,tarleton,brows,lowering,came,forward,with,brent,close,at,his,heels
of,course,the,tarleton,twins,had,nice,manners,and,they,wouldn't,make,a,scene,at,a,barbecue,even,though,tremendously,provoked
just,the,same,all,the,ladies,felt,pleasantly,excited,for,it,was,so,seldom,that,they,actually,saw,a,scene,or,a,quarrel
usually,they,had,to,hear,of,it,third-hand
sir,said,stuart,heavily,what,do,you,mean
rhett,looked,at,him,with,polite,but,mocking,eyes
i,mean,he,answered,what,napoleon,perhaps,you've,heard,of,him,remarked,once,'god,is,on,the,side,of,the,strongest,battalion,'
and,turning,to,john,wilkes,he,said,with,courtesy,that,was,unfeigned,you,promised,to,show,me,your,library,sir
would,it,be,too,great,a,favor,to,ask,to,see,it,now
i,fear,i,must,go,back,to,jonesboro,early,this,afternoon,where,a,bit,of,business,calls,me
he,swung,about,facing,the,crowd,clicked,his,heels,together,and,bowed,like,a,dancing,master,a,bow,that,was,graceful,for,so,powerful,a,man,and,as,full,of,impertinence,as,a,slap,in,the,face
then,he,walked,across,the,lawn,with,john,wilkes,his,black,head,in,the,air,and,the,sound,of,his,discomforting,laughter,floated,back,to,the,group,about,the,tables
there,was,a,startled,silence,and,then,the,buzzing,broke,out,again
india,rose,tiredly,from,her,seat,beneath,the,arbor,and,went,toward,the,angry,stuart,tarleton
scarlett,could,not,hear,what,she,said,but,the,look,in,her,eyes,as,she,gazed,up,into,his,lowering,face,gave,scarlett,something,like,a,twinge,of,conscience
it,was,the,same,look,of,belonging,that,melanie,wore,when,she,looked,at,ashley,only,stuart,did,not,see,it
so,india,did,love,him
scarlett,thought,for,an,instant,that,if,she,had,not,flirted,so,blatantly,with,stuart,at,that,political,speaking,a,year,ago,he,might,have,married,india,long,ere,this
but,then,the,twinge,passed,with,the,comforting,thought,that,it,wasn't,her,fault,if,other,girls,couldn't,keep,their,men
finally,stuart,smiled,down,at,india,an,unwilling,smile,and,nodded,his,head
probably,india,had,been,pleading,with,him,not,to,follow,mr,butler,and,make,trouble
a,polite,tumult,broke,out,under,the,trees,as,the,guests,arose,shaking,crumbs,from,laps
the,married,women,called,to,nurses,and,small,children,and,gathered,their,broods,together,to,take,their,departure,and,groups,of,girls,started,off,laughing,and,talking,toward,the,house,to,exchange,gossip,in,the,upstairs,bedrooms,and,to,take,their,naps
all,the,ladies,except,mrs,tarleton,moved,out,of,the,back,yard,leaving,the,shade,of,oaks,and,arbor,to,the,men
she,was,detained,by,gerald,mr,calvert,and,the,others,who,wanted,an,answer,from,her,about,the,horses,for,the,troop
ashley,strolled,over,to,where,scarlett,and,charles,sat,a,thoughtful,and,amused,smile,on,his,face
arrogant,devil,isn't,he
he,observed,looking,after,butler
he,looks,like,one,of,the,borgias
scarlett,thought,quickly,but,could,remember,no,family,in,the,county,or,atlanta,or,savannah,by,that,name
i,don't,know,them
is,he,kin,to,them
who,are,they
an,odd,look,came,over,charles',face,incredulity,and,shame,struggling,with,love
love,triumphed,as,he,realized,that,it,was,enough,for,a,girl,to,be,sweet,and,gentle,and,beautiful,without,having,an,education,to,hamper,her,charms,and,he,made,swift,answer,the,borgias,were,italians
oh,said,scarlett,losing,interest,foreigners
she,turned,her,prettiest,smile,on,ashley,but,for,some,reason,he,was,not,looking,at,her
he,was,looking,at,charles,and,there,was,understanding,in,his,face,and,a,little,pity
scarlett,stood,on,the,landing,and,peered,cautiously,over,the,banisters,into,the,hall,below
it,was,empty
from,the,bedrooms,on,the,floor,above,came,an,unending,hum,of,low,voices,rising,and,falling,punctuated,with,squeaks,of,laughter,and,now,you,didn't,really
and,what,did,he,say,then
on,the,beds,and,couches,of,the,six,great,bedrooms,the,girls,were,resting,their,dresses,off,their,stays,loosed,their,hair,flowing,down,their,backs
afternoon,naps,were,a,custom,of,the,country,and,never,were,they,so,necessary,as,on,the,all-day,parties,beginning,early,in,the,morning,and,culminating,in,a,ball
for,half,an,hour,the,girls,would,chatter,and,laugh,and,then,servants,would,pull,the,shutters,and,in,the,warm,half-gloom,the,talk,would,die,to,whispers,and,finally,expire,in,silence,broken,only,by,soft,regular,breathing
scarlett,had,made,certain,that,melanie,was,lying,down,on,the,bed,with,honey,and,hetty,tarleton,before,she,slipped,into,the,hall,and,started,down,the,stairs
from,the,window,on,the,landing,she,could,see,the,group,of,men,sitting,under,the,arbor,drinking,from,tall,glasses,and,she,knew,they,would,remain,there,until,late,afternoon
her,eyes,searched,the,group,but,ashley,was,not,among,them
then,she,listened,and,she,heard,his,voice
as,she,had,hoped,he,was,still,in,the,front,driveway,bidding,good-by,to,departing,matrons,and,children
her,heart,in,her,throat,she,went,swiftly,down,the,stairs
what,if,she,should,meet,mr,wilkes
what,excuse,could,she,give,for,prowling,about,the,house,when,all,the,other,girls,were,getting,their,beauty,naps
well,that,had,to,be,risked
as,she,reached,the,bottom,step,she,heard,the,servants,moving,about,in,the,dining,room,under,the,butler's,orders,lifting,out,the,table,and,chairs,in,preparation,for,the,dancing
across,the,wide,hall,was,the,open,door,of,the,library,and,she,sped,into,it,noiselessly
she,could,wait,there,until,ashley,finished,his,adieux,and,then,call,to,him,when,he,came,into,the,house
the,library,was,in,semidarkness,for,the,blinds,had,been,drawn,against,the,sun
the,dim,room,with,towering,walls,completely,filled,with,dark,books,depressed,her
it,was,not,the,place,which,she,would,have,chosen,for,a,tryst,such,as,she,hoped,this,one,would,be
large,numbers,of,books,always,depressed,her,as,did,people,who,liked,to,read,large,numbers,of,books
that,is,all,people,except,ashley
the,heavy,furniture,rose,up,at,her,in,the,half-,light,high-backed,chairs,with,deep,seats,and,wide,arms,made,for,the,tall,wilkes,men,squatty,soft,chairs,of,velvet,with,velvet,hassocks,before,them,for,the,girls
far,across,the,long,room,before,the,hearth,the,seven-foot,sofa,ashley's,favorite,seat,reared,its,high,back,like,some,huge,sleeping,animal
she,closed,the,door,except,for,a,crack,and,tried,to,make,her,heart,beat,more,slowly
she,tried,to,remember,just,exactly,what,she,had,planned,last,night,to,say,to,ashley,but,she,couldn't,recall,anything
had,she,thought,up,something,and,forgotten,it,or,had,she,only,planned,that,ashley,should,say,something,to,her
she,couldn't,remember,and,a,sudden,cold,fright,fell,upon,her
if,her,heart,would,only,stop,pounding,in,her,ears,perhaps,she,could,think,of,what,to,say
but,the,quick,thudding,only,increased,as,she,heard,him,call,a,final,farewell,and,walk,into,the,front,hall
all,she,could,think,of,was,that,she,loved,him,everything,about,him,from,the,proud,lift,of,his,gold,head,to,his,slender,dark,boots,loved,his,laughter,even,when,it,mystified,her,loved,his,bewildering,silences
oh,if,only,he,would,walk,in,on,her,now,and,take,her,in,his,arms,so,she,would,be,spared,the,need,of,saying,anything
he,must,love,her,perhaps,if,i,prayed,she,squeezed,her,eyes,tightly,and,began,gabbling,to,herself,hail,mary,full,of,grace
why,scarlett
said,ashley's,voice,breaking,in,through,the,roaring,in,her,ears,and,throwing,her,into,utter,confusion
he,stood,in,the,hall,peering,at,her,through,the,partly,opened,door,a,quizzical,smile,on,his,face
who,are,you,hiding,from,charles,or,the,tarletons
she,gulped
so,he,had,noticed,how,the,men,had,swarmed,about,her
how,unutterably,dear,he,was,standing,there,with,his,eyes,twinkling,all,unaware,of,her,excitement
she,could,not,speak,but,she,put,out,a,hand,and,drew,him,into,the,room
he,entered,puzzled,but,interested
there,was,a,tenseness,about,her,a,glow,in,her,eyes,that,he,had,never,seen,before,and,even,in,the,dim,light,he,could,see,the,rosy,flush,on,her,cheeks
automatically,he,closed,the,door,behind,him,and,took,her,hand
what,is,it
he,said,almost,in,a,whisper
at,the,touch,of,his,hand,she,began,to,tremble
it,was,going,to,happen,now,just,as,she,had,dreamed,it
a,thousand,incoherent,thoughts,shot,through,her,mind,and,she,could,not,catch,a,single,one,to,mold,into,a,word
she,could,only,shake,and,look,up,into,his,face
why,didn't,he,speak
what,is,it
he,repeated
a,secret,to,tell,me
suddenly,she,found,her,tongue,and,just,as,suddenly,all,the,years,of,ellen's,teachings,fell,away,and,the,forthright,irish,blood,of,gerald,spoke,from,his,daughter's,lips
yes,a,secret
i,love,you
for,an,instance,there,was,a,silence,so,acute,it,seemed,that,neither,of,them,even,breathed
then,the,trembling,fell,away,from,her,as,happiness,and,pride,surged,through,her
why,hadn't,she,done,this,before
how,much,simpler,than,all,the,ladylike,maneuverings,she,had,been,taught
and,then,her,eyes,sought,his
there,was,a,look,of,consternation,in,them,of,incredulity,and,something,more,what,was,it
yes,gerald,had,looked,that,way,the,day,his,pet,hunter,had,broken,his,leg,and,he,had,had,to,shoot,him
why,did,she,have,to,think,of,that,now
such,a,silly,thought
and,why,did,ashley,look,so,oddly,and,say,nothing
then,something,like,a,well-trained,mask,came,down,over,his,face,and,he,smiled,gallantly
isn't,it,enough,that,you've,collected,every,other,man's,heart,here,today
he,said,with,the,old,teasing,caressing,note,in,his,voice
do,you,want,to,make,it,unanimous
well,you've,always,had,my,heart,you,know
you,cut,your,teeth,on,it
something,was,wrong,all,wrong
this,was,not,the,way,she,had,planned,it
through,the,mad,tearing,of,ideas,round,and,round,in,her,brain,one,was,beginning,to,take,form
somehow,for,some,reason,ashley,was,acting,as,if,he,thought,she,was,just,flirting,with,him
but,he,knew,differently
she,knew,he,did
ashley,ashley,tell,me,you,must,oh,don't,tease,me,now
have,i,your,heart
oh,my,dear,i,lo
his,hand,went,across,her,lips,swiftly
the,mask,was,gone
you,must,not,say,these,things,scarlett
you,mustn't
you,don't,mean,them
you'll,hate,yourself,for,saying,them,and,you'll,hate,me,for,hearing,them
she,jerked,her,head,away
a,hot,swift,current,was,running,through,her
i,couldn't,ever,hate,you
i,tell,you,i,love,you,and,i,know,you,must,care,about,me,because,she,stopped
never,before,had,she,seen,so,much,misery,in,anyone's,face
ashley,do,you,care,you,do,don't,you
yes,he,said,dully
i,care
if,he,had,said,he,loathed,her,she,could,not,have,been,more,frightened
she,plucked,at,his,sleeve,speechless
scarlett,he,said,can't,we,go,away,and,forget,that,we,have,ever,said,these,things
no,she,whispered
i,can't
what,do,you,mean
don't,you,want,to,to,marry,me
he,replied,i'm,going,to,marry,melanie
somehow,she,found,that,she,was,sitting,on,the,low,velvet,chair,and,ashley,on,the,hassock,at,her,feet,was,holding,both,her,hands,in,his,in,a,hard,grip
he,was,saying,things,things,that,made,no,sense
her,mind,was,quite,blank,quite,empty,of,all,the,thoughts,that,had,surged,through,it,only,a,moment,before,and,his,words,made,no,more,impression,than,rain,on,glass
they,fell,on,unhearing,ears,words,that,were,swift,and,tender,and,full,of,pity,like,a,father,speaking,to,a,hurt,child
the,sound,of,melanie's,name,caught,in,her,consciousness,and,she,looked,into,his,crystal-gray,eyes
she,saw,in,them,the,old,remoteness,that,had,always,baffled,her,and,a,look,of,self-hatred
father,is,to,announce,the,engagement,tonight
we,are,to,be,married,soon
i,should,have,told,you,but,i,thought,you,knew
i,thought,everyone,knew,had,known,for,years
i,never,dreamed,that,you,you've,so,many,beaux
i,thought,stuart
life,and,feeling,and,comprehension,were,beginning,to,flow,back,into,her
but,you,just,said,you,cared,for,me
his,warm,hands,hurt,hers
my,dear,must,you,make,me,say,things,that,will,hurt,you
her,silence,pressed,him,on
how,can,i,make,you,see,these,things,my,dear
you,who,are,so,young,and,unthinking,that,you,do,not,know,what,marriage,means
i,know,i,love,you
love,isn't,enough,to,make,a,successful,marriage,when,two,people,are,as,different,as,we,are
you,would,want,all,of,a,man,scarlett,his,body,his,heart,his,soul,his,thoughts
and,if,you,did,not,have,them,you,would,be,miserable
and,i,couldn't,give,you,all,of,me
i,couldn't,give,all,of,me,to,anyone
and,i,would,not,want,all,of,your,mind,and,your,soul
and,you,would,be,hurt,and,then,you,would,come,to,hate,me,how,bitterly
you,would,hate,the,books,i,read,and,the,music,i,loved,because,they,took,me,away,from,you,even,for,a,moment
and,i,perhaps,i
do,you,love,her
she,is,like,me,part,of,my,blood,and,we,understand,each,other
scarlett
scarlett
can't,i,make,you,see,that,a,marriage,can't,go,on,in,any,sort,of,peace,unless,the,two,people,are,alike
some,one,else,had,said,that,like,must,marry,like,or,there'll,be,no,happiness
who,was,it
it,seemed,a,million,years,since,she,had,heard,that,but,it,still,did,not,make,sense
but,you,said,you,cared
i,shouldn't,have,said,it
somewhere,in,her,brain,a,slow,fire,rose,and,rage,began,to,blot,out,everything,else
well,having,been,cad,enough,to,say,it
his,face,went,white
i,was,a,cad,to,say,it,as,i'm,going,to,marry,melanie
i,did,you,a,wrong,and,melanie,a,greater,one
i,should,not,have,said,it,for,i,knew,you,wouldn't,understand
how,could,i,help,caring,for,you,you,who,have,all,the,passion,for,life,that,i,have,not
you,who,can,love,and,hate,with,a,violence,impossible,to,me
why,you,are,as,elemental,as,fire,and,wind,and,wild,things,and,i
she,thought,of,melanie,and,saw,suddenly,her,quiet,brown,eyes,with,their,far-off,look,her,placid,little,hands,in,their,black,lace,mitts,her,gentle,silences
and,then,her,rage,broke,the,same,rage,that,drove,gerald,to,murder,and,other,irish,ancestors,to,misdeeds,that,cost,them,their,necks
there,was,nothing,in,her,now,of,the,well-bred,robillards,who,could,bear,with,white,silence,anything,the,world,might,cast
why,don't,you,say,it,you,coward
you're,afraid,to,marry,me
you'd,rather,live,with,that,stupid,little,fool,who,can't,open,her,mouth,except,to,say,'yes',or,'no',and,raise,a,passel,of,mealy-,mouthed,brats,just,like,her
why
you,must,not,say,these,things,about,melanie
'i,mustn't',be,damned,to,you
who,are,you,to,tell,me,i,mustn't
you,coward,you,cad,you,you,made,me,believe,you,were,going,to,marry,me
be,fair,his,voice,pleaded
did,i,ever
she,did,not,want,to,be,fair,although,she,knew,what,he,said,was,true
he,had,never,once,crossed,the,borders,of,friendliness,with,her,and,when,she,thought,of,this,fresh,anger,rose,the,anger,of,hurt,pride,and,feminine,vanity
she,had,run,after,him,and,he,would,have,none,of,her
he,preferred,a,whey-faced,little,fool,like,melanie,to,her
oh,far,better,that,she,had,followed,ellen,and,mammy's,precepts,and,never,never,revealed,that,she,even,liked,him,better,anything,than,to,be,faced,with,this,scorching,shame
she,sprang,to,her,feet,her,hands,clenched,and,he,rose,towering,over,her,his,face,full,of,the,mute,misery,of,one,forced,to,face,realities,when,realities,are,agonies
i,shall,hate,you,till,i,die,you,cad,you,lowdown,lowdown,what,was,the,word,she,wanted
she,could,not,think,of,any,word,bad,enough
scarlett,please
he,put,out,his,hand,toward,her,and,as,he,did,she,slapped,him,across,the,face,with,all,the,strength,she,had
the,noise,cracked,like,a,whip,in,the,still,room,and,suddenly,her,rage,was,gone,and,there,was,desolation,in,her,heart
the,red,mark,of,her,hand,showed,plainly,on,his,white,tired,face
he,said,nothing,but,lifted,her,limp,hand,to,his,lips,and,kissed,it
then,he,was,gone,before,she,could,speak,again,closing,the,door,softly,behind,him
she,sat,down,again,very,suddenly,the,reaction,from,her,rage,making,her,knees,feel,weak
he,was,gone,and,the,memory,of,his,stricken,face,would,haunt,her,till,she,died
she,heard,the,soft,muffled,sound,of,his,footsteps,dying,away,down,the,long,hall,and,the,complete,enormity,of,her,actions,came,over,her
she,had,lost,him,forever
now,he,would,hate,her,and,every,time,he,looked,at,her,he,would,remember,how,she,threw,herself,at,him,when,he,had,given,her,no,encouragement,at,all
i'm,as,bad,as,honey,wilkes,she,thought,suddenly,and,remembered,how,everyone,and,she,more,than,anyone,else,had,laughed,contemptuously,at,honey's,forward,conduct
she,saw,honey's,awkward,wigglings,and,heard,her,silly,titters,as,she,hung,onto,boys',arms,and,the,thought,stung,her,to,new,rage,rage,at,herself,at,ashley,at,the,world
because,she,hated,herself,she,hated,them,all,with,the,fury,of,the,thwarted,and,humiliated,love,of,sixteen
only,a,little,true,tenderness,had,been,mixed,into,her,love
mostly,it,had,been,compounded,out,of,vanity,and,complacent,confidence,in,her,own,charms
now,she,had,lost,and,greater,than,her,sense,of,loss,was,the,fear,that,she,had,made,a,public,spectacle,of,herself
had,she,been,as,obvious,as,honey
was,everyone,laughing,at,her
she,began,to,shake,at,the,thought
her,hand,dropped,to,a,little,table,beside,her,fingering,a,tiny,china,rose-bowl,on,which,two,china,cherubs,smirked
the,room,was,so,still,she,almost,screamed,to,break,the,silence
she,must,do,something,or,go,mad
she,picked,up,the,bowl,and,hurled,it,viciously,across,the,room,toward,the,fireplace
it,barely,cleared,the,tall,back,of,the,sofa,and,splintered,with,a,little,crash,against,the,marble,mantelpiece
this,said,a,voice,from,the,depths,of,the,sofa,is,too,much
nothing,had,ever,startled,or,frightened,her,so,much,and,her,mouth,went,too,dry,for,her,to,utter,a,sound
she,caught,hold,of,the,back,of,the,chair,her,knees,going,weak,under,her,as,rhett,butler,rose,from,the,sofa,where,he,had,been,lying,and,made,her,a,bow,of,exaggerated,politeness
it,is,bad,enough,to,have,an,afternoon,nap,disturbed,by,such,a,passage,as,i've,been,forced,to,hear,but,why,should,my,life,be,endangered
he,was,real
he,wasn't,a,ghost
but,saints,preserve,us,he,had,heard,everything
she,rallied,her,forces,into,a,semblance,of,dignity
sir,you,should,have,made,known,your,presence
indeed
his,white,teeth,gleamed,and,his,bold,dark,eyes,laughed,at,her
but,you,were,the,intruder
i,was,forced,to,wait,for,mr,kennedy,and,feeling,that,i,was,perhaps,persona,non,grata,in,the,back,yard,i,was,thoughtful,enough,to,remove,my,unwelcome,presence,here,where,i,thought,i,would,be,undisturbed
but,alas
he,shrugged,and,laughed,softly
her,temper,was,beginning,to,rise,again,at,the,thought,that,this,rude,and,impertinent,man,had,heard,everything,heard,things,she,now,wished,she,had,died,before,she,ever,uttered
eavesdroppers,she,began,furiously
eavesdroppers,often,hear,highly,entertaining,and,instructive,things,he,grinned
from,a,long,experience,in,eavesdropping,i
sir,she,said,you,are,no,gentleman
an,apt,observation,he,answered,airily
and,you,miss,are,no,lady
he,seemed,to,find,her,very,amusing,for,he,laughed,softly,again
no,one,can,remain,a,lady,after,saying,and,doing,what,i,have,just,overheard
however,ladies,have,seldom,held,any,charms,for,me
i,know,what,they,are,thinking,but,they,never,have,the,courage,or,lack,of,breeding,to,say,what,they,think
and,that,in,time,becomes,a,bore
but,you,my,dear,miss,o'hara,are,a,girl,of,rare,spirit,very,admirable,spirit,and,i,take,off,my,hat,to,you
i,fail,to,understand,what,charms,the,elegant,mr,wilkes,can,hold,for,a,girl,of,your,tempestuous,nature
he,should,thank,god,on,bended,knee,for,a,girl,with,your,how,did,he,put,it,'passion,for,living,',but,being,a,poor-spirited,wretch
you,aren't,fit,to,wipe,his,boots
she,shouted,in,rage
and,you,were,going,to,hate,him,all,your,life
he,sank,down,on,the,sofa,and,she,heard,him,laughing
if,she,could,have,killed,him,she,would,have,done,it
instead,she,walked,out,of,the,room,with,such,dignity,as,she,could,summon,and,banged,the,heavy,door,behind,her
she,went,up,the,stairs,so,swiftly,that,when,she,reached,the,landing,she,thought,she,was,going,to,faint
she,stopped,clutching,the,banisters,her,heart,hammering,so,hard,from,anger,insult,and,exertion,that,it,seemed,about,to,burst,through,her,basque
she,tried,to,draw,deep,breaths,but,mammy's,lacings,were,too,tight
if,she,should,faint,and,they,should,find,her,here,on,the,landing,what,would,they,think
oh,they'd,think,everything
ashley,and,that,vile,butler,man,and,those,nasty,girls,who,were,so,jealous
for,once,in,her,life,she,wished,that,she,carried,smelling,salts,like,the,other,girls,but,she,had,never,even,owned,a,vinaigrette
she,had,always,been,so,proud,of,never,feeling,giddy
she,simply,could,not,let,herself,faint,now
gradually,the,sickening,feeling,began,to,depart
in,a,minute,she'd,feel,all,right,and,then,she'd,slip,quietly,into,the,little,dressing,room,adjoining,india's,room,unloose,her,stays,and,creep,in,and,lay,herself,on,one,of,the,beds,beside,the,sleeping,girls
she,tried,to,quiet,her,heart,and,fix,her,face,into,more,composed,lines,for,she,knew,she,must,look,like,a,crazy,woman
if,any,of,the,girls,were,awake,they'd,know,something,was,wrong
and,no,one,must,ever,ever,know,that,anything,had,happened
through,the,wide,bay,window,on,the,lawn,she,could,see,the,men,still,lounging,in,their,chairs,under,the,trees,and,in,the,shade,of,the,arbor
how,she,envied,them
how,wonderful,to,be,a,man,and,never,have,to,undergo,miseries,such,as,she,had,just,passed,through
as,she,stood,watching,them,hot,eyed,and,dizzy,she,heard,the,rapid,pounding,of,a,horse's,hooves,on,the,front,drive,the,scattering,of,gravel,and,the,sound,of,an,excited,voice,calling,a,question,to,one,of,the,negroes
the,gravel,flew,again,and,across,her,vision,a,man,on,horseback,galloped,over,the,green,lawn,toward,the,lazy,group,under,the,trees
some,late-come,guest,but,why,did,he,ride,his,horse,across,the,turf,that,was,india's,pride
she,could,not,recognize,him,but,as,he,flung,himself,from,the,saddle,and,clutched,john,wilkes',arm,she,could,see,that,there,was,excitement,in,every,line,of,him
the,crowd,swarmed,about,him,tall,glasses,and,palmetto,fans,abandoned,on,tables,and,on,the,ground
in,spite,of,the,distance,she,could,hear,the,hubbub,of,voices,questioning,calling,feel,the,fever-,pitch,tenseness,of,the,men
then,above,the,confused,sounds,stuart,tarleton's,voice,rose,in,an,exultant,shout,yee-aay-ee
as,if,he,were,on,the,hunting,field
and,she,heard,for,the,first,time,without,knowing,it,the,rebel,yell
as,she,watched,the,four,tarletons,followed,by,the,fontaine,boys,broke,from,the,group,and,began,hurrying,toward,the,stable,yelling,as,they,ran,jeems
you,jeems
saddle,the,horses
somebody's,house,must,have,caught,fire,scarlett,thought
but,fire,or,no,fire,her,job,was,to,get,herself,back,into,the,bedroom,before,she,was,discovered
her,heart,was,quieter,now,and,she,tiptoed,up,the,steps,into,the,silent,hall
a,heavy,warm,somnolence,lay,over,the,house,as,if,it,slept,at,ease,like,the,girls,until,night,when,it,would,burst,into,its,full,beauty,with,music,and,candle,flames
carefully,she,eased,open,the,door,of,the,dressing,room,and,slipped,in
her,hand,was,behind,her,still,holding,the,knob,when,honey,wilkes',voice,low,pitched,almost,in,a,whisper,came,to,her,through,the,crack,of,the,opposite,door,leading,into,the,bedroom
i,think,scarlett,acted,as,fast,as,a,girl,could,act,today
scarlett,felt,her,heart,begin,its,mad,racing,again,and,she,clutched,her,hand,against,it,unconsciously,as,if,she,would,squeeze,it,into,submission
eavesdroppers,often,hear,highly,instructive,things,jibed,a,memory
should,she,slip,out,again
or,make,herself,known,and,embarrass,honey,as,she,deserved
but,the,next,voice,made,her,pause
a,team,of,mules,could,not,have,dragged,her,away,when,she,heard,melanie's,voice
oh,honey,no
don't,be,unkind
she's,just,high,spirited,and,vivacious
i,thought,her,most,charming
oh,thought,scarlett,clawing,her,nails,into,her,basque
to,have,that,mealymouthed,little,mess,take,up,for,me
it,was,harder,to,bear,than,honey's,out-and-out,cattiness
scarlett,had,never,trusted,any,woman,and,had,never,credited,any,woman,except,her,mother,with,motives,other,than,selfish,ones
melanie,knew,she,had,ashley,securely,so,she,could,well,afford,to,show,such,a,christian,spirit
scarlett,felt,it,was,just,melanie's,way,of,parading,her,conquest,and,getting,credit,for,being,sweet,at,the,same,time
scarlett,had,frequently,used,the,same,trick,herself,when,discussing,other,girls,with,men,and,it,had,never,failed,to,convince,foolish,males,of,her,sweetness,and,unselfishness
well,miss,said,honey,tartly,her,voice,rising,you,must,be,blind
hush,honey,hissed,the,voice,of,sally,munroe
they'll,hear,you,all,over,the,house
honey,lowered,her,voice,but,went,on
well,you,saw,how,she,was,carrying,on,with,every,man,she,could,get,hold,of,even,mr,kennedy,and,he's,her,own,sister's,beau
i,never,saw,the,like
and,she,certainly,was,going,after,charles
honey,giggled,self-consciously
and,you,know,charles,and,i
are,you,really
whispered,voices,excitedly
well,don't,tell,anybody,girls,not,yet
there,were,more,gigglings,and,the,bed,springs,creaked,as,someone,squeezed,honey
melanie,murmured,something,about,how,happy,she,was,that,honey,would,be,her,sister
well,i,won't,be,happy,to,have,scarlett,for,my,sister,because,she's,a,fast,piece,if,ever,i,saw,one,came,the,aggrieved,voice,of,hefty,tarleton
but,she's,as,good,as,engaged,to,stuart
brent,says,she,doesn't,give,a,rap,about,him,but,of,course,brent's,crazy,about,her,too
if,you,should,ask,me,said,honey,with,mysterious,importance,there's,only,one,person,she,does,give,a,rap,about
and,that's,ashley
as,the,whisperings,merged,together,violently,questioning,interrupting,scarlett,felt,herself,go,cold,with,fear,and,humiliation
honey,was,a,fool,a,silly,a,simpleton,about,men,but,she,had,a,feminine,instinct,about,other,women,that,scarlett,had,underestimated
the,mortification,and,hurt,pride,that,she,had,suffered,in,the,library,with,ashley,and,with,rhett,butler,were,pin,pricks,to,this
men,could,be,trusted,to,keep,their,mouths,shut,even,men,like,mr,butler,but,with,honey,wilkes,giving,tongue,like,a,hound,in,the,field,the,entire,county,would,know,about,it,before,six,o'clock
and,gerald,had,said,only,last,night,that,he,wouldn't,be,having,the,county,laughing,at,his,daughter
and,how,they,would,all,laugh,now
clammy,perspiration,starting,under,her,armpits,began,to,creep,down,her,ribs
melanie's,voice,measured,and,peaceful,a,little,reproving,rose,above,the,others
honey,you,know,that,isn't,so
and,it's,so,unkind
it,is,too,melly,and,if,you,weren't,always,so,busy,looking,for,the,good,in,people,that,haven't,got,any,good,in,them,you'd,see,it
and,i'm,glad,it's,so
it,serves,her,right
all,scarlett,o'hara,has,ever,done,has,been,to,stir,up,trouble,and,try,to,get,other,girls',beaux
you,know,mighty,well,she,took,stuart,from,india,and,she,didn't,want,him
and,today,she,tried,to,take,mr,kennedy,and,ashley,and,charles
i,must,get,home
thought,scarlett
i,must,get,home
if,she,could,only,be,transferred,by,magic,to,tara,and,to,safety
if,she,could,only,be,with,ellen,just,to,see,her,to,hold,onto,her,skirt,to,cry,and,pour,out,the,whole,story,in,her,lap
if,she,had,to,listen,to,another,word,she'd,rush,in,and,pull,out,honey's,straggly,pale,hair,in,big,handfuls,and,spit,on,melanie,hamilton,to,show,her,just,what,she,thought,of,her,charity
but,she'd,already,acted,common,enough,today,enough,like,white,trash,that,was,where,all,her,trouble,lay
she,pressed,her,hands,hard,against,her,skirts,so,they,would,not,rustle,and,backed,out,as,stealthily,as,an,animal
home,she,thought,as,she,sped,down,the,hall,past,the,closed,doors,and,still,rooms,i,must,go,home
she,was,already,on,the,front,porch,when,a,new,thought,brought,her,up,sharply,she,couldn't,go,home
she,couldn't,run,away
she,would,have,to,see,it,through,bear,all,the,malice,of,the,girls,and,her,own,humiliation,and,heartbreak
to,run,away,would,only,give,them,more,ammunition
she,pounded,her,clenched,fist,against,the,tall,white,pillar,beside,her,and,she,wished,that,she,were,samson,so,that,she,could,pull,down,all,of,twelve,oaks,and,destroy,every,person,in,it
she'd,make,them,sorry
she'd,show,them
she,didn't,quite,see,how,she'd,show,them,but,she'd,do,it,all,the,same
she'd,hurt,them,worse,than,they,hurt,her
for,the,moment,ashley,as,ashley,was,forgotten
he,was,not,the,tall,drowsy,boy,she,loved,but,part,and,parcel,of,the,wilkeses,twelve,oaks,the,county,and,she,hated,them,all,because,they,laughed
vanity,was,stronger,than,love,at,sixteen,and,there,was,no,room,in,her,hot,heart,now,for,anything,but,hate
i,won't,go,home,she,thought
i'll,stay,here,and,i'll,make,them,sorry
and,i'll,never,tell,mother
no,i'll,never,tell,anybody
she,braced,herself,to,go,back,into,the,house,to,reclimb,the,stairs,and,go,into,another,bedroom
as,she,turned,she,saw,charles,coming,into,the,house,from,the,other,end,of,the,long,hall
when,he,saw,her,he,hurried,toward,her
his,hair,was,tousled,and,his,face,near,geranium,with,excitement
do,you,know,what's,happened
he,cried,even,before,he,reached,her
have,you,heard
paul,wilson,just,rode,over,from,jonesboro,with,the,news
he,paused,breathless,as,he,came,up,to,her
she,said,nothing,and,only,stared,at,him
mr,lincoln,has,called,for,men,soldiers,i,mean,volunteers,seventy-five,thousand,of,them
mr,lincoln,again
didn't,men,ever,think,about,anything,that,really,mattered
here,was,this,fool,expecting,her,to,be,excited,about,mr,lincoln's,didoes,when,her,heart,was,broken,and,her,reputation,as,good,as,ruined
charles,stared,at,her
her,face,was,paper,white,and,her,narrow,eyes,blazing,like,emeralds
he,had,never,seen,such,fire,in,any,girl's,face,such,a,glow,in,anyone's,eyes
i'm,so,clumsy,he,said
i,should,have,told,you,more,gently
i,forgot,how,delicate,ladies,are
i'm,sorry,i've,upset,you,so
you,don't,feel,faint,do,you
can,i,get,you,a,glass,of,water
no,she,said,and,managed,a,crooked,smile
shall,we,go,sit,on,the,bench
he,asked,taking,her,arm
she,nodded,and,he,carefully,handed,her,down,the,front,steps,and,led,her,across,the,grass,to,the,iron,bench,beneath,the,largest,oak,in,the,front,yard
how,fragile,and,tender,women,are,he,thought,the,mere,mention,of,war,and,harshness,makes,them,faint
the,idea,made,him,feel,very,masculine,and,he,was,doubly,gentle,as,he,seated,her
she,looked,so,strangely,and,there,was,a,wild,beauty,about,her,white,face,that,set,his,heart,leaping
could,it,be,that,she,was,distressed,by,the,thought,that,he,might,go,to,the,war
no,that,was,too,conceited,for,belief
but,why,did,she,look,at,him,so,oddly
and,why,did,her,hands,shake,as,they,fingered,her,lace,handkerchief
and,her,thick,sooty,lashes,they,were,fluttering,just,like,the,eyes,of,girls,in,romances,he,had,read,fluttering,with,timidity,and,love
he,cleared,his,throat,three,times,to,speak,and,failed,each,time
he,dropped,his,eyes,because,her,own,green,ones,met,his,so,piercingly,almost,as,if,she,were,not,seeing,him
he,has,a,lot,of,money,she,was,thinking,swiftly,as,a,thought,and,a,plan,went,through,her,brain
and,he,hasn't,any,parents,to,bother,me,and,he,lives,in,atlanta
and,if,i,married,him,right,away,it,would,show,ashley,that,i,didn't,care,a,rap,that,i,was,only,flirting,with,him
and,it,would,just,kill,honey
she'd,never,never,catch,another,beau,and,everybody'd,laugh,fit,to,die,at,her
and,it,would,hurt,melanie,because,she,loves,charles,so,much
and,it,would,hurt,stu,and,brent,she,didn't,quite,know,why,she,wanted,to,hurt,them,except,that,they,had,catty,sisters
and,they'd,all,be,sorry,when,i,came,back,here,to,visit,in,a,fine,carriage,and,with,lots,of,pretty,clothes,and,a,house,of,my,own
and,they,would,never,never,laugh,at,me
of,course,it,will,mean,fighting,said,charles,after,several,more,embarrassed,attempts
but,don't,you,fret,miss,scarlett,it'll,be,over,in,a,month,and,we'll,have,them,howling
yes,sir
howling
i,wouldn't,miss,it,for,anything
i'm,afraid,there,won't,be,much,of,a,ball,tonight,because,the,troop,is,going,to,meet,at,jonesboro
the,tarleton,boys,have,gone,to,spread,the,news
i,know,the,ladies,will,be,sorry
she,said,oh,for,want,of,anything,better,but,it,sufficed
coolness,was,beginning,to,come,back,to,her,and,her,mind,was,collecting,itself
a,frost,lay,over,all,her,emotions,and,she,thought,that,she,would,never,feel,anything,warmly,again
why,not,take,this,pretty,flushed,boy
he,was,as,good,as,anyone,else,and,she,didn't,care
no,she,could,never,care,about,anything,again,not,if,she,lived,to,be,ninety
i,can't,decide,now,whether,to,go,with,mr,wade,hampton's,south,carolina,legion,or,with,the,atlanta,gate,city,guard
she,said,oh,again,and,their,eyes,met,and,the,fluttering,lashes,were,his,undoing
will,you,wait,for,me,miss,scarlett
it,it,would,be,heaven,just,knowing,that,you,were,waiting,for,me,until,after,we,licked,them
he,hung,breathless,on,her,words,watching,the,way,her,lips,curled,up,at,the,corners,noting,for,the,first,time,the,shadows,about,these,corners,and,thinking,what,it,would,mean,to,kiss,them
her,hand,with,palm,clammy,with,perspiration,slid,into,his
i,wouldn't,want,to,wait,she,said,and,her,eyes,were,veiled
he,sat,clutching,her,hand,his,mouth,wide,open
watching,him,from,under,her,lashes,scarlett,thought,detachedly,that,he,looked,like,a,gigged,frog
he,stuttered,several,times,closed,his,mouth,and,opened,it,again,and,again,became,geranium,colored
can,you,possibly,love,me
she,said,nothing,but,looked,down,into,her,lap,and,charles,was,thrown,into,new,states,of,ecstasy,and,embarrassment
perhaps,a,man,should,not,ask,a,girl,such,a,question
perhaps,it,would,be,unmaidenly,for,her,to,answer,it
having,never,possessed,the,courage,to,get,himself,into,such,a,situation,before,charles,was,at,a,loss,as,to,how,to,act
he,wanted,to,shout,and,to,sing,and,to,kiss,her,and,to,caper,about,the,lawn,and,then,run,tell,everyone,black,and,white,that,she,loved,him
but,he,only,squeezed,her,hand,until,he,drove,her,rings,into,the,flesh
you,will,marry,me,soon,miss,scarlett
um,she,said,fingering,a,fold,of,her,dress
shall,we,make,it,a,double,wedding,with,mel
no,she,said,quickly,her,eyes,glinting,up,at,him,ominously
charles,knew,again,that,he,had,made,an,error
of,course,a,girl,wanted,her,own,wedding,not,shared,glory
how,kind,she,was,to,overlook,his,blunderings
if,it,were,only,dark,and,he,had,the,courage,of,shadows,and,could,kiss,her,hand,and,say,the,things,he,longed,to,say
when,may,i,speak,to,your,father
the,sooner,the,better,she,said,hoping,that,perhaps,he,would,release,the,crushing,pressure,on,her,rings,before,she,had,to,ask,him,to,do,it
he,leaped,up,and,for,a,moment,she,thought,he,was,going,to,cut,a,caper,before,dignity,claimed,him
he,looked,down,at,her,radiantly,his,whole,clean,simple,heart,in,his,eyes
she,had,never,had,anyone,look,at,her,thus,before,and,would,never,have,it,from,any,other,man,but,in,her,queer,detachment,she,only,thought,that,he,looked,like,a,calf
i'll,go,now,and,find,your,father,he,said,smiling,all,over,his,face
i,can't,wait
will,you,excuse,me,dear
the,endearment,came,hard,but,having,said,it,once,he,repeated,it,again,with,pleasure
yes,she,said
i'll,wait,here
it's,so,cool,and,nice,here
he,went,off,across,the,lawn,and,disappeared,around,the,house,and,she,was,alone,under,the,rustling,oak
from,the,stables,men,were,streaming,out,on,horseback,negro,servants,riding,hard,behind,their,masters
the,munroe,boys,tore,past,waving,their,hats,and,the,fontaines,and,calverts,went,down,the,road,yelling
the,four,tarletons,charged,across,the,lawn,by,her,and,brent,shouted,mother's,going,to,give,us,the,horses
yee-aay-ee
turf,flew,and,they,were,gone,leaving,her,alone,again
the,white,house,reared,its,tall,columns,before,her,seeming,to,withdraw,with,dignified,aloofness,from,her
it,would,never,be,her,house,now
ashley,would,never,carry,her,over,the,threshold,as,his,bride
oh,ashley,ashley
what,have,i,done
deep,in,her,under,layers,of,hurt,pride,and,cold,practicality,something,stirred,hurtingly
an,adult,emotion,was,being,born,stronger,than,her,vanity,or,her,willful,selfishness
she,loved,ashley,and,she,knew,she,loved,him,and,she,had,never,cared,so,much,as,in,that,instant,when,she,saw,charles,disappearing,around,the,curved,graveled,walk
chapter,vii
within,two,weeks,scarlett,had,become,a,wife,and,within,two,months,more,she,was,a,widow
she,was,soon,released,from,the,bonds,she,had,assumed,with,so,much,haste,and,so,little,thought,but,she,was,never,again,to,know,the,careless,freedom,of,her,unmarried,days
widowhood,had,crowded,closely,on,the,heels,of,marriage,but,to,her,dismay,motherhood,soon,followed
in,after,years,when,she,thought,of,those,last,days,of,april,1861,scarlett,could,never,quite,remember,details
time,and,events,were,telescoped,jumbled,together,like,a,nightmare,that,had,no,reality,or,reason
till,the,day,she,died,there,would,be,blank,spots,in,her,memories,of,those,days
especially,vague,were,her,recollections,of,the,time,between,her,acceptance,of,charles,and,her,wedding
two,weeks
so,short,an,engagement,would,have,been,impossible,in,times,of,peace
then,there,would,have,been,a,decorous,interval,of,a,year,or,at,least,six,months
but,the,south,was,aflame,with,war,events,roared,along,as,swiftly,as,if,carried,by,a,mighty,wind,and,the,slow,tempo,of,the,old,days,was,gone
ellen,had,wrung,her,hands,and,counseled,delay,in,order,that,scarlett,might,think,the,matter,over,at,greater,length
but,to,her,pleadings,scarlett,turned,a,sullen,face,and,a,deaf,ear
marry,she,would
and,quickly,too
within,two,weeks
learning,that,ashley's,wedding,had,been,moved,up,from,the,autumn,to,the,first,of,may,so,he,could,leave,with,the,troop,as,soon,as,it,was,called,into,service,scarlett,set,the,date,of,her,wedding,for,the,day,before,his
ellen,protested,but,charles,pleaded,with,new-found,eloquence,for,he,was,impatient,to,be,off,to,south,carolina,to,join,wade,hampton's,legion,and,gerald,sided,with,the,two,young,people
he,was,excited,by,the,war,fever,and,pleased,that,scarlett,had,made,so,good,a,match,and,who,was,he,to,stand,in,the,way,of,young,love,when,there,was,a,war
ellen,distracted,finally,gave,in,as,other,mothers,throughout,the,south,were,doing
their,leisured,world,had,been,turned,topsy-turvy,and,their,pleadings,prayers,and,advice,availed,nothing,against,the,powerful,forces,sweeping,them,along
the,south,was,intoxicated,with,enthusiasm,and,excitement
everyone,knew,that,one,battle,would,end,the,war,and,every,young,man,hastened,to,enlist,before,the,war,should,end,hastened,to,marry,his,sweetheart,before,he,rushed,off,to,virginia,to,strike,a,blow,at,the,yankees
there,were,dozens,of,war,weddings,in,the,county,and,there,was,little,time,for,the,sorrow,of,parting,for,everyone,was,too,busy,and,excited,for,either,solemn,thoughts,or,tears
the,ladies,were,making,uniforms,knitting,socks,and,rolling,bandages,and,the,men,were,drilling,and,shooting
train,loads,of,troops,passed,through,jonesboro,daily,on,their,way,north,to,atlanta,and,virginia
some,detachments,were,gaily,uniformed,in,the,scarlets,and,light,blues,and,greens,of,select,social-militia,companies,some,small,groups,were,in,homespun,and,coonskin,caps,others,ununiformed,were,in,broadcloth,and,fine,linen,all,were,half-drilled,half-armed,wild,with,excitement,and,shouting,as,though,en,route,to,a,picnic
the,sight,of,these,men,threw,the,county,boys,into,a,panic,for,fear,the,war,would,be,over,before,they,could,reach,virginia,and,preparations,for,the,troop's,departure,were,speeded
in,the,midst,of,this,turmoil,preparations,went,forward,for,scarlett's,wedding,and,almost,before,she,knew,it,she,was,clad,in,ellen's,wedding,dress,and,veil,coming,down,the,wide,stairs,of,tara,on,her,father's,arm,to,face,a,house,packed,full,with,guests
afterward,she,remembered,as,from,a,dream,the,hundreds,of,candles,flaring,on,the,walls,her,mother's,face,loving,a,little,bewildered,her,lips,moving,in,a,silent,prayer,for,her,daughter's,happiness,gerald,flushed,with,brandy,and,pride,that,his,daughter,was,marrying,both,money,a,fine,name,and,an,old,one,and,ashley,standing,at,the,bottom,of,the,steps,with,melanie's,arm,through,his
when,she,saw,the,look,on,his,face,she,thought,this,can't,be,real
it,can't,be
it's,a,nightmare
i'll,wake,up,and,find,it's,all,been,a,nightmare
i,mustn't,think,of,it,now,or,i'll,begin,screaming,in,front,of,all,these,people
i,can't,think,now
i'll,think,later,when,i,can,stand,it,when,i,can't,see,his,eyes
it,was,all,very,dreamlike,the,passage,through,the,aisle,of,smiling,people,charles',scarlet,face,and,stammering,voice,and,her,own,replies,so,startlingly,clear,so,cold
and,the,congratulations,afterward,and,the,kissing,and,the,toasts,and,the,dancing,all,all,like,a,dream
even,the,feel,of,ashley's,kiss,upon,her,cheek,even,melanie's,soft,whisper,now,we're,really,and,truly,sisters,were,unreal
even,the,excitement,caused,by,the,swooning,spell,that,overtook,charles',plump,emotional,aunt,miss,pittypat,hamilton,had,the,quality,of,a,nightmare
but,when,the,dancing,and,toasting,were,finally,ended,and,the,dawn,was,coming,when,all,the,atlanta,guests,who,could,be,crowded,into,tara,and,the,overseer's,house,had,gone,to,sleep,on,beds,sofas,and,pallets,on,the,floor,and,all,the,neighbors,had,gone,home,to,rest,in,preparation,for,the,wedding,at,twelve,oaks,the,next,day,then,the,dreamlike,trance,shattered,like,crystal,before,reality
the,reality,was,the,blushing,charles,emerging,from,her,dressing,room,in,his,nightshirt,avoiding,the,startled,look,she,gave,him,over,the,high-pulled,sheet
of,course,she,knew,that,married,people,occupied,the,same,bed,but,she,had,never,given,the,matter,a,thought,before
it,seemed,very,natural,in,the,case,of,her,mother,and,father,but,she,had,never,applied,it,to,herself
now,for,the,first,time,since,the,barbecue,she,realized,just,what,she,had,brought,on,herself
the,thought,of,this,strange,boy,whom,she,hadn't,really,wanted,to,marry,getting,into,bed,with,her,when,her,heart,was,breaking,with,an,agony,of,regret,at,her,hasty,action,and,the,anguish,of,losing,ashley,forever,was,too,much,to,be,borne
as,he,hesitatingly,approached,the,bed,she,spoke,in,a,hoarse,whisper
i'll,scream,out,loud,if,you,come,near,me
i,will
i,will,at,the,top,of,my,voice
get,away,from,me
don't,you,dare,touch,me
so,charles,hamilton,spent,his,wedding,night,in,an,armchair,in,the,corner,not,too,unhappily,for,he,understood,or,thought,he,understood,the,modesty,and,delicacy,of,his,bride
he,was,willing,to,wait,until,her,fears,subsided,only,only,he,sighed,as,he,twisted,about,seeking,a,comfortable,position,for,he,was,going,away,to,the,war,so,very,soon
nightmarish,as,her,own,wedding,had,been,ashley's,wedding,was,even,worse
scarlett,stood,in,her,apple-green,second-day,dress,in,the,parlor,of,twelve,oaks,amid,the,blaze,of,hundreds,of,candles,jostled,by,the,same,throng,as,the,night,before,and,saw,the,plain,little,face,of,melanie,hamilton,glow,into,beauty,as,she,became,melanie,wilkes
now,ashley,was,gone,forever
her,ashley
no,not,her,ashley,now
had,he,ever,been,hers
it,was,all,so,mixed,up,in,her,mind,and,her,mind,was,so,tired,so,bewildered
he,had,said,he,loved,her,but,what,was,it,that,had,separated,them
if,she,could,only,remember
she,had,stilled,the,county's,gossiping,tongue,by,marrying,charles,but,what,did,that,matter,now
it,had,seemed,so,important,once,but,now,it,didn't,seem,important,at,all
all,that,mattered,was,ashley
now,he,was,gone,and,she,was,married,to,a,man,she,not,only,did,not,love,but,for,whom,she,had,an,active,contempt
oh,how,she,regretted,it,all
she,had,often,heard,of,people,cutting,off,their,noses,to,spite,their,faces,but,heretofore,it,had,been,only,a,figure,of,speech
now,she,knew,just,what,it,meant
and,mingled,with,her,frenzied,desire,to,be,free,of,charles,and,safely,back,at,tara,an,unmarried,girl,again,ran,the,knowledge,that,she,had,only,herself,to,blame
ellen,had,tried,to,stop,her,and,she,would,not,listen
so,she,danced,through,the,night,of,ashley's,wedding,in,a,daze,and,said,things,mechanically,and,smiled,and,irrelevantly,wondered,at,the,stupidity,of,people,who,thought,her,a,happy,bride,and,could,not,see,that,her,heart,was,broken
well,thank,god,they,couldn't,see
that,night,after,mammy,had,helped,her,undress,and,had,departed,and,charles,had,emerged,shyly,from,the,dressing,room,wondering,if,he,was,to,spend,a,second,night,in,the,horsehair,chair,she,burst,into,tears
she,cried,until,charles,climbed,into,bed,beside,her,and,tried,to,comfort,her,cried,without,words,until,no,more,tears,would,come,and,at,last,she,lay,sobbing,quietly,on,his,shoulder
if,there,had,not,been,a,war,there,would,have,been,a,week,of,visiting,about,the,county,with,balls,and,barbecues,in,honor,of,the,two,newly,married,couples,before,they,set,off,to,saratoga,or,white,sulphur,for,wedding,trips
if,there,had,not,been,a,war,scarlett,would,have,had,third-day,and,fourth-day,and,fifth-day,dresses,to,wear,to,the,fontaine,and,calvert,and,tarleton,parties,in,her,honor
but,there,were,no,parties,now,and,no,wedding,trips
a,week,after,the,wedding,charles,left,to,join,colonel,wade,hampton,and,two,weeks,later,ashley,and,the,troop,departed,leaving,the,whole,county,bereft
in,those,two,weeks,scarlett,never,saw,ashley,alone,never,had,a,private,word,with,him
not,even,at,the,terrible,moment,of,parting,when,he,stopped,by,tara,on,his,way,to,the,train,did,she,have,a,private,talk
melanie,bonneted,and,shawled,sedate,in,newly,acquired,matronly,dignity,hung,on,his,arm,and,the,entire,personnel,of,tara,black,and,white,turned,out,to,see,ashley,off,to,the,war
melanie,said,you,must,kiss,scarlett,ashley
she's,my,sister,now,and,ashley,bent,and,touched,her,cheek,with,cold,lips,his,face,drawn,and,taut
scarlett,could,hardly,take,any,joy,from,that,kiss,so,sullen,was,her,heart,at,melly's,prompting,it
melanie,smothered,her,with,an,embrace,at,parting
you,will,come,to,atlanta,and,visit,me,and,aunt,pittypat,won't,you
oh,darling,we,want,to,have,you,so,much
we,want,to,know,charlie's,wife,better
five,weeks,passed,during,which,letters,shy,ecstatic,loving,came,from,charles,in,south,carolina,telling,of,his,love,his,plans,for,the,future,when,the,war,was,over,his,desire,to,become,a,hero,for,her,sake,and,his,worship,of,his,commander,wade,hampton
in,the,seventh,week,there,came,a,telegram,from,colonel,hampton,himself,and,then,a,letter,a,kind,dignified,letter,of,condolence
charles,was,dead
the,colonel,would,have,wired,earlier,but,charles,thinking,his,illness,a,trifling,one,did,not,wish,to,have,his,family,worried
the,unfortunate,boy,had,not,only,been,cheated,of,the,love,he,thought,he,had,won,but,also,of,his,high,hopes,of,honor,and,glory,on,the,field,of,battle
he,had,died,ignominiously,and,swiftly,of,pneumonia,following,measles,without,ever,having,gotten,any,closer,to,the,yankees,than,the,camp,in,south,carolina
in,due,time,charles',son,was,born,and,because,it,was,fashionable,to,name,boys,after,their,fathers',commanding,officers,he,was,called,wade,hampton,hamilton
scarlett,had,wept,with,despair,at,the,knowledge,that,she,was,pregnant,and,wished,that,she,were,dead
but,she,carried,the,child,through,its,time,with,a,minimum,of,discomfort,bore,him,with,little,distress,and,recovered,so,quickly,that,mammy,told,her,privately,it,was,downright,common,ladies,should,suffer,more
she,felt,little,affection,for,the,child,hide,the,fact,though,she,might
she,had,not,wanted,him,and,she,resented,his,coming,and,now,that,he,was,here,it,did,not,seem,possible,that,he,was,hers,a,part,of,her
though,she,recovered,physically,from,wade's,birth,in,a,disgracefully,short,time,mentally,she,was,dazed,and,sick
her,spirits,drooped,despite,the,efforts,of,the,whole,plantation,to,revive,them
ellen,went,about,with,a,puckered,worried,forehead,and,gerald,swore,more,frequently,than,usual,and,brought,her,useless,gifts,from,jonesboro
even,old,dr,fontaine,admitted,that,he,was,puzzled,after,his,tonic,of,sulphur,molasses,and,herbs,failed,to,perk,her,up
he,told,ellen,privately,that,it,was,a,broken,heart,that,made,scarlett,so,irritable,and,listless,by,turns
but,scarlett,had,she,wished,to,speak,could,have,told,them,that,it,was,a,far,different,and,more,complex,trouble
she,did,not,tell,them,that,it,was,utter,boredom,bewilderment,at,actually,being,a,mother,and,most,of,all,the,absence,of,ashley,that,made,her,look,so,woebegone
her,boredom,was,acute,and,ever,present
the,county,had,been,devoid,of,any,entertainment,or,social,life,ever,since,the,troop,had,gone,away,to,war
all,of,the,interesting,young,men,were,gone,the,four,tarletons,the,two,calverts,the,fontaines,the,munroes,and,everyone,from,jonesboro,fayetteville,and,lovejoy,who,was,young,and,attractive
only,the,older,men,the,cripples,and,the,women,were,left,and,they,spent,their,time,knitting,and,sewing,growing,more,cotton,and,corn,raising,more,hogs,and,sheep,and,cows,for,the,army
there,was,never,a,sight,of,a,real,man,except,when,the,commissary,troop,under,suellen's,middle-aged,beau,frank,kennedy,rode,by,every,month,to,collect,supplies
the,men,in,the,commissary,were,not,very,exciting,and,the,sight,of,frank's,timid,courting,annoyed,her,until,she,found,it,difficult,to,be,polite,to,him
if,he,and,suellen,would,only,get,it,over,with
even,if,the,commissary,troop,had,been,more,interesting,it,would,not,have,helped,her,situation,any
she,was,a,widow,and,her,heart,was,in,the,grave
at,least,everyone,thought,it,was,in,the,grave,and,expected,her,to,act,accordingly
this,irritated,her,for,try,as,she,would,she,could,recall,nothing,about,charles,except,the,dying-calf,look,on,his,face,when,she,told,him,she,would,marry,him
and,even,that,picture,was,fading
but,she,was,a,widow,and,she,had,to,watch,her,behavior
not,for,her,the,pleasures,of,unmarried,girls
she,had,to,be,grave,and,aloof
ellen,had,stressed,this,at,great,length,after,catching,frank's,lieutenant,swinging,scarlett,in,the,garden,swing,and,making,her,squeal,with,laughter
deeply,distressed,ellen,had,told,her,how,easily,a,widow,might,get,herself,talked,about
the,conduct,of,a,widow,must,be,twice,as,circumspect,as,that,of,a,matron
and,god,only,knows,thought,scarlett,listening,obediently,to,her,mother's,soft,voice,matrons,never,have,any,fun,at,all
so,widows,might,as,well,be,dead
a,widow,had,to,wear,hideous,black,dresses,without,even,a,touch,of,braid,to,enliven,them,no,flower,or,ribbon,or,lace,or,even,jewelry,except,onyx,mourning,brooches,or,necklaces,made,from,the,deceased's,hair
and,the,black,crepe,veil,on,her,bonnet,had,to,reach,to,her,knees,and,only,after,three,years,of,widowhood,could,it,be,shortened,to,shoulder,length
widows,could,never,chatter,vivaciously,or,laugh,aloud
even,when,they,smiled,it,must,be,a,sad,tragic,smile
and,most,dreadful,of,all,they,could,in,no,way,indicate,an,interest,in,the,company,of,gentlemen
and,should,a,gentleman,be,so,ill,bred,as,to,indicate,an,interest,in,her,she,must,freeze,him,with,a,dignified,but,well-chosen,reference,to,her,dead,husband
oh,yes,thought,scarlett,drearily,some,widows,do,remarry,eventually,when,they,are,old,and,stringy
though,heaven,knows,how,they,manage,it,with,their,neighbors,watching
and,then,it's,generally,to,some,desperate,old,widower,with,a,large,plantation,and,a,dozen,children
marriage,was,bad,enough,but,to,be,widowed,oh,then,life,was,over,forever
how,stupid,people,were,when,they,talked,about,what,a,comfort,little,wade,hampton,must,be,to,her,now,that,charles,was,gone
how,stupid,of,them,to,say,that,now,she,had,something,to,live,for
everyone,talked,about,how,sweet,it,was,that,she,had,this,posthumous,token,of,her,love,and,she,naturally,did,not,disabuse,their,minds
but,that,thought,was,farthest,from,her,mind
she,had,very,little,interest,in,wade,and,sometimes,it,was,difficult,to,remember,that,he,was,actually,hers
every,morning,she,woke,up,and,for,a,drowsy,moment,she,was,scarlett,o'hara,again,and,the,sun,was,bright,in,the,magnolia,outside,her,window,and,the,mockers,were,singing,and,the,sweet,smell,of,frying,bacon,was,stealing,to,her,nostrils
she,was,carefree,and,young,again
then,she,heard,the,fretful,hungry,wail,and,always,always,there,was,a,startled,moment,when,she,thought,why,there's,a,baby,in,the,house
then,she,remembered,that,it,was,her,baby
it,was,all,very,bewildering
and,ashley
oh,most,of,all,ashley
for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,hated,tara,hated,the,long,red,road,that,led,down,the,hill,to,the,river,hated,the,red,fields,with,springing,green,cotton
every,foot,of,ground,every,tree,and,brook,every,lane,and,bridle,path,reminded,her,of,him
he,belonged,to,another,woman,and,he,had,gone,to,the,war,but,his,ghost,still,haunted,the,roads,in,the,twilight,still,smiled,at,her,from,drowsy,gray,eyes,in,the,shadows,of,the,porch
she,never,heard,the,sound,of,hooves,coming,up,the,river,road,from,twelve,oaks,that,for,a,sweet,moment,she,did,not,think,ashley
she,hated,twelve,oaks,now,and,once,she,had,loved,it
she,hated,it,but,she,was,drawn,there,so,she,could,hear,john,wilkes,and,the,girls,talk,about,him,hear,them,read,his,letters,from,virginia
they,hurt,her,but,she,had,to,hear,them
she,disliked,the,stiff-,necked,india,and,the,foolish,prattling,honey,and,knew,they,disliked,her,equally,but,she,could,not,stay,away,from,them
and,every,time,she,came,home,from,twelve,oaks,she,lay,down,on,her,bed,morosely,and,refused,to,get,up,for,supper
it,was,this,refusal,of,food,that,worried,ellen,and,mammy,more,than,anything,else
mammy,brought,up,tempting,trays,insinuating,that,now,she,was,a,widow,she,might,eat,as,much,as,she,pleased,but,scarlett,had,no,appetite
when,dr,fontaine,told,ellen,gravely,that,heartbreak,frequently,led,to,a,decline,and,women,pined,away,into,the,grave,ellen,went,white,for,that,fear,was,what,she,had,carried,in,her,heart
isn't,there,anything,to,be,done,doctor
a,change,of,scene,will,be,the,best,thing,in,the,world,for,her,said,the,doctor,only,too,anxious,to,be,rid,of,an,unsatisfactory,patient
so,scarlett,unenthusiastic,went,off,with,her,child,first,to,visit,her,o'hara,and,robillard,relatives,in,savannah,and,then,to,ellen's,sisters,pauline,and,eulalie,in,charleston
but,she,was,back,at,tara,a,month,before,ellen,expected,her,with,no,explanation,of,her,return
they,had,been,kind,in,savannah,but,james,and,andrew,and,their,wives,were,old,and,content,to,sit,quietly,and,talk,of,a,past,in,which,scarlett,had,no,interest
it,was,the,same,with,the,robillards,and,charleston,was,terrible,scarlett,thought
aunt,pauline,and,her,husband,a,little,old,man,with,a,formal,brittle,courtesy,and,the,absent,air,of,one,living,in,an,older,age,lived,on,a,plantation,on,the,river,far,more,isolated,than,tara
their,nearest,neighbor,was,twenty,miles,away,by,dark,roads,through,still,jungles,of,cypress,swamp,and,oak
the,live,oaks,with,their,waving,curtains,of,gray,moss,gave,scarlett,the,creeps,and,always,brought,to,her,mind,gerald's,stories,of,irish,ghosts,roaming,in,shimmering,gray,mists
there,was,nothing,to,do,but,knit,all,day,and,at,night,listen,to,uncle,carey,read,aloud,from,the,improving,works,of,mr,bulwer-lytton
eulalie,hidden,behind,a,high-walled,garden,in,a,great,house,on,the,battery,in,charleston,was,no,more,entertaining
scarlett,accustomed,to,wide,vistas,of,rolling,red,hills,felt,that,she,was,in,prison
there,was,more,social,life,here,than,at,aunt,pauline's,but,scarlett,did,not,like,the,people,who,called,with,their,airs,and,their,traditions,and,their,emphasis,on,family
she,knew,very,well,they,all,thought,she,was,a,child,of,a,mesalliance,and,wondered,how,a,robillard,ever,married,a,newly,come,irishman
scarlett,felt,that,aunt,eulalie,apologized,for,her,behind,her,back
this,aroused,her,temper,for,she,cared,no,more,about,family,than,her,father
she,was,proud,of,gerald,and,what,he,had,accomplished,unaided,except,by,his,shrewd,irish,brain
and,the,charlestonians,took,so,much,upon,themselves,about,fort,sumter
good,heavens,didn't,they,realize,that,if,they,hadn't,been,silly,enough,to,fire,the,shot,that,started,the,war,some,other,fools,would,have,done,it
accustomed,to,the,brisk,voices,of,upland,georgia,the,drawling,flat,voices,of,the,low,country,seemed,affected,to,her
she,thought,if,she,ever,again,heard,voices,that,said,paams,for,palms,and,hoose,for,house,and,woon't,for,won't,and,maa,and,paa,for,ma,and,pa,she,would,scream
it,irritated,her,so,much,that,during,one,formal,call,she,aped,gerald's,brogue,to,her,aunt's,distress
then,she,went,back,to,tara
better,to,be,tormented,with,memories,of,ashley,than,charleston,accents
ellen,busy,night,and,day,doubling,the,productiveness,of,tara,to,aid,the,confederacy,was,terrified,when,her,eldest,daughter,came,home,from,charleston,thin,white,and,sharp,tongued
she,had,known,heartbreak,herself,and,night,after,night,she,lay,beside,the,snoring,gerald,trying,to,think,of,some,way,to,lessen,scarlett's,distress
charles',aunt,miss,pittypat,hamilton,had,written,her,several,times,urging,her,to,permit,scarlett,to,come,to,atlanta,for,a,long,visit,and,now,for,the,first,time,ellen,considered,it,seriously
she,and,melanie,were,alone,in,a,big,house,and,without,male,protection,wrote,miss,pittypat,now,that,dear,charlie,has,gone
of,course,there,is,my,brother,henry,but,he,does,not,make,his,home,with,us
but,perhaps,scarlett,has,told,you,of,henry
delicacy,forbids,my,putting,more,concerning,him,on,paper
melly,and,i,would,feel,so,much,easier,and,safer,if,scarlett,were,with,us
three,lonely,women,are,better,than,two
and,perhaps,dear,scarlett,could,find,some,ease,for,her,sorrow,as,melly,is,doing,by,nursing,our,brave,boys,in,the,hospitals,here,and,of,course,melly,and,i,are,longing,to,see,the,dear,baby
so,scarlett's,trunk,was,packed,again,with,her,mourning,clothes,and,off,she,went,to,atlanta,with,wade,hampton,and,his,nurse,prissy,a,headful,of,admonitions,as,to,her,conduct,from,ellen,and,mammy,and,a,hundred,dollars,in,confederate,bills,from,gerald
she,did,not,especially,want,to,go,to,atlanta
she,thought,aunt,pitty,the,silliest,of,old,ladies,and,the,very,idea,of,living,under,the,same,roof,with,ashley's,wife,was,abhorrent
but,the,county,with,its,memories,was,impossible,now,and,any,change,was,welcome
part,two
chapter,viii
as,the,train,carried,scarlett,northward,that,may,morning,in,1862,she,thought,that,atlanta,couldn't,possibly,be,so,boring,as,charleston,and,savannah,had,been,and,in,spite,of,her,distaste,for,miss,pittypat,and,melanie,she,looked,forward,with,some,curiosity,toward,seeing,how,the,town,had,fared,since,her,last,visit,in,the,winter,before,the,war,began
atlanta,had,always,interested,her,more,than,any,other,town,because,when,she,was,a,child,gerald,had,told,her,that,she,and,atlanta,were,exactly,the,same,age
she,discovered,when,she,grew,older,that,gerald,had,stretched,the,truth,somewhat,as,was,his,habit,when,a,little,stretching,would,improve,a,story,but,atlanta,was,only,nine,years,older,than,she,was,and,that,still,left,the,place,amazingly,young,by,comparison,with,any,other,town,she,had,ever,heard,of
savannah,and,charleston,had,the,dignity,of,their,years,one,being,well,along,in,its,second,century,and,the,other,entering,its,third,and,in,her,young,eyes,they,had,always,seemed,like,aged,grandmothers,fanning,themselves,placidly,in,the,sun
but,atlanta,was,of,her,own,generation,crude,with,the,crudities,of,youth,and,as,headstrong,and,impetuous,as,herself
the,story,gerald,had,told,her,was,based,on,the,fact,that,she,and,atlanta,were,christened,in,the,same,year
in,the,nine,years,before,scarlett,was,born,the,town,had,been,called,first,terminus,and,then,marthasville,and,not,until,the,year,of,scarlett's,birth,had,it,become,atlanta
when,gerald,first,moved,to,north,georgia,there,had,been,no,atlanta,at,all,not,even,the,semblance,of,a,village,and,wilderness,rolled,over,the,site
but,the,next,year,in,1836,the,state,had,authorized,the,building,of,a,railroad,northwestward,through,the,territory,which,the,cherokees,had,recently,ceded
the,destination,of,the,proposed,railroad,tennessee,and,the,west,was,clear,and,definite,but,its,beginning,point,in,georgia,was,somewhat,uncertain,until,a,year,later,an,engineer,drove,a,stake,in,the,red,clay,to,mark,the,southern,end,of,the,line,and,atlanta,born,terminus,had,begun
there,were,no,railroads,then,in,north,georgia,and,very,few,anywhere,else
but,during,the,years,before,gerald,married,ellen,the,tiny,settlement,twenty-five,miles,north,of,tara,slowly,grew,into,a,village,and,the,tracks,slowly,pushed,northward
then,the,railroad,building,era,really,began
from,the,old,city,of,augusta,a,second,railroad,was,extended,westward,across,the,state,to,connect,with,the,new,road,to,tennessee
from,the,old,city,of,savannah,a,third,railroad,was,built,first,to,macon,in,the,heart,of,georgia,and,then,north,through,gerald's,own,county,to,atlanta,to,link,up,with,the,other,two,roads,and,give,savannah's,harbor,a,highway,to,the,west
from,the,same,junction,point,the,young,atlanta,a,fourth,railroad,was,constructed,southwestward,to,montgomery,and,mobile
born,of,a,railroad,atlanta,grew,as,its,railroads,grew
with,the,completion,of,the,four,lines,atlanta,was,now,connected,with,the,west,with,the,south,with,the,coast,and,through,augusta,with,the,north,and,east
it,had,become,the,crossroads,of,travel,north,and,south,and,east,and,west,and,the,little,village,leaped,to,life
in,a,space,of,time,but,little,longer,than,scarlett's,seventeen,years,atlanta,had,grown,from,a,single,stake,driven,in,the,ground,into,a,thriving,small,city,of,ten,thousand,that,was,the,center,of,attention,for,the,whole,state
the,older,quieter,cities,were,wont,to,look,upon,the,bustling,new,town,with,the,sensations,of,a,hen,which,has,hatched,a,duckling
why,was,the,place,so,different,from,the,other,georgia,towns
why,did,it,grow,so,fast
after,all,they,thought,it,had,nothing,whatever,to,recommend,it,only,its,railroads,and,a,bunch,of,mighty,pushy,people
the,people,who,settled,the,town,called,successively,terminus,marthasville,and,atlanta,were,a,pushy,people
restless,energetic,people,from,the,older,sections,of,georgia,and,from,more,distant,states,were,drawn,to,this,town,that,sprawled,itself,around,the,junction,of,the,railroads,in,its,center
they,came,with,enthusiasm
they,built,their,stores,around,the,five,muddy,red,roads,that,crossed,near,the,depot
they,built,their,fine,homes,on,whitehall,and,washington,streets,and,along,the,high,ridge,of,land,on,which,countless,generations,of,moccasined,indian,feet,had,beaten,a,path,called,the,peachtree,trail
they,were,proud,of,the,place,proud,of,its,growth,proud,of,themselves,for,making,it,grow
let,the,older,towns,call,atlanta,anything,they,pleased
atlanta,did,not,care
scarlett,had,always,liked,atlanta,for,the,very,same,reasons,that,made,savannah,augusta,and,macon,condemn,it
like,herself,the,town,was,a,mixture,of,the,old,and,new,in,georgia,in,which,the,old,often,came,off,second,best,in,its,conflicts,with,the,self-willed,and,vigorous,new
moreover,there,was,something,personal,exciting,about,a,town,that,was,born,or,at,least,christened,the,same,year,she,was,christened
the,night,before,had,been,wild,and,wet,with,rain,but,when,scarlett,arrived,in,atlanta,a,warm,sun,was,at,work,bravely,attempting,to,dry,the,streets,that,were,winding,rivers,of,red,mud
in,the,open,space,around,the,depot,the,soft,ground,had,been,cut,and,churned,by,the,constant,flow,of,traffic,in,and,out,until,it,resembled,an,enormous,hog,wallow,and,here,and,there,vehicles,were,mired,to,the,hubs,in,the,ruts
a,never-ceasing,line,of,army,wagons,and,ambulances,loading,and,unloading,supplies,and,wounded,from,the,trains,made,the,mud,and,confusion,worse,as,they,toiled,in,and,struggled,out,drivers,swearing,mules,plunging,and,mud,spattering,for,yards
scarlett,stood,on,the,lower,step,of,the,train,a,pale,pretty,figure,in,her,black,mourning,dress,her,crepe,veil,fluttering,almost,to,her,heels
she,hesitated,unwilling,to,soil,her,slippers,and,hems,and,looked,about,in,the,shouting,tangle,of,wagons,buggies,and,carriages,for,miss,pittypat
there,was,no,sign,of,that,chubby,pink-cheeked,lady,but,as,scarlett,searched,anxiously,a,spare,old,negro,with,grizzled,kinks,and,an,air,of,dignified,authority,came,toward,her,through,the,mud,his,hat,in,his,hand

scarlett,submitted,meekly,to,being,carried,toward,the,carriage,and,also,to,the,peremptory,manner,in,which,uncle,peter,criticized,her,and,prissy
as,they,went,through,the,mud,with,prissy,sloshing,pouting,after,them,she,recalled,what,charles,had,said,about,uncle,peter
he,went,through,all,the,mexican,campaigns,with,father,nursed,him,when,he,was,wounded,in,fact,he,saved,his,life
uncle,peter,practically,raised,melanie,and,me,for,we,were,very,young,when,father,and,mother,died
aunt,pitty,had,a,falling,out,with,her,brother,uncle,henry,about,that,time,so,she,came,to,live,with,us,and,take,care,of,us
she,is,the,most,helpless,soul,just,like,a,sweet,grown-up,child,and,uncle,peter,treats,her,that,way
to,save,her,life,she,couldn't,make,up,her,mind,about,anything,so,peter,makes,it,up,for,her
he,was,the,one,who,decided,i,should,have,a,larger,allowance,when,i,was,fifteen,and,he,insisted,that,i,should,go,to,harvard,for,my,senior,year,when,uncle,henry,wanted,me,to,take,my,degree,at,the,university
and,he,decided,when,melly,was,old,enough,to,put,up,her,hair,and,go,to,parties
he,tells,aunt,pitty,when,it's,too,cold,or,too,wet,for,her,to,go,calling,and,when,she,should,wear,a,shawl
he's,the,smartest,old,darky,i've,ever,seen,and,about,the,most,devoted
the,only,trouble,with,him,is,that,he,owns,the,three,of,us,body,and,soul,and,he,knows,it

scarlett,looked,at,prissy,and,sighed
prissy,was,not,the,most,adequate,of,nurses
her,recent,graduation,from,a,skinny,pickaninny,with,brief,skirts,and,stiffly,wrapped,braids,into,the,dignity,of,a,calico,dress,and,starched,white,turban,was,an,intoxicating,affair
she,would,never,have,arrived,at,this,eminence,so,early,in,life,had,not,the,exigencies,of,war,and,the,demands,of,the,commissary,department,on,tara,made,it,impossible,for,ellen,to,spare,mammy,or,dilcey,or,even,rosa,or,teena
prissy,had,never,been,more,than,a,mile,away,from,twelve,oaks,or,tara,before,and,the,trip,on,the,train,plus,her,elevation,to,nurse,was,almost,more,than,the,brain,in,her,little,black,skull,could,bear
the,twenty-mile,journey,from,jonesboro,to,atlanta,had,so,excited,her,that,scarlett,had,been,forced,to,hold,the,baby,all,the,way
now,the,sight,of,so,many,buildings,and,people,completed,prissy's,demoralization
she,twisted,from,side,to,side,pointed,bounced,about,and,so,jounced,the,baby,that,he,wailed,miserably
scarlett,longed,for,the,fat,old,arms,of,mammy
mammy,had,only,to,lay,hands,on,a,child,and,it,hushed,crying
but,mammy,was,at,tara,and,there,was,nothing,scarlett,could,do
it,was,useless,for,her,to,take,little,wade,from,prissy
he,yelled,just,as,loudly,when,she,held,him,as,when,prissy,did
besides,he,would,tug,at,the,ribbons,of,her,bonnet,and,no,doubt,rumple,her,dress
so,she,pretended,she,had,not,heard,uncle,peter's,suggestion
maybe,i'll,learn,about,babies,sometime,she,thought,irritably,as,the,carriage,jolted,and,swayed,out,of,the,morass,surrounding,the,station,but,i'm,never,going,to,like,fooling,with,them
and,as,wade's,face,went,purple,with,his,squalling,she,snapped,crossly,give,him,that,sugar-tit,in,your,pocket,priss
anything,to,make,him,hush
i,know,he's,hungry,but,i,can't,do,anything,about,that,now
prissy,produced,the,sugar-tit,given,her,that,morning,by,mammy,and,the,baby's,wails,subsided
with,quiet,restored,and,with,the,new,sights,that,met,her,eyes,scarlett's,spirits,began,to,rise,a,little
when,uncle,peter,finally,maneuvered,the,carriage,out,of,the,mudholes,and,onto,peachtree,street,she,felt,the,first,surge,of,interest,she,had,known,in,months
how,the,town,had,grown
it,was,not,much,more,than,a,year,since,she,had,last,been,here,and,it,did,not,seem,possible,that,the,little,atlanta,she,knew,could,have,changed,so,much
for,the,past,year,she,had,been,so,engrossed,in,her,own,woes,so,bored,by,any,mention,of,war,she,did,not,know,that,from,the,minute,the,fighting,first,began,atlanta,had,been,transformed
the,same,railroads,which,had,made,the,town,the,crossroads,of,commerce,in,time,of,peace,were,now,of,vital,strategic,importance,in,time,of,war
far,from,the,battle,lines,the,town,and,its,railroads,provided,the,connecting,link,between,the,two,armies,of,the,confederacy,the,army,in,virginia,and,the,army,in,tennessee,and,the,west
and,atlanta,likewise,linked,both,of,the,armies,with,the,deeper,south,from,which,they,drew,their,supplies
now,in,response,to,the,needs,of,war,atlanta,had,become,a,manufacturing,center,a,hospital,base,and,one,of,the,south's,chief,depots,for,the,collecting,of,food,and,supplies,for,the,armies,in,the,field
scarlett,looked,about,her,for,the,little,town,she,remembered,so,well
it,was,gone
the,town,she,was,now,seeing,was,like,a,baby,grown,overnight,into,a,busy,sprawling,giant
atlanta,was,humming,like,a,beehive,proudly,conscious,of,its,importance,to,the,confederacy,and,work,was,going,forward,night,and,day,toward,turning,an,agricultural,section,into,an,industrial,one
before,the,war,there,had,been,few,cotton,factories,woolen,mills,arsenals,and,machine,shops,south,of,maryland,a,fact,of,which,all,southerners,were,proud
the,south,produced,statesmen,and,soldiers,planters,and,doctors,lawyers,and,poets,but,certainly,not,engineers,or,mechanics
let,the,yankees,adopt,such,low,callings
but,now,the,confederate,ports,were,stoppered,with,yankee,gunboats,only,a,trickle,of,blockade-run,goods,was,slipping,in,from,europe,and,the,south,was,desperately,trying,to,manufacture,her,own,war,materials
the,north,could,call,on,the,whole,world,for,supplies,and,for,soldiers,and,thousands,of,irish,and,germans,were,pouring,into,the,union,army,lured,by,the,bounty,money,offered,by,the,north
the,south,could,only,turn,in,upon,itself
in,atlanta,there,were,machine,factories,tediously,turning,out,machinery,to,manufacture,war,materials,tediously,because,there,were,few,machines,in,the,south,from,which,they,could,model,and,nearly,every,wheel,and,cog,had,to,be,made,from,drawings,that,came,through,the,blockade,from,england
there,were,strange,faces,on,the,streets,of,atlanta,now,and,citizens,who,a,year,ago,would,have,pricked,up,their,ears,at,the,sound,of,even,a,western,accent,paid,no,heed,to,the,foreign,tongues,of,europeans,who,had,run,the,blockade,to,build,machines,and,turn,out,confederate,munitions
skilled,men,these,without,whom,the,confederacy,would,have,been,hard,put,to,make,pistols,rifles,cannon,and,powder
almost,the,pulsing,of,the,town's,heart,could,be,felt,as,the,work,went,forward,night,and,day,pumping,the,materials,of,war,up,the,railway,arteries,to,the,two,battle,fronts
trains,roared,in,and,out,of,the,town,at,all,hours
soot,from,the,newly,erected,factories,fell,in,showers,on,the,white,houses
by,night,the,furnaces,glowed,and,the,hammers,clanged,long,after,townsfolk,were,abed
where,vacant,lots,had,been,a,year,before,there,were,now,factories,turning,out,harness,saddles,and,shoes,ordnance-supply,plants,making,rifles,and,cannon,rolling,mills,and,foundries,producing,iron,rails,and,freight,cars,to,replace,those,destroyed,by,the,yankees,and,a,variety,of,industries,manufacturing,spurs,bridle,bits,buckles,tents,buttons,pistols,and,swords
already,the,foundries,were,beginning,to,feel,the,lack,of,iron,for,little,or,none,came,through,the,blockade,and,the,mines,in,alabama,were,standing,almost,idle,while,the,miners,were,at,the,front
there,were,no,iron,picket,fences,iron,summerhouses,iron,gates,or,even,iron,statuary,on,the,lawns,of,atlanta,now,for,they,had,early,found,their,way,into,the,melting,pots,of,the,rolling,mills
here,along,peachtree,street,and,near-by,streets,were,the,headquarters,of,the,various,army,departments,each,office,swarming,with,uniformed,men,the,commissary,the,signal,corps,the,mail,service,the,railway,transport,the,provost,marshal
on,the,outskirts,of,town,were,the,remount,depots,where,horses,and,mules,milled,about,in,large,corrals,and,along,side,streets,were,the,hospitals
as,uncle,peter,told,her,about,them,scarlett,felt,that,atlanta,must,be,a,city,of,the,wounded,for,there,were,general,hospitals,contagious,hospitals,convalescent,hospitals,without,number
and,every,day,the,trains,just,below,five,points,disgorged,more,sick,and,more,wounded
the,little,town,was,gone,and,the,face,of,the,rapidly,growing,city,was,animated,with,never-ceasing,energy,and,bustle
the,sight,of,so,much,hurrying,made,scarlett,fresh,from,rural,leisure,and,quiet,almost,breathless,but,she,liked,it
there,was,an,exciting,atmosphere,about,the,place,that,uplifted,her
it,was,as,if,she,could,actually,feel,the,accelerated,steady,pulse,of,the,town's,heart,beating,in,time,with,her,own
as,they,slowly,made,their,way,through,the,mudholes,of,the,town's,chief,street,she,noted,with,interest,all,the,new,buildings,and,the,new,faces
the,sidewalks,were,crowded,with,men,in,uniform,bearing,the,insignia,of,all,ranks,and,all,service,branches,the,narrow,street,was,jammed,with,vehicles,carriages,buggies,ambulances,covered,army,wagons,with,profane,drivers,swearing,as,the,mules,struggled,through,the,ruts,gray-clad,couriers,dashed,spattering,through,the,streets,from,one,headquarters,to,another,bearing,orders,and,telegraphic,dispatches,convalescents,limped,about,on,crutches,usually,with,a,solicitous,lady,at,either,elbow,bugle,and,drum,and,barked,orders,sounded,from,the,drill,fields,where,the,recruits,were,being,turned,into,soldiers,and,with,her,heart,in,her,throat,scarlett,had,her,first,sight,of,yankee,uniforms,as,uncle,peter,pointed,with,his,whip,to,a,detachment,of,dejected-looking,bluecoats,being,shepherded,toward,the,depot,by,a,squad,of,confederates,with,fixed,bayonets,to,entrain,for,the,prison,camp
oh,thought,scarlett,with,the,first,feeling,of,real,pleasure,she,had,experienced,since,the,day,of,the,barbecue,i'm,going,to,like,it,here
it's,so,alive,and,exciting
the,town,was,even,more,alive,than,she,realized,for,there,were,new,barrooms,by,the,dozens,prostitutes,following,the,army,swarmed,the,town,and,bawdy,houses,were,blossoming,with,women,to,the,consternation,of,the,church,people
every,hotel,boarding,house,and,private,residence,was,crammed,with,visitors,who,had,come,to,be,near,wounded,relatives,in,the,big,atlanta,hospitals
there,were,parties,and,balls,and,bazaars,every,week,and,war,weddings,without,number,with,the,grooms,on,furlough,in,bright,gray,and,gold,braid,and,the,brides,in,blockade-run,finery,aisles,of,crossed,swords,toasts,drunk,in,blockaded,champagne,and,tearful,farewells
nightly,the,dark,tree-lined,streets,resounded,with,dancing,feet,and,from,parlors,tinkled,pianos,where,soprano,voices,blended,with,those,of,soldier,guests,in,the,pleasing,melancholy,of,the,bugles,sang,truce,and,your,letter,came,but,came,too,late,plaintive,ballads,that,brought,exciting,tears,to,soft,eyes,which,had,never,known,the,tears,of,real,grief
as,they,progressed,down,the,street,through,the,sucking,mud,scarlett,bubbled,over,with,questions,and,peter,answered,them,pointing,here,and,there,with,his,whip,proud,to,display,his,knowledge

scarlett,vaguely,remembered,two,ladies,of,those,names,who,came,from,atlanta,to,tara,to,attend,her,wedding,and,she,remembered,that,they,were,miss,pittypat's,best,friends
so,she,turned,quickly,where,uncle,peter,pointed,and,bowed
the,two,were,sitting,in,a,carriage,outside,a,drygoods,store
the,proprietor,and,two,clerks,stood,on,the,sidewalk,with,armfuls,of,bolts,of,cotton,cloth,they,had,been,displaying
mrs,merriwether,was,a,tall,stout,woman,and,so,tightly,corseted,that,her,bust,jutted,forward,like,the,prow,of,a,ship
her,iron-gray,hair,was,eked,out,by,a,curled,false,fringe,that,was,proudly,brown,and,disdained,to,match,the,rest,of,her,hair
she,had,a,round,highly,colored,face,in,which,was,combined,good-natured,shrewdness,and,the,habit,of,command
mrs,elsing,was,younger,a,thin,frail,woman,who,had,been,a,beauty,and,about,her,there,still,clung,a,faded,freshness,a,dainty,imperious,air
these,two,ladies,with,a,third,mrs,whiting,were,the,pillars,of,atlanta
they,ran,the,three,churches,to,which,they,belonged,the,clergy,the,choirs,and,the,parishioners
they,organized,bazaars,and,presided,over,sewing,circles,they,chaperoned,balls,and,picnics,they,knew,who,made,good,matches,and,who,did,not,who,drank,secretly,who,were,to,have,babies,and,when
they,were,authorities,on,the,genealogies,of,everyone,who,was,anyone,in,georgia,south,carolina,and,virginia,and,did,not,bother,their,heads,about,the,other,states,because,they,believed,that,no,one,who,was,anybody,ever,came,from,states,other,than,these,three
they,knew,what,was,decorous,behavior,and,what,was,not,and,they,never,failed,to,make,their,opinions,known,mrs
merriwether,at,the,top,of,her,voice,mrs,elsing,in,an,elegant,die-away,drawl,and,mrs,whiting,in,a,distressed,whisper,which,showed,how,much,she,hated,to,speak,of,such,things
these,three,ladies,disliked,and,distrusted,one,another,as,heartily,as,the,first,triumvirate,of,rome,and,their,close,alliance,was,probably,for,the,same,reason
i,told,pitty,i,had,to,have,you,in,my,hospital,called,mrs,merriweather,smiling
don't,you,go,promising,mrs,meade,or,mrs
whiting
i,won't,said,scarlett,having,no,idea,what,mrs,merriwether,was,talking,about,but,feeling,a,glow,of,warmth,at,being,welcomed,and,wanted
i,hope,to,see,you,again,soon
the,carriage,plowed,its,way,farther,and,halted,for,a,moment,to,permit,two,ladies,with,baskets,of,bandages,on,their,arms,to,pick,precarious,passages,across,the,sloppy,street,on,stepping,stones
at,the,same,moment,scarlett's,eye,was,caught,by,a,figure,on,the,sidewalk,in,a,brightly,colored,dress,too,bright,for,street,wear,covered,by,a,paisley,shawl,with,fringes,to,the,heels
turning,she,saw,a,tall,handsome,woman,with,a,bold,face,and,a,mass,of,red,hair,too,red,to,be,true
it,was,the,first,time,she,had,ever,seen,any,woman,who,she,knew,for,certain,had,done,something,to,her,hair,and,she,watched,her,fascinated
uncle,peter,who,is,that
she,whispered
ah,doan,know
you,do,too
i,can,tell
who,is,she
her,name,belle,watling,said,uncle,peter,his,lower,lip,beginning,to,protrude
scarlett,was,quick,to,catch,the,fact,that,he,had,not,preceded,the,name,with,miss,or,mrs
who,is,she
miss,scarlett,said,peter,darkly,laying,the,whip,on,the,startled,horse,miss,pitty,ain',gwine,ter,lak,it,you,astin',questions,dat,ain',none,of,yo',bizness
dey's,a,passel,of,no-,count,folks,in,dis,town,now,dat,it,ain',no,use,talkin',about
good,heavens
thought,scarlett,reproved,into,silence
that,must,be,a,bad,woman
she,had,never,seen,a,bad,woman,before,and,she,twisted,her,head,and,stared,after,her,until,she,was,lost,in,the,crowd
the,stores,and,the,new,war,buildings,were,farther,apart,now,with,vacant,lots,between
finally,the,business,section,fell,behind,and,the,residences,came,into,view
scarlett,picked,them,out,as,old,friends,the,leyden,house,dignified,and,stately,the,bonnells',with,little,white,columns,and,green,blinds,the,close-lipped,red-,brick,georgian,home,of,the,mclure,family,behind,its,low,box,hedges
their,progress,was,slower,now,for,from,porches,and,gardens,and,sidewalks,ladies,called,to,her
some,she,knew,slightly,others,she,vaguely,remembered,but,most,of,them,she,knew,not,at,all
pittypat,had,certainly,broadcast,her,arrival
little,wade,had,to,be,held,up,time,and,again,so,that,ladies,who,ventured,as,far,through,the,ooze,as,their,carriage,blocks,could,exclaim,over,him
they,all,cried,to,her,that,she,must,join,their,knitting,and,sewing,circles,and,their,hospital,committees,and,no,one,else's,and,she,promised,recklessly,to,right,and,left
as,they,passed,a,rambling,green,clapboard,house,a,little,black,girl,posted,on,the,front,steps,cried,hyah,she,come,and,dr,meade,and,his,wife,and,little,thirteen-year-old,phil,emerged,calling,greetings
scarlett,recalled,that,they,too,had,been,at,her,wedding
mrs,meade,mounted,her,carriage,block,and,craned,her,neck,for,a,view,of,the,baby,but,the,doctor,disregarding,the,mud,plowed,through,to,the,side,of,the,carriage
he,was,tall,and,gaunt,and,wore,a,pointed,beard,of,iron,gray,and,his,clothes,hung,on,his,spare,figure,as,though,blown,there,by,a,hurricane
atlanta,considered,him,the,root,of,all,strength,and,all,wisdom,and,it,was,not,strange,that,he,had,absorbed,something,of,their,belief
but,for,all,his,habit,of,making,oracular,statements,and,his,slightly,pompous,manner,he,was,as,kindly,a,man,as,the,town,possessed
after,shaking,her,hand,and,prodding,wade,in,the,stomach,and,complimenting,him,the,doctor,announced,that,aunt,pittypat,had,promised,on,oath,that,scarlett,should,be,on,no,other,hospital,and,bandage-rolling,committee,save,mrs,meade's
oh,dear,but,i've,promised,a,thousand,ladies,already
said,scarlett
mrs,merriwether,i'll,be,bound
cried,mrs,meade,indignantly
drat,the,woman
i,believe,she,meets,every,train
i,promised,because,i,hadn't,a,notion,what,it,was,all,about,scarlett,confessed
what,are,hospital,committees,anyway
both,the,doctor,and,his,wife,looked,slightly,shocked,at,her,ignorance
but,of,course,you've,been,buried,in,the,country,and,couldn't,know,mrs,meade,apologized,for,her
we,have,nursing,committees,for,different,hospitals,and,for,different,days
we,nurse,the,men,and,help,the,doctors,and,make,bandages,and,clothes,and,when,the,men,are,well,enough,to,leave,the,hospitals,we,take,them,into,our,homes,to,convalesce,till,they,are,able,to,go,back,in,the,army
and,we,look,after,the,wives,and,families,of,some,of,the,wounded,who,are,destitute,yes,worse,than,destitute
dr,meade,is,at,the,institute,hospital,where,my,committee,works,and,everyone,says,he's,marvelous,and
there,there,mrs,meade,said,the,doctor,fondly
don't,go,bragging,on,me,in,front,of,folks
it's,little,enough,i,can,do,since,you,wouldn't,let,me,go,in,the,army
'wouldn't,let,'
she,cried,indignantly
me
the,town,wouldn't,let,you,and,you,know,it
why,scarlett,when,folks,heard,he,was,intending,to,go,to,virginia,as,an,army,surgeon,all,the,ladies,signed,a,petition,begging,him,to,stay,here
of,course,the,town,couldn't,do,without,you
there,there,mrs,meade,said,the,doctor,basking,obviously,in,the,praise
perhaps,with,one,boy,at,the,front,that's,enough,for,the,time,being
and,i'm,going,next,year
cried,little,phil,hopping,about,excitedly
as,a,drummer,boy
i'm,learning,how,to,drum,now
do,you,want,to,hear,me
i'll,run,get,my,drum
no,not,now,said,mrs,meade,drawing,him,closer,to,her,a,sudden,look,of,strain,coming,over,her,face
not,next,year,darling
maybe,the,year,after
but,the,war,will,be,over,then
he,cried,petulantly,pulling,away,from,her
and,you,promised
over,his,head,the,eyes,of,the,parents,met,and,scarlett,saw,the,look
darcy,meade,was,in,virginia,and,they,were,clinging,closer,to,the,little,boy,that,was,left
uncle,peter,cleared,his,throat
miss,pitty,were,in,a,state,when,ah,lef',home,an',ef,ah,doan,git,dar,soon,she'll,done,swooned

and,you,tell,pitty,for,me,that,if,you,aren't,on,my,committee,she's,going,to,be,in,a,worse,state
the,carriage,slipped,and,slid,down,the,muddy,road,and,scarlett,leaned,back,on,the,cushions,and,smiled
she,felt,better,now,than,she,had,felt,in,months
atlanta,with,its,crowds,and,its,hurry,and,its,undercurrent,of,driving,excitement,was,very,pleasant,very,exhilarating,so,very,much,nicer,than,the,lonely,plantation,out,from,charleston,where,the,bellow,of,alligators,broke,the,night,stillness,better,than,charleston,itself,dreaming,in,its,gardens,behind,its,high,walls,better,than,savannah,with,its,wide,streets,lined,with,palmetto,and,the,muddy,river,beside,it
yes,and,temporarily,even,better,than,tara,dear,though,tara,was
there,was,something,exciting,about,this,town,with,its,narrow,muddy,streets,lying,among,rolling,red,hills,something,raw,and,crude,that,appealed,to,the,rawness,and,crudeness,underlying,the,fine,veneer,that,ellen,and,mammy,had,given,her
she,suddenly,felt,that,this,was,where,she,belonged,not,in,serene,and,quiet,old,cities,flat,beside,yellow,waters
the,houses,were,farther,and,farther,apart,now,and,leaning,out,scarlett,saw,the,red,brick,and,slate,roof,of,miss,pittypat's,house
it,was,almost,the,last,house,on,the,north,side,of,town
beyond,it,peachtree,road,narrowed,and,twisted,under,great,trees,out,of,sight,into,thick,quiet,woods
the,neat,wooden-paneled,fence,had,been,newly,painted,white,and,the,front,yard,it,inclosed,was,yellow,starred,with,the,last,jonquils,of,the,season
on,the,front,steps,stood,two,women,in,black,and,behind,them,a,large,yellow,woman,with,her,hands,under,her,apron,and,her,white,teeth,showing,in,a,wide,smile
plump,miss,pittypat,was,teetering,excitedly,on,tiny,feet,one,hand,pressed,to,her,copious,bosom,to,still,her,fluttering,heart
scarlett,saw,melanie,standing,by,her,and,with,a,surge,of,dislike,she,realized,that,the,fly,in,the,ointment,of,atlanta,would,be,this,slight,little,person,in,black,mourning,dress,her,riotous,dark,curls,subdued,to,matronly,smoothness,and,a,loving,smile,of,welcome,and,happiness,on,her,heart-shaped,face
when,a,southerner,took,the,trouble,to,pack,a,trunk,and,travel,twenty,miles,for,a,visit,the,visit,was,seldom,of,shorter,duration,than,a,month,usually,much,longer
southerners,were,as,enthusiastic,visitors,as,they,were,hosts,and,there,was,nothing,unusual,in,relatives,coming,to,spend,the,christmas,holidays,and,remaining,until,july
often,when,newly,married,couples,went,on,the,usual,round,of,honeymoon,visits,they,lingered,in,some,pleasant,home,until,the,birth,of,their,second,child
frequently,elderly,aunts,and,uncles,came,to,sunday,dinner,and,remained,until,they,were,buried,years,later
visitors,presented,no,problem,for,houses,were,large,servants,numerous,and,the,feeding,of,several,extra,mouths,a,minor,matter,in,that,land,of,plenty
all,ages,and,sexes,went,visiting,honeymooners,young,mothers,showing,off,new,babies,convalescents,the,bereaved,girls,whose,parents,were,anxious,to,remove,them,from,the,dangers,of,unwise,matches,girls,who,had,reached,the,danger,age,without,becoming,engaged,and,who,it,was,hoped,would,make,suitable,matches,under,the,guidance,of,relatives,in,other,places
visitors,added,excitement,and,variety,to,the,slow-moving,southern,life,and,they,were,always,welcome
so,scarlett,had,come,to,atlanta,with,no,idea,as,to,how,long,she,would,remain
if,her,visit,proved,as,dull,as,those,in,savannah,and,charleston,she,would,return,home,in,a,month
if,her,stay,was,pleasant,she,would,remain,indefinitely
but,no,sooner,had,she,arrived,than,aunt,pitty,and,melanie,began,a,campaign,to,induce,her,to,make,her,home,permanently,with,them
they,brought,up,every,possible,argument
they,wanted,her,for,her,own,self,because,they,loved,her
they,were,lonely,and,often,frightened,at,night,in,the,big,house,and,she,was,so,brave,she,gave,them,courage
she,was,so,charming,that,she,cheered,them,in,their,sorrow
now,that,charles,was,dead,her,place,and,her,son's,place,were,with,his,kindred
besides,half,the,house,now,belonged,to,her,through,charles',will
last,the,confederacy,needed,every,pair,of,hands,for,sewing,knitting,bandage,rolling,and,nursing,the,wounded
charles',uncle,henry,hamilton,who,lived,in,bachelor,state,at,the,atlanta,hotel,near,the,depot,also,talked,seriously,to,her,on,this,subject
uncle,henry,was,a,short,pot-bellied,irascible,old,gentleman,with,a,pink,face,a,shock,of,long,silver,hair,and,an,utter,lack,of,patience,with,feminine,timidities,and,vaporings
it,was,for,the,latter,reason,that,he,was,barely,on,speaking,terms,with,his,sister,miss,pittypat
from,childhood,they,had,been,exact,opposites,in,temperament,and,they,had,been,further,estranged,by,his,objections,to,the,manner,in,which,she,had,reared,charles,making,a,damn,sissy,out,of,a,soldier's,son
years,before,he,had,so,insulted,her,that,now,miss,pitty,never,spoke,of,him,except,in,guarded,whispers,and,with,so,great,reticence,that,a,stranger,would,have,thought,the,honest,old,lawyer,a,murderer,at,the,least
the,insult,had,occurred,on,a,day,when,pitty,wished,to,draw,five,hundred,dollars,from,her,estate,of,which,he,was,trustee,to,invest,in,a,non-existent,gold,mine
he,had,refused,to,permit,it,and,stated,heatedly,that,she,had,no,more,sense,than,a,june,bug,and,furthermore,it,gave,him,the,fidgets,to,be,around,her,longer,than,five,minutes
since,that,day,she,only,saw,him,formally,once,a,month,when,uncle,peter,drove,her,to,his,office,to,get,the,housekeeping,money
after,these,brief,visits,pitty,always,took,to,her,bed,for,the,rest,of,the,day,with,tears,and,smelling,salts
melanie,and,charles,who,were,on,excellent,terms,with,their,uncle,had,frequently,offered,to,relieve,her,of,this,ordeal,but,pitty,always,set,her,babyish,mouth,firmly,and,refused
henry,was,her,cross,and,she,must,bear,him
from,this,charles,and,melanie,could,only,infer,that,she,took,a,profound,pleasure,in,this,occasional,excitement,the,only,excitement,in,her,sheltered,life
uncle,henry,liked,scarlett,immediately,because,he,said,he,could,see,that,for,all,her,silly,affectations,she,had,a,few,grains,of,sense
he,was,trustee,not,only,of,pitty's,and,melanie's,estates,but,also,of,that,left,scarlett,by,charles
it,came,to,scarlett,as,a,pleasant,surprise,that,she,was,now,a,well-to-do,young,woman,for,charles,had,not,only,left,her,half,of,aunt,pitty's,house,but,farm,lands,and,town,property,as,well
and,the,stores,and,warehouses,along,the,railroad,track,near,the,depot,which,were,part,of,her,inheritance,had,tripled,in,value,since,the,war,began
it,was,when,uncle,henry,was,giving,her,an,account,of,her,property,that,he,broached,the,matter,of,her,permanent,residence,in,atlanta
when,wade,hampton,comes,of,age,he's,going,to,be,a,rich,young,man,he,said
the,way,atlanta,is,growing,his,property,will,be,ten,times,more,valuable,in,twenty,years,and,it's,only,right,that,the,boy,should,be,raised,where,his,property,is,so,he,can,learn,to,take,care,of,it,yes,and,of,pitty's,and,melanie's,too
he'll,be,the,only,man,of,the,hamilton,name,left,before,long,for,i,won't,be,here,forever
as,for,uncle,peter,he,took,it,for,granted,that,scarlett,had,come,to,stay
it,was,inconceivable,to,him,that,charles',only,son,should,be,reared,where,he,could,not,supervise,the,rearing
to,all,these,arguments,scarlett,smiled,but,said,nothing,unwilling,to,commit,herself,before,learning,how,she,would,like,atlanta,and,constant,association,with,her,in-laws
she,knew,too,that,gerald,and,ellen,would,have,to,be,won,over
moreover,now,that,she,was,away,from,tara,she,missed,it,dreadfully,missed,the,red,fields,and,the,springing,green,cotton,and,the,sweet,twilight,silences
for,the,first,time,she,realized,dimly,what,gerald,had,meant,when,he,said,that,the,love,of,the,land,was,in,her,blood
so,she,gracefully,evaded,for,the,time,being,a,definite,answer,as,to,the,duration,of,her,visit,and,slipped,easily,into,the,life,of,the,red-brick,house,at,the,quiet,end,of,peachtree,street
living,with,charles',blood,kin,seeing,the,home,from,which,he,came
scarlett,could,now,understand,a,little,better,the,boy,who,had,made,her,wife,widow,and,mother,in,such,rapid,succession
it,was,easy,to,see,why,he,had,been,so,shy,so,unsophisticated,so,idealistic
if,charles,had,inherited,any,of,the,qualities,of,the,stern,fearless,hot-tempered,soldier,who,had,been,his,father,they,had,been,obliterated,in,childhood,by,the,ladylike,atmosphere,in,which,he,had,been,reared
he,had,been,devoted,to,the,childlike,pitty,and,closer,than,brothers,usually,are,to,melanie,and,two,more,sweet,unworldly,women,could,not,be,found
aunt,pittypat,had,been,christened,sarah,jane,hamilton,sixty,years,before,but,since,the,long-past,day,when,her,doting,father,had,fastened,his,nickname,upon,her,because,of,her,airy,restless,pattering,little,feet,no,one,had,called,her,anything,else
in,the,years,that,followed,that,second,christening,many,changes,had,taken,place,in,her,that,made,the,pet,name,incongruous
of,the,swiftly,scampering,child,all,that,now,remained,were,two,tiny,feet,inadequate,to,her,weight,and,a,tendency,to,prattle,happily,and,aimlessly
she,was,stout,pink-cheeked,and,silver-haired,and,always,a,little,breathless,from,too,tightly,laced,stays
she,was,unable,to,walk,more,than,a,block,on,the,tiny,feet,which,she,crammed,into,too,small,slippers
she,had,a,heart,which,fluttered,at,any,excitement,and,she,pampered,it,shamelessly,fainting,at,any,provocation
everyone,knew,that,her,swoons,were,generally,mere,ladylike,pretenses,but,they,loved,her,enough,to,refrain,from,saying,so
everyone,loved,her,spoiled,her,like,a,child,and,refused,to,take,her,seriously,everyone,except,her,brother,henry
she,liked,gossip,better,than,anything,else,in,the,world,even,more,than,she,liked,the,pleasures,of,the,table,and,she,prattled,on,for,hours,about,other,people's,affairs,in,a,harmless,kindly,way
she,had,no,memory,for,names,dates,or,places,and,frequently,confused,the,actors,in,one,atlanta,drama,with,the,actors,in,another,which,misled,no,one,for,no,one,was,foolish,enough,to,take,seriously,anything,she,said
no,one,ever,told,her,anything,really,shocking,or,scandalous,for,her,spinster,state,must,be,protected,even,if,she,was,sixty,years,old,and,her,friends,were,in,a,kindly,conspiracy,to,keep,her,a,sheltered,and,petted,old,child
melanie,was,like,her,aunt,in,many,ways
she,had,her,shyness,her,sudden,blushes,her,modesty,but,she,did,have,common,sense,of,a,sort,i'll,admit,that,scarlett,thought,grudgingly
like,aunt,pitty,melanie,had,the,face,of,a,sheltered,child,who,had,never,known,anything,but,simplicity,and,kindness,truth,and,love,a,child,who,had,never,looked,upon,harshness,or,evil,and,would,not,recognize,them,if,she,saw,them
because,she,had,always,been,happy,she,wanted,everyone,about,her,to,be,happy,or,at,least,pleased,with,themselves
to,this,end,she,always,saw,the,best,in,everyone,and,remarked,kindly,upon,it
there,was,no,servant,so,stupid,that,she,did,not,find,some,redeeming,trait,of,loyalty,and,kind-heartedness,no,girl,so,ugly,and,disagreeable,that,she,could,not,discover,grace,of,form,or,nobility,of,character,in,her,and,no,man,so,worthless,or,so,boring,that,she,did,not,view,him,in,the,light,of,his,possibilities,rather,than,his,actualities
because,of,these,qualities,that,came,sincerely,and,spontaneously,from,a,generous,heart,everyone,flocked,about,her,for,who,can,resist,the,charm,of,one,who,discovers,in,others,admirable,qualities,undreamed,of,even,by,himself
she,had,more,girl,friends,than,anyone,in,town,and,more,men,friends,too,though,she,had,few,beaux,for,she,lacked,the,willfulness,and,selfishness,that,go,far,toward,trapping,men's,hearts
what,melanie,did,was,no,more,than,all,southern,girls,were,taught,to,do,to,make,those,about,them,feel,at,ease,and,pleased,with,themselves
it,was,this,happy,feminine,conspiracy,which,made,southern,society,so,pleasant
women,knew,that,a,land,where,men,were,contented,uncontradicted,and,safe,in,possession,of,unpunctured,vanity,was,likely,to,be,a,very,pleasant,place,for,women,to,live
so,from,the,cradle,to,the,grave,women,strove,to,make,men,pleased,with,themselves,and,the,satisfied,men,repaid,lavishly,with,gallantry,and,adoration
in,fact,men,willingly,gave,the,ladies,everything,in,the,world,except,credit,for,having,intelligence
scarlett,exercised,the,same,charms,as,melanie,but,with,a,studied,artistry,and,consummate,skill
the,difference,between,the,two,girls,lay,in,the,fact,that,melanie,spoke,kind,and,flattering,words,from,a,desire,to,make,people,happy,if,only,temporarily,and,scarlett,never,did,it,except,to,further,her,own,aims
from,the,two,he,loved,best,charles,had,received,no,toughening,influences,learned,nothing,of,harshness,or,reality,and,the,home,in,which,he,grew,to,manhood,was,as,soft,as,a,bird's,nest
it,was,such,a,quiet,old-fashioned,gentle,home,compared,with,tara
to,scarlett,this,house,cried,out,for,the,masculine,smells,of,brandy,tobacco,and,macassar,oil,for,hoarse,voices,and,occasional,curses,for,guns,for,whiskers,for,saddles,and,bridles,and,for,hounds,underfoot
she,missed,the,sounds,of,quarreling,voices,that,were,always,heard,at,tara,when,ellen's,back,was,turned,mammy,quarreling,with,pork,rosa,and,teena,bickering,her,own,acrimonious,arguments,with,suellen,gerald's,bawling,threats
no,wonder,charles,had,been,a,sissy,coming,from,a,home,like,this
here,excitement,never,entered,in,voices,were,never,raised,everyone,deferred,gently,to,the,opinions,of,others,and,in,the,end,the,black,grizzled,autocrat,in,the,kitchen,had,his,way
scarlett,who,had,hoped,for,a,freer,rein,when,she,escaped,mammy's,supervision,discovered,to,her,sorrow,that,uncle,peter's,standards,of,ladylike,conduct,especially,for,mist',charles',widow,were,even,stricter,than,mammy's
in,such,a,household,scarlett,came,back,to,herself,and,almost,before,she,realized,it,her,spirits,rose,to,normal
she,was,only,seventeen,she,had,superb,health,and,energy,and,charles',people,did,their,best,to,make,her,happy
if,they,fell,a,little,short,of,this,it,was,not,their,fault,for,no,one,could,take,out,of,her,heart,the,ache,that,throbbed,whenever,ashley's,name,was,mentioned
and,melanie,mentioned,it,so,often
but,melanie,and,pitty,were,tireless,in,planning,ways,to,soothe,the,sorrow,under,which,they,thought,she,labored
they,put,their,own,grief,into,the,background,in,order,to,divert,her
they,fussed,about,her,food,and,her,hours,for,taking,afternoon,naps,and,for,taking,carriage,rides
they,not,only,admired,her,extravagantly,her,high-spiritedness,her,figure,her,tiny,hands,and,feet,her,white,skin,but,they,said,so,frequently,petting,hugging,and,kissing,her,to,emphasize,their,loving,words
scarlett,did,not,care,for,the,caresses,but,she,basked,in,the,compliments
no,one,at,tara,had,ever,said,so,many,charming,things,about,her
in,fact,mammy,had,spent,her,time,deflating,her,conceit
little,wade,was,no,longer,an,annoyance,for,the,family,black,and,white,and,the,neighbors,idolized,him,and,there,was,a,never-ceasing,rivalry,as,to,whose,lap,he,should,occupy
melanie,especially,doted,on,him
even,in,his,worst,screaming,spells,melanie,thought,him,adorable,and,said,so,adding,oh,you,precious,darling
i,just,wish,you,were,mine
sometimes,scarlett,found,it,hard,to,dissemble,her,feelings,for,she,still,thought,aunt,pitty,the,silliest,of,old,ladies,and,her,vagueness,and,vaporings,irritated,her,unendurably
she,disliked,melanie,with,a,jealous,dislike,that,grew,as,the,days,went,by,and,sometimes,she,had,to,leave,the,room,abruptly,when,melanie,beaming,with,loving,pride,spoke,of,ashley,or,read,his,letters,aloud
but,all,in,all,life,went,on,as,happily,as,was,possible,under,the,circumstances
atlanta,was,more,interesting,than,savannah,or,charleston,or,tara,and,it,offered,so,many,strange,war-time,occupations,she,had,little,time,to,think,or,mope
but,sometimes,when,she,blew,out,the,candle,and,burrowed,her,head,into,the,pillow,she,sighed,and,thought,if,only,ashley,wasn't,married
if,only,i,didn't,have,to,nurse,in,that,plagued,hospital
oh,if,only,i,could,have,some,beaux
she,had,immediately,loathed,nursing,but,she,could,not,escape,this,duty,because,she,was,on,both,mrs,meade's,and,mrs,merriwether's,committees
that,meant,four,mornings,a,week,in,the,sweltering,stinking,hospital,with,her,hair,tied,up,in,a,towel,and,a,hot,apron,covering,her,from,neck,to,feet
every,matron,old,or,young,in,atlanta,nursed,and,did,it,with,an,enthusiasm,that,seemed,to,scarlett,little,short,of,fanatic
they,took,it,for,granted,that,she,was,imbued,with,their,own,patriotic,fervor,and,would,have,been,shocked,to,know,how,slight,an,interest,in,the,war,she,had
except,for,the,ever-present,torment,that,ashley,might,be,killed,the,war,interested,her,not,at,all,and,nursing,was,something,she,did,simply,because,she,didn't,know,how,to,get,out,of,it
certainly,there,was,nothing,romantic,about,nursing
to,her,it,meant,groans,delirium,death,and,smells
the,hospitals,were,filled,with,dirty,bewhiskered,verminous,men,who,smelled,terribly,and,bore,on,their,bodies,wounds,hideous,enough,to,turn,a,christian's,stomach
the,hospitals,stank,of,gangrene,the,odor,assaulting,her,nostrils,long,before,the,doors,were,reached,a,sickish,sweet,smell,that,clung,to,her,hands,and,hair,and,haunted,her,in,her,dreams
flies,mosquitoes,and,gnats,hovered,in,droning,singing,swarms,over,the,wards,tormenting,the,men,to,curses,and,weak,sobs,and,scarlett,scratching,her,own,mosquito,bites,swung,palmetto,fans,until,her,shoulders,ached,and,she,wished,that,all,the,men,were,dead
melanie,however,did,not,seem,to,mind,the,smells,the,wounds,or,the,nakedness,which,scarlett,thought,strange,in,one,who,was,the,most,timorous,and,modest,of,women
sometimes,when,holding,basins,and,instruments,while,dr,meade,cut,out,gangrened,flesh,melanie,looked,very,white
and,once,alter,such,an,operation,scarlett,found,her,in,the,linen,closet,vomiting,quietly,into,a,towel
but,as,long,as,she,was,where,the,wounded,could,see,her,she,was,gentle,sympathetic,and,cheerful,and,the,men,in,the,hospitals,called,her,an,angel,of,mercy
scarlett,would,have,liked,that,title,too,but,it,involved,touching,men,crawling,with,lice,running,fingers,down,throats,of,unconscious,patients,to,see,if,they,were,choking,on,swallowed,tobacco,quids,bandaging,stumps,and,picking,maggots,out,of,festering,flesh
no,she,did,not,like,nursing
perhaps,it,might,have,been,endurable,if,she,had,been,permitted,to,use,her,charms,on,the,convalescent,men,for,many,of,them,were,attractive,and,well,born,but,this,she,could,not,do,in,her,widowed,state
the,young,ladies,of,the,town,who,were,not,permitted,to,nurse,for,fear,they,would,see,sights,unfit,for,virgin,eyes,had,the,convalescent,wards,in,their,charge
unhampered,by,matrimony,or,widowhood,they,made,vast,inroads,on,the,convalescents,and,even,the,least,attractive,girls,scarlett,observed,gloomily,had,no,difficulty,in,getting,engaged
with,the,exception,of,desperately,ill,and,severely,wounded,men,scarlett's,was,a,completely,feminized,world,and,this,irked,her,for,she,neither,liked,nor,trusted,her,own,sex,and,worse,still,was,always,bored,by,it
but,on,three,afternoons,a,week,she,had,to,attend,sewing,circles,and,bandage-rolling,committees,of,melanie's,friends
the,girls,who,had,all,known,charles,were,very,kind,and,attentive,to,her,at,these,gatherings,especially,fanny,elsing,and,maybelle,merriwether,the,daughters,of,the,town,dowagers
but,they,treated,her,deferentially,as,if,she,were,old,and,finished,and,their,constant,chatter,of,dances,and,beaux,made,her,both,envious,of,their,pleasures,and,resentful,that,her,widowhood,barred,her,from,such,activities
why,she,was,three,times,as,attractive,as,fanny,and,maybelle
oh,how,unfair,life,was
how,unfair,that,everyone,should,think,her,heart,was,in,the,grave,when,it,wasn't,at,all
it,was,in,virginia,with,ashley
but,in,spite,of,these,discomforts,atlanta,pleased,her,very,well
and,her,visit,lengthened,as,the,weeks,slipped,by
chapter,ix
scarlett,sat,in,the,window,of,her,bedroom,that,midsummer,morning,and,disconsolately,watched,the,wagons,and,carriages,full,of,girls,soldiers,and,chaperons,ride,gaily,out,peachtree,road,in,search,of,woodland,decorations,for,the,bazaar,which,was,to,be,held,that,evening,for,the,benefit,of,the,hospitals
the,red,road,lay,checkered,in,shade,and,sun,glare,beneath,the,over-arching,trees,and,the,many,hooves,kicked,up,little,red,clouds,of,dust
one,wagon,ahead,of,the,others,bore,four,stout,negroes,with,axes,to,cut,evergreens,and,drag,down,the,vines,and,the,back,of,this,wagon,was,piled,high,with,napkin-covered,hampers,split-oak,baskets,of,lunch,and,a,dozen,watermelons
two,of,the,black,bucks,were,equipped,with,banjo,and,harmonica,and,they,were,rendering,a,spirited,version,of,if,you,want,to,have,a,good,time,jine,the,cavalry

everybody,was,riding,out,peachtree,road,to,gather,greenery,and,have,a,picnic,and,melon,cutting
everybody,thought,scarlett,morosely,except,me
they,all,waved,and,called,to,her,as,they,went,by,and,she,tried,to,respond,with,a,good,grace,but,it,was,difficult
a,hard,little,pain,had,started,in,her,heart,and,was,traveling,slowly,up,toward,her,throat,where,it,would,become,a,lump,and,the,lump,would,soon,become,tears
everybody,was,going,to,the,picnic,except,her
and,everybody,was,going,to,the,bazaar,and,the,ball,tonight,except,her
that,is,everybody,except,her,and,pittypat,and,melly,and,the,other,unfortunates,in,town,who,were,in,mourning
but,melly,and,pittypat,did,not,seem,to,mind
it,had,not,even,occurred,to,them,to,want,to,go
it,had,occurred,to,scarlett
and,she,did,want,to,go,tremendously
it,simply,wasn't,fair
she,had,worked,twice,as,hard,as,any,girl,in,town,getting,things,ready,for,the,bazaar
she,had,knitted,socks,and,baby,caps,and,afghans,and,mufflers,and,tatted,yards,of,lace,and,painted,china,hair,receivers,and,mustache,cups
and,she,had,embroidered,half,a,dozen,sofa-pillow,cases,with,the,confederate,flag,on,them
the,stars,were,a,bit,lopsided,to,be,sure,some,of,them,being,almost,round,and,others,having,six,or,even,seven,points,but,the,effect,was,good
yesterday,she,had,worked,until,she,was,worn,out,in,the,dusty,old,barn,of,an,armory,draping,yellow,and,pink,and,green,cheesecloth,on,the,booths,that,lined,the,walls
under,the,supervision,of,the,ladies',hospital,committee,this,was,plain,hard,work,and,no,fun,at,all
it,was,never,fun,to,be,around,mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,elsing,and,mrs,whiting,and,have,them,boss,you,like,you,were,one,of,the,darkies
and,have,to,listen,to,them,brag,about,how,popular,their,daughters,were
and,worst,of,all,she,had,burned,two,blisters,on,her,fingers,helping,pittypat,and,cookie,make,layer,cakes,for,raffling
and,now,having,worked,like,a,field,hand,she,had,to,retire,decorously,when,the,fun,was,just,beginning
oh,it,wasn't,fair,that,she,should,have,a,dead,husband,and,a,baby,yelling,in,the,next,room,and,be,out,of,everything,that,was,pleasant
just,a,little,over,a,year,ago,she,was,dancing,and,wearing,bright,clothes,instead,of,this,dark,mourning,and,was,practically,engaged,to,three,boys
she,was,only,seventeen,now,and,there,was,still,a,lot,of,dancing,left,in,her,feet
oh,it,wasn't,fair
life,was,going,past,her,down,a,hot,shady,summer,road,life,with,gray,uniforms,and,jingling,spurs,and,flowered,organdie,dresses,and,banjos,playing
she,tried,not,to,smile,and,wave,too,enthusiastically,to,the,men,she,knew,best,the,ones,she'd,nursed,in,the,hospital,but,it,was,hard,to,subdue,her,dimples,hard,to,look,as,though,her,heart,were,in,the,grave,when,it,wasn't
her,bowing,and,waving,were,abruptly,halted,when,pittypat,entered,the,room,panting,as,usual,from,climbing,the,stairs,and,jerked,her,away,from,the,window,unceremoniously
have,you,lost,your,mind,honey,waving,at,men,out,of,your,bedroom,window

oh,auntie,don't,cry
oh,now,i've,made,you,cry,too,sobbed,pittypat,in,a,pleased,way,fumbling,in,her,skirt,pocket,for,her,handkerchief
the,hard,little,pain,had,at,last,reached,scarlett's,throat,and,she,wailed,out,loud,not,as,pittypat,thought,for,poor,charlie,but,because,the,last,sounds,of,the,wheels,and,the,laughter,were,dying,away
melanie,rustled,in,from,her,room,a,worried,frown,puckering,her,forehead,a,brush,in,her,hands,her,usually,tidy,black,hair,freed,of,its,net,fluffing,about,her,face,in,a,mass,of,tiny,curls,and,waves
darlings
what,is,the,matter
charlie
sobbed,pittypat,surrendering,utterly,to,the,pleasure,of,her,grief,and,burying,her,head,on,melly's,shoulder
oh,said,melly,her,lip,quivering,at,the,mention,of,her,brother's,name
be,brave,dear
don't,cry
oh,scarlett
scarlett,had,thrown,herself,on,the,bed,and,was,sobbing,at,the,top,of,her,voice,sobbing,for,her,lost,youth,and,the,pleasures,of,youth,that,were,denied,her,sobbing,with,the,indignation,and,despair,of,a,child,who,once,could,get,anything,she,wanted,by,sobbing,and,now,knows,that,sobbing,can,no,longer,help,her
she,burrowed,her,head,in,the,pillow,and,cried,and,kicked,her,feet,at,the,tufted,counterpane
i,might,as,well,be,dead
she,sobbed,passionately
before,such,an,exhibition,of,grief,pittypat's,easy,tears,ceased,and,melly,flew,to,the,bedside,to,comfort,her,sister-in-law
dear,don't,cry
try,to,think,how,much,charlie,loved,you,and,let,that,comfort,you
try,to,think,of,your,darling,baby
indignation,at,being,misunderstood,mingled,with,scarlett's,forlorn,feeling,of,being,out,of,everything,and,strangled,all,utterance
that,was,fortunate,for,if,she,could,have,spoken,she,would,have,cried,out,truths,couched,in,gerald's,forthright,words
melanie,patted,her,shoulder,and,pittypat,tiptoed,heavily,about,the,room,pulling,down,the,shades
don't,do,that
shouted,scarlett,raising,a,red,and,swollen,face,from,the,pillow
i'm,not,dead,enough,for,you,to,pull,down,the,shades,though,i,might,as,well,be
oh,do,go,away,and,leave,me,alone
she,sank,her,face,into,the,pillow,again,and,after,a,whispered,conference,the,two,standing,over,her,tiptoed,out
she,heard,melanie,say,to,pittypat,in,a,low,voice,as,they,went,down,the,stairs
aunt,pitty,i,wish,you,wouldn't,speak,of,charles,to,her
you,know,how,it,always,affects,her
poor,thing,she,gets,that,queer,look,and,i,know,she's,trying,not,to,cry
we,mustn't,make,it,harder,for,her
scarlett,kicked,the,coverlet,in,impotent,rage,trying,to,think,of,something,bad,enough,to,say
god's,nightgown
she,cried,at,last,and,felt,somewhat,relieved
how,could,melanie,be,content,to,stay,at,home,and,never,have,any,fun,and,wear,crepe,for,her,brother,when,she,was,only,eighteen,years,old
melanie,did,not,seem,to,know,or,care,that,life,was,riding,by,with,jingling,spurs
but,she's,such,a,stick,thought,scarlett,pounding,the,pillow
and,she,never,was,popular,like,me,so,she,doesn't,miss,the,things,i,miss
and,and,besides,she's,got,ashley,and,i,i,haven't,got,anybody
and,at,this,fresh,woe,she,broke,into,renewed,outcries
she,remained,gloomily,in,her,room,until,afternoon,and,then,the,sight,of,the,returning,picnickers,with,wagons,piled,high,with,pine,boughs,vines,and,ferns,did,not,cheer,her
everyone,looked,happily,tired,as,they,waved,to,her,again,and,she,returned,their,greetings,drearily
life,was,a,hopeless,affair,and,certainly,not,worth,living
deliverance,came,in,the,form,she,least,expected,when,during,the,after-dinner-nap,period,mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,elsing,drove,up
startled,at,having,callers,at,such,an,hour,melanie,scarlett,and,aunt,pittypat,roused,themselves,hastily,hooked,their,basques,smoothed,their,hair,and,descended,to,the,parlor
mrs,bonnell's,children,have,the,measles,said,mrs,merriwether,abruptly,showing,plainly,that,she,held,mrs,bonnell,personally,responsible,for,permitting,such,a,thing,to,happen
and,the,mclure,girls,have,been,called,to,virginia,said,mrs,elsing,in,her,die-away,voice,fanning,herself,languidly,as,if,neither,this,nor,anything,else,mattered,very,much
dallas,mclure,is,wounded
how,dreadful
chorused,their,hostesses
is,poor,dallas
no
just,through,the,shoulder,said,mrs,merriwether,briskly
but,it,couldn't,possibly,have,happened,at,a,worse,time
the,girls,are,going,north,to,bring,him,home
but,skies,above,we,haven't,time,to,sit,here,talking
we,must,hurry,back,to,the,armory,and,get,the,decorating,done
pitty,we,need,you,and,melly,tonight,to,take,mrs,bonnell's,and,the,mclure,girls',places
oh,but,dolly,we,can't,go

we,need,you,to,watch,the,darkies,with,the,refreshments
that,was,what,mrs,bonnell,was,to,do
and,melly,you,must,take,the,mclure,girls',booth
oh,we,just,couldn't,with,poor,charlie,dead,only,a
i,know,how,you,feel,but,there,isn't,any,sacrifice,too,great,for,the,cause,broke,in,mrs,elsing,in,a,soft,voice,that,settled,matters
oh,we'd,love,to,help,but,why,can't,you,get,some,sweet,pretty,girls,to,take,the,booths
mrs,merriwether,snorted,a,trumpeting,snort
i,don't,know,what's,come,over,the,young,people,these,days
they,have,no,sense,of,responsibility
all,the,girls,who,haven't,already,taken,booths,have,more,excuses,than,you,could,shake,a,stick,at
oh,they,don't,fool,me
they,just,don't,want,to,be,hampered,in,making,up,to,the,officers,that's,all
and,they're,afraid,their,new,dresses,won't,show,off,behind,booth,counters
i,wish,to,goodness,that,blockade,runner,what's,his,name
captain,butler,supplied,mrs,elsing
i,wish,he'd,bring,in,more,hospital,supplies,and,less,hoop,skirts,and,lace
if,i've,had,to,look,at,one,dress,today,i've,had,to,look,at,twenty,dresses,that,he,ran,in
captain,butler,i'm,sick,of,the,name
now,pitty,i,haven't,time,to,argue
you,must,come
everybody,will,understand
nobody,will,see,you,in,the,back,room,anyway,and,melly,won't,be,conspicuous
the,poor,mclure,girls',booth,is,way,down,at,the,end,and,not,very,pretty,so,nobody,will,notice,you
i,think,we,should,go,said,scarlett,trying,to,curb,her,eagerness,and,to,keep,her,face,earnest,and,simple
it,is,the,least,we,can,do,for,the,hospital
neither,of,the,visiting,ladies,had,even,mentioned,her,name,and,they,turned,and,looked,sharply,at,her
even,in,their,extremity,they,had,not,considered,asking,a,widow,of,scarcely,a,year,to,appear,at,a,social,function
scarlett,bore,their,gaze,with,a,wide-eyed,childlike,expression
i,think,we,should,go,and,help,to,make,it,a,success,all,of,us
i,think,i,should,go,in,the,booth,with,melly,because,well,i,think,it,would,look,better,for,us,both,to,be,there,instead,of,just,one
don't,you,think,so,melly
well,began,melly,helplessly
the,idea,of,appearing,publicly,at,a,social,gathering,while,in,mourning,was,so,unheard,of,she,was,bewildered
scarlett's,right,said,mrs,merriwether,observing,signs,of,weakening
she,rose,and,jerked,her,hoops,into,place
both,of,you,all,of,you,must,come
now,pitty,don't,start,your,excuses,again
just,think,how,much,the,hospital,needs,money,for,new,beds,and,drugs
and,i,know,charlie,would,like,you,to,help,the,cause,he,died,for
well,said,pittypat,helpless,as,always,in,the,presence,of,a,stronger,personality,if,you,think,people,will,understand
too,good,to,be,true
too,good,to,be,true
said,scarlett's,joyful,heart,as,she,slipped,unobtrusively,into,the,pink-and-yellow-draped,booth,that,was,to,have,been,the,mclure,girls'
actually,she,was,at,a,party
after,a,year's,seclusion,after,crepe,and,hushed,voices,and,nearly,going,crazy,with,boredom,she,was,actually,at,a,party,the,biggest,party,atlanta,had,ever,seen
and,she,could,see,people,and,many,lights,and,hear,music,and,view,for,herself,the,lovely,laces,and,frocks,and,frills,that,the,famous,captain,butler,had,run,through,the,blockade,on,his,last,trip
she,sank,down,on,one,of,the,little,stools,behind,the,counter,of,the,booth,and,looked,up,and,down,the,long,hall,which,until,this,afternoon,had,been,a,bare,and,ugly,drill,room
how,the,ladies,must,have,worked,today,to,bring,it,to,its,present,beauty
it,looked,lovely
every,candle,and,candlestick,in,atlanta,must,be,in,this,hall,tonight,she,thought,silver,ones,with,a,dozen,sprangling,arms,china,ones,with,charming,figurines,clustering,their,bases,old,brass,stands,erect,and,dignified,laden,with,candles,of,all,sizes,and,colors,smelling,fragrantly,of,bayberries,standing,on,the,gun,racks,that,ran,the,length,of,the,hall,on,the,long,flower-decked,tables,on,booth,counters,even,on,the,sills,of,the,open,windows,where,the,draughts,of,warm,summer,air,were,just,strong,enough,to,make,them,flare
in,the,center,of,the,hall,the,huge,ugly,lamp,hanging,from,the,ceiling,by,rusty,chains,was,completely,transformed,by,twining,ivy,and,wild,grapevines,that,were,already,withering,from,the,heat
the,walls,were,banked,with,pine,branches,that,gave,out,a,spicy,smell,making,the,corners,of,the,room,into,pretty,bowers,where,the,chaperons,and,old,ladies,would,sit
long,graceful,ropes,of,ivy,and,grapevine,and,smilax,were,hung,everywhere,in,looping,festoons,on,the,walls,draped,above,the,windows,twined,in,scallops,all,over,the,brightly,colored,cheesecloth,booths
and,everywhere,amid,the,greenery,on,flags,and,bunting,blazed,the,bright,stars,of,the,confederacy,on,their,background,of,red,and,blue
the,raised,platform,for,the,musicians,was,especially,artistic
it,was,completely,hidden,from,view,by,the,banked,greenery,and,starry,bunting,and,scarlett,knew,that,every,potted,and,tubbed,plant,in,town,was,there,coleus,geranium,hydrangea,oleander,elephant,ear,even,mrs,elsing's,four,treasured,rubber,plants,which,were,given,posts,of,honor,at,the,four,corners
at,the,other,end,of,the,hall,from,the,platform,the,ladies,had,eclipsed,themselves
on,this,wall,hung,large,pictures,of,president,davis,and,georgia's,own,little,alec,stephens,vice-,president,of,the,confederacy
above,them,was,an,enormous,flag,and,beneath,on,long,tables,was,the,loot,of,the,gardens,of,the,town,ferns,banks,of,roses,crimson,and,yellow,and,white,proud,sheaths,of,golden,gladioli,masses,of,varicolored,nasturtiums,tall,stiff,hollyhocks,rearing,deep,maroon,and,creamy,heads,above,the,other,flowers
among,them,candles,burned,serenely,like,altar,fires
the,two,faces,looked,down,on,the,scene,two,faces,as,different,as,could,be,possible,in,two,men,at,the,helm,of,so,momentous,an,undertaking,davis,with,the,flat,cheeks,and,cold,eyes,of,an,ascetic,his,thin,proud,lips,set,firmly,stephens,with,dark,burning,eyes,deep,socketed,in,a,face,that,had,known,nothing,but,sickness,and,pain,and,had,triumphed,over,them,with,humor,and,with,fire,two,faces,that,were,greatly,loved
the,elderly,ladies,of,the,committee,in,whose,hands,rested,the,responsibility,for,the,whole,bazaar,rustled,in,as,importantly,as,full-rigged,ships,hurried,the,belated,young,matrons,and,giggling,girls,into,their,booths,and,then,swept,through,the,doors,into,the,back,rooms,where,the,refreshments,were,being,laid,out
aunt,pitty,panted,out,after,them
the,musicians,clambered,upon,their,platform,black,grinning,their,fat,cheeks,already,shining,with,perspiration,and,began,tuning,their,fiddles,and,sawing,and,whanging,with,their,bows,in,anticipatory,importance
old,levi,mrs,merriwether's,coachman,who,had,led,the,orchestras,for,every,bazaar,ball,and,wedding,since,atlanta,was,named,marthasville,rapped,with,his,bow,for,attention
few,except,the,ladies,who,were,conducting,the,bazaar,had,arrived,yet,but,all,eyes,turned,toward,him
then,the,fiddles,bull,fiddles,accordions,banjos,and,knuckle-bones,broke,into,a,slow,rendition,of,lorena,too,slow,for,dancing,the,dancing,would,come,later,when,the,booths,were,emptied,of,their,wares
scarlett,felt,her,heart,beat,faster,as,the,sweet,melancholy,of,the,waltz,came,to,her
the,years,creep,slowly,by,lorena
the,snow,is,on,the,grass,again
the,sun's,far,down,the,sky,lorena
one-two-three,one-two-three,dip-sway,three,turn,two-three
what,a,beautiful,waltz
she,extended,her,hands,slightly,closed,her,eyes,and,swayed,with,the,sad,haunting,rhythm
there,was,something,about,the,tragic,melody,and,lorena's,lost,love,that,mingled,with,her,own,excitement,and,brought,a,lump,into,her,throat
then,as,if,brought,into,being,by,the,waltz,music,sounds,floated,in,from,the,shadowy,moonlit,street,below,the,trample,of,horses',hooves,and,the,sound,of,carriage,wheels,laughter,on,the,warm,sweet,air,and,the,soft,acrimony,of,negro,voices,raised,in,argument,over,hitching,places,for,the,horses
there,was,confusion,on,the,stairs,and,light-hearted,merriment,the,mingling,of,girls',fresh,voices,with,the,bass,notes,of,their,escorts,airy,cries,of,greeting,and,squeals,of,joy,as,girls,recognized,friends,from,whom,they,had,parted,only,that,afternoon
suddenly,the,hall,burst,into,life
it,was,full,of,girls,girls,who,floated,in,butterfly,bright,dresses,hooped,out,enormously,lace,pantalets,peeping,from,beneath,round,little,white,shoulders,bare,and,faintest,traces,of,soft,little,bosoms,showing,above,lace,flounces,lace,shawls,carelessly,hanging,from,arms,fans,spangled,and,painted,fans,of,swan's-down,and,peacock,feathers,dangling,at,wrists,by,tiny,velvet,ribbons,girls,with,masses,of,golden,curls,about,their,necks,and,fringed,gold,earbobs,that,tossed,and,danced,with,their,dancing,curls
laces,and,silks,and,braid,and,ribbons,all,blockade,run,all,the,more,precious,and,more,proudly,worn,because,of,it,finery,flaunted,with,an,added,pride,as,an,extra,affront,to,the,yankees
not,all,the,flowers,of,the,town,were,standing,in,tribute,to,the,leaders,of,the,confederacy
the,smallest,the,most,fragrant,blossoms,bedecked,the,girls
tea,roses,tucked,behind,pink,ears,cape,jessamine,and,bud,roses,in,round,little,garlands,over,cascades,of,side,curls,blossoms,thrust,demurely,into,satin,sashes,flowers,that,before,the,night,was,over,would,find,their,way,into,the,breast,pockets,of,gray,uniforms,as,treasured,souvenirs
there,were,so,many,uniforms,in,the,crowd,so,many,uniforms,on,so,many,men,whom,scarlett,knew,men,she,had,met,on,hospital,cots,on,the,streets,at,the,drill,ground
they,were,such,resplendent,uniforms,brave,with,shining,buttons,and,dazzling,with,twined,gold,braid,on,cuffs,and,collars,the,red,and,yellow,and,blue,stripes,on,the,trousers,for,the,different,branches,of,the,service,setting,off,the,gray,to,perfection
scarlet,and,gold,sashes,swung,to,and,fro,sabers,glittered,and,banged,against,shining,boots,spurs,rattled,and,jingled
such,handsome,men,thought,scarlett,with,a,swell,of,pride,in,her,heart,as,the,men,called,greetings,waved,to,friends,bent,low,over,the,hands,of,elderly,ladies
all,of,them,were,so,young,looking,even,with,their,sweeping,yellow,mustaches,and,full,black,and,brown,beards,so,handsome,so,reckless,with,their,arms,in,slings,with,head,bandages,startlingly,white,across,sun-browned,faces
some,of,them,were,on,crutches,and,how,proud,were,the,girls,who,solicitously,slowed,their,steps,to,their,escorts',hopping,pace
there,was,one,gaudy,splash,of,color,among,the,uniforms,that,put,the,girls',bright,finery,to,shame,and,stood,out,in,the,crowd,like,a,tropical,bird,a,louisiana,zouave,with,baggy,blue,and,white,striped,pants,cream,gaiters,and,tight,little,red,jacket,a,dark,grinning,little,monkey,of,a,man,with,his,arm,in,a,black,silk,sling
he,was,maybelle,merriwether's,especial,beau,rene,picard
the,whole,hospital,must,have,turned,out,at,least,everybody,who,could,walk,and,all,the,men,on,furlough,and,sick,leave,and,all,the,railroad,and,mail,service,and,hospital,and,commissary,departments,between,here,and,macon
how,pleased,the,ladies,would,be
the,hospital,should,make,a,mint,of,money,tonight
there,was,a,ruffle,of,drums,from,the,street,below,the,tramp,of,feet,the,admiring,cries,of,coachmen
a,bugle,blared,and,a,bass,voice,shouted,the,command,to,break,ranks
in,a,moment,the,home,guard,and,the,militia,unit,in,their,bright,uniforms,shook,the,narrow,stairs,and,crowded,into,the,room,bowing,saluting,shaking,hands
there,were,boys,in,the,home,guard,proud,to,be,playing,at,war,promising,themselves,they,would,be,in,virginia,this,time,next,year,if,the,war,would,just,last,that,long,old,men,with,white,beards,wishing,they,were,younger,proud,to,march,in,uniform,in,the,reflected,glory,of,sons,at,the,front
in,the,militia,there,were,many,middle-aged,men,and,some,older,men,but,there,was,a,fair,sprinkling,of,men,of,military,age,who,did,not,carry,themselves,quite,so,jauntily,as,their,elders,or,their,juniors
already,people,were,beginning,to,whisper,asking,why,they,were,not,with,lee
how,would,they,all,get,into,the,hall
it,had,seemed,such,a,large,place,a,few,minutes,before,and,now,it,was,packed,warm,with,summer-night,odors,of,sachet,and,cologne,water,and,hair,pomade,and,burning,bayberry,candles,fragrant,with,flowers,faintly,dusty,as,many,feet,trod,the,old,drill,floors
the,din,and,hubbub,of,voices,made,it,almost,impossible,to,hear,anything,and,as,if,feeling,the,joy,and,excitement,of,the,occasion,old,levi,choked,off,lorena,in,mid-bar,rapped,sharply,with,his,bow,and,sawing,away,for,dear,life,the,orchestra,burst,into,bonnie,blue,flag
a,hundred,voices,took,it,up,sang,it,shouted,it,like,a,cheer
the,home,guard,bugler,climbing,onto,the,platform,caught,up,with,the,music,just,as,the,chorus,began,and,the,high,silver,notes,soared,out,thrillingly,above,the,massed,singing,causing,goose,bumps,to,break,out,on,bare,arms,and,cold,chills,of,deeply,felt,emotion,to,fly,down,spines
hurrah
hurrah
for,the,southern,rights,hurrah
hurrah,for,the,bonnie,blue,flag,that,bears,a,single,star
they,crashed,into,the,second,verse,and,scarlett,singing,with,the,rest,heard,the,high,sweet,soprano,of,melanie,mounting,behind,her,clear,and,true,and,thrilling,as,the,bugle,notes
turning,she,saw,that,melly,was,standing,with,her,hands,clasped,to,her,breast,her,eyes,closed,and,tiny,tears,oozing,from,the,corners
she,smiled,at,scarlett,whimsically,as,the,music,ended,making,a,little,moue,of,apology,as,she,dabbed,with,her,handkerchief
i'm,so,happy,she,whispered,and,so,proud,of,the,soldiers,that,i,just,can't,help,crying,about,it
there,was,a,deep,almost,fanatic,glow,in,her,eyes,that,for,a,moment,lit,up,her,plain,little,face,and,made,it,beautiful
the,same,look,was,on,the,faces,of,all,the,women,as,the,song,ended,tears,of,pride,on,cheeks,pink,or,wrinkled,smiles,on,lips,a,deep,hot,glow,in,eyes,as,they,turned,to,their,men,sweetheart,to,lover,mother,to,son,wife,to,husband
they,were,all,beautiful,with,the,blinding,beauty,that,transfigures,even,the,plainest,woman,when,she,is,utterly,protected,and,utterly,loved,and,is,giving,back,that,love,a,thousandfold
they,loved,their,men,they,believed,in,them,they,trusted,them,to,the,last,breaths,of,their,bodies
how,could,disaster,ever,come,to,women,such,as,they,when,their,stalwart,gray,line,stood,between,them,and,the,yankees
had,there,ever,been,such,men,as,these,since,the,first,dawn,of,the,world,so,heroic,so,reckless,so,gallant,so,tender
how,could,anything,but,overwhelming,victory,come,to,a,cause,as,just,and,right,as,theirs
a,cause,they,loved,as,much,as,they,loved,their,men,a,cause,they,served,with,their,hands,and,their,hearts,a,cause,they,talked,about,thought,about,dreamed,about,a,cause,to,which,they,would,sacrifice,these,men,if,need,be,and,bear,their,loss,as,proudly,as,the,men,bore,their,battle,flags
it,was,high,tide,of,devotion,and,pride,in,their,hearts,high,tide,of,the,confederacy,for,final,victory,was,at,hand
stonewall,jackson's,triumphs,in,the,valley,and,the,defeat,of,the,yankees,in,the,seven,days',battle,around,richmond,showed,that,clearly
how,could,it,be,otherwise,with,such,leaders,as,lee,and,jackson
one,more,victory,and,the,yankees,would,be,on,their,knees,yelling,for,peace,and,the,men,would,be,riding,home,and,there,would,be,kissing,and,laughter
one,more,victory,and,the,war,was,over
of,course,there,were,empty,chairs,and,babies,who,would,never,see,their,fathers',faces,and,unmarked,graves,by,lonely,virginia,creeks,and,in,the,still,mountains,of,tennessee,but,was,that,too,great,a,price,to,pay,for,such,a,cause
silks,for,the,ladies,and,tea,and,sugar,were,hard,to,get,but,that,was,something,to,joke,about
besides,the,dashing,blockade,runners,were,bringing,in,these,very,things,under,the,yankees',disgruntled,noses,and,that,made,the,possession,of,them,many,times,more,thrilling
soon,raphael,semmes,and,the,confederate,navy,would,tend,to,those,yankee,gunboats,and,the,ports,would,be,wide,open
and,england,was,coming,in,to,help,the,confederacy,win,the,war,because,the,english,mills,were,standing,idle,for,want,of,southern,cotton
and,naturally,the,british,aristocracy,sympathized,with,the,confederacy,as,one,aristocrat,with,another,against,a,race,of,dollar,lovers,like,the,yankees
so,the,women,swished,their,silks,and,laughed,and,looking,on,their,men,with,hearts,bursting,with,pride,they,knew,that,love,snatched,in,the,face,of,danger,and,death,was,doubly,sweet,for,the,strange,excitement,that,went,with,it
when,first,she,looked,at,the,crowd,scarlett's,heart,had,thump-,thumped,with,the,unaccustomed,excitement,of,being,at,a,party,but,as,she,half-comprehendingly,saw,the,high-hearted,look,on,the,faces,about,her,her,joy,began,to,evaporate
every,woman,present,was,blazing,with,an,emotion,she,did,not,feel
it,bewildered,and,depressed,her
somehow,the,ball,did,not,seem,so,pretty,nor,the,girls,so,dashing,and,the,white,heat,of,devotion,to,the,cause,that,was,still,shining,on,every,face,seemed,why,it,just,seemed,silly
in,a,sudden,flash,of,self-knowledge,that,made,her,mouth,pop,open,with,astonishment,she,realized,that,she,did,not,share,with,these,women,their,fierce,pride,their,desire,to,sacrifice,themselves,and,everything,they,had,for,the,cause
before,horror,made,her,think,no,no
i,mustn't,think,such,things
they're,wrong,sinful,she,knew,the,cause,meant,nothing,at,all,to,her,and,that,she,was,bored,with,hearing,other,people,talk,about,it,with,that,fanatic,look,in,their,eyes
the,cause,didn't,seem,sacred,to,her
the,war,didn't,seem,to,be,a,holy,affair,but,a,nuisance,that,killed,men,senselessly,and,cost,money,and,made,luxuries,hard,to,get
she,saw,that,she,was,tired,of,the,endless,knitting,and,the,endless,bandage,rolling,and,lint,picking,that,roughened,the,cuticle,of,her,nails
and,oh,she,was,so,tired,of,the,hospital
tired,and,bored,and,nauseated,with,the,sickening,gangrene,smells,and,the,endless,moaning,frightened,by,the,look,that,coming,death,gave,to,sunken,faces
she,looked,furtively,around,her,as,the,treacherous,blasphemous,thoughts,rushed,through,her,mind,fearful,that,someone,might,find,them,written,clearly,upon,her,face
oh,why,couldn't,she,feel,like,those,other,women
they,were,whole,hearted,and,sincere,in,their,devotion,to,the,cause
they,really,meant,everything,they,said,and,did
and,if,anyone,should,ever,suspect,that,she,no,no,one,must,ever,know
she,must,go,on,making,a,pretense,of,enthusiasm,and,pride,in,the,cause,which,she,could,not,feel,acting,out,her,part,of,the,widow,of,a,confederate,officer,who,bears,her,grief,bravely,whose,heart,is,in,the,grave,who,feels,that,her,husband's,death,meant,nothing,if,it,aided,the,cause,to,triumph
oh,why,was,she,different,apart,from,these,loving,women
she,could,never,love,anything,or,anyone,so,selflessly,as,they,did
what,a,lonely,feeling,it,was,and,she,had,never,been,lonely,either,in,body,or,spirit,before
at,first,she,tried,to,stifle,the,thoughts,but,the,hard,self-honesty,that,lay,at,the,base,of,her,nature,would,not,permit,it
and,so,while,the,bazaar,went,on,while,she,and,melanie,waited,on,the,customers,who,came,to,their,booth,her,mind,was,busily,working,trying,to,justify,herself,to,herself,a,task,which,she,seldom,found,difficult
the,other,women,were,simply,silly,and,hysterical,with,their,talk,of,patriotism,and,the,cause,and,the,men,were,almost,as,bad,with,their,talk,of,vital,issues,and,states',rights
she,scarlett,o'hara,hamilton,alone,had,good,hard-headed,irish,sense
she,wasn't,going,to,make,a,fool,out,of,herself,about,the,cause,but,neither,was,she,going,to,make,a,fool,out,of,herself,by,admitting,her,true,feelings
she,was,hard-headed,enough,to,be,practical,about,the,situation,and,no,one,would,ever,know,how,she,felt
how,surprised,the,bazaar,would,be,if,they,knew,what,she,really,was,thinking
how,shocked,if,she,suddenly,climbed,on,the,bandstand,and,declared,that,she,thought,the,war,ought,to,stop,so,everybody,could,go,home,and,tend,to,their,cotton,and,there,could,be,parties,and,beaux,again,and,plenty,of,pale,green,dresses
for,a,moment,her,self-justification,buoyed,her,up,but,still,she,looked,about,the,hall,with,distaste
the,mclure,girls',booth,was,inconspicuous,as,mrs,merriwether,had,said,and,there,were,long,intervals,when,no,one,came,to,their,corner,and,scarlett,had,nothing,to,do,but,look,enviously,on,the,happy,throng
melanie,sensed,her,moodiness,but,crediting,it,to,longing,for,charlie,did,not,try,to,engage,her,in,conversation
she,busied,herself,arranging,the,articles,in,the,booth,in,more,attractive,display,while,scarlett,sat,and,looked,glumly,around,the,room
even,the,banked,flowers,below,the,pictures,of,mr,davis,and,mr,stephens,displeased,her
it,looks,like,an,altar,she,sniffed
and,the,way,they,all,carry,on,about,those,two,they,might,as,well,be,the,father,and,the,son
then,smitten,with,sudden,fright,at,her,irreverence,she,began,hastily,to,cross,herself,by,way,of,apology,but,caught,herself,in,time
well,it's,true,she,argued,with,her,conscience
everybody,carries,on,like,they,were,holy,and,they,aren't,anything,but,men,and,mighty,unattractive,looking,ones,at,that
of,course,mr,stephens,couldn't,help,how,he,looked,for,he,had,been,an,invalid,all,his,life,but,mr,davis,she,looked,up,at,the,cameo,clean,proud,face
it,was,his,goatee,that,annoyed,her,the,most
men,should,either,be,clean,shaven,mustached,or,wear,full,beards
that,little,wisp,looks,like,it,was,just,the,best,he,could,do,she,thought,not,seeing,in,his,face,the,cold,hard,intelligence,that,was,carrying,the,weight,of,a,new,nation
no,she,was,not,happy,now,and,at,first,she,had,been,radiant,with,the,pleasure,of,being,in,a,crowd
now,just,being,present,was,not,enough
she,was,at,the,bazaar,but,not,a,part,of,it
no,one,paid,her,any,attention,and,she,was,the,only,young,unmarried,woman,present,who,did,not,have,a,beau
and,all,her,life,she,had,enjoyed,the,center,of,the,stage
it,wasn't,fair
she,was,seventeen,years,old,and,her,feet,were,patting,the,floor,wanting,to,skip,and,dance
she,was,seventeen,years,old,and,she,had,a,husband,lying,at,oakland,cemetery,and,a,baby,in,his,cradle,at,aunt,pittypat's,and,everyone,thought,she,should,be,content,with,her,lot
she,had,a,whiter,bosom,and,a,smaller,waist,and,a,tinier,foot,than,any,girl,present,but,for,all,they,mattered,she,might,just,as,well,be,lying,beside,charles,with,beloved,wife,of,carved,over,her
she,wasn't,a,girl,who,could,dance,and,flirt,and,she,wasn't,a,wife,who,could,sit,with,other,wives,and,criticize,the,dancing,and,flirting,girls
and,she,wasn't,old,enough,to,be,a,widow
widows,should,be,old,so,terribly,old,they,didn't,want,to,dance,and,flirt,and,be,admired
oh,it,wasn't,fair,that,she,should,have,to,sit,here,primly,and,be,the,acme,of,widowed,dignity,and,propriety,when,she,was,only,seventeen
it,wasn't,fair,that,she,must,keep,her,voice,low,and,her,eyes,cast,modestly,down,when,men,attractive,ones,too,came,to,their,booth
every,girl,in,atlanta,was,three,deep,in,men
even,the,plainest,girls,were,carrying,on,like,belles,and,oh,worst,of,all,they,were,carrying,on,in,such,lovely,lovely,dresses
here,she,sat,like,a,crow,with,hot,black,taffeta,to,her,wrists,and,buttoned,up,to,her,chin,with,not,even,a,hint,of,lace,or,braid,not,a,jewel,except,ellen's,onyx,mourning,brooch,watching,tacky-,looking,girls,hanging,on,the,arms,of,good-looking,men
all,because,charles,hamilton,had,had,the,measles
he,didn't,even,die,in,a,fine,glow,of,gallantry,in,battle,so,she,could,brag,about,him
rebelliously,she,leaned,her,elbows,on,the,counter,and,looked,at,the,crowd,flouting,mammy's,oft-repeated,admonition,against,leaning,on,elbows,and,making,them,ugly,and,wrinkled
what,did,it,matter,if,they,did,get,ugly
she'd,probably,never,get,a,chance,to,show,them,again
she,looked,hungrily,at,the,frocks,floating,by,butter-yellow,watered,silks,with,garlands,of,rosebuds,pink,satins,with,eighteen,flounces,edged,with,tiny,black,velvet,ribbons,baby,blue,taffeta,ten,yards,in,the,skirt,and,foamy,with,cascading,lace,exposed,bosoms,seductive,flowers
maybelle,merriwether,went,toward,the,next,booth,on,the,arm,of,the,zouave,in,an,apple-,green,tarlatan,so,wide,that,it,reduced,her,waist,to,nothingness
it,was,showered,and,flounced,with,cream-colored,chantilly,lace,that,had,come,from,charleston,on,the,last,blockader,and,maybelle,was,flaunting,it,as,saucily,as,if,she,and,not,the,famous,captain,butler,had,run,the,blockade
how,sweet,i'd,look,in,that,dress,thought,scarlett,a,savage,envy,in,her,heart
her,waist,is,as,big,as,a,cow's
that,green,is,just,my,color,and,it,would,make,my,eyes,look,why,will,blondes,try,to,wear,that,color
her,skin,looks,as,green,as,an,old,cheese
and,to,think,i'll,never,wear,that,color,again,not,even,when,i,do,get,out,of,mourning
no,not,even,if,i,do,manage,to,get,married,again
then,i'll,have,to,wear,tacky,old,grays,and,tans,and,lilacs
for,a,brief,moment,she,considered,the,unfairness,of,it,all
how,short,was,the,time,for,fun,for,pretty,clothes,for,dancing,for,coquetting
only,a,few,too,few,years
then,you,married,and,wore,dull-colored,dresses,and,had,babies,that,ruined,your,waist,line,and,sat,in,corners,at,dances,with,other,sober,matrons,and,only,emerged,to,dance,with,your,husband,or,with,old,gentlemen,who,stepped,on,your,feet
if,you,didn't,do,these,things,the,other,matrons,talked,about,you,and,then,your,reputation,was,ruined,and,your,family,disgraced
it,seemed,such,a,terrible,waste,to,spend,all,your,little,girlhood,learning,how,to,be,attractive,and,how,to,catch,men,and,then,only,use,the,knowledge,for,a,year,or,two
when,she,considered,her,training,at,the,hands,of,ellen,and,mammy,she,knew,it,had,been,thorough,and,good,because,it,had,always,reaped,results
there,were,set,rules,to,be,followed,and,if,you,followed,them,success,crowned,your,efforts
with,old,ladies,you,were,sweet,and,guileless,and,appeared,as,simple,minded,as,possible,for,old,ladies,were,sharp,and,they,watched,girls,as,jealously,as,cats,ready,to,pounce,on,any,indiscretion,of,tongue,or,eye
with,old,gentlemen,a,girl,was,pert,and,saucy,and,almost,but,not,quite,flirtatious,so,that,the,old,fools',vanities,would,be,tickled
it,made,them,feel,devilish,and,young,and,they,pinched,your,cheek,and,declared,you,were,a,minx
and,of,course,you,always,blushed,on,such,occasions,otherwise,they,would,pinch,you,with,more,pleasure,than,was,proper,and,then,tell,their,sons,that,you,were,fast
with,young,girls,and,young,married,women,you,slopped,over,with,sugar,and,kissed,them,every,time,you,met,them,even,if,it,was,ten,times,a,day
and,you,put,your,arms,about,their,waists,and,suffered,them,to,do,the,same,to,you,no,matter,how,much,you,disliked,it
you,admired,their,frocks,or,their,babies,indiscriminately,and,teased,about,beaux,and,complimented,husbands,and,giggled,modestly,and,denied,that,you,had,any,charms,at,all,compared,with,theirs
and,above,all,you,never,said,what,you,really,thought,about,anything,any,more,than,they,said,what,they,really,thought
other,women's,husbands,you,let,severely,alone,even,if,they,were,your,own,discarded,beaux,and,no,matter,how,temptingly,attractive,they,were
if,you,were,too,nice,to,young,husbands,their,wives,said,you,were,fast,and,you,got,a,bad,reputation,and,never,caught,any,beaux,of,your,own
but,with,young,bachelors,ah,that,was,a,different,matter
you,could,laugh,softly,at,them,and,when,they,came,flying,to,see,why,you,laughed,you,could,refuse,to,tell,them,and,laugh,harder,and,keep,them,around,indefinitely,trying,to,find,out
you,could,promise,with,your,eyes,any,number,of,exciting,things,that,would,make,a,man,maneuver,to,get,you,alone
and,having,gotten,you,alone,you,could,be,very,very,hurt,or,very,very,angry,when,he,tried,to,kiss,you
you,could,make,him,apologize,for,being,a,cur,and,forgive,him,so,sweetly,that,he,would,hang,around,trying,to,kiss,you,a,second,time
sometimes,but,not,often,you,did,let,him,kiss,you
ellen,and,mammy,had,not,taught,her,that,but,she,learned,it,was,effective
then,you,cried,and,declared,you,didn't,know,what,had,come,over,you,and,that,he,couldn't,ever,respect,you,again
then,he,had,to,dry,your,eyes,and,usually,he,proposed,to,show,just,how,much,he,did,respect,you
and,then,there,were,oh,there,were,so,many,things,to,do,to,bachelors,and,she,knew,them,all,the,nuance,of,the,sidelong,glance,the,half-smile,behind,the,fan,the,swaying,of,the,hips,so,that,skirts,swung,like,a,bell,the,tears,the,laughter,the,flattery,the,sweet,sympathy
oh,all,the,tricks,that,never,failed,to,work,except,with,ashley
no,it,didn't,seem,right,to,learn,all,these,smart,tricks,use,them,so,briefly,and,then,put,them,away,forever
how,wonderful,it,would,be,never,to,marry,but,to,go,on,being,lovely,in,pale,green,dresses,and,forever,courted,by,handsome,men
but,if,you,went,on,too,long,you,got,to,be,an,old,maid,like,india,wilkes,and,everyone,said,poor,thing,in,that,smug,hateful,way
no,after,all,it,was,better,to,marry,and,keep,your,self-respect,even,if,you,never,had,any,more,fun
oh,what,a,mess,life,was
why,had,she,been,such,an,idiot,as,to,marry,charles,of,all,people,and,have,her,life,end,at,sixteen
her,indignant,and,hopeless,reverie,was,broken,when,the,crowd,began,pushing,back,against,the,walls,the,ladies,carefully,holding,their,hoops,so,that,no,careless,contact,should,turn,them,up,against,their,bodies,and,show,more,pantalets,than,was,proper
scarlett,tiptoed,above,the,crowd,and,saw,the,captain,of,the,militia,mounting,the,orchestra,platform
he,shouted,orders,and,half,of,the,company,fell,into,line
for,a,few,minutes,they,went,through,a,brisk,drill,that,brought,perspiration,to,their,foreheads,and,cheers,and,applause,from,the,audience
scarlett,clapped,her,hands,dutifully,with,the,rest,and,as,the,soldiers,pushed,forward,toward,the,punch,and,lemonade,booths,after,they,were,dismissed,she,turned,to,melanie,feeling,that,she,had,better,begin,her,deception,about,the,cause,as,soon,as,possible
they,looked,fine,didn't,they
she,said
melanie,was,fussing,about,with,the,knitted,things,on,the,counter
most,of,them,would,look,a,lot,finer,in,gray,uniforms,and,in,virginia,she,said,and,she,did,not,trouble,to,lower,her,voice
several,of,the,proud,mothers,of,members,of,the,militia,were,standing,close,by,and,overheard,the,remark
mrs,guinan,turned,scarlet,and,then,white,for,her,twenty-five-year-old,willie,was,in,the,company
scarlett,was,aghast,at,such,words,coming,from,melly,of,all,people
why,melly
you,know,it's,true,scarlet
i,don't,mean,the,little,boys,and,the,old,gentlemen
but,a,lot,of,the,militia,are,perfectly,able,to,tote,a,rifle,and,that's,what,they,ought,to,be,doing,this,minute
but,but,began,scarlett,who,had,never,considered,the,matter,before
somebody's,got,to,stay,home,to,what,was,it,willie,guinan,had,told,her,by,way,of,excusing,his,presence,in,atlanta
somebody's,got,to,stay,home,to,protect,the,state,from,invasion
nobody's,invading,us,and,nobody's,going,to,said,melly,coolly,looking,toward,a,group,of,the,militia
and,the,best,way,to,keep,out,invaders,is,to,go,to,virginia,and,beat,the,yankees,there
and,as,for,all,this,talk,about,the,militia,staying,here,to,keep,the,darkies,from,rising,why,it's,the,silliest,thing,i,ever,heard,of
why,should,our,people,rise
it's,just,a,good,excuse,for,cowards
i'll,bet,we,could,lick,the,yankees,in,a,month,if,all,the,militia,of,all,the,states,went,to,virginia
so,there
why,melly
cried,scarlett,again,staring
melly's,soft,dark,eyes,were,flashing,angrily
my,husband,wasn't,afraid,to,go,and,neither,was,yours
and,i'd,rather,they'd,both,be,dead,than,here,at,home,oh,darling,i'm,sorry
how,thoughtless,and,cruel,of,me
she,stroked,scarlett's,arm,appealingly,and,scarlett,stared,at,her
but,it,was,not,of,dead,charles,she,was,thinking
it,was,of,ashley
suppose,he,too,were,to,die
she,turned,quickly,and,smiled,automatically,as,dr,meade,walked,up,to,their,booth
well,girls,he,greeted,them,it,was,nice,of,you,to,come
i,know,what,a,sacrifice,it,must,have,been,for,you,to,come,out,tonight
but,it's,all,for,the,cause
and,i'm,going,to,tell,you,a,secret
i've,a,surprise,way,for,making,some,more,money,tonight,for,the,hospital,but,i'm,afraid,some,of,the,ladies,are,going,to,be,shocked,about,it
he,stopped,and,chuckled,as,he,tugged,at,his,gray,goatee
oh,what
do,tell
on,second,thought,i,believe,i'll,keep,you,guessing,too
but,you,girls,must,stand,up,for,me,if,the,church,members,want,to,run,me,out,of,town,for,doing,it
however,it's,for,the,hospital
you'll,see
nothing,like,this,has,ever,been,done,before
he,went,off,pompously,toward,a,group,of,chaperons,in,one,corner,and,just,as,the,two,girls,had,turned,to,each,other,to,discuss,the,possibilities,of,the,secret,two,old,gentlemen,bore,down,on,the,booth,declaring,in,loud,voices,that,they,wanted,ten,miles,of,tatting
well,after,all,old,gentlemen,were,better,than,no,gentlemen,at,all,thought,scarlett,measuring,out,the,tatting,and,submitting,demurely,to,being,chucked,under,the,chin
the,old,blades,charged,off,toward,the,lemonade,booth,and,others,took,their,places,at,the,counter
their,booth,did,not,have,so,many,customers,as,did,the,other,booths,where,the,tootling,laugh,of,maybelle,merriwether,sounded,and,fanny,elsing's,giggles,and,the,whiting,girls',repartee,made,merriment
melly,sold,useless,stuff,to,men,who,could,have,no,possible,use,for,it,as,quietly,and,serenely,as,a,shopkeeper,and,scarlett,patterned,her,conduct,on,melly's
there,were,crowds,in,front,of,every,other,counter,but,theirs,girls,chattering,men,buying
the,few,who,came,to,them,talked,about,how,they,went,to,the,university,with,ashley,and,what,a,fine,soldier,he,was,or,spoke,in,respectful,tones,of,charles,and,how,great,a,loss,to,atlanta,his,death,had,been
then,the,music,broke,into,the,rollicking,strains,of,johnny,booker,he'p,dis,nigger
and,scarlett,thought,she,would,scream
she,wanted,to,dance
she,wanted,to,dance
she,looked,across,the,floor,and,tapped,her,foot,to,the,music,and,her,green,eyes,blazed,so,eagerly,that,they,fairly,snapped
all,the,way,across,the,floor,a,man,newly,come,and,standing,in,the,doorway,saw,them,started,in,recognition,and,watched,closely,the,slanting,eyes,in,the,sulky,rebellious,face
then,he,grinned,to,himself,as,he,recognized,the,invitation,that,any,male,could,read
he,was,dressed,in,black,broadcloth,a,tall,man,towering,over,the,officers,who,stood,near,him,bulky,in,the,shoulders,but,tapering,to,a,small,waist,and,absurdly,small,feet,in,varnished,boots
his,severe,black,suit,with,fine,ruffled,shirt,and,trousers,smartly,strapped,beneath,high,insteps,was,oddly,at,variance,with,his,physique,and,face,for,he,was,foppishly,groomed,the,clothes,of,a,dandy,on,a,body,that,was,powerful,and,latently,dangerous,in,its,lazy,grace
his,hair,was,jet,black,and,his,black,mustache,was,small,and,closely,clipped,almost,foreign,looking,compared,with,the,dashing,swooping,mustaches,of,the,cavalrymen,near,by
he,looked,and,was,a,man,of,lusty,and,unashamed,appetites
he,had,an,air,of,utter,assurance,of,displeasing,insolence,about,him,and,there,was,a,twinkle,of,malice,in,his,bold,eyes,as,he,stared,at,scarlett,until,finally,feeling,his,gaze,she,looked,toward,him
somewhere,in,her,mind,the,bell,of,recognition,rang,but,for,the,moment,she,could,not,recall,who,he,was
but,he,was,the,first,man,in,months,who,had,displayed,an,interest,in,her,and,she,threw,him,a,gay,smile
she,made,a,little,curtsy,as,he,bowed,and,then,as,he,straightened,and,started,toward,her,with,a,peculiarly,lithe,indian-like,gait,her,hand,went,to,her,mouth,in,horror,for,she,knew,who,he,was
thunderstruck,she,stood,as,if,paralyzed,while,he,made,his,way,through,the,crowd
then,she,turned,blindly,bent,on,flight,into,the,refreshment,rooms,but,her,skirt,caught,on,a,nail,of,the,booth
she,jerked,furiously,at,it,tearing,it,and,in,an,instant,he,was,beside,her
permit,me,he,said,bending,over,and,disentangling,the,flounce
i,hardly,hoped,that,you,would,recall,me,miss,o'hara
his,voice,was,oddly,pleasant,to,the,ear,the,well-modulated,voice,of,a,gentleman,resonant,and,overlaid,with,the,flat,slow,drawl,of,the,charlestonian
she,looked,up,at,him,imploringly,her,face,crimson,with,the,shame,of,their,last,meeting,and,met,two,of,the,blackest,eyes,she,had,ever,seen,dancing,in,merciless,merriment
of,all,the,people,in,the,world,to,turn,up,here,this,terrible,person,who,had,witnessed,that,scene,with,ashley,which,still,gave,her,nightmares,this,odious,wretch,who,ruined,girls,and,was,not,received,by,nice,people,this,despicable,man,who,had,said,and,with,good,cause,that,she,was,not,a,lady
at,the,sound,of,his,voice,melanie,turned,and,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,scarlett,thanked,god,for,the,existence,of,her,sister-,in-law
why,it's,it's,mr,rhett,butler,isn't,it
said,melanie,with,a,little,smile,putting,out,her,hand
i,met,you
on,the,happy,occasion,of,the,announcement,of,your,betrothal,he,finished,bending,over,her,hand
it,is,kind,of,you,to,recall,me
and,what,are,you,doing,so,far,from,charleston,mr
butler
a,boring,matter,of,business,mrs,wilkes
i,will,be,in,and,out,of,your,town,from,now,on
i,find,i,must,not,only,bring,in,goods,but,see,to,the,disposal,of,them
bring,in,began,melly,her,brow,wrinkling,and,then,she,broke,into,a,delighted,smile
why,you,you,must,be,the,famous,captain,butler,we've,been,hearing,so,much,about,the,blockade,runner
why,every,girl,here,is,wearing,dresses,you,brought,in
scarlett,aren't,you,thrilled,what's,the,matter,dear
are,you,faint
do,sit,down
scarlett,sank,to,the,stool,her,breath,coming,so,rapidly,she,feared,the,lacings,of,her,stays,would,burst
oh,what,a,terrible,thing,to,happen
she,had,never,thought,to,meet,this,man,again
he,picked,up,her,black,fan,from,the,counter,and,began,fanning,her,solicitously,too,solicitously,his,face,grave,but,his,eyes,still,dancing
it,is,quite,warm,in,here,he,said
no,wonder,miss,o'hara,is,faint
may,i,lead,you,to,a,window
no,said,scarlett,so,rudely,that,melly,stared
she,is,not,miss,o'hara,any,longer,said,melly
she,is,mrs,hamilton
she,is,my,sister,now,and,melly,bestowed,one,of,her,fond,little,glances,on,her
scarlett,felt,that,she,would,strangle,at,the,expression,on,captain,butler's,swarthy,piratical,face
i,am,sure,that,is,a,great,gain,to,two,charming,ladies,said,he,making,a,slight,bow
that,was,the,kind,of,remark,all,men,made,but,when,he,said,it,it,seemed,to,her,that,he,meant,just,the,opposite
your,husbands,are,here,tonight,i,trust,on,this,happy,occasion
it,would,be,a,pleasure,to,renew,acquaintances
my,husband,is,in,virginia,said,melly,with,a,proud,lift,of,her,head
but,charles,her,voice,broke
he,died,in,camp,said,scarlett,flatly
she,almost,snapped,the,words
would,this,creature,never,go,away
melly,looked,at,her,startled,and,the,captain,made,a,gesture,of,self-reproach
my,dear,ladies,how,could,i
you,must,forgive,me
but,permit,a,stranger,to,offer,the,comfort,of,saying,that,to,die,for,one's,country,is,to,live,forever
melanie,smiled,at,him,through,sparkling,tears,while,scarlett,felt,the,fox,of,wrath,and,impotent,hate,gnaw,at,her,vitals
again,he,had,made,a,graceful,remark,the,kind,of,compliment,any,gentleman,would,pay,under,such,circumstances,but,he,did,not,mean,a,word,of,it
he,was,jeering,at,her
he,knew,she,hadn't,loved,charles
and,melly,was,just,a,big,enough,fool,not,to,see,through,him
oh,please,god,don't,let,anybody,else,see,through,him,she,thought,with,a,start,of,terror
would,he,tell,what,he,knew
of,course,he,wasn't,a,gentleman,and,there,was,no,telling,what,men,would,do,when,they,weren't,gentlemen
there,was,no,standard,to,judge,them,by
she,looked,up,at,him,and,saw,that,his,mouth,was,pulled,down,at,the,corners,in,mock,sympathy,even,while,he,swished,the,fan
something,in,his,look,challenged,her,spirit,and,brought,her,strength,back,in,a,surge,of,dislike
abruptly,she,snatched,the,fan,from,his,hand
i'm,quite,all,right,she,said,tartly
there's,no,need,to,blow,my,hair,out,of,place
scarlett,darling
captain,butler,you,must,forgive,her
she,she,isn't,herself,when,she,hears,poor,charlie's,name,spoken,and,perhaps,after,all,we,shouldn't,have,come,here,tonight
we're,still,in,mourning,you,see,and,it's,quite,a,strain,on,her,all,this,gaiety,and,music,poor,child
i,quite,understand,he,said,with,elaborate,gravity,but,as,he,turned,and,gave,melanie,a,searching,look,that,went,to,the,bottom,of,her,sweet,worried,eyes,his,expression,changed,reluctant,respect,and,gentleness,coming,over,his,dark,face
i,think,you're,a,courageous,little,lady,mrs
wilkes
not,a,word,about,me
thought,scarlett,indignantly,as,melly,smiled,in,confusion,and,answered
dear,me,no,captain,butler
the,hospital,committee,just,had,to,have,us,for,this,booth,because,at,the,last,minute,a,pillow,case
here's,a,lovely,one,with,a,flag,on,it
she,turned,to,three,cavalrymen,who,appeared,at,her,counter
for,a,moment,melanie,thought,how,nice,captain,butler,was
then,she,wished,that,something,more,substantial,than,cheesecloth,was,between,her,skirt,and,the,spittoon,that,stood,just,outside,the,booth,for,the,aim,of,the,horsemen,with,amber,streams,of,tobacco,juice,was,not,so,unerring,as,with,their,long,horse,pistols
then,she,forgot,about,the,captain,scarlett,and,the,spittoons,as,more,customers,crowded,to,her
scarlett,sat,quietly,on,the,stool,fanning,herself,not,daring,to,look,up,wishing,captain,butler,back,on,the,deck,of,his,ship,where,he,belonged
your,husband,has,been,dead,long
oh,yes,a,long,time
almost,a,year
an,aeon,i'm,sure
scarlett,was,not,sure,what,an,aeon,was,but,there,was,no,mistaking,the,baiting,quality,of,his,voice,so,she,said,nothing
had,you,been,married,long
forgive,my,questions,but,i,have,been,away,from,this,section,for,so,long
two,months,said,scarlett,unwillingly
a,tragedy,no,less,his,easy,voice,continued
oh,damn,him,she,thought,violently
if,he,was,any,other,man,in,the,world,i,could,simply,freeze,up,and,order,him,off
but,he,knows,about,ashley,and,he,knows,i,didn't,love,charlie
and,my,hands,are,tied
she,said,nothing,still,looking,down,at,her,fan
and,this,is,your,first,social,appearance
i,know,it,looks,quite,odd,she,explained,rapidly
but,the,mclure,girls,who,were,to,take,this,booth,were,called,away,and,there,was,no,one,else,so,melanie,and,i
no,sacrifice,is,too,great,for,the,cause
why,that,was,what,mrs,elsing,had,said,but,when,she,said,it,it,didn't,sound,the,same,way
hot,words,started,to,her,lips,but,she,choked,them,back
after,all,she,was,here,not,for,the,cause,but,because,she,was,tired,of,sitting,home
i,have,always,thought,he,said,reflectively,that,the,system,of,mourning,of,immuring,women,in,crepe,for,the,rest,of,their,lives,and,forbidding,them,normal,enjoyment,is,just,as,barbarous,as,the,hindu,suttee
settee
he,laughed,and,she,blushed,for,her,ignorance
she,hated,people,who,used,words,unknown,to,her
in,india,when,a,man,dies,he,is,burned,instead,of,buried,and,his,wife,always,climbs,on,the,funeral,pyre,and,is,burned,with,him
how,dreadful
why,do,they,do,it
don't,the,police,do,anything,about,it
of,course,not
a,wife,who,didn't,burn,herself,would,be,a,social,outcast
all,the,worthy,hindu,matrons,would,talk,about,her,for,not,behaving,as,a,well-bred,lady,should,precisely,as,those,worthy,matrons,in,the,corner,would,talk,about,you,should,you,appear,tonight,in,a,red,dress,and,lead,a,reel
personally,i,think,suttee,much,more,merciful,than,our,charming,southern,custom,of,burying,widows,alive
how,dare,you,say,i'm,buried,alive
how,closely,women,crutch,the,very,chains,that,bind,them
you,think,the,hindu,custom,barbarous,but,would,you,have,had,the,courage,to,appear,here,tonight,if,the,confederacy,hadn't,needed,you
arguments,of,this,character,were,always,confusing,to,scarlett
his,were,doubly,confusing,because,she,had,a,vague,idea,there,was,truth,in,them
but,now,was,the,time,to,squelch,him
of,course,i,wouldn't,have,come
it,would,have,been,well,disrespectful,to,it,would,have,seemed,as,if,i,hadn't,lov
his,eyes,waited,on,her,words,cynical,amusement,in,them,and,she,could,not,go,on
he,knew,she,hadn't,loved,charlie,and,he,wouldn't,let,her,pretend,to,the,nice,polite,sentiments,that,she,should,express
what,a,terrible,terrible,thing,it,was,to,have,to,do,with,a,man,who,wasn't,a,gentleman
a,gentleman,always,appeared,to,believe,a,lady,even,when,he,knew,she,was,lying
that,was,southern,chivalry
a,gentleman,always,obeyed,the,rules,and,said,the,correct,things,and,made,life,easier,for,a,lady
but,this,man,seemed,not,to,care,for,rules,and,evidently,enjoyed,talking,of,things,no,one,ever,talked,about
i,am,waiting,breathlessly
i,think,you,are,horrid,she,said,helplessly,dropping,her,eyes
he,leaned,down,across,the,counter,until,his,mouth,was,near,her,ear,and,hissed,in,a,very,creditable,imitation,of,the,stage,villains,who,appeared,infrequently,at,the,athenaeum,hall,fear,not,fair,lady
your,guilty,secret,is,safe,with,me
oh,she,whispered,feverishly,how,can,you,say,such,things
i,only,thought,to,ease,your,mind
what,would,you,have,me,say
'be,mine,beautiful,female,or,i,will,reveal,all,'
she,met,his,eyes,unwillingly,and,saw,they,were,as,teasing,as,a,small,boy's
suddenly,she,laughed
it,was,such,a,silly,situation,after,all
he,laughed,too,and,so,loudly,that,several,of,the,chaperons,in,the,corner,looked,their,way
observing,how,good,a,time,charles,hamilton's,widow,appeared,to,be,having,with,a,perfect,stranger,they,put,their,heads,together,disapprovingly
there,was,a,roll,of,drums,and,many,voices,cried,sh
as,dr,meade,mounted,the,platform,and,spread,out,his,arms,for,quiet
we,must,all,give,grateful,thanks,to,the,charming,ladies,whose,indefatigable,and,patriotic,efforts,have,made,this,bazaar,not,only,a,pecuniary,success,he,began,but,have,transformed,this,rough,hall,into,a,bower,of,loveliness,a,fit,garden,for,the,charming,rosebuds,i,see,about,me
everyone,clapped,approvingly
the,ladies,have,given,their,best,not,only,of,their,time,but,of,the,labor,of,their,hands,and,these,beautiful,objects,in,the,booths,are,doubly,beautiful,made,as,they,are,by,the,fair,hands,of,our,charming,southern,women
there,were,more,shouts,of,approval,and,rhett,butler,who,had,been,lounging,negligently,against,the,counter,at,scarlett's,side,whispered,pompous,goat,isn't,he
startled,at,first,horrified,at,this,lese,majesty,toward,atlanta's,most,beloved,citizen,she,stared,reprovingly,at,him
but,the,doctor,did,look,like,a,goat,with,his,gray,chin,whiskers,wagging,away,at,a,great,rate,and,with,difficulty,she,stifled,a,giggle
but,these,things,are,not,enough
the,good,ladies,of,the,hospital,committee,whose,cool,hands,have,soothed,many,a,suffering,brow,and,brought,back,from,the,jaws,of,death,our,brave,men,wounded,in,the,bravest,of,all,causes,know,our,needs
i,will,not,enumerate,them
we,must,have,more,money,to,buy,medical,supplies,from,england,and,we,have,with,us,tonight,the,intrepid,captain,who,has,so,successfully,run,the,blockade,for,a,year,and,who,will,run,it,again,to,bring,us,the,drugs,we,need
captain,rhett,butler
though,caught,unawares,the,blockader,made,a,graceful,bow,too,graceful,thought,scarlett,trying,to,analyze,it
it,was,almost,as,if,he,overdid,his,courtesy,because,his,contempt,for,everybody,present,was,so,great
there,was,a,loud,burst,of,applause,as,he,bowed,and,a,craning,of,necks,from,the,ladies,in,the,corner
so,that,was,who,poor,charles,hamilton's,widow,was,carrying,on,with
and,charlie,hardly,dead,a,year
we,need,more,gold,and,i,am,asking,you,for,it,the,doctor,continued
i,am,asking,a,sacrifice,but,a,sacrifice,so,small,compared,with,the,sacrifices,our,gallant,men,in,gray,are,making,that,it,will,seem,laughably,small
ladies,i,want,your,jewelry
_i_,want,your,jewelry
no,the,confederacy,wants,your,jewelry,the,confederacy,calls,for,it,and,i,know,no,one,will,hold,back
how,fair,a,gem,gleams,on,a,lovely,wrist
how,beautifully,gold,brooches,glitter,on,the,bosoms,of,our,patriotic,women
but,how,much,more,beautiful,is,sacrifice,than,all,the,gold,and,gems,of,the,ind
the,gold,will,be,melted,and,the,stones,sold,and,the,money,used,to,buy,drugs,and,other,medical,supplies
ladies,there,will,pass,among,you,two,of,our,gallant,wounded,with,baskets,and,but,the,rest,of,his,speech,was,lost,in,the,storm,and,tumult,of,clapping,hands,and,cheering,voices
scarlett's,first,thought,was,one,of,deep,thankfulness,that,mourning,forbade,her,wearing,her,precious,earbobs,and,the,heavy,gold,chain,that,had,been,grandma,robillard's,and,the,gold,and,black,enameled,bracelets,and,the,garnet,brooch
she,saw,the,little,zouave,a,split-oak,basket,over,his,unwounded,arm,making,the,rounds,of,the,crowd,on,her,side,of,the,hall,and,saw,women,old,and,young,laughing,eager,tugging,at,bracelets,squealing,in,pretended,pain,as,earrings,came,from,pierced,flesh,helping,each,other,undo,stiff,necklace,clasps,unpinning,brooches,from,bosoms
there,was,a,steady,little,clink-clink,of,metal,on,metal,and,cries,of,wait,wait
i've,got,it,unfastened,now
there
maybelle,merriwether,was,pulling,off,her,lovely,twin,bracelets,from,above,and,below,her,elbows
fanny,elsing,crying,mamma,may,i
was,tearing,from,her,curls,the,seed-pearl,ornament,set,in,heavy,gold,which,had,been,in,the,family,for,generations
as,each,offering,went,into,the,basket,there,was,applause,and,cheering
the,grinning,little,man,was,coming,to,their,booth,now,his,basket,heavy,on,his,arm,and,as,he,passed,rhett,butler,a,handsome,gold,cigar,case,was,thrown,carelessly,into,the,basket
when,he,came,to,scarlett,and,rested,his,basket,upon,the,counter,she,shook,her,head,throwing,wide,her,hands,to,show,that,she,had,nothing,to,give
it,was,embarrassing,to,be,the,only,person,present,who,was,giving,nothing
and,then,she,saw,the,bright,gleam,of,her,wide,gold,wedding,ring
for,a,confused,moment,she,tried,to,remember,charles',face,how,he,had,looked,when,he,slipped,it,on,her,finger
but,the,memory,was,blurred,blurred,by,the,sudden,feeling,of,irritation,that,memory,of,him,always,brought,to,her
charles,he,was,the,reason,why,life,was,over,for,her,why,she,was,an,old,woman
with,a,sudden,wrench,she,seized,the,ring,but,it,stuck
the,zouave,was,moving,toward,melanie
wait
cried,scarlett
i,have,something,for,you
the,ring,came,off,and,as,she,started,to,throw,it,into,the,basket,heaped,up,with,chains,watches,rings,pins,and,bracelets,she,caught,rhett,butler's,eye
his,lips,were,twisted,in,a,slight,smile
defiantly,she,tossed,the,ring,onto,the,top,of,the,pile
oh,my,darling
whispered,molly,clutching,her,arm,her,eyes,blazing,with,love,and,pride
you,brave,brave,girl
wait,please,wait,lieutenant,picard
i,have,something,for,you,too
she,was,tugging,at,her,own,wedding,ring,the,ring,scarlett,knew,had,never,once,left,that,finger,since,ashley,put,it,there
scarlett,knew,as,no,one,did,how,much,it,meant,to,her
it,came,off,with,difficulty,and,for,a,brief,instant,was,clutched,tightly,in,the,small,palm
then,it,was,laid,gently,on,the,pile,of,jewelry
the,two,girls,stood,looking,after,the,zouave,who,was,moving,toward,the,group,of,elderly,ladies,in,the,corner,scarlett,defiant,melanie,with,a,look,more,pitiful,than,tears
and,neither,expression,was,lost,on,the,man,who,stood,beside,them
if,you,hadn't,been,brave,enough,to,do,it,i,would,never,have,been,either,said,melly,putting,her,arm,about,scarlett's,waist,and,giving,her,a,gentle,squeeze
for,a,moment,scarlett,wanted,to,shake,her,off,and,cry,name,of,god
at,the,top,of,her,lungs,as,gerald,did,when,he,was,irritated,but,she,caught,rhett,butler's,eye,and,managed,a,very,sour,smile
it,was,annoying,the,way,melly,always,misconstrued,her,motives,but,perhaps,that,was,far,preferable,to,having,her,suspect,the,truth
what,a,beautiful,gesture,said,rhett,butler,softly
it,is,such,sacrifices,as,yours,that,hearten,our,brave,lads,in,gray
hot,words,bubbled,to,her,lips,and,it,was,with,difficulty,that,she,checked,them
there,was,mockery,in,everything,he,said
she,disliked,him,heartily,lounging,there,against,the,booth
but,there,was,something,stimulating,about,him,something,warm,and,vital,and,electric
all,that,was,irish,in,her,rose,to,the,challenge,of,his,black,eyes
she,decided,she,was,going,to,take,this,man,down,a,notch,or,two
his,knowledge,of,her,secret,gave,him,an,advantage,over,her,that,was,exasperating,so,she,would,have,to,change,that,by,putting,him,at,a,disadvantage,somehow
she,stifled,her,impulse,to,tell,him,exactly,what,she,thought,of,him
sugar,always,caught,more,flies,than,vinegar,as,mammy,often,said,and,she,was,going,to,catch,and,subdue,this,fly,so,he,could,never,again,have,her,at,his,mercy
thank,you,she,said,sweetly,deliberately,misunderstanding,his,jibe
a,compliment,like,that,coming,from,so,famous,a,man,as,captain,butler,is,appreciated
he,threw,back,his,head,and,laughed,freely,yelped,was,what,scarlett,thought,fiercely,her,face,becoming,pink,again
why,don't,you,say,what,you,really,think
he,demanded,lowering,his,voice,so,that,in,the,clatter,and,excitement,of,the,collection,it,came,only,to,her,ears
why,don't,you,say,i'm,a,damned,rascal,and,no,gentleman,and,that,i,must,take,myself,off,or,you'll,have,one,of,these,gallant,boys,in,gray,call,me,out
it,was,on,the,tip,of,her,tongue,to,answer,tartly,but,she,managed,by,heroic,control,to,say,why,captain,butler
how,you,do,run,on
as,if,everybody,didn't,know,how,famous,you,are,and,how,brave,and,what,a,what,a
i,am,disappointed,in,you,he,said
disappointed
yes
on,the,occasion,of,our,first,eventful,meeting,i,thought,to,myself,that,i,had,at,last,met,a,girl,who,was,not,only,beautiful,but,who,had,courage
and,now,i,see,that,you,are,only,beautiful
do,you,mean,to,call,me,a,coward
she,was,ruffling,like,a,hen
exactly
you,lack,the,courage,to,say,what,you,really,think
when,i,first,met,you,i,thought,there,is,a,girl,in,a,million
she,isn't,like,these,other,silly,little,fools,who,believe,everything,their,mammas,tell,them,and,act,on,it,no,matter,how,they,feel
and,conceal,all,their,feelings,and,desires,and,little,heartbreaks,behind,a,lot,of,sweet,words
i,thought,miss,o'hara,is,a,girl,of,rare,spirit
she,knows,what,she,wants,and,she,doesn't,mind,speaking,her,mind,or,throwing,vases
oh,she,said,rage,breaking,through
then,i'll,speak,my,mind,right,this,minute
if,you'd,had,any,raising,at,all,you'd,never,have,come,over,here,and,talked,to,me
you'd,have,known,i,never,wanted,to,lay,eyes,on,you,again
but,you,aren't,a,gentleman
you,are,just,a,nasty,ill-bred,creature
and,you,think,that,because,your,rotten,little,boats,can,outrun,the,yankees,you've,the,right,to,come,here,and,jeer,at,men,who,are,brave,and,women,who,are,sacrificing,everything,for,the,cause
stop,stop,he,begged,with,a,grin
you,started,off,very,nicely,and,said,what,you,thought,but,don't,begin,talking,to,me,about,the,cause
i'm,tired,of,hearing,about,it,and,i'll,bet,you,are,too
why,how,did,she,began,caught,off,her,balance,and,then,checked,herself,hastily,boiling,with,anger,at,herself,for,falling,into,his,trap
i,stood,there,in,the,doorway,before,you,saw,me,and,i,watched,you,he,said
and,i,watched,the,other,girls
and,they,all,looked,as,though,their,faces,came,out,of,one,mold
yours,didn't
you,have,an,easy,face,to,read
you,didn't,have,your,mind,on,your,business,and,i'll,wager,you,weren't,thinking,about,our,cause,or,the,hospital
it,was,all,over,your,face,that,you,wanted,to,dance,and,have,a,good,time,and,you,couldn't
so,you,were,mad,clean,through
tell,the,truth
am,i,not,right
i,have,nothing,more,to,say,to,you,captain,butler,she,said,as,formally,as,she,could,trying,to,draw,the,rags,of,her,dignity,about,her
just,because,you're,conceited,at,being,the,'great,blockader',doesn't,give,you,the,right,to,insult,women
the,great,blockader
that's,a,joke
pray,give,me,only,one,moment,more,of,your,precious,time,before,you,cast,me,into,darkness
i,wouldn't,want,so,charming,a,little,patriot,to,be,left,under,a,misapprehension,about,my,contribution,to,the,confederate,cause
i,don't,care,to,listen,to,your,brags
blockading,is,a,business,with,me,and,i'm,making,money,out,of,it
when,i,stop,making,money,out,of,it,i'll,quit
what,do,you,think,of,that
i,think,you're,a,mercenary,rascal,just,like,the,yankees
exactly,he,grinned
and,the,yankees,help,me,make,my,money
why,last,month,i,sailed,my,boat,right,into,new,york,harbor,and,took,on,a,cargo
what
cried,scarlett,interested,and,excited,in,spite,of,herself
didn't,they,shell,you
my,poor,innocent
of,course,not
there,are,plenty,of,sturdy,union,patriots,who,are,not,averse,to,picking,up,money,selling,goods,to,the,confederacy
i,run,my,boat,into,new,york,buy,from,yankee,firms,sub,rosa,of,course,and,away,i,go
and,when,that,gets,a,bit,dangerous,i,go,to,nassau,where,these,same,union,patriots,have,brought,powder,and,shells,and,hoop,skirts,for,me
it's,more,convenient,than,going,to,england
sometimes,it's,a,bit,difficult,running,it,into,charleston,or,wilmington,but,you'd,be,surprised,how,far,a,little,gold,goes
oh,i,knew,yankees,were,vile,but,i,didn't,know
why,quibble,about,the,yankees,earning,an,honest,penny,selling,out,the,union
it,won't,matter,in,a,hundred,years
the,result,will,be,the,same
they,know,the,confederacy,will,be,licked,eventually,so,why,shouldn't,they,cash,in,on,it
licked,us
of,course
will,you,please,leave,me,or,will,it,be,necessary,for,me,to,call,my,carriage,and,go,home,to,get,rid,of,you
a,red-hot,little,rebel,he,said,with,another,sudden,grin
he,bowed,and,sauntered,off,leaving,her,with,her,bosom,heaving,with,impotent,rage,and,indignation
there,was,disappointment,burning,in,her,that,she,could,not,quite,analyze,the,disappointment,of,a,child,seeing,illusions,crumble
how,dared,he,take,the,glamor,from,the,blockaders
and,how,dared,he,say,the,confederacy,would,be,licked
he,should,be,shot,for,that,shot,like,a,traitor
she,looked,about,the,hall,at,the,familiar,faces,so,assured,of,success,so,brave,so,devoted,and,somehow,a,cold,little,chill,set,in,at,her,heart
licked
these,people,why,of,course,not
the,very,idea,was,impossible,disloyal
what,were,you,two,whispering,about
asked,melanie,turning,to,scarlett,as,her,customers,drifted,off
i,couldn't,help,seeing,that,mrs,merriwether,had,her,eye,on,you,all,the,time,and,dear,you,know,how,she,talks
oh,the,man's,impossible,an,ill-bred,boor,said,scarlett
and,as,for,old,lady,merriwether,let,her,talk
i'm,sick,of,acting,like,a,ninny,just,for,her,benefit
why,scarlett
cried,melanie,scandalized
sh-sh,said,scarlett
dr,meade,is,going,to,make,another,announcement
the,gathering,quieted,again,as,the,doctor,raised,his,voice,at,first,in,thanks,to,the,ladies,who,had,so,willingly,given,their,jewelry
and,now,ladies,and,gentlemen,i,am,going,to,propose,a,surprise,an,innovation,that,may,shock,some,of,you,but,i,ask,you,to,remember,that,all,this,is,done,for,the,hospital,and,for,the,benefit,of,our,boys,lying,there
everyone,edged,forward,in,anticipation,trying,to,imagine,what,the,sedate,doctor,could,propose,that,would,be,shocking
the,dancing,is,about,to,begin,and,the,first,number,will,of,course,be,a,reel,followed,by,a,waltz
the,dances,following,the,polkas,the,schottisches,the,mazurkas,will,be,preceded,by,short,reels
i,know,the,gentle,rivalry,to,lead,the,reels,very,well,and,so,the,doctor,mopped,his,brow,and,cast,a,quizzical,glance,at,the,corner,where,his,wife,sat,among,the,chaperons
gentlemen,if,you,wish,to,lead,a,reel,with,the,lady,of,your,choice,you,must,bargain,for,her
i,will,be,auctioneer,and,the,proceeds,will,go,to,the,hospital
fans,stopped,in,mid-swish,and,a,ripple,of,excited,murmuring,ran,through,the,hall
the,chaperons',corner,was,in,tumult,and,mrs,meade,anxious,to,support,her,husband,in,an,action,of,which,she,heartily,disapproved,was,at,a,disadvantage
mrs,elsing,mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,whiting,were,red,with,indignation
but,suddenly,the,home,guard,gave,a,cheer,and,it,was,taken,up,by,the,other,uniformed,guests
the,young,girls,clapped,their,hands,and,jumped,excitedly
don't,you,think,it's,it's,just,just,a,little,like,a,slave,auction
whispered,melanie,staring,uncertainly,at,the,embattled,doctor,who,heretofore,had,been,perfect,in,her,eyes
scarlett,said,nothing,but,her,eyes,glittered,and,her,heart,contracted,with,a,little,pain
if,only,she,were,not,a,widow
if,only,she,were,scarlett,o'hara,again,out,there,on,the,floor,in,an,apple-green,dress,with,dark-green,velvet,ribbons,dangling,from,her,bosom,and,tuberoses,in,her,black,hair,she'd,lead,that,reel
yes,indeed
there'd,be,a,dozen,men,battling,for,her,and,paying,over,money,to,the,doctor
oh,to,have,to,sit,here,a,wallflower,against,her,will,and,see,fanny,or,maybelle,lead,the,first,reel,as,the,belle,of,atlanta
above,the,tumult,sounded,the,voice,of,the,little,zouave,his,creole,accent,very,obvious,eef,i,may,twenty,dollars,for,mees,maybelle,merriwether
maybelle,collapsed,with,blushes,against,fanny's,shoulder,and,the,two,girls,hid,their,faces,in,each,other's,necks,and,giggled,as,other,voices,began,calling,other,names,other,amounts,of,money
dr,meade,had,begun,to,smile,again,ignoring,completely,the,indignant,whispers,that,came,from,the,ladies',hospital,committee,in,the,corner
at,first,mrs,merriwether,had,stated,flatly,and,loudly,that,her,maybelle,would,never,take,part,in,such,a,proceeding,but,as,maybelle's,name,was,called,most,often,and,the,amount,went,up,to,seventy-five,dollars,her,protests,began,to,dwindle
scarlett,leaned,her,elbows,on,the,counter,and,almost,glared,at,the,excited,laughing,crowd,surging,about,the,platform,their,hands,full,of,confederate,paper,money
now,they,would,all,dance,except,her,and,the,old,ladies
now,everyone,would,have,a,good,time,except,her
she,saw,rhett,butler,standing,just,below,the,doctor,and,before,she,could,change,the,expression,of,her,face,he,saw,her,and,one,corner,of,his,mouth,went,down,and,one,eyebrow,went,up
she,jerked,her,chin,up,and,turned,away,from,him,and,suddenly,she,heard,her,own,name,called,called,in,an,unmistakable,charleston,voice,that,rang,out,above,the,hubbub,of,other,names
mrs,charles,hamilton,one,hundred,and,fifty,dollars,in,gold
a,sudden,hush,fell,on,the,crowd,both,at,the,mention,of,the,sum,and,at,the,name
scarlett,was,so,startled,she,could,not,even,move
she,remained,sitting,with,her,chin,in,her,hands,her,eyes,wide,with,astonishment
everybody,turned,to,look,at,her
she,saw,the,doctor,lean,down,from,the,platform,and,whisper,something,to,rhett,butler
probably,telling,him,she,was,in,mourning,and,it,was,impossible,for,her,to,appear,on,the,floor
she,saw,rhett's,shoulders,shrug,lazily
another,one,of,our,belles,perhaps
questioned,the,doctor
no,said,rhett,clearly,his,eyes,sweeping,the,crowd,carelessly
mrs
hamilton
i,tell,you,it,is,impossible,said,the,doctor,testily
mrs,hamilton,will,not
scarlett,heard,a,voice,which,at,first,she,did,not,recognize,as,her,own
yes,i,will
she,leaped,to,her,feet,her,heart,hammering,so,wildly,she,feared,she,could,not,stand,hammering,with,the,thrill,of,being,the,center,of,attention,again,of,being,the,most,highly,desired,girl,present,and,oh,best,of,all,at,the,prospect,of,dancing,again
oh,i,don't,care
i,don't,care,what,they,say
she,whispered,as,a,sweet,madness,swept,over,her
she,tossed,her,head,and,sped,out,of,the,booth,tapping,her,heels,like,castanets,snapping,open,her,black,silk,fan,to,its,widest
for,a,fleeting,instant,she,saw,melanie's,incredulous,face,the,look,on,the,chaperons',faces,the,petulant,girls,the,enthusiastic,approval,of,the,soldiers
then,she,was,on,the,floor,and,rhett,butler,was,advancing,toward,her,through,the,aisle,of,the,crowd,that,nasty,mocking,smile,on,his,face
but,she,didn't,care,didn't,care,if,he,were,abe,lincoln,himself
she,was,going,to,dance,again
she,was,going,to,lead,the,reel
she,swept,him,a,low,curtsy,and,a,dazzling,smile,and,he,bowed,one,hand,on,his,frilled,bosom
levi,horrified,was,quick,to,cover,the,situation,and,bawled,choose,yo',padners,fo',de,ferginny,reel
and,the,orchestra,crashed,into,that,best,of,all,reel,tunes,dixie
how,dare,you,make,me,so,conspicuous,captain,butler
but,my,dear,mrs,hamilton,you,so,obviously,wanted,to,be,conspicuous
how,could,you,call,my,name,out,in,front,of,everybody
you,could,have,refused
but,i,owe,it,to,the,cause,i,i,couldn't,think,of,myself,when,you,were,offering,so,much,in,gold
stop,laughing,everyone,is,looking,at,us
they,will,look,at,us,anyway
don't,try,to,palm,off,that,twaddle,about,the,cause,to,me
you,wanted,to,dance,and,i,gave,you,the,opportunity
this,march,is,the,last,figure,of,the,reel,isn't,it
yes,really,i,must,stop,and,sit,down,now

that's,the,beginning,of,wisdom
oh,but
when,you've,been,talked,about,as,much,as,i,have,you'll,realize,how,little,it,matters

not,even,my,contribution,to,our,just,and,holy,cause,lifts,the,ban
how,dreadful
oh,not,at,all
until,you've,lost,your,reputation,you,never,realize,what,a,burden,it,was,or,what,freedom,really,is
you,do,talk,scandalous
scandalously,and,truly
always,providing,you,have,enough,courage,or,money,you,can,do,without,a,reputation

and,i'm,sure,i'll,clean,up,a,million,on,the,blockade
oh,no
oh,yes
what,most,people,don't,seem,to,realize,is,that,there,is,just,as,much,money,to,be,made,out,of,the,wreckage,of,a,civilization,as,from,the,upbuilding,of,one
and,what,does,all,that,mean
your,family,and,my,family,and,everyone,here,tonight,made,their,money,out,of,changing,a,wilderness,into,a,civilization

oh,dear,there's,the,end,of,the,music,and,there's,aunt,pittypat,coming,out,of,the,back,room
i,know,mrs,merriwether,must,have,told,her
oh,for,goodness',sakes,let's,walk,over,and,look,out,the,window
i,don't,want,her,to,catch,me,now
her,eyes,are,as,big,as,saucers
chapter,x
over,the,waffles,next,morning,pittypat,was,lachrymose,melanie,was,silent,and,scarlett,defiant
i,don't,care,if,they,do,talk
i'll,bet,i,made,more,money,for,the,hospital,than,any,girl,there,more,than,all,the,messy,old,stuff,we,sold,too
oh,dear,what,does,the,money,matter
wailed,pittypat,wringing,her,hands
i,just,couldn't,believe,my,eyes,and,poor,charlie,hardly,dead,a,year
and,that,awful,captain,butler,making,you,so,conspicuous,and,he's,a,terrible,terrible,person,scarlett
mrs,whiting's,cousin,mrs,coleman,whose,husband,came,from,charleston,told,me,about,him
he's,the,black,sheep,of,a,lovely,family,oh,how,could,any,of,the,butlers,ever,turn,out,anything,like,him
he,isn't,received,in,charleston,and,he,has,the,fastest,reputation,and,there,was,something,about,a,girl,something,so,bad,mrs,coleman,didn't,even,know,what,it,was
oh,i,can't,believe,he's,that,bad,said,melly,gently
he,seemed,a,perfect,gentleman,and,when,you,think,how,brave,he's,been,running,the,blockade
he,isn't,brave,said,scarlett,perversely,pouring,half,a,pitcher,of,syrup,over,her,waffles
he,just,does,it,for,money
he,told,me,so
he,doesn't,care,anything,about,the,confederacy,and,he,says,we're,going,to,get,licked
but,he,dances,divinely
her,audience,was,speechless,with,horror
i'm,tired,of,sitting,at,home,and,i'm,not,going,to,do,it,any,longer
if,they,all,talked,about,me,about,last,night,then,my,reputation,is,already,gone,and,it,won't,matter,what,else,they,say
it,did,not,occur,to,her,that,the,idea,was,rhett,butler's
it,came,so,patly,and,fitted,so,well,with,what,she,was,thinking
oh
what,will,your,mother,say,when,she,hears
what,will,she,think,of,me
a,cold,qualm,of,guilt,assailed,scarlett,at,the,thought,of,ellen's,consternation,should,she,ever,learn,of,her,daughter's,scandalous,conduct
but,she,took,heart,at,the,thought,of,the,twenty-five,miles,between,atlanta,and,tara
miss,pitty,certainly,wouldn't,tell,ellen
it,would,put,her,in,such,a,bad,light,as,a,chaperon
and,if,pitty,didn't,tattle,she,was,safe
i,think,said,pitty,yes,i,think,i'd,better,write,henry,a,letter,about,it,much,as,i,hate,it,but,he's,our,only,male,relative,and,make,him,go,speak,reprovingly,to,captain,butler,oh,dear,if,charlie,were,only,alive,you,must,never,never,speak,to,that,man,again,scarlett
melanie,had,been,sitting,quietly,her,hands,in,her,lap,her,waffles,cooling,on,her,plate
she,arose,and,coming,behind,scarlett,put,her,arms,about,her,neck
darling,she,said,don't,you,get,upset
i,understand,and,it,was,a,brave,thing,you,did,last,night,and,it's,going,to,help,the,hospital,a,lot
and,if,anybody,dares,say,one,little,word,about,you,i'll,tend,to,them
aunt,pitty,don't,cry
it,has,been,hard,on,scarlett,not,going,anywhere
she's,just,a,baby
her,fingers,played,in,scarlett's,black,hair
and,maybe,we'd,all,be,better,off,if,we,went,out,occasionally,to,parties
maybe,we've,been,very,selfish,staying,here,with,our,grief
war,times,aren't,like,other,times
when,i,think,of,all,the,soldiers,in,town,who,are,far,from,home,and,haven't,any,friends,to,call,on,at,night,and,the,ones,in,the,hospital,who,are,well,enough,to,be,out,of,bed,and,not,well,enough,to,go,back,in,the,army,why,we,have,been,selfish
we,ought,to,have,three,convalescents,in,our,house,this,minute,like,everybody,else,and,some,of,the,soldiers,out,to,dinner,every,sunday
there,scarlett,don't,you,fret
people,won't,talk,when,they,understand
we,know,you,loved,charlie
scarlett,was,far,from,fretting,and,melanie's,soft,hands,in,her,hair,were,irritating
she,wanted,to,jerk,her,head,away,and,say,oh,fiddle-dee-dee
for,the,warming,memory,was,still,on,her,of,how,the,home,guard,and,the,militia,and,the,soldiers,from,the,hospital,had,fought,for,her,dances,last,night
of,all,the,people,in,the,world,she,didn't,want,melly,for,a,defender
she,could,defend,herself,thank,you,and,if,the,old,cats,wanted,to,squall,well,she,could,get,along,without,the,old,cats
there,were,too,many,nice,officers,in,the,world,for,her,to,bother,about,what,old,women,said
pittypat,was,dabbing,at,her,eyes,under,melanie's,soothing,words,when,prissy,entered,with,a,bulky,letter
fer,you
miss,melly
a,lil,nigger,boy,brung,it
for,me
said,melly,wondering,as,she,ripped,open,the,envelope
scarlett,was,making,headway,with,her,waffles,and,so,noticed,nothing,until,she,heard,a,burst,of,tears,from,melly,and,looking,up,saw,aunt,pittypat's,hand,go,to,her,heart
ashley's,dead
screamed,pittypat,throwing,her,head,back,and,letting,her,arms,go,limp
oh,my,god
cried,scarlett,her,blood,turning,to,ice,water
no
no
cried,melanie
quick
her,smelling,salts,scarlett
there,there,honey,do,you,feel,better
breathe,deep
no,it's,not,ashley
i'm,so,sorry,i,scared,you
i,was,crying,because,i'm,so,happy,and,suddenly,she,opened,her,clenched,palm,and,pressed,some,object,that,was,in,it,to,her,lips
i'm,so,happy,and,burst,into,tears,again
scarlett,caught,a,fleeting,glimpse,and,saw,that,it,was,a,broad,gold,ring
read,it,said,melly,pointing,to,the,letter,on,the,floor
oh,how,sweet,how,kind,he,is
scarlett,bewildered,picked,up,the,single,sheet,and,saw,written,in,a,black,bold,hand,the,confederacy,may,need,the,lifeblood,of,its,men,but,not,yet,does,it,demand,the,heart's,blood,of,its,women
accept,dear,madam,this,token,of,my,reverence,for,your,courage,and,do,not,think,that,your,sacrifice,has,been,in,vain,for,this,ring,has,been,redeemed,at,ten,times,its,value
captain,rhett,butler
melanie,slipped,the,ring,on,her,finger,and,looked,at,it,lovingly
i,told,you,he,was,a,gentleman,didn't,i
she,said,turning,to,pittypat,her,smile,bright,through,the,teardrops,on,her,face
no,one,but,a,gentleman,of,refinement,and,thoughtfulness,would,ever,have,thought,how,it,broke,my,heart,to,i'll,send,my,gold,chain,instead
aunt,pittypat,you,must,write,him,a,note,and,invite,him,to,sunday,dinner,so,i,can,thank,him
in,the,excitement,neither,of,the,others,seemed,to,have,thought,that,captain,butler,had,not,returned,scarlett's,ring,too
but,she,thought,of,it,annoyed
and,she,knew,it,had,not,been,captain,butler's,refinement,that,had,prompted,so,gallant,a,gesture
it,was,that,he,intended,to,be,asked,into,pittypat's,house,and,knew,unerringly,how,to,get,the,invitation
i,was,greatly,disturbed,to,hear,of,your,recent,conduct,ran,ellen's,letter,and,scarlett,who,was,reading,it,at,the,table,scowled
bad,news,certainly,traveled,swiftly
she,had,often,heard,in,charleston,and,savannah,that,atlanta,people,gossiped,more,and,meddled,in,other,people's,business,more,than,any,other,people,in,the,south,and,now,she,believed,it
the,bazaar,had,taken,place,monday,night,and,today,was,only,thursday
which,of,the,old,cats,had,taken,it,upon,herself,to,write,ellen
for,a,moment,she,suspected,pittypat,but,immediately,abandoned,that,thought
poor,pittypat,had,been,quaking,in,her,number-three,shoes,for,fear,of,being,blamed,for,scarlett's,forward,conduct,and,would,be,the,last,to,notify,ellen,of,her,own,inadequate,chaperonage
probably,it,was,mrs,merriwether
it,is,difficult,for,me,to,believe,that,you,could,so,forget,yourself,and,your,rearing
i,will,pass,over,the,impropriety,of,your,appearing,publicly,while,in,mourning,realizing,your,warm,desire,to,be,of,assistance,to,the,hospital
but,to,dance,and,with,such,a,man,as,captain,butler
i,have,heard,much,of,him,as,who,has,not
and,pauline,wrote,me,only,last,week,that,he,is,a,man,of,bad,repute,and,not,even,received,by,his,own,family,in,charleston,except,of,course,by,his,heartbroken,mother
he,is,a,thoroughly,bad,character,who,would,take,advantage,of,your,youth,and,innocence,to,make,you,conspicuous,and,publicly,disgrace,you,and,your,family
how,could,miss,pittypat,have,so,neglected,her,duty,to,you
scarlett,looked,across,the,table,at,her,aunt
the,old,lady,had,recognized,ellen's,handwriting,and,her,fat,little,mouth,was,pursed,in,a,frightened,way,like,a,baby,who,fears,a,scolding,and,hopes,to,ward,it,off,by,tears
i,am,heartbroken,to,think,that,you,could,so,soon,forget,your,rearing
i,have,thought,of,calling,you,home,immediately,but,will,leave,that,to,your,father's,discretion
he,will,be,in,atlanta,friday,to,speak,with,captain,butler,and,to,escort,you,home
i,fear,he,will,be,severe,with,you,despite,my,pleadings
i,hope,and,pray,it,was,only,youth,and,thoughtlessness,that,prompted,such,forward,conduct
no,one,can,wish,to,serve,our,cause,more,than,i,and,i,wish,my,daughters,to,feel,the,same,way,but,to,disgrace
there,was,more,in,the,same,vein,but,scarlett,did,not,finish,it
for,once,she,was,thoroughly,frightened
she,did,not,feel,reckless,and,defiant,now
she,felt,as,young,and,guilty,as,when,she,was,ten,and,had,thrown,a,buttered,biscuit,at,suellen,at,the,table
to,think,of,her,gentle,mother,reproving,her,so,harshly,and,her,father,coming,to,town,to,talk,to,captain,butler
the,real,seriousness,of,the,matter,grew,on,her
gerald,was,going,to,be,severe
this,was,one,time,when,she,knew,she,couldn't,wiggle,out,of,her,punishment,by,sitting,on,his,knee,and,being,sweet,and,pert
not,not,bad,news
quavered,pittypat
pa,is,coming,tomorrow,and,he's,going,to,land,on,me,like,a,duck,on,a,june,bug,answered,scarlett,dolorously
prissy,find,my,salts,fluttered,pittypat,pushing,back,her,chair,from,her,half-eaten,meal
i,i,feel,faint
dey's,in,yo',skirt,pocket,said,prissy,who,had,been,hovering,behind,scarlett,enjoying,the,sensational,drama
mist',gerald,in,a,temper,was,always,exciting,providing,his,temper,was,not,directed,at,her,kinky,head
pitty,fumbled,at,her,skirt,and,held,the,vial,to,her,nose
you,all,must,stand,by,me,and,not,leave,me,alone,with,him,for,one,minute,cried,scarlett
he's,so,fond,of,you,both,and,if,you,are,with,me,he,can't,fuss,at,me
i,couldn't,said,pittypat,weakly,rising,to,her,feet
i,i,feel,ill,i,must,go,lie,down
i,shall,lie,down,all,day,tomorrow
you,must,give,him,my,excuses
coward
thought,scarlett,glowering,at,her
melly,rallied,to,the,defense,though,white,and,frightened,at,the,prospect,of,facing,the,fire-eating,mr,o'hara
i'll,i'll,help,you,explain,how,you,did,it,for,the,hospital
surely,he'll,understand
no,he,won't,said,scarlett
and,oh,i,shall,die,if,i,have,to,go,back,to,tara,in,disgrace,like,mother,threatens
oh,you,can't,go,home,cried,pittypat,bursting,into,tears
if,you,did,i,should,be,forced,yes,forced,to,ask,henry,to,come,live,with,us,and,you,know,i,just,couldn't,live,with,henry
i'm,so,nervous,with,just,melly,in,the,house,at,night,with,so,many,strange,men,in,town
you're,so,brave,i,don't,mind,being,here,without,a,man
oh,he,couldn't,take,you,to,tara
said,melly,looking,as,if,she,too,would,cry,in,a,moment
this,is,your,home,now
what,would,we,ever,do,without,you
you'd,be,glad,to,do,without,me,if,you,knew,what,i,really,think,of,you,thought,scarlett,sourly,wishing,there,were,some,other,person,than,melanie,to,help,ward,off,gerald's,wrath
it,was,sickening,to,be,defended,by,someone,you,disliked,so,much
perhaps,we,should,recall,our,invitation,to,captain,butler,began,pittypat
oh,we,couldn't
it,would,be,the,height,of,rudeness
cried,melly,distressed
help,me,to,bed
i'm,going,to,be,ill,moaned,pittypat
oh,scarlett,how,could,you,have,brought,this,on,me
pittypat,was,ill,and,in,her,bed,when,gerald,arrived,the,next,afternoon
she,sent,many,messages,of,regret,to,him,from,behind,her,closed,door,and,left,the,two,frightened,girls,to,preside,over,the,supper,table
gerald,was,ominously,silent,although,he,kissed,scarlett,and,pinched,melanie's,cheek,approvingly,and,called,her,cousin,melly
scarlett,would,have,infinitely,preferred,bellowing,oaths,and,accusations
true,to,her,promise,melanie,clung,to,scarlett's,skirts,like,a,small,rustling,shadow,and,gerald,was,too,much,of,a,gentleman,to,upbraid,his,daughter,in,front,of,her
scarlett,had,to,admit,that,melanie,carried,off,things,very,well,acting,as,if,she,knew,nothing,was,amiss,and,she,actually,succeeded,in,engaging,gerald,in,conversation,once,the,supper,had,been,served
i,want,to,know,all,about,the,county,she,said,beaming,upon,him
india,and,honey,are,such,poor,correspondents,and,i,know,you,know,everything,that,goes,on,down,there
do,tell,us,about,joe,fontaine's,wedding
gerald,warmed,to,the,flattery,and,said,that,the,wedding,had,been,a,quiet,affair,not,like,you,girls,had,for,joe,had,only,a,few,days',furlough
sally,the,little,munroe,chit,looked,very,pretty
no,he,couldn't,recall,what,she,wore,but,he,did,hear,that,she,didn't,have,a,second-day,dress
she,didn't
exclaimed,the,girls,scandalized
sure,because,she,didn't,have,a,second,day,gerald,explained,and,bawled,with,laughter,before,recalling,that,perhaps,such,remarks,were,not,fit,for,female,ears
scarlett's,spirits,soared,at,his,laugh,and,she,blessed,melanie's,tact
back,joe,went,to,virginia,the,next,day,gerald,added,hastily
there,was,no,visiting,about,and,dancing,afterwards
the,tarleton,twins,are,home
we,heard,that
have,they,recovered
they,weren't,badly,wounded
stuart,had,it,in,the,knee,and,a,minie,ball,went,through,brent's,shoulder
you,had,it,too,that,they,were,mentioned,in,dispatches,for,bravery
no
tell,us
hare,brained,both,of,them
i'm,believing,there's,irish,in,them,said,gerald,complacently
i,forget,what,they,did,but,brent,is,a,lieutenant,now
scarlett,felt,pleased,at,hearing,of,their,exploits,pleased,in,a,proprietary,manner
once,a,man,had,been,her,beau,she,never,lost,the,conviction,that,he,belonged,to,her,and,all,his,good,deeds,redounded,to,her,credit
and,i've,news,that'll,be,holding,the,both,of,you,said,gerald
they're,saying,stu,is,courting,at,twelve,oaks,again
honey,or,india
questioned,melly,excitedly,while,scarlett,stared,almost,indignantly
oh,miss,india,to,be,sure
didn't,she,have,him,fast,till,this,baggage,of,mine,winked,at,him
oh,said,melly,somewhat,embarrassed,at,gerald's,outspokenness
and,more,than,that,young,brent,has,taken,to,hanging,about,tara
now
scarlett,could,not,speak
the,defection,of,her,beaux,was,almost,insulting
especially,when,she,recalled,how,wildly,both,the,twins,had,acted,when,she,told,them,she,was,going,to,marry,charles
stuart,had,even,threatened,to,shoot,charles,or,scarlett,or,himself,or,all,three
it,had,been,most,exciting
suellen
questioned,melly,breaking,into,a,pleased,smile
but,i,thought,mr,kennedy
oh,him
said,gerald
frank,kennedy,still,pussyfoots,about,afraid,of,his,shadow,and,i'll,be,asking,him,his,intentions,soon,if,he,doesn't,speak,up
no,'tis,me,baby
carreen
she's,nothing,but,a,child
said,scarlett,sharply,finding,her,tongue
she's,little,more,than,a,year,younger,than,you,were,miss,when,you,were,married,retorted,gerald
is,it,you're,grudging,your,old,beau,to,your,sister
melly,blushed,unaccustomed,to,such,frankness,and,signaled,peter,to,bring,in,the,sweet,potato,pie
frantically,she,cast,about,in,her,mind,for,some,other,topic,of,conversation,which,would,not,be,so,personal,but,which,would,divert,mr,o'hara,from,the,purpose,of,his,trip
she,could,think,of,nothing,but,once,started,gerald,needed,no,stimulus,other,than,an,audience
he,talked,on,about,the,thievery,of,the,commissary,department,which,every,month,increased,its,demands,the,knavish,stupidity,of,jefferson,davis,and,the,blackguardery,of,the,irish,who,were,being,enticed,into,the,yankee,army,by,bounty,money
when,the,wine,was,on,the,table,and,the,two,girls,rose,to,leave,him,gerald,cocked,a,severe,eye,at,his,daughter,from,under,frowning,brows,and,commanded,her,presence,alone,for,a,few,minutes
scarlett,cast,a,despairing,glance,at,melly,who,twisted,her,handkerchief,helplessly,and,went,out,softly,pulling,the,sliding,doors,together
how,now,missy
bawled,gerald,pouring,himself,a,glass,of,port
'tis,a,fine,way,to,act
is,it,another,husband,you're,trying,to,catch,and,you,so,fresh,a,widow
not,so,loud,pa,the,servants
they,know,already,to,be,sure,and,everybody,knows,of,our,disgrace
and,your,poor,mother,taking,to,her,bed,with,it,and,me,not,able,to,hold,up,me,head
'tis,shameful
no,puss,you,need,not,think,to,get,around,me,with,tears,this,time,he,said,hastily,and,with,some,panic,in,his,voice,as,scarlett's,lids,began,to,bat,and,her,mouth,to,screw,up
i,know,you
you'd,be,flirting,at,the,wake,of,your,husband
don't,cry
there,i'll,be,saying,no,more,tonight,for,i'm,going,to,see,this,fine,captain,butler,who,makes,so,light,of,me,daughter's,reputation
but,in,the,morning,there,now,don't,cry
twill,do,you,no,good,at,all,at,all
'tis,firm,that,i,am,and,back,to,tara,you'll,be,going,tomorrow,before,you're,disgracing,the,lot,of,us,again
don't,cry,pet
look,what,i've,brought,you

see,look
how,could,you,be,putting,so,much,trouble,on,me,bringing,me,all,the,way,up,here,when,'tis,a,busy,man,i,am
don't,cry
melanie,and,pittypat,had,gone,to,sleep,hours,before,but,scarlett,lay,awake,in,the,warm,darkness,her,heart,heavy,and,frightened,in,her,breast
to,leave,atlanta,when,life,had,just,begun,again,and,go,home,and,face,ellen
she,would,rather,die,than,face,her,mother
she,wished,she,were,dead,this,very,minute,then,everyone,would,be,sorry,they,had,been,so,hateful
she,turned,and,tossed,on,the,hot,pillow,until,a,noise,far,up,the,quiet,street,reached,her,ears
it,was,an,oddly,familiar,noise,blurred,and,indistinct,though,it,was
she,slipped,out,of,bed,and,went,to,the,window
the,street,with,its,over-arching,trees,was,softly,deeply,black,under,a,dim,star-studded,sky
the,noise,came,closer,the,sound,of,wheels,the,plod,of,a,horse's,hooves,and,voices
and,suddenly,she,grinned,for,as,a,voice,thick,with,brogue,and,whisky,came,to,her,raised,in,peg,in,a,low-backed,car,she,knew
this,might,not,be,jonesboro,on,court,day,but,gerald,was,coming,home,in,the,same,condition
she,saw,the,dark,bulk,of,a,buggy,stop,in,front,of,the,house,and,indistinct,figures,alight
someone,was,with,him
two,figures,paused,at,the,gate,and,she,heard,the,click,of,the,latch,and,gerald's,voice,came,plain
now,i'll,be,giving,you,the,'lament,for,robert,emmet,'
'tis,a,song,you,should,be,knowing,me,lad
i'll,teach,it,to,you
i'd,like,to,learn,it,replied,his,companion,a,hint,of,buried,laughter,in,his,flat,drawling,voice
but,not,now,mr
o'hara
oh,my,god,it's,that,hateful,butler,man
thought,scarlett,at,first,annoyed
then,she,took,heart
at,least,they,hadn't,shot,each,other
and,they,must,be,on,amicable,terms,to,be,coming,home,together,at,this,hour,and,in,this,condition
sing,it,i,will,and,listen,you,will,or,i'll,be,shooting,you,for,the,orangeman,you,are
not,orangeman,charlestonian
'tis,no,better
'tis,worse
i,have,two,sister-in-laws,in,charleston,and,i,know
is,he,going,to,tell,the,whole,neighborhood
thought,scarlett,panic-stricken,reaching,for,her,wrapper
but,what,could,she,do
she,couldn't,go,downstairs,at,this,hour,of,the,night,and,drag,her,father,in,from,the,street
with,no,further,warning,gerald,who,was,hanging,on,the,gate,threw,back,his,head,and,began,the,lament,in,a,roaring,bass
scarlett,rested,her,elbows,on,the,window,sill,and,listened,grinning,unwillingly
it,would,be,a,beautiful,song,if,only,her,father,could,carry,a,tune
it,was,one,of,her,favorite,songs,and,for,a,moment,she,followed,the,fine,melancholy,of,those,verses,beginning
she,is,far,from,the,land,where,her,young,hero,sleeps,and,lovers,are,round,her,sighing
the,song,went,on,and,she,heard,stirrings,in,pittypat's,and,melly's,rooms
poor,things,they'd,certainly,be,upset
they,were,not,used,to,full-blooded,males,like,gerald
when,the,song,had,finished,two,forms,merged,into,one,came,up,the,walk,and,mounted,the,steps
a,discreet,knock,sounded,at,the,door
i,suppose,i,must,go,down,thought,scarlett
after,all,he's,my,father,and,poor,pitty,would,die,before,she'd,go
besides,she,didn't,want,the,servants,to,see,gerald,in,his,present,condition
and,if,peter,tried,to,put,him,to,bed,he,might,get,unruly
pork,was,the,only,one,who,knew,how,to,handle,him
she,pinned,the,wrapper,close,about,her,throat,lit,her,bedside,candle,and,hurried,down,the,dark,stairs,into,the,front,hall
setting,the,candle,on,the,stand,she,unlocked,the,door,and,in,the,wavering,light,she,saw,rhett,butler,not,a,ruffle,disarranged,supporting,her,small,thickset,father
the,lament,had,evidently,been,gerald's,swan,song,for,he,was,frankly,hanging,onto,his,companion's,arm
his,hat,was,gone,his,crisp,long,hair,was,tumbled,in,a,white,mane,his,cravat,was,under,one,ear,and,there,were,liquor,stains,down,his,shirt,bosom
your,father,i,believe
said,captain,butler,his,eyes,amused,in,his,swarthy,face
he,took,in,her,dishabille,in,one,glance,that,seemed,to,penetrate,through,her,wrapper
bring,him,in,she,said,shortly,embarrassed,at,her,attire,infuriated,at,gerald,for,putting,her,in,a,position,where,this,man,could,laugh,at,her
rhett,propelled,gerald,forward
shall,i,help,you,take,him,upstairs
you,cannot,manage,him
he's,quite,heavy
her,mouth,fell,open,with,horror,at,the,audacity,of,his,proposal
just,imagine,what,pittypat,and,melly,cowering,in,their,beds,would,think,should,captain,butler,come,upstairs
mother,of,god,no
in,here,in,the,parlor,on,that,settee
the,suttee,did,you,say
i'll,thank,you,to,keep,a,civil,tongue,in,your,head
here
now,lay,him,down
shall,i,take,off,his,boots
no
he's,slept,in,them,before
she,could,have,bitten,off,her,tongue,for,that,slip,for,he,laughed,softly,as,he,crossed,gerald's,legs
please,go,now
he,walked,out,into,the,dim,hall,and,picked,up,the,hat,he,had,dropped,on,the,doorsill
i,will,be,seeing,you,sunday,at,dinner,he,said,and,went,out,closing,the,door,noiselessly,behind,him
scarlett,arose,at,five-thirty,before,the,servants,had,come,in,from,the,back,yard,to,start,breakfast,and,slipped,down,the,steps,to,the,quiet,lower,floor
gerald,was,awake,sitting,on,the,sofa,his,hands,gripping,his,bullet,head,as,if,he,wished,to,crush,it,between,his,palms
he,looked,up,furtively,as,she,entered
the,pain,of,moving,his,eyes,was,too,excruciating,to,be,borne,and,he,groaned
wurra,the,day
it's,a,fine,way,you've,acted,pa,she,began,in,a,furious,whisper
coming,home,at,such,an,hour,and,waking,all,the,neighbors,with,your,singing
i,sang
sang
you,woke,the,echoes,singing,the,'lament,'
'tis,nothing,i'm,remembering
the,neighbors,will,remember,it,till,their,dying,day,and,so,will,miss,pittypat,and,melanie
mother,of,sorrows,moaned,gerald,moving,a,thickly,furred,tongue,around,parched,lips
'tis,little,i'm,remembering,after,the,game,started
game
that,laddybuck,butler,bragged,that,he,was,the,best,poker,player,in
how,much,did,you,lose
why,i,won,naturally
a,drink,or,two,helps,me,game
look,in,your,wallet
as,if,every,movement,was,agony,gerald,removed,his,wallet,from,his,coat,and,opened,it
it,was,empty,and,he,looked,at,it,in,forlorn,bewilderment
five,hundred,dollars,he,said
and,'twas,to,buy,things,from,the,blockaders,for,mrs,o'hara,and,now,not,even,fare,left,to,tara
as,she,looked,indignantly,at,the,empty,purse,an,idea,took,form,in,scarlett's,mind,and,grew,swiftly
i'll,not,be,holding,up,my,head,in,this,town,she,began
you've,disgraced,us,all
hold,your,tongue,puss
can,you,not,see,me,head,is,bursting
coming,home,drunk,with,a,man,like,captain,butler,and,singing,at,the,top,of,your,lungs,for,everyone,to,hear,and,losing,all,that,money
the,man,is,too,clever,with,cards,to,be,a,gentleman
he
what,will,mother,say,when,she,hears
he,looked,up,in,sudden,anguished,apprehension
you,wouldn't,be,telling,your,mother,a,word,and,upsetting,her,now,would,you
scarlett,said,nothing,but,pursed,her,lips
think,now,how,'twould,hurt,her,and,her,so,gentle
and,to,think,pa,that,you,said,only,last,night,i,had,disgraced,the,family
me,with,my,poor,little,dance,to,make,money,for,the,soldiers
oh,i,could,cry
well,don't,pleaded,gerald
'twould,be,more,than,me,poor,head,could,stand,and,sure,'tis,bursting,now
and,you,said,that,i
now,puss,now,puss,don't,you,be,hurt,at,what,your,poor,old,father,said,and,him,not,meaning,a,thing,and,not,understanding,a,thing
sure,you're,a,fine,well-meaning,girl,i'm,sure
and,wanting,to,take,me,home,in,disgrace
ah,darling,i,wouldn't,be,doing,that
'twas,to,tease,you
you,won't,be,mentioning,the,money,to,your,mother,and,her,in,a,flutter,about,expenses,already
no,said,scarlett,frankly,i,won't,if,you'll,let,me,stay,here,and,if,you'll,tell,mother,that,'twas,nothing,but,a,lot,of,gossip,from,old,cats
gerald,looked,mournfully,at,his,daughter
'tis,blackmail,no,less
and,last,night,was,a,scandal,no,less
well,he,began,wheedlingly,we'll,be,forgetting,all,that
and,do,you,think,a,fine,pretty,lady,like,miss,pittypat,would,be,having,any,brandy,in,the,house
the,hair,of,the,dog
scarlett,turned,and,tiptoed,through,the,silent,hall,into,the,dining,room,to,get,the,brandy,bottle,that,she,and,melly,privately,called,the,swoon,bottle,because,pittypat,always,took,a,sip,from,it,when,her,fluttering,heart,made,her,faint,or,seem,to,faint
triumph,was,written,on,her,face,and,no,trace,of,shame,for,her,unfilial,treatment,of,gerald
now,ellen,would,be,soothed,with,lies,if,any,other,busybody,wrote,her
now,she,could,stay,in,atlanta
now,she,could,do,almost,as,she,pleased,pittypat,being,the,weak,vessel,that,she,was
she,unlocked,the,cellaret,and,stood,for,a,moment,with,the,bottle,and,glass,pressed,to,her,bosom
she,saw,a,long,vista,of,picnics,by,the,bubbling,waters,of,peachtree,creek,and,barbecues,at,stone,mountain,receptions,and,balls,afternoon,danceables,buggy,rides,and,sunday-night,buffet,suppers
she,would,be,there,right,in,the,heart,of,things,right,in,the,center,of,a,crowd,of,men
and,men,fell,in,love,so,easily,after,you,did,little,things,for,them,at,the,hospital
she,wouldn't,mind,the,hospital,so,much,now
men,were,so,easily,stirred,when,they,had,been,ill,they,fell,into,a,clever,girl's,hand,just,like,the,ripe,peaches,at,tara,when,the,trees,were,gently,shaken
she,went,back,toward,her,father,with,the,reviving,liquor,thanking,heaven,that,the,famous,o'hara,head,had,not,been,able,to,survive,last,night's,bout,and,wondering,suddenly,if,rhett,butler,had,had,anything,to,do,with,that
chapter,xi
on,an,afternoon,of,the,following,week,scarlett,came,home,from,the,hospital,weary,and,indignant
she,was,tired,from,standing,on,her,feet,all,morning,and,irritable,because,mrs,merriwether,had,scolded,her,sharply,for,sitting,on,a,soldier's,bed,while,she,dressed,his,wounded,arm
aunt,pitty,and,melanie,bonneted,in,their,best,were,on,the,porch,with,wade,and,prissy,ready,for,their,weekly,round,of,calls
scarlett,asked,to,be,excused,from,accompanying,them,and,went,upstairs,to,her,room
when,the,last,sound,of,carriage,wheels,had,died,away,and,she,knew,the,family,was,safely,out,of,sight,she,slipped,quietly,into,melanie's,room,and,turned,the,key,in,the,lock
it,was,a,prim,virginal,little,room,and,it,lay,still,and,warm,in,the,slanting,rays,of,the,four-o'clock,sun
the,floors,were,glistening,and,bare,except,for,a,few,bright,rag,rugs,and,the,white,walls,unornamented,save,for,one,corner,which,melanie,had,fitted,up,as,a,shrine
here,under,a,draped,confederate,flag,hung,the,gold-hilted,saber,that,melanie's,father,had,carried,in,the,mexican,war,the,same,saber,charles,had,worn,away,to,war
charles',sash,and,pistol,belt,hung,there,too,with,his,revolver,in,the,holster
between,the,saber,and,the,pistol,was,a,daguerreotype,of,charles,himself,very,stiff,and,proud,in,his,gray,uniform,his,great,brown,eyes,shining,out,of,the,frame,and,a,shy,smile,on,his,lips
scarlett,did,not,even,glance,at,the,picture,but,went,unhesitatingly,across,the,room,to,the,square,rosewood,writing,box,that,stood,on,the,table,beside,the,narrow,bed
from,it,she,took,a,pack,of,letters,tied,together,with,a,blue,ribbon,addressed,in,ashley's,hand,to,melanie
on,the,top,was,the,letter,which,had,come,that,morning,and,this,one,she,opened
when,scarlett,first,began,secretly,reading,these,letters,she,had,been,so,stricken,of,conscience,and,so,fearful,of,discovery,she,could,hardly,open,the,envelopes,for,trembling
now,her,never-,too-scrupulous,sense,of,honor,was,dulled,by,repetition,of,the,offense,and,even,fear,of,discovery,had,subsided
occasionally,she,thought,with,a,sinking,heart,what,would,mother,say,if,she,knew
she,knew,ellen,would,rather,see,her,dead,than,know,her,guilty,of,such,dishonor
this,had,worried,scarlett,at,first,for,she,still,wanted,to,be,like,her,mother,in,every,respect
but,the,temptation,to,read,the,letters,was,too,great,and,she,put,the,thought,of,ellen,out,of,her,mind
she,had,become,adept,at,putting,unpleasant,thoughts,out,of,her,mind,these,days
she,had,learned,to,say,i,won't,think,of,this,or,that,bothersome,thought,now
i'll,think,about,it,tomorrow
generally,when,tomorrow,came,the,thought,either,did,not,occur,at,all,or,it,was,so,attenuated,by,the,delay,it,was,not,very,troublesome
so,the,matter,of,ashley's,letters,did,not,lie,very,heavily,on,her,conscience
melanie,was,always,generous,with,the,letters,reading,parts,of,them,aloud,to,aunt,pitty,and,scarlett
but,it,was,the,part,she,did,not,read,that,tormented,scarlett,that,drove,her,to,surreptitious,reading,of,her,sister-in-law's,mail
she,had,to,know,if,ashley,had,come,to,love,his,wife,since,marrying,her
she,had,to,know,if,he,even,pretended,to,love,her
did,he,address,tender,endearments,to,her
what,sentiments,did,he,express,and,with,what,warmth
she,carefully,smoothed,out,the,letter
ashley's,small,even,writing,leaped,up,at,her,as,she,read,my,dear,wife,and,she,breathed,in,relief
he,wasn't,calling,melanie,darling,or,sweetheart,yet
my,dear,wife,you,write,me,saying,you,are,alarmed,lest,i,be,concealing,my,real,thoughts,from,you,and,you,ask,me,what,is,occupying,my,mind,these,days
mother,of,god
thought,scarlett,in,a,panic,of,guilt
'concealing,his,real,thoughts,'
can,melly,have,read,his,mind
or,my,mind
does,she,suspect,that,he,and,i
her,hands,trembled,with,fright,as,she,held,the,letter,closer,but,as,she,read,the,next,paragraph,she,relaxed
dear,wife,if,i,have,concealed,aught,from,you,it,is,because,i,did,not,wish,to,lay,a,burden,on,your,shoulders,to,add,to,your,worries,for,my,physical,safety,with,those,of,my,mental,turmoil
but,i,can,keep,nothing,from,you,for,you,know,me,too,well
do,not,be,alarmed
i,have,no,wound
i,have,not,been,ill,i,have,enough,to,eat,and,occasionally,a,bed,to,sleep,in
a,soldier,can,ask,for,no,more
but,melanie,heavy,thoughts,lie,on,my,heart,and,i,will,open,my,heart,to,you
these,summer,nights,i,lie,awake,long,after,the,camp,is,sleeping,and,i,look,up,at,the,stars,and,over,and,over,i,wonder,'why,are,you,here,ashley,wilkes
what,are,you,fighting,for,'
not,for,honor,and,glory,certainly
war,is,a,dirty,business,and,i,do,not,like,dirt
i,am,not,a,soldier,and,i,have,no,desire,to,seek,the,bubble,reputation,even,in,the,cannon's,mouth
yet,here,i,am,at,the,wars,whom,god,never,intended,to,be,other,than,a,studious,country,gentleman
for,melanie,bugles,do,not,stir,my,blood,nor,drums,entice,my,feet,and,i,see,too,clearly,that,we,have,been,betrayed,betrayed,by,our,arrogant,southern,selves,believing,that,one,of,us,could,whip,a,dozen,yankees,believing,that,king,cotton,could,rule,the,world
betrayed,too,by,words,and,catch,phrases,prejudices,and,hatreds,coming,from,the,mouths,of,those,highly,placed,those,men,whom,we,respected,and,revered,'king,cotton,slavery,states',rights,damn,yankees,'
and,so,when,i,lie,on,my,blanket,and,look,up,at,the,stars,and,say,'what,are,you,fighting,for,'
i,think,of,states',rights,and,cotton,and,the,darkies,and,the,yankees,whom,we,have,been,bred,to,hate,and,i,know,that,none,of,these,is,the,reason,why,i,am,fighting
instead,i,see,twelve,oaks,and,remember,how,the,moonlight,slants,across,the,white,columns,and,the,unearthly,way,the,magnolias,look,opening,under,the,moon,and,how,the,climbing,roses,make,the,side,porch,shady,even,at,the,hottest,noon
and,i,see,mother,sewing,there,as,she,did,when,i,was,a,little,boy
and,i,hear,the,darkies,coming,home,across,the,fields,at,dusk,tired,and,singing,and,ready,for,supper,and,the,sound,of,the,windlass,as,the,bucket,goes,down,into,the,cool,well
and,there's,the,long,view,down,the,road,to,the,river,across,the,cotton,fields,and,the,mist,rising,from,the,bottom,lands,in,the,twilight
and,that,is,why,i'm,here,who,have,no,love,of,death,or,misery,or,glory,and,no,hatred,for,anyone
perhaps,that,is,what,is,called,patriotism,love,of,home,and,country
but,melanie,it,goes,deeper,than,that
for,melanie,these,things,i,have,named,are,but,the,symbols,of,the,thing,for,which,i,risk,my,life,symbols,of,the,kind,of,life,i,love
for,i,am,fighting,for,the,old,days,the,old,ways,i,love,so,much,but,which,i,fear,are,now,gone,forever,no,matter,how,the,die,may,fall
for,win,or,lose,we,lose,just,the,same
if,we,win,this,war,and,have,the,cotton,kingdom,of,our,dreams,we,still,have,lost,for,we,will,become,a,different,people,and,the,old,quiet,ways,will,go
the,world,will,be,at,our,doors,clamoring,for,cotton,and,we,can,command,our,own,price
then,i,fear,we,will,become,like,the,yankees,at,whose,money-making,activities,acquisitiveness,and,commercialism,we,now,sneer
and,if,we,lose,melanie,if,we,lose
i,am,not,afraid,of,danger,or,capture,or,wounds,or,even,death,if,death,must,come,but,i,do,fear,that,once,this,war,is,over,we,will,never,get,back,to,the,old,times
and,i,belong,in,those,old,times
i,do,not,belong,in,this,mad,present,of,killing,and,i,fear,i,will,not,fit,into,any,future,try,though,i,may
nor,will,you,my,dear,for,you,and,i,are,of,the,same,blood
i,do,not,know,what,the,future,will,bring,but,it,cannot,be,as,beautiful,or,as,satisfying,as,the,past
i,lie,and,look,at,the,boys,sleeping,near,me,and,i,wonder,if,the,twins,or,alex,or,cade,think,these,same,thoughts
i,wonder,if,they,know,they,are,fighting,for,a,cause,that,was,lost,the,minute,the,first,shot,was,fired,for,our,cause,is,really,our,own,way,of,living,and,that,is,gone,already
but,i,do,not,think,they,think,these,things,and,they,are,lucky
i,had,not,thought,of,this,for,us,when,i,asked,you,to,marry,me
i,had,thought,of,life,going,on,at,twelve,oaks,as,it,had,always,done,peacefully,easily,unchanging
we,are,alike,melanie,loving,the,same,quiet,things,and,i,saw,before,us,a,long,stretch,of,uneventful,years,in,which,to,read,hear,music,and,dream
but,not,this
never,this
that,this,could,happen,to,us,all,this,wrecking,of,old,ways,this,bloody,slaughter,and,hate
melanie,nothing,is,worth,it,states',rights,nor,slaves,nor,cotton
nothing,is,worth,what,is,happening,to,us,now,and,what,may,happen,for,if,the,yankees,whip,us,the,future,will,be,one,of,incredible,horror
and,my,dear,they,may,yet,whip,us
i,should,not,write,those,words
i,should,not,even,think,them
but,you,have,asked,me,what,was,in,my,heart,and,the,fear,of,defeat,is,there
do,you,remember,at,the,barbecue,the,day,our,engagement,was,announced,that,a,man,named,butler,a,charlestonian,by,his,accent,nearly,caused,a,fight,by,his,remarks,about,the,ignorance,of,southerners
do,you,recall,how,the,twins,wanted,to,shoot,him,because,he,said,we,had,few,foundries,and,factories,mills,and,ships,arsenals,and,machine,shops
do,you,recall,how,he,said,the,yankee,fleet,could,bottle,us,up,so,tightly,we,could,not,ship,out,our,cotton
he,was,right
we,are,fighting,the,yankees',new,rifles,with,revolutionary,war,muskets,and,soon,the,blockade,will,be,too,tight,for,even,medical,supplies,to,slip,in
we,should,have,paid,heed,to,cynics,like,butler,who,knew,instead,of,statesmen,who,felt,and,talked
he,said,in,effect,that,the,south,had,nothing,with,which,to,wage,war,but,cotton,and,arrogance
our,cotton,is,worthless,and,what,he,called,arrogance,is,all,that,is,left
but,i,call,that,arrogance,matchless,courage
if
but,scarlett,carefully,folded,up,the,letter,without,finishing,it,and,thrust,it,back,into,the,envelope,too,bored,to,read,further
besides,the,tone,of,the,letter,vaguely,depressed,her,with,its,foolish,talk,of,defeat
after,all,she,wasn't,reading,melanie's,mail,to,learn,ashley's,puzzling,and,uninteresting,ideas
she,had,had,to,listen,to,enough,of,them,when,he,sat,on,the,porch,at,tara,in,days,gone,by
all,she,wanted,to,know,was,whether,he,wrote,impassioned,letters,to,his,wife
so,far,he,had,not
she,had,read,every,letter,in,the,writing,box,and,there,was,nothing,in,any,one,of,them,that,a,brother,might,not,have,written,to,a,sister
they,were,affectionate,humorous,discursive,but,not,the,letters,of,a,lover
scarlett,had,received,too,many,ardent,love,letters,herself,not,to,recognize,the,authentic,note,of,passion,when,she,saw,it
and,that,note,was,missing
as,always,after,her,secret,readings,a,feeling,of,smug,satisfaction,enveloped,her,for,she,felt,certain,that,ashley,still,loved,her
and,always,she,wondered,sneeringly,why,melanie,did,not,realize,that,ashley,only,loved,her,as,a,friend
melanie,evidently,found,nothing,lacking,in,her,husband's,messages,but,melanie,had,had,no,other,man's,love,letters,with,which,to,compare,ashley's
he,writes,such,crazy,letters,scarlett,thought
if,ever,any,husband,of,mine,wrote,me,such,twaddle-twaddle,he'd,certainly,hear,from,me
why,even,charlie,wrote,better,letters,than,these
she,flipped,back,the,edges,of,the,letters,looking,at,the,dates,remembering,their,contents
in,them,there,were,no,fine,descriptive,pages,of,bivouacs,and,charges,such,as,darcy,meade,wrote,his,parents,or,poor,dallas,mclure,had,written,his,old-maid,sisters,misses,faith,and,hope
the,meades,and,mclures,proudly,read,these,letters,all,over,the,neighborhood,and,scarlett,had,frequently,felt,a,secret,shame,that,melanie,had,no,such,letters,from,ashley,to,read,aloud,at,sewing,circles
it,was,as,though,when,writing,melanie,ashley,tried,to,ignore,the,war,altogether,and,sought,to,draw,about,the,two,of,them,a,magic,circle,of,timelessness,shutting,out,everything,that,had,happened,since,fort,sumter,was,the,news,of,the,day
it,was,almost,as,if,he,were,trying,to,believe,there,wasn't,any,war
he,wrote,of,books,which,he,and,melanie,had,read,and,songs,they,had,sung,of,old,friends,they,knew,and,places,he,had,visited,on,his,grand,tour
through,the,letters,ran,a,wistful,yearning,to,be,back,home,at,twelve,oaks,and,for,pages,he,wrote,of,the,hunting,and,the,long,rides,through,the,still,forest,paths,under,frosty,autumn,stars,the,barbecues,the,fish,fries,the,quiet,of,moonlight,nights,and,the,serene,charm,of,the,old,house
she,thought,of,his,words,in,the,letter,she,had,just,read,not,this
never,this
and,they,seemed,to,cry,of,a,tormented,soul,facing,something,he,could,not,face,yet,must,face
it,puzzled,her,for,if,he,was,not,afraid,of,wounds,and,death,what,was,it,he,feared
unanalytical,she,struggled,with,the,complex,thought
the,war,disturbs,him,and,he,he,doesn't,like,things,that,disturb,him
me,for,instance
he,loved,me,but,he,was,afraid,to,marry,me,because,for,fear,i'd,upset,his,way,of,thinking,and,living
no,it,wasn't,exactly,that,he,was,afraid
ashley,isn't,a,coward
he,couldn't,be,when,he's,been,mentioned,in,dispatches,and,when,colonel,sloan,wrote,that,letter,to,melly,all,about,his,gallant,conduct,in,leading,the,charge
once,he's,made,up,his,mind,to,do,something,no,one,could,be,braver,or,more,determined,but,he,lives,inside,his,head,instead,of,outside,in,the,world,and,he,hates,to,come,out,into,the,world,and,oh,i,don't,know,what,it,is
if,i'd,just,understood,this,one,thing,about,him,years,ago,i,know,he'd,have,married,me
she,stood,for,a,moment,holding,the,letters,to,her,breast,thinking,longingly,of,ashley
her,emotions,toward,him,had,not,changed,since,the,day,when,she,first,fell,in,love,with,him
they,were,the,same,emotions,that,struck,her,speechless,that,day,when,she,was,fourteen,years,old,and,she,had,stood,on,the,porch,of,tara,and,seen,ashley,ride,up,smiling,his,hair,shining,silver,in,the,morning,sun
her,love,was,still,a,young,girl's,adoration,for,a,man,she,could,not,understand,a,man,who,possessed,all,the,qualities,she,did,not,own,but,which,she,admired
he,was,still,a,young,girl's,dream,of,the,perfect,knight,and,her,dream,asked,no,more,than,acknowledgment,of,his,love,went,no,further,than,hopes,of,a,kiss
after,reading,the,letters,she,felt,certain,he,did,love,her,scarlett,even,though,he,had,married,melanie,and,that,certainty,was,almost,all,that,she,desired
she,was,still,that,young,and,untouched
had,charles,with,his,fumbling,awkwardness,and,his,embarrassed,intimacies,tapped,any,of,the,deep,vein,of,passionate,feeling,within,her,her,dreams,of,ashley,would,not,be,ending,with,a,kiss
but,those,few,moonlight,nights,alone,with,charles,had,not,touched,her,emotions,or,ripened,her,to,maturity
charles,had,awakened,no,idea,of,what,passion,might,be,or,tenderness,or,true,intimacy,of,body,or,spirit
all,that,passion,meant,to,her,was,servitude,to,inexplicable,male,madness,unshared,by,females,a,painful,and,embarrassing,process,that,led,inevitably,to,the,still,more,painful,process,of,childbirth
that,marriage,should,be,like,this,was,no,surprise,to,her
ellen,had,hinted,before,the,wedding,that,marriage,was,something,women,must,bear,with,dignity,and,fortitude,and,the,whispered,comments,of,other,matrons,since,her,widowhood,had,confirmed,this
scarlett,was,glad,to,be,done,with,passion,and,marriage
she,was,done,with,marriage,but,not,with,love,for,her,love,for,ashley,was,something,different,having,nothing,to,do,with,passion,or,marriage,something,sacred,and,breathtakingly,beautiful,an,emotion,that,grew,stealthily,through,the,long,days,of,her,enforced,silence,feeding,on,oft-thumbed,memories,and,hopes
she,sighed,as,she,carefully,tied,the,ribbon,about,the,packet,wondering,for,the,thousandth,time,just,what,it,was,in,ashley,that,eluded,her,understanding
she,tried,to,think,the,matter,to,some,satisfactory,conclusion,but,as,always,the,conclusion,evaded,her,uncomplex,mind
she,put,the,letters,back,in,the,lap,secretary,and,closed,the,lid
then,she,frowned,for,her,mind,went,back,to,the,last,part,of,the,letter,she,had,just,read,to,his,mention,of,captain,butler
how,strange,that,ashley,should,be,impressed,by,something,that,scamp,had,said,a,year,ago
undeniably,captain,butler,was,a,scamp,for,all,that,he,danced,divinely
no,one,but,a,scamp,would,say,the,things,about,the,confederacy,that,he,had,said,at,the,bazaar
she,crossed,the,room,to,the,mirror,and,patted,her,smooth,hair,approvingly
her,spirits,rose,as,always,at,the,sight,of,her,white,skin,and,slanting,green,eyes,and,she,smiled,to,bring,out,her,dimples
then,she,dismissed,captain,butler,from,her,mind,as,she,happily,viewed,her,reflection,remembering,how,ashley,had,always,liked,her,dimples
no,pang,of,conscience,at,loving,another,woman's,husband,or,reading,that,woman's,mail,disturbed,her,pleasure,in,her,youth,and,charm,and,her,renewed,assurance,of,ashley's,love
she,unlocked,the,door,and,went,down,the,dim,winding,stair,with,a,light,heart
halfway,down,she,began,singing,when,this,cruel,war,is,over
chapter,xii
the,war,went,on,successfully,for,the,most,part,but,people,had,stopped,saying,one,more,victory,and,the,war,is,over,just,as,they,had,stopped,saying,the,yankees,were,cowards
it,was,obvious,to,all,now,that,the,yankees,were,far,from,cowardly,and,that,it,would,take,more,than,one,victory,to,conquer,them
however,there,were,the,confederate,victories,in,tennessee,scored,by,general,morgan,and,general,forrest,and,the,triumph,at,the,second,battle,of,bull,run,hung,up,like,visible,yankee,scalps,to,gloat,over
but,there,was,a,heavy,price,on,these,scalps
the,hospitals,and,homes,of,atlanta,were,overflowing,with,the,sick,and,wounded,and,more,and,more,women,were,appearing,in,black
the,monotonous,rows,of,soldiers',graves,at,oakland,cemetery,stretched,longer,every,day
confederate,money,had,dropped,alarmingly,and,the,price,of,food,and,clothing,had,risen,accordingly
the,commissary,was,laying,such,heavy,levies,on,foodstuffs,that,the,tables,of,atlanta,were,beginning,to,suffer
white,flour,was,scarce,and,so,expensive,that,corn,bread,was,universal,instead,of,biscuits,rolls,and,waffles
the,butcher,shops,carried,almost,no,beef,and,very,little,mutton,and,that,mutton,cost,so,much,only,the,rich,could,afford,it
however,there,was,still,plenty,of,hog,meat,as,well,as,chickens,and,vegetables
the,yankee,blockade,about,the,confederate,ports,had,tightened,and,luxuries,such,as,tea,coffee,silks,whalebone,stays,colognes,fashion,magazines,and,books,were,scarce,and,dear
even,the,cheapest,cotton,goods,had,skyrocketed,in,price,and,ladies,were,regretfully,making,their,old,dresses,do,another,season
looms,that,had,gathered,dust,for,years,had,been,brought,down,from,attics,and,there,were,webs,of,homespun,to,be,found,in,nearly,every,parlor
everyone,soldiers,civilians,women,children,and,negroes,began,to,wear,homespun
gray,as,the,color,of,the,confederate,uniform,practically,disappeared,and,homespun,of,a,butternut,shade,took,its,place
already,the,hospitals,were,worrying,about,the,scarcity,of,quinine,calomel,opium,chloroform,and,iodine
linen,and,cotton,bandages,were,too,precious,now,to,be,thrown,away,when,used,and,every,lady,who,nursed,at,the,hospitals,brought,home,baskets,of,bloody,strips,to,be,washed,and,ironed,and,returned,for,use,on,other,sufferers
but,to,scarlett,newly,emerged,from,the,chrysalis,of,widowhood,all,the,war,meant,was,a,time,of,gaiety,and,excitement
even,the,small,privations,of,clothing,and,food,did,not,annoy,her,so,happy,was,she,to,be,in,the,world,again
when,she,thought,of,the,dull,times,of,the,past,year,with,the,days,going,by,one,very,much,like,another,life,seemed,to,have,quickened,to,an,incredible,speed
every,day,dawned,as,an,exciting,adventure,a,day,in,which,she,would,meet,new,men,who,would,ask,to,call,on,her,tell,her,how,pretty,she,was,and,how,it,was,a,privilege,to,fight,and,perhaps,to,die,for,her
she,could,and,did,love,ashley,with,the,last,breath,in,her,body,but,that,did,not,prevent,her,from,inveigling,other,men,into,asking,to,marry,her
the,ever-present,war,in,the,background,lent,a,pleasant,informality,to,social,relations,an,informality,which,older,people,viewed,with,alarm
mothers,found,strange,men,calling,on,their,daughters,men,who,came,without,letters,of,introduction,and,whose,antecedents,were,unknown
to,their,horror,mothers,found,their,daughters,holding,hands,with,these,men
mrs,merriwether,who,had,never,kissed,her,husband,until,after,the,wedding,ceremony,could,scarcely,believe,her,eyes,when,she,caught,maybelle,kissing,the,little,zouave,rene,picard,and,her,consternation,was,even,greater,when,maybelle,refused,to,be,ashamed
even,the,fact,that,rene,immediately,asked,for,her,hand,did,not,improve,matters
mrs,merriwether,felt,that,the,south,was,heading,for,a,complete,moral,collapse,and,frequently,said,so
other,mothers,concurred,heartily,with,her,and,blamed,it,on,the,war
but,men,who,expected,to,die,within,a,week,or,a,month,could,not,wait,a,year,before,they,begged,to,call,a,girl,by,her,first,name,with,miss,of,course,preceding,it
nor,would,they,go,through,the,formal,and,protracted,courtships,which,good,manners,had,prescribed,before,the,war
they,were,likely,to,propose,in,three,or,four,months
and,girls,who,knew,very,well,that,a,lady,always,refused,a,gentleman,the,first,three,times,he,proposed,rushed,headlong,to,accept,the,first,time
this,informality,made,the,war,a,lot,of,fun,for,scarlett
except,for,the,messy,business,of,nursing,and,the,bore,of,bandage,rolling,she,did,not,care,if,the,war,lasted,forever
in,fact,she,could,endure,the,hospital,with,equanimity,now,because,it,was,a,perfect,happy,hunting,ground
the,helpless,wounded,succumbed,to,her,charms,without,a,struggle
renew,their,bandages,wash,their,faces,pat,up,their,pillows,and,fan,them,and,they,fell,in,love
oh,it,was,heaven,after,the,last,dreary,year
scarlett,was,back,again,where,she,had,been,before,she,married,charles,and,it,was,as,if,she,had,never,married,him,never,felt,the,shock,of,his,death,never,borne,wade
war,and,marriage,and,childbirth,had,passed,over,her,without,touching,any,deep,chord,within,her,and,she,was,unchanged
she,had,a,child,but,he,was,cared,for,so,well,by,the,others,in,the,red,brick,house,she,could,almost,forget,him
in,her,mind,and,heart,she,was,scarlett,o'hara,again,the,belle,of,the,county
her,thoughts,and,activities,were,the,same,as,they,had,been,in,the,old,days,but,the,field,of,her,activities,had,widened,immensely
careless,of,the,disapproval,of,aunt,pitty's,friends,she,behaved,as,she,had,behaved,before,her,marriage,went,to,parties,danced,went,riding,with,soldiers,flirted,did,everything,she,had,done,as,a,girl,except,stop,wearing,mourning
this,she,knew,would,be,a,straw,that,would,break,the,backs,of,pittypat,and,melanie
she,was,as,charming,a,widow,as,she,had,been,a,girl,pleasant,when,she,had,her,own,way,obliging,as,long,as,it,did,not,discommode,her,vain,of,her,looks,and,her,popularity
she,was,happy,now,where,a,few,weeks,before,she,had,been,miserable,happy,with,her,beaux,and,their,reassurances,of,her,charm,as,happy,as,she,could,be,with,ashley,married,to,melanie,and,in,danger
but,somehow,it,was,easier,to,bear,the,thought,of,ashley,belonging,to,some,one,else,when,he,was,far,away
with,the,hundreds,of,miles,stretching,between,atlanta,and,virginia,he,sometimes,seemed,as,much,hers,as,melanie's
so,the,autumn,months,of,1862,went,swiftly,by,with,nursing,dancing,driving,and,bandage,rolling,taking,up,all,the,time,she,did,not,spend,on,brief,visits,to,tara
these,visits,were,disappointing,for,she,had,little,opportunity,for,the,long,quiet,talks,with,her,mother,to,which,she,looked,forward,while,in,atlanta,no,time,to,sit,by,ellen,while,she,sewed,smelling,the,faint,fragrance,of,lemon,verbena,sachet,as,her,skirts,rustled,feeling,her,soft,hands,on,her,cheek,in,a,gentle,caress
ellen,was,thin,and,preoccupied,now,and,on,her,feet,from,morning,until,long,after,the,plantation,was,asleep
the,demands,of,the,confederate,commissary,were,growing,heavier,by,the,month,and,hers,was,the,task,of,making,tara,produce
even,gerald,was,busy,for,the,first,time,in,many,years,for,he,could,get,no,overseer,to,take,jonas,wilkerson's,place,and,he,was,riding,his,own,acres
with,ellen,too,busy,for,more,than,a,goodnight,kiss,and,gerald,in,the,fields,all,day,scarlett,found,tara,boring
even,her,sisters,were,taken,up,with,their,own,concerns
suellen,had,now,come,to,an,understanding,with,frank,kennedy,and,sang,when,this,cruel,war,is,over,with,an,arch,meaning,scarlett,found,well-nigh,unendurable,and,carreen,was,too,wrapped,up,in,dreams,of,brent,tarleton,to,be,interesting,company
though,scarlett,always,went,home,to,tara,with,a,happy,heart,she,was,never,sorry,when,the,inevitable,letters,came,from,pitty,and,melanie,begging,her,to,return
ellen,always,sighed,at,these,times,saddened,by,the,thought,of,her,oldest,daughter,and,her,only,grandchild,leaving,her
but,i,mustn't,be,selfish,and,keep,you,here,when,you,are,needed,to,nurse,in,atlanta,she,said
only,only,my,darling,it,seems,that,i,never,get,the,time,to,talk,to,you,and,to,feel,that,you,are,my,own,little,girl,again,before,you,are,gone,from,me
i'm,always,your,little,girl,scarlett,would,say,and,bury,her,head,upon,ellen's,breast,her,guilt,rising,up,to,accuse,her
she,did,not,tell,her,mother,that,it,was,the,dancing,and,the,beaux,which,drew,her,back,to,atlanta,and,not,the,service,of,the,confederacy
there,were,many,things,she,kept,from,her,mother,these,days
but,most,of,all,she,kept,secret,the,fact,that,rhett,butler,called,frequently,at,aunt,pittypat's,house
during,the,months,that,followed,the,bazaar,rhett,called,whenever,he,was,in,town,taking,scarlett,riding,in,his,carriage,escorting,her,to,danceables,and,bazaars,and,waiting,outside,the,hospital,to,drive,her,home
she,lost,her,fear,of,his,betraying,her,secret,but,there,always,lurked,in,the,back,of,her,mind,the,disquieting,memory,that,he,had,seen,her,at,her,worst,and,knew,the,truth,about,ashley
it,was,this,knowledge,that,checked,her,tongue,when,he,annoyed,her
and,he,annoyed,her,frequently
he,was,in,his,mid-thirties,older,than,any,beau,she,had,ever,had,and,she,was,as,helpless,as,a,child,to,control,and,handle,him,as,she,had,handled,beaux,nearer,her,own,age
he,always,looked,as,if,nothing,had,ever,surprised,him,and,much,had,amused,him,and,when,he,had,gotten,her,into,a,speechless,temper,she,felt,that,she,amused,him,more,than,anything,in,the,world
frequently,she,flared,into,open,wrath,under,his,expert,baiting,for,she,had,gerald's,irish,temper,along,with,the,deceptive,sweetness,of,face,she,had,inherited,from,ellen
heretofore,she,had,never,bothered,to,control,her,temper,except,in,ellen's,presence
now,it,was,painful,to,have,to,choke,back,words,for,fear,of,his,amused,grin
if,only,he,would,ever,lose,his,temper,too,then,she,would,not,feel,at,such,a,disadvantage
after,tilts,with,him,from,which,she,seldom,emerged,the,victor,she,vowed,he,was,impossible,ill-bred,and,no,gentleman,and,she,would,have,nothing,more,to,do,with,him
but,sooner,or,later,he,returned,to,atlanta,called,presumably,on,aunt,pitty,and,presented,scarlett,with,overdone,gallantry,a,box,of,bonbons,he,had,brought,her,from,nassau
or,preempted,a,seat,by,her,at,a,musicale,or,claimed,her,at,a,dance,and,she,was,usually,so,amused,by,his,bland,impudence,that,she,laughed,and,overlooked,his,past,misdeeds,until,the,next,occurred
for,all,his,exasperating,qualities,she,grew,to,look,forward,to,his,calls
there,was,something,exciting,about,him,that,she,could,not,analyze,something,different,from,any,man,she,had,ever,known
there,was,something,breathtaking,in,the,grace,of,his,big,body,which,made,his,very,entrance,into,a,room,like,an,abrupt,physical,impact,something,in,the,impertinence,and,bland,mockery,of,his,dark,eyes,that,challenged,her,spirit,to,subdue,him
it's,almost,like,i,was,in,love,with,him
she,thought,bewildered
but,i'm,not,and,i,just,can't,understand,it
but,the,exciting,feeling,persisted
when,he,came,to,call,his,complete,masculinity,made,aunt,pitty's,well-bred,and,ladylike,house,seem,small,pale,and,a,trifle,fusty
scarlett,was,not,the,only,member,of,the,household,who,reacted,strangely,and,unwillingly,to,his,presence,for,he,kept,aunt,pitty,in,a,flutter,and,a,ferment
while,pitty,knew,ellen,would,disapprove,of,his,calls,on,her,daughter,and,knew,also,that,the,edict,of,charleston,banning,him,from,polite,society,was,not,one,to,be,lightly,disregarded,she,could,no,more,resist,his,elaborate,compliments,and,hand,kissing,than,a,fly,can,resist,a,honey,pot
moreover,he,usually,brought,her,some,little,gift,from,nassau,which,he,assured,her,he,had,purchased,especially,for,her,and,blockaded,in,at,risk,of,his,life,papers,of,pins,and,needles,buttons,spools,of,silk,thread,and,hairpins
it,was,almost,impossible,to,obtain,these,small,luxuries,now,ladies,were,wearing,hand-whittled,wooden,hairpins,and,covering,acorns,with,cloth,for,buttons,and,pitty,lacked,the,moral,stamina,to,refuse,them
besides,she,had,a,childish,love,of,surprise,packages,and,could,not,resist,opening,his,gifts
and,having,once,opened,them,she,did,not,feel,that,she,could,refuse,them
then,having,accepted,his,gifts,she,could,not,summon,courage,enough,to,tell,him,his,reputation,made,it,improper,for,him,to,call,on,three,lone,women,who,had,no,male,protector
aunt,pitty,always,felt,that,she,needed,a,male,protector,when,rhett,butler,was,in,the,house
i,don't,know,what,it,is,about,him,she,would,sigh,helplessly
but,well,i,think,he'd,be,a,nice,attractive,man,if,i,could,just,feel,that,well,that,deep,down,in,his,heart,he,respected,women
since,the,return,of,her,wedding,ring,melanie,had,felt,that,rhett,was,a,gentleman,of,rare,refinement,and,delicacy,and,she,was,shocked,at,this,remark
he,was,unfailingly,courteous,to,her,but,she,was,a,little,timid,with,him,largely,because,she,was,shy,with,any,man,she,had,not,known,from,childhood
secretly,she,was,very,sorry,for,him,a,feeling,which,would,have,amused,him,had,he,been,aware,of,it
she,was,certain,that,some,romantic,sorrow,had,blighted,his,life,and,made,him,hard,and,bitter,and,she,felt,that,what,he,needed,was,the,love,of,a,good,woman
in,all,her,sheltered,life,she,had,never,seen,evil,and,could,scarcely,credit,its,existence,and,when,gossip,whispered,things,about,rhett,and,the,girl,in,charleston,she,was,shocked,and,unbelieving
and,instead,of,turning,her,against,him,it,only,made,her,more,timidly,gracious,toward,him,because,of,her,indignation,at,what,she,fancied,was,a,gross,injustice,done,him
scarlett,silently,agreed,with,aunt,pitty
she,too,felt,that,he,had,no,respect,for,any,woman,unless,perhaps,for,melanie
she,still,felt,unclothed,every,time,his,eyes,ran,up,and,down,her,figure
it,was,not,that,he,ever,said,anything
then,she,could,have,scorched,him,with,hot,words
it,was,the,bold,way,his,eyes,looked,out,of,his,swarthy,face,with,a,displeasing,air,of,insolence,as,if,all,women,were,his,property,to,be,enjoyed,in,his,own,good,time
only,with,melanie,was,this,look,absent
there,was,never,that,cool,look,of,appraisal,never,mockery,in,his,eyes,when,he,looked,at,melanie,and,there,was,an,especial,note,in,his,voice,when,he,spoke,to,her,courteous,respectful,anxious,to,be,of,service
i,don't,see,why,you're,so,much,nicer,to,her,than,to,me,said,scarlett,petulantly,one,afternoon,when,melanie,and,pitty,had,retired,to,take,their,naps,and,she,was,alone,with,him
for,an,hour,she,had,watched,rhett,hold,the,yarn,melanie,was,winding,for,knitting,had,noted,the,blank,inscrutable,expression,when,melanie,talked,at,length,and,with,pride,of,ashley,and,his,promotion
scarlett,knew,rhett,had,no,exalted,opinion,of,ashley,and,cared,nothing,at,all,about,the,fact,that,he,had,been,made,a,major
yet,he,made,polite,replies,and,murmured,the,correct,things,about,ashley's,gallantry
and,if,i,so,much,as,mention,ashley's,name,she,had,thought,irritably,he,cocks,his,eyebrow,up,and,smiles,that,nasty,knowing,smile
i'm,much,prettier,than,she,is,she,continued,and,i,don't,see,why,you're,nicer,to,her
dare,i,hope,that,you,are,jealous
oh,don't,presume
another,hope,crushed
if,i,am,'nicer',to,mrs,wilkes,it,is,because,she,deserves,it
she,is,one,of,the,very,few,kind,sincere,and,unselfish,persons,i,have,ever,known
but,perhaps,you,have,failed,to,note,these,qualities
and,moreover,for,all,her,youth,she,is,one,of,the,few,great,ladies,i,have,ever,been,privileged,to,know
do,you,mean,to,say,you,don't,think,i'm,a,great,lady,too
i,think,we,agreed,on,the,occasion,of,our,first,meeting,that,you,were,no,lady,at,all
oh,if,you,are,going,to,be,hateful,and,rude,enough,to,bring,that,up,again
how,can,you,hold,that,bit,of,childish,temper,against,me
that,was,so,long,ago,and,i've,grown,up,since,then,and,i'd,forget,all,about,it,if,you,weren't,always,harping,and,hinting,about,it
i,don't,think,it,was,childish,temper,and,i,don't,believe,you've,changed
you,are,just,as,capable,now,as,then,of,throwing,vases,if,you,don't,get,your,own,way
but,you,usually,get,your,way,now
and,so,there's,no,necessity,for,broken,bric-a-brac
oh,you,are,i,wish,i,was,a,man
i'd,call,you,out,and
and,get,killed,for,your,pains
i,can,drill,a,dime,at,fifty,yards
better,stick,to,your,own,weapons,dimples,vases,and,the,like
you,are,just,a,rascal
do,you,expect,me,to,fly,into,a,rage,at,that
i,am,sorry,to,disappoint,you
you,can't,make,me,mad,by,calling,me,names,that,are,true
certainly,i'm,a,rascal,and,why,not
it's,a,free,country,and,a,man,may,be,a,rascal,if,he,chooses
it's,only,hypocrites,like,you,my,dear,lady,just,as,black,at,heart,but,trying,to,hide,it,who,become,enraged,when,called,by,their,right,names
she,was,helpless,before,his,calm,smile,and,his,drawling,remarks,for,she,had,never,before,met,anyone,who,was,so,completely,impregnable
her,weapons,of,scorn,coldness,and,abuse,blunted,in,her,hands,for,nothing,she,could,say,would,shame,him
it,had,been,her,experience,that,the,liar,was,the,hottest,to,defend,his,veracity,the,coward,his,courage,the,ill-bred,his,gentlemanliness,and,the,cad,his,honor
but,not,rhett
he,admitted,everything,and,laughed,and,dared,her,to,say,more
he,came,and,went,during,these,months,arriving,unheralded,and,leaving,without,saying,good-by
scarlett,never,discovered,just,what,business,brought,him,to,atlanta,for,few,other,blockaders,found,it,necessary,to,come,so,far,away,from,the,coast
they,landed,their,cargoes,at,wilmington,or,charleston,where,they,were,met,by,swarms,of,merchants,and,speculators,from,all,over,the,south,who,assembled,to,buy,blockaded,goods,at,auction
it,would,have,pleased,her,to,think,that,he,made,these,trips,to,see,her,but,even,her,abnormal,vanity,refused,to,believe,this
if,he,had,ever,once,made,love,to,her,seemed,jealous,of,the,other,men,who,crowded,about,her,even,tried,to,hold,her,hand,or,begged,for,a,picture,or,a,handkerchief,to,cherish,she,would,have,thought,triumphantly,he,had,been,caught,by,her,charms
but,he,remained,annoyingly,unloverlike,and,worst,of,all,seemed,to,see,through,all,her,maneuverings,to,bring,him,to,his,knees
whenever,he,came,to,town,there,was,a,feminine,fluttering
not,only,did,the,romantic,aura,of,the,dashing,blockader,hang,about,him,but,there,was,also,the,titillating,element,of,the,wicked,and,the,forbidden
he,had,such,a,bad,reputation
and,every,time,the,matrons,of,atlanta,gathered,together,to,gossip,his,reputation,grew,worse,which,only,made,him,all,the,more,glamorous,to,the,young,girls
as,most,of,them,were,quite,innocent,they,had,heard,little,more,than,that,he,was,quite,loose,with,women,and,exactly,how,a,man,went,about,the,business,of,being,loose,they,did,not,know
they,also,heard,whispers,that,no,girl,was,safe,with,him
with,such,a,reputation,it,was,strange,that,he,had,never,so,much,as,kissed,the,hand,of,an,unmarried,girl,since,he,first,appeared,in,atlanta
but,that,only,served,to,make,him,more,mysterious,and,more,exciting
outside,of,the,army,heroes,he,was,the,most,talked-about,man,in,atlanta
everyone,knew,in,detail,how,he,had,been,expelled,from,west,point,for,drunkenness,and,something,about,women
that,terrific,scandal,concerning,the,charleston,girl,he,had,compromised,and,the,brother,he,had,killed,was,public,property
correspondence,with,charleston,friends,elicited,the,further,information,that,his,father,a,charming,old,gentleman,with,an,iron,will,and,a,ramrod,for,a,backbone,had,cast,him,out,without,a,penny,when,he,was,twenty,and,even,stricken,his,name,from,the,family,bible
after,that,he,had,wandered,to,california,in,the,gold,rush,of,1849,and,thence,to,south,america,and,cuba,and,the,reports,of,his,activities,in,these,parts,were,none,too,savory
scrapes,about,women,several,shootings,gun,running,to,the,revolutionists,in,central,america,and,worst,of,all,professional,gambling,were,included,in,his,career,as,atlanta,heard,it
there,was,hardly,a,family,in,georgia,who,could,not,own,to,their,sorrow,at,least,one,male,member,or,relative,who,gambled,losing,money,houses,land,and,slaves
but,that,was,different
a,man,could,gamble,himself,to,poverty,and,still,be,a,gentleman,but,a,professional,gambler,could,never,be,anything,but,an,outcast
had,it,not,been,for,the,upset,conditions,due,to,the,war,and,his,own,services,to,the,confederate,government,rhett,butler,would,never,have,been,received,in,atlanta
but,now,even,the,most,strait,laced,felt,that,patriotism,called,upon,them,to,be,more,broad,minded
the,more,sentimental,were,inclined,to,view,that,the,black,sheep,of,the,butler,family,had,repented,of,his,evil,ways,and,was,making,an,attempt,to,atone,for,his,sins
so,the,ladies,felt,in,duty,bound,to,stretch,a,point,especially,in,the,case,of,so,intrepid,a,blockader
everyone,knew,now,that,the,fate,of,the,confederacy,rested,as,much,upon,the,skill,of,the,blockade,boats,in,eluding,the,yankee,fleet,as,it,did,upon,the,soldiers,at,the,front
rumor,had,it,that,captain,butler,was,one,of,the,best,pilots,in,the,south,and,that,he,was,reckless,and,utterly,without,nerves
reared,in,charleston,he,knew,every,inlet,creek,shoal,and,rock,of,the,carolina,coast,near,that,port,and,he,was,equally,at,home,in,the,waters,around,wilmington
he,had,never,lost,a,boat,or,even,been,forced,to,dump,a,cargo
at,the,onset,of,the,war,he,had,emerged,from,obscurity,with,enough,money,to,buy,a,small,swift,boat,and,now,when,blockaded,goods,realized,two,thousand,per,cent,on,each,cargo,he,owned,four,boats
he,had,good,pilots,and,paid,them,well,and,they,slid,out,of,charleston,and,wilmington,on,dark,nights,bearing,cotton,for,nassau,england,and,canada
the,cotton,mills,of,england,were,standing,idle,and,the,workers,were,starving,and,any,blockader,who,could,outwit,the,yankee,fleet,could,command,his,own,price,in,liverpool
rhett's,boats,were,singularly,lucky,both,in,taking,out,cotton,for,the,confederacy,and,bringing,in,the,war,materials,for,which,the,south,was,desperate
yes,the,ladies,felt,they,could,forgive,and,forget,a,great,many,things,for,such,a,brave,man
he,was,a,dashing,figure,and,one,that,people,turned,to,look,at
he,spent,money,freely,rode,a,wild,black,stallion,and,wore,clothes,which,were,always,the,height,of,style,and,tailoring
the,latter,in,itself,was,enough,to,attract,attention,to,him,for,the,uniforms,of,the,soldiers,were,dingy,and,worn,now,and,the,civilians,even,when,turned,out,in,their,best,showed,skillful,patching,and,darning
scarlett,thought,she,had,never,seen,such,elegant,pants,as,he,wore,fawn,colored,shepherd's,plaid,and,checked
as,for,his,waistcoats,they,were,indescribably,handsome,especially,the,white,watered-silk,one,with,tiny,pink,rosebuds,embroidered,on,it
and,he,wore,these,garments,with,a,still,more,elegant,air,as,though,unaware,of,their,glory
there,were,few,ladies,who,could,resist,his,charms,when,he,chose,to,exert,them,and,finally,even,mrs,merriwether,unbent,and,invited,him,to,sunday,dinner
maybelle,merriwether,was,to,marry,her,little,zouave,when,he,got,his,next,furlough,and,she,cried,every,time,she,thought,of,it,for,she,had,set,her,heart,on,marrying,in,a,white,satin,dress,and,there,was,no,white,satin,in,the,confederacy
nor,could,she,borrow,a,dress,for,the,satin,wedding,dresses,of,years,past,had,all,gone,into,the,making,of,battle,flags
useless,for,the,patriotic,mrs,merriwether,to,upbraid,her,daughter,and,point,out,that,homespun,was,the,proper,bridal,attire,for,a,confederate,bride
maybelle,wanted,satin
she,was,willing,even,proud,to,go,without,hairpins,and,buttons,and,nice,shoes,and,candy,and,tea,for,the,sake,of,the,cause,but,she,wanted,a,satin,wedding,dress
rhett,hearing,of,this,from,melanie,brought,in,from,england,yards,and,yards,of,gleaming,white,satin,and,a,lace,veil,and,presented,them,to,her,as,a,wedding,gift
he,did,it,in,such,a,way,that,it,was,unthinkable,to,even,mention,paying,him,for,them,and,maybelle,was,so,delighted,she,almost,kissed,him
mrs,merriwether,knew,that,so,expensive,a,gift,and,a,gift,of,clothing,at,that,was,highly,improper,but,she,could,think,of,no,way,of,refusing,when,rhett,told,her,in,the,most,florid,language,that,nothing,was,too,good,to,deck,the,bride,of,one,of,our,brave,heroes
so,mrs,merriwether,invited,him,to,dinner,feeling,that,this,concession,more,than,paid,for,the,gift
he,not,only,brought,maybelle,the,satin,but,he,was,able,to,give,excellent,hints,on,the,making,of,the,wedding,dress
hoops,in,paris,were,wider,this,season,and,skirts,were,shorter
they,were,no,longer,ruffled,but,were,gathered,up,in,scalloped,festoons,showing,braided,petticoats,beneath
he,said,too,that,he,had,seen,no,pantalets,on,the,streets,so,he,imagined,they,were,out
afterwards,mrs,merriwether,told,mrs,elsing,she,feared,that,if,she,had,given,him,any,encouragement,at,all,he,would,have,told,her,exactly,what,kind,of,drawers,were,being,worn,by,parisiennes
had,he,been,less,obviously,masculine,his,ability,to,recall,details,of,dresses,bonnets,and,coiffures,would,have,been,put,down,as,the,rankest,effeminacy
the,ladies,always,felt,a,little,odd,when,they,besieged,him,with,questions,about,styles,but,they,did,it,nevertheless
they,were,as,isolated,from,the,world,of,fashion,as,shipwrecked,mariners,for,few,books,of,fashion,came,through,the,blockade
for,all,they,knew,the,ladies,of,france,might,be,shaving,their,heads,and,wearing,coonskin,caps,so,rhett's,memory,for,furbelows,was,an,excellent,substitute,for,godey's,lady's,book
he,could,and,did,notice,details,so,dear,to,feminine,hearts,and,after,each,trip,abroad,he,could,be,found,in,the,center,of,a,group,of,ladies,telling,that,bonnets,were,smaller,this,year,and,perched,higher,covering,most,of,the,top,of,the,head,that,plumes,and,not,flowers,were,being,used,to,trim,them,that,the,empress,of,france,had,abandoned,the,chignon,for,evening,wear,and,had,her,hair,piled,almost,on,the,top,of,her,head,showing,all,of,her,ears,and,that,evening,frocks,were,shockingly,low,again
for,some,months,he,was,the,most,popular,and,romantic,figure,the,town,knew,despite,his,previous,reputation,despite,the,faint,rumors,that,he,was,engaged,not,only,in,blockading,but,in,speculating,on,foodstuffs,too
people,who,did,not,like,him,said,that,after,every,trip,he,made,to,atlanta,prices,jumped,five,dollars
but,even,with,this,under-cover,gossip,seeping,about,he,could,have,retained,his,popularity,had,he,considered,it,worth,retaining
instead,it,seemed,as,though,after,trying,the,company,of,the,staid,and,patriotic,citizens,and,winning,their,respect,and,grudging,liking,something,perverse,in,him,made,him,go,out,of,his,way,to,affront,them,and,show,them,that,his,conduct,had,been,only,a,masquerade,and,one,which,no,longer,amused,him
it,was,as,though,he,bore,an,impersonal,contempt,for,everyone,and,everything,in,the,south,the,confederacy,in,particular,and,took,no,pains,to,conceal,it
it,was,his,remarks,about,the,confederacy,that,made,atlanta,look,at,him,first,in,bewilderment,then,coolly,and,then,with,hot,rage
even,before,1862,passed,into,1863,men,were,bowing,to,him,with,studied,frigidity,and,women,beginning,to,draw,their,daughters,to,their,sides,when,he,appeared,at,a,gathering
he,seemed,to,take,pleasure,not,only,in,affronting,the,sincere,and,red-hot,loyalties,of,atlanta,but,in,presenting,himself,in,the,worst,possible,light
when,well-meaning,people,complimented,him,on,his,bravery,in,running,the,blockade,he,blandly,replied,that,he,was,always,frightened,when,in,danger,as,frightened,as,were,the,brave,boys,at,the,front
everyone,knew,there,had,never,been,a,cowardly,confederate,soldier,and,they,found,this,statement,peculiarly,irritating
he,always,referred,to,the,soldiers,as,our,brave,boys,and,our,heroes,in,gray,and,did,it,in,such,a,way,as,to,convey,the,utmost,in,insult
when,daring,young,ladies,hoping,for,a,flirtation,thanked,him,for,being,one,of,the,heroes,who,fought,for,them,he,bowed,and,declared,that,such,was,not,the,case,for,he,would,do,the,same,thing,for,yankee,women,if,the,same,amount,of,money,were,involved
since,scarlett's,first,meeting,with,him,in,atlanta,on,the,night,of,the,bazaar,he,had,talked,with,her,in,this,manner,but,now,there,was,a,thinly,veiled,note,of,mockery,in,his,conversations,with,everyone
when,praised,for,his,services,to,the,confederacy,he,unfailingly,replied,that,blockading,was,a,business,with,him
if,he,could,make,as,much,money,out,of,government,contracts,he,would,say,picking,out,with,his,eyes,those,who,had,government,contracts,then,he,would,certainly,abandon,the,hazards,of,blockading,and,take,to,selling,shoddy,cloth,sanded,sugar,spoiled,flour,and,rotten,leather,to,the,confederacy
most,of,his,remarks,were,unanswerable,which,made,them,all,the,worse
there,had,already,been,minor,scandals,about,those,holding,government,contracts
letters,from,men,at,the,front,complained,constantly,of,shoes,that,wore,out,in,a,week,gunpowder,that,would,not,ignite,harness,that,snapped,at,any,strain,meat,that,was,rotten,and,flour,that,was,full,of,weevils
atlanta,people,tried,to,think,that,the,men,who,sold,such,stuff,to,the,government,must,be,contract,holders,from,alabama,or,virginia,or,tennessee,and,not,georgians
for,did,not,the,georgia,contract,holders,include,men,from,the,very,best,families
were,they,not,the,first,to,contribute,to,the,hospital,funds,and,to,the,aid,of,soldiers',orphans
were,they,not,the,first,to,cheer,at,dixie,and,the,most,rampant,seekers,in,oratory,at,least,for,yankee,blood
the,full,tide,of,fury,against,those,profiteering,on,government,contracts,had,not,yet,risen,and,rhett's,words,were,taken,merely,as,evidence,of,his,own,bad,breeding
he,not,only,affronted,the,town,with,insinuations,of,venality,on,the,part,of,men,in,high,places,and,slurs,on,the,courage,of,the,men,in,the,field,but,he,took,pleasure,in,tricking,the,dignified,citizenry,into,embarrassing,situations
he,could,no,more,resist,pricking,the,conceits,the,hypocrisies,and,the,flamboyant,patriotism,of,those,about,him,than,a,small,boy,can,resist,putting,a,pin,into,a,balloon
he,neatly,deflated,the,pompous,and,exposed,the,ignorant,and,the,bigoted,and,he,did,it,in,such,subtle,ways,drawing,his,victims,out,by,his,seemingly,courteous,interest,that,they,never,were,quite,certain,what,had,happened,until,they,stood,exposed,as,windy,high,flown,and,slightly,ridiculous
during,the,months,when,the,town,accepted,him,scarlett,had,been,under,no,illusions,about,him
she,knew,that,his,elaborate,gallantries,and,his,florid,speeches,were,all,done,with,his,tongue,in,his,cheek
she,knew,that,he,was,acting,the,part,of,the,dashing,and,patriotic,blockade,runner,simply,because,it,amused,him
sometimes,he,seemed,to,her,like,the,county,boys,with,whom,she,had,grown,up,the,wild,tarleton,twins,with,their,obsession,for,practical,jokes,the,devil-inspired,fontaines,teasing,mischievous,the,calverts,who,would,sit,up,all,night,planning,hoaxes
but,there,was,a,difference,for,beneath,rhett's,seeming,lightness,there,was,something,malicious,almost,sinister,in,its,suave,brutality
though,she,was,thoroughly,aware,of,his,insincerity,she,much,preferred,him,in,the,role,of,the,romantic,blockader
for,one,thing,it,made,her,own,situation,in,associating,with,him,so,much,easier,than,it,had,been,at,first
so,she,was,intensely,annoyed,when,he,dropped,his,masquerade,and,set,out,apparently,upon,a,deliberate,campaign,to,alienate,atlanta's,good,will
it,annoyed,her,because,it,seemed,foolish,and,also,because,some,of,the,harsh,criticism,directed,at,him,fell,on,her
it,was,at,mrs,elsing's,silver,musicale,for,the,benefit,of,the,convalescents,that,rhett,signed,his,final,warrant,of,ostracism
that,afternoon,the,elsing,home,was,crowded,with,soldiers,on,leave,and,men,from,the,hospitals,members,of,the,home,guard,and,the,militia,unit,and,matrons,widows,and,young,girls
every,chair,in,the,house,was,occupied,and,even,the,long,winding,stair,was,packed,with,guests
the,large,cut-glass,bowl,held,at,the,door,by,the,elsings',butler,had,been,emptied,twice,of,its,burden,of,silver,coins
that,in,itself,was,enough,to,make,the,affair,a,success,for,now,a,dollar,in,silver,was,worth,sixty,dollars,in,confederate,paper,money
every,girl,with,any,pretense,to,accomplishments,had,sung,or,played,the,piano,and,the,tableaux,vivants,had,been,greeted,with,flattering,applause
scarlett,was,much,pleased,with,herself,for,not,only,had,she,and,melanie,rendered,a,touching,duet,when,the,dew,is,on,the,blossom,followed,as,an,encore,by,the,more,sprightly,oh,lawd,ladies,don't,mind,stephen
but,she,had,also,been,chosen,to,represent,the,spirit,of,the,confederacy,in,the,last,tableau
she,had,looked,most,fetching,wearing,a,modestly,draped,greek,robe,of,white,cheesecloth,girdled,with,red,and,blue,and,holding,the,stars,and,bars,in,one,hand,while,with,the,other,she,stretched,out,to,the,kneeling,captain,carey,ashburn,of,alabama,the,gold-hilted,saber,which,had,belonged,to,charles,and,his,father
when,her,tableau,was,over,she,could,not,help,seeking,rhett's,eyes,to,see,if,he,had,appreciated,the,pretty,picture,she,made
with,a,feeling,of,exasperation,she,saw,that,he,was,in,an,argument,and,probably,had,not,even,noticed,her
scarlett,could,see,by,the,faces,of,the,group,surrounding,him,that,they,were,infuriated,by,what,he,was,saying
she,made,her,way,toward,them,and,in,one,of,those,odd,silences,which,sometimes,fall,on,a,gathering,she,heard,willie,guinan,of,the,militia,outfit,say,plainly,do,i,understand,sir,that,you,mean,the,cause,for,which,our,heroes,have,died,is,not,sacred
if,you,were,run,over,by,a,railroad,train,your,death,wouldn't,sanctify,the,railroad,company,would,it
asked,rhett,and,his,voice,sounded,as,if,he,were,humbly,seeking,information
sir,said,willie,his,voice,shaking,if,we,were,not,under,this,roof
i,tremble,to,think,what,would,happen,said,rhett
for,of,course,your,bravery,is,too,well,known
willie,went,scarlet,and,all,conversation,ceased
everyone,was,embarrassed
willie,was,strong,and,healthy,and,of,military,age,and,yet,he,wasn't,at,the,front
of,course,he,was,the,only,boy,his,mother,had,and,after,all,somebody,had,to,be,in,the,militia,to,protect,the,state
but,there,were,a,few,irreverent,snickers,from,convalescent,officers,when,rhett,spoke,of,bravery
oh,why,doesn't,he,keep,his,mouth,shut
thought,scarlett,indignantly
he's,simply,spoiling,the,whole,party
dr,meade's,brows,were,thunderous
nothing,may,be,sacred,to,you,young,man,he,said,in,the,voice,he,always,used,when,making,speeches
but,there,are,many,things,sacred,to,the,patriotic,men,and,ladies,of,the,south
and,the,freedom,of,our,land,from,the,usurper,is,one,and,states',rights,is,another,and
rhett,looked,lazy,and,his,voice,had,a,silky,almost,bored,note
all,wars,are,sacred,he,said
to,those,who,have,to,fight,them
if,the,people,who,started,wars,didn't,make,them,sacred,who,would,be,foolish,enough,to,fight
but,no,matter,what,rallying,cries,the,orators,give,to,the,idiots,who,fight,no,matter,what,noble,purposes,they,assign,to,wars,there,is,never,but,one,reason,for,a,war
and,that,is,money
all,wars,are,in,reality,money,squabbles
but,so,few,people,ever,realize,it
their,ears,are,too,full,of,bugles,and,drums,and,the,fine,words,from,stay-at-home,orators
sometimes,the,rallying,cry,is,'save,the,tomb,of,christ,from,the,heathen,'
sometimes,it's,'down,with,popery,'
and,sometimes,'liberty,'
and,sometimes,'cotton,slavery,and,states',rights,'
what,on,earth,has,the,pope,to,do,with,it
thought,scarlett
or,christ's,tomb,either
but,as,she,hurried,toward,the,incensed,group,she,saw,rhett,bow,jauntily,and,start,toward,the,doorway,through,the,crowd
she,started,after,him,but,mrs,elsing,caught,her,skirt,and,held,her
let,him,go,she,said,in,a,clear,voice,that,carried,throughout,the,tensely,quiet,room
let,him,go
he,is,a,traitor,a,speculator
he,is,a,viper,that,we,have,nursed,to,our,bosoms
rhett,standing,in,the,hall,his,hat,in,his,hand,heard,as,he,was,intended,to,hear,and,turning,surveyed,the,room,for,a,moment
he,looked,pointedly,at,mrs,elsing's,flat,bosom,grinned,suddenly,and,bowing,made,his,exit
mrs,merriwether,rode,home,in,aunt,pitty's,carriage,and,scarcely,had,the,four,ladies,seated,themselves,when,she,exploded
there,now,pittypat,hamilton
i,hope,you,are,satisfied
with,what
cried,pitty,apprehensively
with,the,conduct,of,that,wretched,butler,man,you've,been,harboring
pittypat,fluttered,too,upset,by,the,accusation,to,recall,that,mrs,merriwether,had,also,been,rhett,butler's,hostess,on,several,occasions
scarlett,and,melanie,thought,of,this,but,bred,to,politeness,to,their,elders,refrained,from,remarking,on,the,matter
instead,they,studiously,looked,down,at,their,mittened,hands
he,insulted,us,all,and,the,confederacy,too,said,mrs,merriwether,and,her,stout,bust,heaved,violently,beneath,its,glittering,passementerie,trimmings
saying,that,we,were,fighting,for,money
saying,that,our,leaders,had,lied,to,us
he,should,be,put,in,jail
yes,he,should
i,shall,speak,to,dr,meade,about,it
if,mr,merriwether,were,only,alive,he'd,tend,to,him
now,pitty,hamilton,you,listen,to,me
you,mustn't,ever,let,that,scamp,come,into,your,house,again
oh,mumbled,pitty,helplessly,looking,as,if,she,wished,she,were,dead
she,looked,appealingly,at,the,two,girls,who,kept,their,eyes,cast,down,and,then,hopefully,toward,uncle,peter's,erect,back
she,knew,he,was,listening,attentively,to,every,word,and,she,hoped,he,would,turn,and,take,a,hand,in,the,conversation,as,he,frequently,did
she,hoped,he,would,say,now,miss,dolly,you,let,miss,pitty,be,but,peter,made,no,move
he,disapproved,heartily,of,rhett,butler,and,poor,pitty,knew,it
she,sighed,and,said,well,dolly,if,you,think
i,do,think,returned,mrs,merriwether,firmly
i,can't,imagine,what,possessed,you,to,receive,him,in,the,first,place
after,this,afternoon,there,won't,be,a,decent,home,in,town,that,he'll,be,welcome,in
do,get,up,some,gumption,and,forbid,him,your,house
she,turned,a,sharp,eye,on,the,girls
i,hope,you,two,are,marking,my,words,she,continued,for,it's,partly,your,fault,being,so,pleasant,to,him
just,tell,him,politely,but,firmly,that,his,presence,and,his,disloyal,talk,are,distinctly,unwelcome,at,your,house
by,this,time,scarlett,was,boiling,ready,to,rear,like,a,horse,at,the,touch,of,a,strange,rough,hand,on,its,bridle
but,she,was,afraid,to,speak
she,could,not,risk,mrs,merriwether,writing,another,letter,to,her,mother
you,old,buffalo
she,thought,her,face,crimson,with,suppressed,fury
how,heavenly,it,would,be,to,tell,you,just,what,i,think,of,you,and,your,bossy,ways
i,never,thought,to,live,long,enough,to,hear,such,disloyal,words,spoken,of,our,cause,went,on,mrs,merriwether,by,this,time,in,a,ferment,of,righteous,anger
any,man,who,does,not,think,our,cause,is,just,and,holy,should,be,hanged
i,don't,want,to,hear,of,you,two,girls,ever,even,speaking,to,him,again,for,heaven's,sake,melly,what,ails,you
melanie,was,white,and,her,eyes,were,enormous
i,will,speak,to,him,again,she,said,in,a,low,voice
i,will,not,be,rude,to,him
i,will,not,forbid,him,the,house
mrs,merriwether's,breath,went,out,of,her,lungs,as,explosively,as,though,she,had,been,punched
aunt,pitty's,fat,mouth,popped,open,and,uncle,peter,turned,to,stare
now,why,didn't,i,have,the,gumption,to,say,that
thought,scarlett,jealousy,mixing,with,admiration
how,did,that,little,rabbit,ever,get,up,spunk,enough,to,stand,up,to,old,lady,merriwether
melanie's,hands,were,shaking,but,she,went,on,hurriedly,as,though,fearing,her,courage,would,fail,her,if,she,delayed
i,won't,be,rude,to,him,because,of,what,he,said,because,it,was,rude,of,him,to,say,it,out,loud,most,ill,advised,but,it's,it's,what,ashley,thinks
and,i,can't,forbid,the,house,to,a,man,who,thinks,what,my,husband,thinks
it,would,be,unjust
mrs,merriwether's,breath,had,come,back,and,she,charged
melly,hamilton,i,never,heard,such,a,lie,in,all,my,life
there,was,never,a,wilkes,who,was,a,coward
i,never,said,ashley,was,a,coward,said,melanie,her,eyes,beginning,to,flash
i,said,he,thinks,what,captain,butler,thinks,only,he,expresses,it,in,different,words
and,he,doesn't,go,around,saying,it,at,musicales,i,hope
but,he,has,written,it,to,me
scarlett's,guilty,conscience,stirred,as,she,tried,to,recall,what,ashley,might,have,written,that,would,lead,melanie,to,make,such,a,statement,but,most,of,the,letters,she,had,read,had,gone,out,of,her,head,as,soon,as,she,finished,reading,them
she,believed,melanie,had,simply,taken,leave,of,her,senses
ashley,wrote,me,that,we,should,not,be,fighting,the,yankees
and,that,we,have,been,betrayed,into,it,by,statesmen,and,orators,mouthing,catchwords,and,prejudices,said,melly,rapidly
he,said,nothing,in,the,world,was,worth,what,this,war,was,going,to,do,to,us
he,said,here,wasn't,anything,at,all,to,glory,it,was,just,misery,and,dirt
oh
that,letter,thought,scarlett
was,that,what,he,meant
i,don't,believe,it,said,mrs,merriwether,firmly
you,misunderstood,his,meaning
i,never,misunderstand,ashley,melanie,replied,quietly,though,her,lips,were,trembling
i,understand,him,perfectly
he,meant,exactly,what,captain,butler,meant,only,he,didn't,say,it,in,a,rude,way
you,should,be,ashamed,of,yourself,comparing,a,fine,man,like,ashley,wilkes,to,a,scoundrel,like,captain,butler
i,suppose,you,too,think,the,cause,is,nothing
i,i,don't,know,what,i,think,melanie,began,uncertainly,her,fire,deserting,her,and,panic,at,her,outspokenness,taking,hold,of,her
i,i'd,die,for,the,cause,like,ashley,would
but,i,mean,i,mean,i'll,let,the,men,folks,do,the,thinking,because,they,are,so,much,smarter
i,never,heard,the,like,snorted,mrs,merriwether
stop,uncle,peter,you're,driving,past,my,house
uncle,peter,preoccupied,with,the,conversation,behind,him,had,driven,past,the,merriwether,carriage,block,and,he,backed,up,the,horse
mrs,merriwether,alighted,her,bonnet,ribbons,shaking,like,sails,in,a,storm
you'll,be,sorry,she,said
uncle,peter,whipped,up,the,horse
you,young,misses,ought,ter,tek,shame,gittin',miss,pitty,in,a,state,he,scolded
i'm,not,in,a,state,replied,pitty,surprisingly,for,less,strain,than,this,had,frequently,brought,on,fainting,fits
melly,honey,i,knew,you,were,doing,it,just,to,take,up,for,me,and,really,i,was,glad,to,see,somebody,take,dolly,down,a,peg
she's,so,bossy
how,did,you,have,the,courage
but,do,you,think,you,should,have,said,that,about,ashley
but,it's,true,answered,melanie,and,she,began,to,cry,softly
and,i'm,not,ashamed,that,he,thinks,that,way
he,thinks,the,war,is,all,wrong,but,he's,willing,to,fight,and,die,anyway,and,that,takes,lots,more,courage,than,fighting,for,something,you,think,is,right
lawd,miss,melly,doan,cry,hyah,on,peachtree,street,groaned,uncle,peter,hastening,his,horse's,pace
folks'll,talk,sumpin',scan'lous
wait,till,us,gits,home
scarlett,said,nothing
she,did,not,even,squeeze,the,hand,that,melanie,had,inserted,into,her,palm,for,comfort
she,had,read,ashley's,letters,for,only,one,purpose,to,assure,herself,that,he,still,loved,her
now,melanie,had,given,a,new,meaning,to,passages,in,the,letters,which,scarlett's,eyes,had,barely,seen
it,shocked,her,to,realize,that,anyone,as,absolutely,perfect,as,ashley,could,have,any,thought,in,common,with,such,a,reprobate,as,rhett,butler
she,thought,they,both,see,the,truth,of,this,war,but,ashley,is,willing,to,die,about,it,and,rhett,isn't
i,think,that,shows,rhett's,good,sense
she,paused,a,moment,horror,struck,that,she,could,have,such,a,thought,about,ashley
they,both,see,the,same,unpleasant,truth,but,rhett,likes,to,look,it,in,the,face,and,enrage,people,by,talking,about,it,and,ashley,can,hardly,bear,to,face,it
it,was,very,bewildering
chapter,xiii
under,mrs,merriwether's,goading,dr,meade,took,action,in,the,form,of,a,letter,to,the,newspaper,wherein,he,did,not,mention,rhett,by,name,though,his,meaning,was,obvious
the,editor,sensing,the,social,drama,of,the,letter,put,it,on,the,second,page,of,the,paper,in,itself,a,startling,innovation,as,the,first,two,pages,of,the,paper,were,always,devoted,to,advertisements,of,slaves,mules,plows,coffins,houses,for,sale,or,rent,cures,for,private,diseases,abortifacients,and,restoratives,for,lost,manhood
the,doctor's,letter,was,the,first,of,a,chorus,of,indignation,that,was,beginning,to,be,heard,all,over,the,south,against,speculators,profiteers,and,holders,of,government,contracts
conditions,in,wilmington,the,chief,blockade,port,now,that,charleston's,port,was,practically,sealed,by,the,yankee,gunboats,had,reached,the,proportions,of,an,open,scandal
speculators,swarmed,wilmington,and,having,the,ready,cash,bought,up,boatloads,of,goods,and,held,them,for,a,rise,in,prices
the,rise,always,came,for,with,the,increasing,scarcity,of,necessities,prices,leaped,higher,by,the,month
the,civilian,population,had,either,to,do,without,or,buy,at,the,speculators',prices,and,the,poor,and,those,in,moderate,circumstances,were,suffering,increasing,hardships
with,the,rise,in,prices,confederate,money,sank,and,with,its,rapid,fall,there,rose,a,wild,passion,for,luxuries
blockaders,were,commissioned,to,bring,in,necessities,but,now,it,was,the,higher-priced,luxuries,that,filled,their,boats,to,the,exclusion,of,the,things,the,confederacy,vitally,needed
people,frenziedly,bought,these,luxuries,with,the,money,they,had,today,fearing,that,tomorrow's,prices,would,be,higher,and,the,money,worthless
to,make,matters,worse,there,was,only,one,railroad,line,from,wilmington,to,richmond,and,while,thousands,of,barrels,of,flour,and,boxes,of,bacon,spoiled,and,rotted,in,wayside,stations,for,want,of,transportation,speculators,with,wines,taffetas,and,coffee,to,sell,seemed,always,able,to,get,their,goods,to,richmond,two,days,after,they,were,landed,at,wilmington
the,rumor,which,had,been,creeping,about,underground,was,now,being,openly,discussed,that,rhett,butler,not,only,ran,his,own,four,boats,and,sold,the,cargoes,at,unheard-of,prices,but,bought,up,the,cargoes,of,other,boats,and,held,them,for,rises,in,prices
it,was,said,that,he,was,at,the,head,of,a,combine,worth,more,than,a,million,dollars,with,wilmington,as,its,headquarters,for,the,purpose,of,buying,blockade,goods,on,the,docks
they,had,dozens,of,warehouses,in,that,city,and,in,richmond,so,the,story,ran,and,the,warehouses,were,crammed,with,food,and,clothing,that,were,being,held,for,higher,prices
already,soldiers,and,civilians,alike,were,feeling,the,pinch,and,the,muttering,against,him,and,his,fellow,speculators,was,bitter
there,are,many,brave,and,patriotic,men,in,the,blockade,arm,of,the,confederacy's,naval,service,ran,the,last,of,the,doctor's,letter,unselfish,men,who,are,risking,their,lives,and,all,their,wealth,that,the,confederacy,may,survive
they,are,enshrined,in,the,hearts,of,all,loyal,southerners,and,no,one,begrudges,them,the,scant,monetary,returns,they,make,for,their,risks
they,are,unselfish,gentlemen,and,we,honor,them
of,these,men,i,do,not,speak
but,there,are,other,scoundrels,who,masquerade,under,the,cloak,of,the,blockader,for,their,own,selfish,gains,and,i,call,down,the,just,wrath,and,vengeance,of,an,embattled,people,fighting,in,the,justest,of,causes,on,these,human,vultures,who,bring,in,satins,and,laces,when,our,men,are,dying,for,want,of,quinine,who,load,their,boats,with,tea,and,wines,when,our,heroes,are,writhing,for,lack,of,morphia
i,execrate,these,vampires,who,are,sucking,the,lifeblood,of,the,men,who,follow,robert,lee,these,men,who,are,making,the,very,name,of,blockader,a,stench,in,the,nostrils,of,all,patriotic,men
how,can,we,endure,these,scavengers,in,our,midst,with,their,varnished,boots,when,our,boys,are,tramping,barefoot,into,battle
how,can,we,tolerate,them,with,their,champagnes,and,their,pates,of,strasbourg,when,our,soldiers,are,shivering,about,their,camp,fires,and,gnawing,moldy,bacon
i,call,upon,every,loyal,confederate,to,cast,them,out
atlanta,read,knew,the,oracle,had,spoken,and,as,loyal,confederates,they,hastened,to,cast,rhett,out
of,all,the,homes,which,had,received,him,in,the,fall,of,1862,miss,pittypat's,was,almost,the,only,one,into,which,he,could,enter,in,1863,and,except,for,melanie,he,probably,would,not,have,been,received,there
aunt,pitty,was,in,a,state,whenever,he,was,in,town
she,knew,very,well,what,her,friends,were,saying,when,she,permitted,him,to,call,but,she,still,lacked,the,courage,to,tell,him,he,was,unwelcome
each,time,he,arrived,in,atlanta,she,set,her,fat,mouth,and,told,the,girls,that,she,would,meet,him,at,the,door,and,forbid,him,to,enter
and,each,time,he,came,a,little,package,in,his,hand,and,a,compliment,for,her,charm,and,beauty,on,his,lips,she,wilted
i,just,don't,know,what,to,do,she,would,moan
he,just,looks,at,me,and,i,i'm,scared,to,death,of,what,he,would,do,if,i,told,him
he's,got,such,a,bad,reputation
do,you,suppose,he,would,strike,me,or,or,oh,dear,if,charlie,were,only,alive
scarlett,you,must,tell,him,not,to,call,again,tell,him,in,a,nice,way
oh,me
i,do,believe,you,encourage,him,and,the,whole,town,is,talking,and,if,your,mother,ever,finds,out,what,will,she,say,to,me
melly,you,must,not,be,so,nice,to,him
be,cool,and,distant,and,he,will,understand
oh,melly,do,you,think,i'd,better,write,henry,a,note,and,ask,him,to,speak,to,captain,butler
no,i,don't,said,melanie
and,i,won't,be,rude,to,him,either
i,think,people,are,acting,like,chickens,with,their,heads,off,about,captain,butler
i'm,sure,he,can't,be,all,the,bad,things,dr,meade,and,mrs,merriwether,say,he,is
he,wouldn't,hold,food,from,starving,people
why,he,even,gave,me,a,hundred,dollars,for,the,orphans
i'm,sure,he's,just,as,loyal,and,patriotic,as,any,of,us,and,he's,just,too,proud,to,defend,himself
you,know,how,obstinate,men,are,when,they,get,their,backs,up
aunt,pitty,knew,nothing,about,men,either,with,their,backs,up,or,otherwise,and,she,could,only,wave,her,fat,little,hands,helplessly
as,for,scarlett,she,had,long,ago,become,resigned,to,melanie's,habit,of,seeing,good,in,everyone
melanie,was,a,fool,but,there,was,nothing,anybody,could,do,about,it
scarlett,knew,that,rhett,was,not,being,patriotic,and,though,she,would,have,died,rather,than,confess,it,she,did,not,care
the,little,presents,he,brought,her,from,nassau,little,oddments,that,a,lady,could,accept,with,propriety,were,what,mattered,most,to,her
with,prices,as,high,as,they,were,where,on,earth,could,she,get,needles,and,bonbons,and,hairpins,if,she,forbade,the,house,to,him
no,it,was,easier,to,shift,the,responsibility,to,aunt,pitty,who,after,all,was,the,head,of,the,house,the,chaperon,and,the,arbiter,of,morals
scarlett,knew,the,town,gossiped,about,rhett's,calls,and,about,her,too,but,she,also,knew,that,in,the,eyes,of,atlanta,melanie,wilkes,could,do,no,wrong,and,if,melanie,defended,rhett,his,calls,were,still,tinged,with,respectability
however,life,would,be,pleasanter,if,rhett,would,recant,his,heresies
she,wouldn't,have,to,suffer,the,embarrassment,of,seeing,him,cut,openly,when,she,walked,down,peachtree,street,with,him
even,if,you,think,such,things,why,do,you,say,them
she,scolded
if,you'd,just,think,what,you,please,but,keep,your,mouth,shut,everything,would,be,so,much,nicer
that's,your,system,isn't,it,my,green-eyed,hypocrite
scarlett,scarlett
i,hoped,for,more,courageous,conduct,from,you
i,thought,the,irish,said,what,they,thought,and,the,divvil,take,the,hindermost
tell,me,truthfully,don't,you,sometimes,almost,burst,from,keeping,your,mouth,shut
well,yes,scarlett,confessed,reluctantly
i,do,get,awfully,bored,when,they,talk,about,the,cause,morning,noon,and,night
but,goodness,rhett,butler,if,i,admitted,it,nobody,would,speak,to,me,and,none,of,the,boys,would,dance,with,me
ah,yes,and,one,must,be,danced,with,at,all,costs
well,i,admire,your,self-control,but,i,do,not,find,myself,equal,to,it
nor,can,i,masquerade,in,a,cloak,of,romance,and,patriotism,no,matter,how,convenient,it,might,be
there,are,enough,stupid,patriots,who,are,risking,every,cent,they,have,in,the,blockade,and,who,are,going,to,come,out,of,this,war,paupers
they,don't,need,me,among,their,number,either,to,brighten,the,record,of,patriotism,or,to,increase,the,roll,of,paupers
let,them,have,the,haloes
they,deserve,them,for,once,i,am,being,sincere,and,besides,haloes,will,be,about,all,they,will,have,in,a,year,or,so
i,think,you,are,very,nasty,to,even,hint,such,things,when,you,know,very,well,that,england,and,france,are,coming,in,on,our,side,in,no,time,and
why,scarlett
you,must,have,been,reading,a,newspaper
i'm,surprised,at,you
don't,do,it,again
it,addles,women's,brains
for,your,information,i,was,in,england,not,a,month,ago,and,i'll,tell,you,this
england,will,never,help,the,confederacy
england,never,bets,on,the,underdog
that's,why,she's,england
besides,the,fat,dutch,woman,who,is,sitting,on,the,throne,is,a,god-fearing,soul,and,she,doesn't,approve,of,slavery
let,the,english,mill,workers,starve,because,they,can't,get,our,cotton,but,never,never,strike,a,blow,for,slavery
and,as,for,france,that,weak,imitation,of,napoleon,is,far,too,busy,establishing,the,french,in,mexico,to,be,bothered,with,us
in,fact,he,welcomes,this,war,because,it,keeps,us,too,busy,to,run,his,troops,out,of,mexico
no,scarlett,the,idea,of,assistance,from,abroad,is,just,a,newspaper,invention,to,keep,up,the,morale,of,the,south
the,confederacy,is,doomed
it's,living,on,its,hump,now,like,the,camel,and,even,the,largest,of,humps,aren't,inexhaustible
i,give,myself,about,six,months,more,of,blockading,and,then,i'm,through
after,that,it,will,be,too,risky
and,i'll,sell,my,boats,to,some,foolish,englishman,who,thinks,he,can,slip,them,through
but,one,way,or,the,other,it's,not,bothering,me
i've,made,money,enough,and,it's,in,english,banks,and,in,gold
none,of,this,worthless,paper,for,me
as,always,when,he,spoke,he,sounded,so,plausible
other,people,might,call,his,utterances,treachery,but,to,scarlett,they,always,rang,with,common,sense,and,truth
and,she,knew,that,this,was,utterly,wrong,knew,she,should,be,shocked,and,infuriated
actually,she,was,neither,but,she,could,pretend,to,be
it,made,her,feel,more,respectable,and,ladylike
i,think,what,dr,meade,wrote,about,was,right,captain,butler
the,only,way,to,redeem,yourself,is,to,enlist,after,you,sell,your,boats
you're,a,west,pointer,and
you,talk,like,a,baptist,preacher,making,a,recruiting,speech
suppose,i,don't,want,to,redeem,myself
why,should,i,fight,to,uphold,the,system,that,cast,me,out
i,shall,take,pleasure,in,seeing,it,smashed
i,never,heard,of,any,system,she,said,crossly
no
and,yet,you,are,a,part,of,it,like,i,was,and,i'll,wager,you,don't,like,it,any,more,than,i,did
well,why,am,i,the,black,sheep,of,the,butler,family
for,this,reason,and,no,other,i,didn't,conform,to,charleston,and,i,couldn't
and,charleston,is,the,south,only,intensified
i,wonder,if,you,realize,yet,what,a,bore,it,is
so,many,things,that,one,must,do,because,they've,always,been,done
so,many,things,quite,harmless,that,one,must,not,do,for,the,same,reason
so,many,things,that,annoyed,me,by,their,senselessness
not,marrying,the,young,lady,of,whom,you,have,probably,heard,was,merely,the,last,straw
why,should,i,marry,a,boring,fool,simply,because,an,accident,prevented,me,from,getting,her,home,before,dark
and,why,permit,her,wild-eyed,brother,to,shoot,and,kill,me,when,i,could,shoot,straighter
if,i,had,been,a,gentleman,of,course,i,would,have,let,him,kill,me,and,that,would,have,wiped,the,blot,from,the,butler,escutcheon
but,i,like,to,live
and,so,i've,lived,and,i've,had,a,good,time
when,i,think,of,my,brother,living,among,the,sacred,cows,of,charleston,and,most,reverent,toward,them,and,remember,his,stodgy,wife,and,his,saint,cecilia,balls,and,his,everlasting,rice,fields,then,i,know,the,compensation,for,breaking,with,the,system
scarlett,our,southern,way,of,living,is,as,antiquated,as,the,feudal,system,of,the,middle,ages
the,wonder,is,that,it's,lasted,as,long,as,it,has
it,had,to,go,and,it's,going,now
and,yet,you,expect,me,to,listen,to,orators,like,dr,meade,who,tell,me,our,cause,is,just,and,holy
and,get,so,excited,by,the,roll,of,drums,that,i'll,grab,a,musket,and,rush,off,to,virginia,to,shed,my,blood,for,marse,robert
what,kind,of,a,fool,do,you,think,i,am
kissing,the,rod,that,chastised,me,is,not,in,my,line
the,south,and,i,are,even,now
the,south,threw,me,out,to,starve,once
i,haven't,starved,and,i,am,making,enough,money,out,of,the,south's,death,throes,to,compensate,me,for,my,lost,birthright
i,think,you,are,vile,and,mercenary,said,scarlett,but,her,remark,was,automatic
most,of,what,he,was,saying,went,over,her,head,as,did,any,conversation,that,was,not,personal
but,part,of,it,made,sense
there,were,such,a,lot,of,foolish,things,about,life,among,nice,people
having,to,pretend,that,her,heart,was,in,the,grave,when,it,wasn't
and,how,shocked,everybody,had,been,when,she,danced,at,the,bazaar
and,the,infuriating,way,people,lifted,their,eyebrows,every,time,she,did,or,said,anything,the,least,bit,different,from,what,every,other,young,woman,did,and,said
but,still,she,was,jarred,at,hearing,him,attack,the,very,traditions,that,irked,her,most
she,had,lived,too,long,among,people,who,dissembled,politely,not,to,feel,disturbed,at,hearing,her,own,thoughts,put,into,words
mercenary
no,i'm,only,farsighted
though,perhaps,that,is,merely,a,synonym,for,mercenary
at,least,people,who,were,not,as,farsighted,as,i,will,call,it,that
any,loyal,confederate,who,had,a,thousand,dollars,in,cash,in,1861,could,have,done,what,i,did,but,how,few,were,mercenary,enough,to,take,advantage,of,their,opportunities
as,for,instance,right,after,fort,sumter,fell,and,before,the,blockade,was,established,i,bought,up,several,thousand,bales,of,cotton,at,dirt-cheap,prices,and,ran,them,to,england
they,are,still,there,in,warehouses,in,liverpool
i've,never,sold,them
i'm,holding,them,until,the,english,mills,have,to,have,cotton,and,will,give,me,any,price,i,ask
i,wouldn't,be,surprised,if,i,got,a,dollar,a,pound
you'll,get,a,dollar,a,pound,when,elephants,roost,in,trees
i'll,believe,i'll,get,it
cotton,is,at,seventy-two,cents,a,pound,already
i'm,going,to,be,a,rich,man,when,this,war,is,over,scarlett,because,i,was,farsighted,pardon,me,mercenary
i,told,you,once,before,that,there,were,two,times,for,making,big,money,one,in,the,upbuilding,of,a,country,and,the,other,in,its,destruction
slow,money,on,the,upbuilding,fast,money,in,the,crack-up
remember,my,words
perhaps,they,may,be,of,use,to,you,some,day
i,do,appreciate,good,advice,so,much,said,scarlett,with,all,the,sarcasm,she,could,muster
but,i,don't,need,your,advice
do,you,think,pa,is,a,pauper
he's,got,all,the,money,i'll,ever,need,and,then,i,have,charles',property,besides
i,imagine,the,french,aristocrats,thought,practically,the,same,thing,until,the,very,moment,when,they,climbed,into,the,tumbrils
frequently,rhett,pointed,out,to,scarlett,the,inconsistency,of,her,wearing,black,mourning,clothes,when,she,was,participating,in,all,social,activities
he,liked,bright,colors,and,scarlett's,funeral,dresses,and,the,crepe,veil,that,hung,from,her,bonnet,to,her,heels,both,amused,him,and,offended,him
but,she,clung,to,her,dull,black,dresses,and,her,veil,knowing,that,if,she,changed,them,for,colors,without,waiting,several,more,years,the,town,would,buzz,even,more,than,it,was,already,buzzing
and,besides,how,would,she,ever,explain,to,her,mother
rhett,said,frankly,that,the,crepe,veil,made,her,look,like,a,crow,and,the,black,dresses,added,ten,years,to,her,age
this,ungallant,statement,sent,her,flying,to,the,mirror,to,see,if,she,really,did,look,twenty-eight,instead,of,eighteen
i,should,think,you'd,have,more,pride,than,to,try,to,look,like,mrs,merriwether,he,taunted
and,better,taste,than,to,wear,that,veil,to,advertise,a,grief,i'm,sure,you,never,felt
i'll,lay,a,wager,with,you
i'll,have,that,bonnet,and,veil,off,your,head,and,a,paris,creation,on,it,within,two,months
indeed,no,and,don't,let's,discuss,it,any,further,said,scarlett,annoyed,by,his,reference,to,charles
rhett,who,was,preparing,to,leave,for,wilmington,for,another,trip,abroad,departed,with,a,grin,on,his,face
one,bright,summer,morning,some,weeks,later,he,reappeared,with,a,brightly,trimmed,hatbox,in,his,hand,and,after,finding,that,scarlett,was,alone,in,the,house,he,opened,it
wrapped,in,layers,of,tissue,was,a,bonnet,a,creation,that,made,her,cry,oh,the,darling,thing
as,she,reached,for,it
starved,for,the,sight,much,less,the,touch,of,new,clothes,it,seemed,the,loveliest,bonnet,she,had,ever,seen
it,was,of,dark-green,taffeta,lined,with,water,silk,of,a,pale-jade,color
the,ribbons,that,tied,under,the,chin,were,as,wide,as,her,hand,and,they,too,were,pale,green
and,curled,about,the,brim,of,this,confection,was,the,perkiest,of,green,ostrich,plumes
put,it,on,said,rhett,smiling
she,flew,across,the,room,to,the,mirror,and,plopped,it,on,her,head,pushing,back,her,hair,to,show,her,earrings,and,tying,the,ribbon,under,her,chin
how,do,i,look
she,cried,pirouetting,for,his,benefit,and,tossing,her,head,so,that,the,plume,danced
but,she,knew,she,looked,pretty,even,before,she,saw,confirmation,in,his,eyes
she,looked,attractively,saucy,and,the,green,of,the,lining,made,her,eyes,dark,emerald,and,sparkling
oh,rhett,whose,bonnet,is,it
i'll,buy,it
i'll,give,you,every,cent,i've,got,for,it
it's,your,bonnet,he,said
who,else,could,wear,that,shade,of,green
don't,you,think,i,carried,the,color,of,your,eyes,well,in,my,mind
did,you,really,have,it,trimmed,just,for,me
yes,and,there's,'rue,de,la,paix',on,the,box,if,that,means,anything,to,you
it,meant,nothing,to,her,smiling,at,her,reflection,in,the,mirror
just,at,this,moment,nothing,mattered,to,her,except,that,she,looked,utterly,charming,in,the,first,pretty,hat,she,had,put,on,her,head,in,two,years
what,she,couldn't,do,with,this,hat
and,then,her,smile,faded
don't,you,like,it
oh,it's,a,dream,but,oh,i,do,hate,to,have,to,cover,this,lovely,green,with,crepe,and,dye,the,feather,black
he,was,beside,her,quickly,and,his,deft,fingers,untied,the,wide,bow,under,her,chin
in,a,moment,the,hat,was,back,in,its,box
what,are,you,doing
you,said,it,was,mine
but,not,to,change,to,a,mourning,bonnet
i,shall,find,some,other,charming,lady,with,green,eyes,who,appreciates,my,taste
oh,you,shan't
i'll,die,if,i,don't,have,it
oh,please,rhett,don't,be,mean
let,me,have,it
and,turn,it,into,a,fright,like,your,other,hats
no
she,clutched,at,the,box
that,sweet,thing,that,made,her,look,so,young,and,enchanting,to,be,given,to,some,other,girl
oh,never
for,a,moment,she,thought,of,the,horror,of,pitty,and,melanie
she,thought,of,ellen,and,what,she,would,say,and,she,shivered
but,vanity,was,stronger
i,won't,change,it
i,promise
now,do,let,me,have,it
he,gave,her,the,box,with,a,slightly,sardonic,smile,and,watched,her,while,she,put,it,on,again,and,preened,herself
how,much,is,it
she,asked,suddenly,her,face,falling
i,have,only,fifty,dollars,but,next,month
it,would,cost,about,two,thousand,dollars,confederate,money,he,said,with,a,grin,at,her,woebegone,expression
oh,dear,well,suppose,i,give,you,the,fifty,now,and,then,when,i,get
i,don't,want,any,money,for,it,he,said
it's,a,gift
scarlett's,mouth,dropped,open
the,line,was,so,closely,so,carefully,drawn,where,gifts,from,men,were,concerned
candy,and,flowers,dear,ellen,had,said,time,and,again,and,perhaps,a,book,of,poetry,or,an,album,or,a,small,bottle,of,florida,water,are,the,only,things,a,lady,may,accept,from,a,gentleman
never,never,any,expensive,gift,even,from,your,fiance
and,never,any,gift,of,jewelry,or,wearing,apparel,not,even,gloves,or,handkerchiefs
should,you,accept,such,gifts,men,would,know,you,were,no,lady,and,would,try,to,take,liberties
oh,dear,thought,scarlett,looking,first,at,herself,in,the,mirror,and,then,at,rhett's,unreadable,face
i,simply,can't,tell,him,i,won't,accept,it
it's,too,darling
i'd,i'd,almost,rather,he,took,a,liberty,if,it,was,a,very,small,one
then,she,was,horrified,at,herself,for,having,such,a,thought,and,she,turned,pink
i'll,i'll,give,you,the,fifty,dollars
if,you,do,i,will,throw,it,in,the,gutter
or,better,still,buy,masses,for,your,soul
i'm,sure,your,soul,could,do,with,a,few,masses
she,laughed,unwillingly,and,the,laughing,reflection,under,the,green,brim,decided,her,instantly
whatever,are,you,trying,to,do,to,me
i'm,tempting,you,with,fine,gifts,until,your,girlish,ideals,are,quite,worn,away,and,you,are,at,my,mercy,he,said
'accept,only,candy,and,flowers,from,gentlemen,dearie,',he,mimicked,and,she,burst,into,a,giggle
you,are,a,clever,black-hearted,wretch,rhett,butler,and,you,know,very,well,this,bonnet's,too,pretty,to,be,refused
his,eyes,mocked,her,even,while,they,complimented,her,beauty
of,course,you,can,tell,miss,pitty,that,you,gave,me,a,sample,of,taffeta,and,green,silk,and,drew,a,picture,of,the,bonnet,and,i,extorted,fifty,dollars,from,you,for,it
no
i,shall,say,one,hundred,dollars,and,she'll,tell,everybody,in,town,and,everybody,will,be,green,with,envy,and,talk,about,my,extravagance
but,rhett,you,mustn't,bring,me,anything,else,so,expensive
it's,awfully,kind,of,you,but,i,really,couldn't,accept,anything,else
indeed
well,i,shall,bring,you,presents,so,long,as,it,pleases,me,and,so,long,as,i,see,things,that,will,enhance,your,charms
i,shall,bring,you,dark-green,watered,silk,for,a,frock,to,match,the,bonnet
and,i,warn,you,that,i,am,not,kind
i,am,tempting,you,with,bonnets,and,bangles,and,leading,you,into,a,pit
always,remember,i,never,do,anything,without,reason,and,i,never,give,anything,without,expecting,something,in,return
i,always,get,paid
his,black,eyes,sought,her,face,and,traveled,to,her,lips
scarlett,cast,down,her,eyes,excitement,filling,her
now,he,was,going,to,try,to,take,liberties,just,as,ellen,predicted
he,was,going,to,kiss,her,or,try,to,kiss,her,and,she,couldn't,quite,make,up,her,flurried,mind,which,it,should,be
if,she,refused,he,might,jerk,the,bonnet,right,off,her,head,and,give,it,to,some,other,girl
on,the,other,hand,if,she,permitted,one,chaste,peck,he,might,bring,her,other,lovely,presents,in,the,hope,of,getting,another,kiss
men,set,such,a,store,by,kisses,though,heaven,alone,knew,why
and,lots,of,times,after,one,kiss,they,fell,completely,in,love,with,a,girl,and,made,most,entertaining,spectacles,of,themselves,provided,the,girl,was,clever,and,withheld,her,kisses,after,the,first,one
it,would,be,exciting,to,have,rhett,butler,in,love,with,her,and,admitting,it,and,begging,for,a,kiss,or,a,smile
yes,she,would,let,him,kiss,her
but,he,made,no,move,to,kiss,her
she,gave,him,a,sidelong,glance,from,under,her,lashes,and,murmured,encouragingly
so,you,always,get,paid,do,you
and,what,do,you,expect,to,get,from,me
that,remains,to,be,seen
well,if,you,think,i'll,marry,you,to,pay,for,the,bonnet,i,won't,she,said,daringly,and,gave,her,head,a,saucy,flirt,that,set,the,plume,to,bobbing
his,white,teeth,gleamed,under,his,little,mustache
madam,you,flatter,yourself,i,do,not,want,to,marry,you,or,anyone,else
i,am,not,a,marrying,man
indeed
she,cried,taken,aback,and,now,determined,that,he,should,take,some,liberty
i,don't,even,intend,to,kiss,you,either
then,why,is,your,mouth,all,pursed,up,in,that,ridiculous,way
oh
she,cried,as,she,caught,a,glimpse,of,herself,and,saw,that,her,red,lips,were,indeed,in,the,proper,pose,for,a,kiss
oh
she,cried,again,losing,her,temper,and,stamping,her,foot
you,are,the,horridest,man,i,have,ever,seen,and,i,don't,care,if,i,never,lay,eyes,on,you,again
if,you,really,felt,that,way,you'd,stamp,on,the,bonnet
my,what,a,passion,you,are,in,and,it's,quite,becoming,as,you,probably,know
come,scarlett,stamp,on,the,bonnet,to,show,me,what,you,think,of,me,and,my,presents
don't,you,dare,touch,this,bonnet,she,said,clutching,it,by,the,bow,and,retreating
he,came,after,her,laughing,softly,and,took,her,hands,in,his
oh,scarlett,you,are,so,young,you,wring,my,heart,he,said
and,i,shall,kiss,you,as,you,seem,to,expect,it,and,leaning,down,carelessly,his,mustache,just,grazed,her,cheek
now,do,you,feel,that,you,must,slap,me,to,preserve,the,proprieties
her,lips,mutinous,she,looked,up,into,his,eyes,and,saw,so,much,amusement,in,their,dark,depths,that,she,burst,into,laughter
what,a,tease,he,was,and,how,exasperating
if,he,didn't,want,to,marry,her,and,didn't,even,want,to,kiss,her,what,did,he,want
if,he,wasn't,in,love,with,her,why,did,he,call,so,often,and,bring,her,presents
that's,better,he,said
scarlett,i'm,a,bad,influence,on,you,and,if,you,have,any,sense,you,will,send,me,packing,if,you,can
i'm,very,hard,to,get,rid,of
but,i'm,bad,for,you
are,you
can't,you,see,it
ever,since,i,met,you,at,the,bazaar,your,career,has,been,most,shocking,and,i'm,to,blame,for,most,of,it
who,encouraged,you,to,dance
who,forced,you,to,admit,that,you,thought,our,glorious,cause,was,neither,glorious,nor,sacred
who,goaded,you,into,admitting,that,you,thought,men,were,fools,to,die,for,high-sounding,principles
who,has,aided,you,in,giving,the,old,ladies,plenty,to,gossip,about
who,is,getting,you,out,of,mourning,several,years,too,soon
and,who,to,end,all,this,has,lured,you,into,accepting,a,gift,which,no,lady,can,accept,and,still,remain,a,lady
you,flatter,yourself,captain,butler
i,haven't,done,anything,so,scandalous,and,i'd,have,done,everything,you,mentioned,without,your,aid,anyway
i,doubt,that,he,said,and,his,face,went,suddenly,quiet,and,somber
you'd,still,be,the,broken-hearted,widow,of,charles,hamilton,and,famed,for,your,good,deeds,among,the,wounded
eventually,however
but,she,was,not,listening,for,she,was,regarding,herself,pleasedly,in,the,mirror,again,thinking,she,would,wear,the,bonnet,to,the,hospital,this,very,afternoon,and,take,flowers,to,the,convalescent,officers
that,there,was,truth,in,his,last,words,did,not,occur,to,her
she,did,not,see,that,rhett,had,pried,open,the,prison,of,her,widowhood,and,set,her,free,to,queen,it,over,unmarried,girls,when,her,days,as,a,belle,should,have,been,long,past
nor,did,she,see,that,under,his,influence,she,had,come,a,long,way,from,ellen's,teachings
the,change,had,been,so,gradual,the,flouting,of,one,small,convention,seeming,to,have,no,connection,with,the,flouting,of,another,and,none,of,them,any,connection,with,rhett
she,did,not,realize,that,with,his,encouragement,she,had,disregarded,many,of,the,sternest,injunctions,of,her,mother,concerning,the,proprieties,forgotten,the,difficult,lessons,in,being,a,lady
she,only,saw,that,the,bonnet,was,the,most,becoming,one,she,ever,had,that,it,had,not,cost,her,a,penny,and,that,rhett,must,be,in,love,with,her,whether,he,admitted,it,or,not
and,she,certainly,intended,to,find,a,way,to,make,him,admit,it
the,next,day,scarlett,was,standing,in,front,of,the,mirror,with,a,comb,in,her,hand,and,her,mouth,full,of,hairpins,attempting,a,new,coiffure,which,maybelle,fresh,from,a,visit,to,her,husband,in,richmond,had,said,was,the,rage,at,the,capital
it,was,called,cats,rats,and,mice,and,presented,many,difficulties
the,hair,was,parted,in,the,middle,and,arranged,in,three,rolls,of,graduating,size,on,each,side,of,the,head,the,largest,nearest,the,part,being,the,cat
the,cat,and,the,rat,were,easy,to,fix,but,the,mice,kept,slipping,out,of,her,hairpins,in,an,exasperating,manner
however,she,was,determined,to,accomplish,it,for,rhett,was,coming,to,supper,and,he,always,noticed,and,commented,upon,any,innovation,of,dress,or,hair
as,she,struggled,with,her,bushy,obstinate,locks,perspiration,beading,her,forehead,she,heard,light,running,feet,in,the,downstairs,hall,and,knew,that,melanie,was,home,from,the,hospital
as,she,heard,her,fly,up,the,stairs,two,at,a,time,she,paused,hairpin,in,mid-air,realizing,that,something,must,be,wrong,for,melanie,always,moved,as,decorously,as,a,dowager
she,went,to,the,door,and,threw,it,open,and,melanie,ran,in,her,face,flushed,and,frightened,looking,like,a,guilty,child
there,were,tears,on,her,cheeks,her,bonnet,was,hanging,on,her,neck,by,the,ribbons,and,her,hoops,swaying,violently
she,was,clutching,something,in,her,hand,and,the,reek,of,heavy,cheap,perfume,came,into,the,room,with,her
oh,scarlett
she,cried,shutting,the,door,and,sinking,on,the,bed
is,auntie,home,yet
she,isn't
oh,thank,the,lord
scarlett,i'm,so,mortified,i,could,die
i,nearly,swooned,and,scarlett,uncle,peter,is,threatening,to,tell,aunt,pitty
tell,what
that,i,was,talking,to,that,to,miss,mrs,melanie,fanned,her,hot,face,with,her,handkerchief
that,woman,with,red,hair,named,belle,watling
why,melly
cried,scarlett,so,shocked,she,could,only,stare
belle,watling,was,the,red-haired,woman,she,had,seen,on,the,street,the,first,day,she,came,to,atlanta,and,by,now,she,was,easily,the,most,notorious,woman,in,town
many,prostitutes,had,flocked,into,atlanta,following,the,soldiers,but,belle,stood,out,above,the,rest,due,to,her,flaming,hair,and,the,gaudy,overly,fashionable,dresses,she,wore
she,was,seldom,seen,on,peachtree,street,or,in,any,nice,neighborhood,but,when,she,did,appear,respectable,women,made,haste,to,cross,the,street,to,remove,themselves,from,her,vicinity
and,melanie,had,been,talking,with,her
no,wonder,uncle,peter,was,outraged
i,shall,die,if,aunt,pitty,finds,out
you,know,she'll,cry,and,tell,everybody,in,town,and,i'll,be,disgraced,sobbed,melanie
and,it,wasn't,my,fault
i,i,couldn't,run,away,from,her
it,would,have,been,so,rude
scarlett,i,i,felt,sorry,for,her
do,you,think,i'm,bad,for,feeling,that,way
but,scarlett,was,not,concerned,with,the,ethics,of,the,matter
like,most,innocent,and,well-bred,young,women,she,had,a,devouring,curiosity,about,prostitutes
what,did,she,want
what,does,she,talk,like
oh,she,used,awful,grammar,but,i,could,see,she,was,trying,so,hard,to,be,elegant,poor,thing
i,came,out,of,the,hospital,and,uncle,peter,and,the,carriage,weren't,waiting,so,i,thought,i'd,walk,home
and,when,i,went,by,the,emersons',yard,there,she,was,hiding,behind,the,hedge
oh,thank,heaven,the,emersons,are,in,macon
and,she,said,'please,mrs,wilkes,do,speak,a,minute,with,me,'
i,don't,know,how,she,knew,my,name
i,knew,i,ought,to,run,as,hard,as,i,could,but,well,scarlett,she,looked,so,sad,and,well,sort,of,pleading
and,she,had,on,a,black,dress,and,black,bonnet,and,no,paint,and,really,looked,decent,but,for,that,red,hair
and,before,i,could,answer,she,said
'i,know,i,shouldn't,speak,to,you,but,i,tried,to,talk,to,that,old,peahen,mrs,elsing,and,she,ran,me,away,from,the,hospital,'
did,she,really,call,her,a,peahen
said,scarlett,pleasedly,and,laughed
oh,don't,laugh
it,isn't,funny
it,seems,that,miss,this,woman,wanted,to,do,something,for,the,hospital,can,you,imagine,it
she,offered,to,nurse,every,morning,and,of,course,mrs,elsing,must,have,nearly,died,at,the,idea,and,ordered,her,out,of,the,hospital
and,then,she,said,'i,want,to,do,something,too
ain't,i,a,confedrut,good,as,you,'
and,scarlett,i,was,right,touched,at,her,wanting,to,help
you,know,she,can't,be,all,bad,if,she,wants,to,help,the,cause
do,you,think,i'm,bad,to,feel,that,way
for,heaven's,sake,melly,who,cares,if,you're,bad
what,else,did,she,say
she,said,she'd,been,watching,the,ladies,go,by,to,the,hospital,and,thought,i,had,a,a,kind,face,and,so,she,stopped,me
she,had,some,money,and,she,wanted,me,to,take,it,and,use,it,for,the,hospital,and,not,tell,a,soul,where,it,came,from
she,said,mrs,elsing,wouldn't,let,it,be,used,if,she,knew,what,kind,of,money,it,was
what,kind,of,money
that's,when,i,thought,i'd,swoon
and,i,was,so,upset,and,anxious,to,get,away,i,just,said,'oh,yes,indeed,how,sweet,of,you',or,something,idiotic,and,she,smiled,and,said,'that's,right,christian,of,you',and,shoved,this,dirty,handkerchief,into,my,hand
ugh,can,you,smell,the,perfume
melanie,held,out,a,man's,handkerchief,soiled,and,highly,perfumed,in,which,some,coins,were,knotted
she,was,saying,thank,you,and,something,about,bringing,me,some,money,every,week,and,just,then,uncle,peter,drove,up,and,saw,me
melly,collapsed,into,tears,and,laid,her,head,on,the,pillow
and,when,he,saw,who,was,with,me,he,scarlett,he,hollered,at,me
nobody,has,ever,hollered,at,me,before,in,my,whole,life
and,he,said,'you,git,in,dis,hyah,cah'ige,dis,minute,'
of,course,i,did,and,all,the,way,home,he,blessed,me,out,and,wouldn't,let,me,explain,and,said,he,was,going,to,tell,aunt,pitty
scarlett,do,go,down,and,beg,him,not,to,tell,her
perhaps,he,will,listen,to,you
it,will,kill,auntie,if,she,knows,i,ever,even,looked,that,woman,in,the,face
will,you
yes,i,will
but,let's,see,how,much,money,is,in,here
it,feels,heavy
she,untied,the,knot,and,a,handful,of,gold,coins,rolled,out,on,the,bed
scarlett,there's,fifty,dollars,here
and,in,gold
cried,melanie,awed,as,she,counted,the,bright,pieces
tell,me,do,you,think,it's,all,right,to,use,this,kind,well,money,made,er,this,way,for,the,boys
don't,you,think,that,maybe,god,will,understand,that,she,wanted,to,help,and,won't,care,if,it,is,tainted
when,i,think,of,how,many,things,the,hospital,needs
but,scarlett,was,not,listening
she,was,looking,at,the,dirty,handkerchief,and,humiliation,and,fury,were,filling,her
there,was,a,monogram,in,the,corner,in,which,were,the,initials,r,k
b
in,her,top,drawer,was,a,handkerchief,just,like,this,one,that,rhett,butler,had,lent,her,only,yesterday,to,wrap,about,the,stems,of,wild,flowers,they,had,picked
she,had,planned,to,return,it,to,him,when,he,came,to,supper,tonight
so,rhett,consorted,with,that,vile,watling,creature,and,gave,her,money
that,was,where,the,contribution,to,the,hospital,came,from
blockade,gold
and,to,think,that,rhett,would,have,the,gall,to,look,a,decent,woman,in,the,face,after,being,with,that,creature
and,to,think,that,she,could,have,believed,he,was,in,love,with,her
this,proved,he,couldn't,be
bad,women,and,all,they,involved,were,mysterious,and,revolting,matters,to,her
she,knew,that,men,patronized,these,women,for,purposes,which,no,lady,should,mention,or,if,she,did,mention,them,in,whispers,and,by,indirection,and,euphemism
she,had,always,thought,that,only,common,vulgar,men,visited,such,women
before,this,moment,it,had,never,occurred,to,her,that,nice,men,that,is,men,she,met,at,nice,homes,and,with,whom,she,danced,could,possibly,do,such,things
it,opened,up,an,entirely,new,field,of,thought,and,one,that,was,horrifying
perhaps,all,men,did,this
it,was,bad,enough,that,they,forced,their,wives,to,go,through,such,indecent,performances,but,to,actually,seek,out,low,women,and,pay,them,for,such,accommodation
oh,men,were,so,vile,and,rhett,butler,was,the,worst,of,them,all
she,would,take,this,handkerchief,and,fling,it,in,his,face,and,show,him,the,door,and,never,never,speak,to,him,again
but,no,of,course,she,couldn't,do,that
she,could,never,never,let,him,know,she,even,realized,that,bad,women,existed,much,less,that,he,visited,them
a,lady,could,never,do,that
oh,she,thought,in,fury
if,i,just,wasn't,a,lady,what,wouldn't,i,tell,that,varmint
and,crumbling,the,handkerchief,in,her,hand,she,went,down,the,stairs,to,the,kitchen,in,search,of,uncle,peter
as,she,passed,the,stove,she,shoved,the,handkerchief,into,the,flames,and,with,impotent,anger,watched,it,burn

hope,was,rolling,high,in,every,southern,heart,as,the,summer,of,1863,came,in
despite,privation,and,hardships,despite,food,speculators,and,kindred,scourges,despite,death,and,sickness,and,suffering,which,had,now,left,their,mark,on,nearly,every,family,the,south,was,again,saying,one,more,victory,and,the,war,is,over,saying,it,with,even,more,happy,assurance,than,in,the,summer,before
the,yankees,were,proving,a,hard,nut,to,crack,but,they,were,cracking,at,last
christmas,of,1862,had,been,a,happy,one,for,atlanta,for,the,whole,south
the,confederacy,had,scored,a,smashing,victory,at,fredericksburg,and,the,yankee,dead,and,wounded,were,counted,in,the,thousands
there,was,universal,rejoicing,in,that,holiday,season,rejoicing,and,thankfulness,that,the,tide,was,turning
the,army,in,butternut,were,now,seasoned,fighters,their,generals,had,proven,their,mettle,and,everyone,knew,that,when,the,campaign,reopened,in,the,spring,the,yankees,would,be,crushed,for,good,and,all
spring,came,and,the,fighting,recommenced
may,came,and,the,confederacy,won,another,great,victory,at,chancellorsville
the,south,roared,with,elation
closer,at,home,a,union,cavalry,dash,into,georgia,had,been,turned,into,a,confederate,triumph
folks,were,still,laughing,and,slapping,each,other,on,the,back,and,saying,yes,sir
when,old,nathan,bedford,forrest,gets,after,them,they,better,git
late,in,april,colonel,streight,and,eighteen,hundred,yankee,cavalry,had,made,a,surprise,raid,into,georgia,aiming,at,rome,only,a,little,more,than,sixty,miles,north,of,atlanta
they,had,ambitious,plans,to,cut,the,vitally,important,railroad,between,atlanta,and,tennessee,and,then,swing,southward,into,atlanta,to,destroy,the,factories,and,the,war,supplies,concentrated,there,in,that,key,city,of,the,confederacy
it,was,a,bold,stroke,and,it,would,have,cost,the,south,dearly,except,for,forrest
with,only,one-third,as,many,men,but,what,men,and,what,riders,he,had,started,after,them,engaged,them,before,they,even,reached,rome,harassed,them,day,and,night,and,finally,captured,the,entire,force
the,news,reached,atlanta,almost,simultaneously,with,the,news,of,the,victory,at,chancellorsville,and,the,town,fairly,rocked,with,exultation,and,with,laughter
chancellorsville,might,be,a,more,important,victory,but,the,capture,of,streight's,raiders,made,the,yankees,positively,ridiculous
no,sir,they'd,better,not,fool,with,old,forrest,atlanta,said,gleefully,as,the,story,was,told,over,and,over
the,tide,of,the,confederacy's,fortune,was,running,strong,and,full,now,sweeping,the,people,jubilantly,along,on,its,flood
true,the,yankees,under,grant,had,been,besieging,vicksburg,since,the,middle,of,may
true,the,south,had,suffered,a,sickening,loss,when,stonewall,jackson,had,been,fatally,wounded,at,chancellorsville
true,georgia,had,lost,one,of,her,bravest,and,most,brilliant,sons,when,general,t,r,r,cobb,had,been,killed,at,fredericksburg
but,the,yankees,just,couldn't,stand,any,more,defeats,like,fredericksburg,and,chancellorsville
they'd,have,to,give,in,and,then,this,cruel,war,would,be,over
the,first,days,of,july,came,and,with,them,the,rumor,later,confirmed,by,dispatches,that,lee,was,marching,into,pennsylvania
lee,in,the,enemy's,territory
lee,forcing,battle
this,was,the,last,fight,of,the,war
atlanta,was,wild,with,excitement,pleasure,and,a,hot,thirst,for,vengeance
now,the,yankees,would,know,what,it,meant,to,have,the,war,carried,into,their,own,country
now,they'd,know,what,it,meant,to,have,fertile,fields,stripped,horses,and,cattle,stolen,houses,burned,old,men,and,boys,dragged,off,to,prison,and,women,and,children,turned,out,to,starve
everyone,knew,what,the,yankees,had,done,in,missouri,kentucky,tennessee,and,virginia
even,small,children,could,recite,with,hate,and,fear,the,horrors,the,yankees,had,inflicted,upon,the,conquered,territory
already,atlanta,was,full,of,refugees,from,east,tennessee,and,the,town,had,heard,firsthand,stories,from,them,of,what,suffering,they,had,gone,through
in,that,section,the,confederate,sympathizers,were,in,the,minority,and,the,hand,of,war,fell,heavily,upon,them,as,it,did,on,all,the,border,states,neighbor,informing,against,neighbor,and,brother,killing,brother
these,refugees,cried,out,to,see,pennsylvania,one,solid,sheet,of,flame,and,even,the,gentlest,of,old,ladies,wore,expressions,of,grim,pleasure
but,when,the,news,trickled,back,that,lee,had,issued,orders,that,no,private,property,in,pennsylvania,should,be,touched,that,looting,would,be,punished,by,death,and,that,the,army,would,pay,for,every,article,it,requisitioned,then,it,needed,all,the,reverence,the,general,had,earned,to,save,his,popularity
not,turn,the,men,loose,in,the,rich,storehouses,of,that,prosperous,state
what,was,general,lee,thinking,of
and,our,boys,so,hungry,and,needing,shoes,and,clothes,and,horses
a,hasty,note,from,darcy,meade,to,the,doctor,the,only,first-hand,information,atlanta,received,during,those,first,days,of,july,was,passed,from,hand,to,hand,with,mounting,indignation
pa,could,you,manage,to,get,me,a,pair,of,boots
i've,been,barefooted,for,two,weeks,now,and,i,don't,see,any,prospects,of,getting,another,pair
if,i,didn't,have,such,big,feet,i,could,get,them,off,dead,yankees,like,the,other,boys,but,i've,never,yet,found,a,yankee,whose,feet,were,near,as,big,as,mine
if,you,can,get,me,some,don't,mail,them
somebody,would,steal,them,on,the,way,and,i,wouldn't,blame,them
put,phil,on,the,train,and,send,him,up,with,them
i'll,write,you,soon,where,we'll,be
right,now,i,don't,know,except,that,we're,marching,north
we're,in,maryland,now,and,everybody,says,we're,going,on,into,pennsylvania
pa,i,thought,that,we'd,give,the,yanks,a,taste,of,their,own,medicine,but,the,general,says,no,and,personally,i,don't,care,to,get,shot,just,for,the,pleasure,of,burning,some,yank's,house
pa,today,we,marched,through,the,grandest,cornfields,you,ever,saw
we,don't,have,corn,like,this,down,home
well,i,must,admit,we,did,a,bit,of,private,looting,in,that,corn,for,we,were,all,pretty,hungry,and,what,the,general,don't,know,won't,hurt,him
but,that,green,corn,didn't,do,us,a,bit,of,good
all,the,boys,have,got,dysentery,anyway,and,that,corn,made,it,worse
it's,easier,to,walk,with,a,leg,wound,than,with,dysentery
pa,do,try,to,manage,some,boots,for,me
i'm,a,captain,now,and,a,captain,ought,to,have,boots,even,if,he,hasn't,got,a,new,uniform,or,epaulets
but,the,army,was,in,pennsylvania,that,was,all,that,mattered
one,more,victory,and,the,war,would,be,over,and,then,darcy,meade,could,have,all,the,boots,he,wanted,and,the,boys,would,come,marching,home,and,everybody,would,be,happy,again
mrs,meade's,eyes,grew,wet,as,she,pictured,her,soldier,son,home,at,last,home,to,stay
on,the,third,of,july,a,sudden,silence,fell,on,the,wires,from,the,north,a,silence,that,lasted,till,midday,of,the,fourth,when,fragmentary,and,garbled,reports,began,to,trickle,into,headquarters,in,atlanta
there,had,been,hard,fighting,in,pennsylvania,near,a,little,town,named,gettysburg,a,great,battle,with,all,lee's,army,massed
the,news,was,uncertain,slow,in,coming,for,the,battle,had,been,fought,in,the,enemy's,territory,and,the,reports,came,first,through,maryland,were,relayed,to,richmond,and,then,to,atlanta
suspense,grew,and,the,beginnings,of,dread,slowly,crawled,over,the,town
nothing,was,so,bad,as,not,knowing,what,was,happening
families,with,sons,at,the,front,prayed,fervently,that,their,boys,were,not,in,pennsylvania,but,those,who,knew,their,relatives,were,in,the,same,regiment,with,darcy,meade,clamped,their,teeth,and,said,it,was,an,honor,for,them,to,be,in,the,big,fight,that,would,lick,the,yankees,for,good,and,all
in,aunt,pitty's,house,the,three,women,looked,into,one,another's,eyes,with,fear,they,could,not,conceal
ashley,was,in,darcy's,regiment
on,the,fifth,came,evil,tidings,not,from,the,north,but,from,the,west
vicksburg,had,fallen,fallen,after,a,long,and,bitter,siege,and,practically,all,the,mississippi,river,from,st,louis,to,new,orleans,was,in,the,hands,of,the,yankees
the,confederacy,had,been,cut,in,two
at,any,other,time,the,news,of,this,disaster,would,have,brought,fear,and,lamentation,to,atlanta
but,now,they,could,give,little,thought,to,vicksburg
they,were,thinking,of,lee,in,pennsylvania,forcing,battle
vicksburg's,loss,would,be,no,catastrophe,if,lee,won,in,the,east
there,lay,philadelphia,new,york,washington
their,capture,would,paralyze,the,north,and,more,than,cancel,off,the,defeat,on,the,mississippi
the,hours,dragged,by,and,the,black,shadow,of,calamity,brooded,over,the,town,obscuring,the,hot,sun,until,people,looked,up,startled,into,the,sky,as,if,incredulous,that,it,was,clear,and,blue,instead,of,murky,and,heavy,with,scudding,clouds
everywhere,women,gathered,in,knots,huddled,in,groups,on,front,porches,on,sidewalks,even,in,the,middle,of,the,streets,telling,each,other,that,no,news,is,good,news,trying,to,comfort,each,other,trying,to,present,a,brave,appearance
but,hideous,rumors,that,lee,was,killed,the,battle,lost,and,enormous,casualty,lists,coming,in,fled,up,and,down,the,quiet,streets,like,darting,bats
though,they,tried,not,to,believe,whole,neighborhoods,swayed,by,panic,rushed,to,town,to,the,newspapers,to,headquarters,pleading,for,news,any,news,even,bad,news
crowds,formed,at,the,depot,hoping,for,news,from,incoming,trains,at,the,telegraph,office,in,front,of,the,harried,headquarters,before,the,locked,doors,of,the,newspapers
they,were,oddly,still,crowds,crowds,that,quietly,grew,larger,and,larger
there,was,no,talking
occasionally,an,old,man's,treble,voice,begged,for,news,and,instead,of,inciting,the,crowd,to,babbling,it,only,intensified,the,hush,as,they,heard,the,oft-repeated,nothing,on,the,wires,yet,from,the,north,except,that,there's,been,fighting
the,fringe,of,women,on,foot,and,in,carriages,grew,greater,and,greater,and,the,heat,of,the,close-packed,bodies,and,dust,rising,from,restless,feet,were,suffocating
the,women,did,not,speak,but,their,pale,set,faces,pleaded,with,a,mute,eloquence,that,was,louder,than,wailing
there,was,hardly,a,house,in,town,that,had,not,sent,away,a,son,a,brother,a,father,a,lover,a,husband,to,this,battle
they,all,waited,to,hear,the,news,that,death,had,come,to,their,homes
they,expected,death
they,did,not,expect,defeat
that,thought,they,dismissed
their,men,might,be,dying,even,now,on,the,sun-parched,grass,of,the,pennsylvania,hills
even,now,the,southern,ranks,might,be,falling,like,grain,before,a,hailstorm,but,the,cause,for,which,they,fought,could,never,fall
they,might,be,dying,in,thousands,but,like,the,fruit,of,the,dragon's,teeth,thousands,of,fresh,men,in,gray,and,butternut,with,the,rebel,yell,on,their,lips,would,spring,up,from,the,earth,to,take,their,places
where,these,men,would,come,from,no,one,knew
they,only,knew,as,surely,as,they,knew,there,was,a,just,and,jealous,god,in,heaven,that,lee,was,miraculous,and,the,army,of,virginia,invincible
scarlett,melanie,and,miss,pittypat,sat,in,front,of,the,daily,examiner,office,in,the,carriage,with,the,top,back,sheltered,beneath,their,parasols
scarlett's,hands,shook,so,that,her,parasol,wobbled,above,her,head,pitty,was,so,excited,her,nose,quivered,in,her,round,face,like,a,rabbit's,but,melanie,sat,as,though,carved,of,stone,her,dark,eyes,growing,larger,and,larger,as,time,went,by
she,made,only,one,remark,in,two,hours,as,she,took,a,vial,of,smelling,salts,from,her,reticule,and,handed,it,to,her,aunt,the,only,time,she,had,ever,spoken,to,her,in,her,whole,life,with,anything,but,tenderest,affection
take,this,auntie,and,use,it,if,you,feel,faint
i,warn,you,if,you,do,faint,you'll,just,have,to,faint,and,let,uncle,peter,take,you,home,for,i'm,not,going,to,leave,this,place,till,i,hear,about,till,i,hear
and,i'm,not,going,to,let,scarlett,leave,me,either
scarlett,had,no,intention,of,leaving,no,intention,of,placing,herself,where,she,could,not,have,the,first,news,of,ashley
no,even,if,miss,pitty,died,she,wouldn't,leave,this,spot
somewhere,ashley,was,fighting,perhaps,dying,and,the,newspaper,office,was,the,only,place,where,she,could,learn,the,truth
she,looked,about,the,crowd,picking,out,friends,and,neighbors,mrs,meade,with,her,bonnet,askew,and,her,arm,through,that,of,fifteen-,year-old,phil,the,misses,mclure,trying,to,make,their,trembling,upper,lips,cover,their,buck,teeth,mrs,elsing,erect,as,a,spartan,mother,betraying,her,inner,turmoil,only,by,the,straggling,gray,locks,that,hung,from,her,chignon,and,fanny,elsing,white,as,a,ghost
surely,fanny,wouldn't,be,so,worried,about,her,brother,hugh
had,she,a,real,beau,at,the,front,that,no,one,suspected
mrs,merriwether,sat,in,her,carriage,patting,maybelle's,hand
maybelle,looked,so,very,pregnant,it,was,a,disgrace,for,her,to,be,out,in,public,even,if,she,did,have,her,shawl,carefully,draped,over,her
why,should,she,be,so,worried
nobody,had,heard,that,the,louisiana,troops,were,in,pennsylvania
probably,her,hairy,little,zouave,was,safe,in,richmond,this,very,minute
there,was,a,movement,on,the,outskirts,of,the,crowd,and,those,on,foot,gave,way,as,rhett,butler,carefully,edged,his,horse,toward,aunt,pitty's,carriage
scarlett,thought,he's,got,courage,coming,here,at,this,time,when,it,wouldn't,take,anything,to,make,this,mob,tear,him,to,pieces,because,he,isn't,in,uniform
as,he,came,nearer,she,thought,she,might,be,the,first,to,rend,him
how,dared,he,sit,there,on,that,fine,horse,in,shining,boots,and,handsome,white,linen,suit,so,sleek,and,well,fed,smoking,an,expensive,cigar,when,ashley,and,all,the,other,boys,were,fighting,the,yankees,barefooted,sweltering,in,the,heat,hungry,their,bellies,rotten,with,disease
bitter,looks,were,thrown,at,him,as,he,came,slowly,through,the,press
old,men,growled,in,their,beards,and,mrs,merriwether,who,feared,nothing,rose,slightly,in,her,carriage,and,said,clearly,speculator
in,a,tone,that,made,the,word,the,foulest,and,most,venomous,of,epithets
he,paid,no,heed,to,anyone,but,raised,his,hat,to,melly,and,aunt,pitty,and,riding,to,scarlett's,side,leaned,down,and,whispered,don't,you,think,this,would,be,the,time,for,dr,meade,to,give,us,his,familiar,speech,about,victory,perching,like,a,screaming,eagle,on,our,banners
her,nerves,taut,with,suspense,she,turned,on,him,as,swiftly,as,an,angry,cat,hot,words,bubbling,to,her,lips,but,he,stopped,them,with,a,gesture
i,came,to,tell,you,ladies,he,said,loudly,that,i,have,been,to,headquarters,and,the,first,casualty,lists,are,coming,in
at,these,words,a,hum,rose,among,those,near,enough,to,hear,his,remark,and,the,crowd,surged,ready,to,turn,and,run,down,whitehall,street,toward,headquarters
don't,go,he,called,rising,in,his,saddle,and,holding,up,his,hand
the,lists,have,been,sent,to,both,newspapers,and,are,now,being,printed
stay,where,you,are
oh,captain,butler,cried,melly,turning,to,him,with,tears,in,her,eyes
how,kind,of,you,to,come,and,tell,us
when,will,they,be,posted
they,should,be,out,any,minute,madam
the,reports,have,been,in,the,offices,for,half,an,hour,now
the,major,in,charge,didn't,want,to,let,that,out,until,the,printing,was,done,for,fear,the,crowd,would,wreck,the,offices,trying,to,get,news
ah
look
the,side,window,of,the,newspaper,office,opened,and,a,hand,was,extended,bearing,a,sheaf,of,long,narrow,galley,proofs,smeared,with,fresh,ink,and,thick,with,names,closely,printed
the,crowd,fought,for,them,tearing,the,slips,in,half,those,obtaining,them,trying,to,back,out,through,the,crowd,to,read,those,behind,pushing,forward,crying,let,me,through
hold,the,reins,said,rhett,shortly,swinging,to,the,ground,and,tossing,the,bridle,to,uncle,peter
they,saw,his,heavy,shoulders,towering,above,the,crowd,as,he,went,through,brutally,pushing,and,shoving
in,a,while,he,was,back,with,half,a,dozen,in,his,hands

quickly
scarlett,took,a,quick,glance,at,the,lists
hugh,elsing,was,not,listed
fanny,must,have,had,a,beau,and,now,he,was,dead
the,crowd,made,way,in,sympathetic,silence,for,the,elsings',carriage,and,after,them,followed,the,little,wicker,pony,cart,of,the,mclure,girls

mrs,meade,was,looking,down,into,her,lap,and,she,did,not,raise,her,head,when,her,name,was,called,but,the,face,of,little,phil,beside,her,was,an,open,book,that,all,might,read
there,there,mother,he,said,helplessly
mrs,meade,looked,up,meeting,melanie's,eyes
he,won't,need,those,boots,now,she,said
oh,darling
cried,melly,beginning,to,sob,as,she,shoved,aunt,pitty,onto,scarlett's,shoulder,and,scrambled,out,of,the,carriage,and,toward,that,of,the,doctor's,wife
mother,you've,still,got,me,said,phil,in,a,forlorn,effort,at,comforting,the,white-faced,woman,beside,him
and,if,you'll,just,let,me,i'll,go,kill,all,the,yank

as,soon,as,you,take,auntie,home,come,over,to,mrs,meade's
captain,butler,can,you,get,word,to,the,doctor
he's,at,the,hospital
the,carriage,moved,off,through,the,dispersing,crowd
some,of,the,women,were,weeping,with,joy,but,most,looked,too,stunned,to,realize,the,heavy,blows,that,had,fallen,upon,them
scarlett,bent,her,head,over,the,blurred,lists,reading,rapidly,to,find,names,of,friends
now,that,ashley,was,safe,she,could,think,of,other,people
oh,how,long,the,list,was
how,heavy,the,toll,from,atlanta,from,all,of,georgia
good,heavens
calvert,raiford,lieutenant
raif
suddenly,she,remembered,the,day,so,long,ago,when,they,had,run,away,together,but,decided,to,come,home,at,nightfall,because,they,were,hungry,and,afraid,of,the,dark
fontaine,joseph,k,private
little,bad-tempered,joe
and,sally,hardly,over,having,her,baby
munroe,lafayette,captain
and,lafe,had,been,engaged,to,cathleen,calvert
poor,cathleen
hers,had,been,a,double,loss,a,brother,and,a,sweetheart
but,sally's,loss,was,greater,a,brother,and,a,husband
oh,this,was,too,terrible
she,was,almost,afraid,to,read,further
aunt,pitty,was,heaving,and,sighing,on,her,shoulder,and,with,small,ceremony,scarlett,pushed,her,over,into,a,corner,of,the,carriage,and,continued,her,reading
surely,surely,there,couldn't,be,three,tarleton,names,on,that,list
perhaps,perhaps,the,hurried,printer,had,repeated,the,name,by,error
but,no
there,they,were
tarleton,brenton,lieutenant
tarleton,stuart,corporal
tarleton,thomas,private
and,boyd,dead,the,first,year,of,the,war,was,buried,god,knew,where,in,virginia
all,the,tarleton,boys,gone
tom,and,the,lazy,long-legged,twins,with,their,love,of,gossip,and,their,absurd,practical,jokes,and,boyd,who,had,the,grace,of,a,dancing,master,and,the,tongue,of,a,wasp
she,could,not,read,any,more
she,could,not,know,if,any,other,of,those,boys,with,whom,she,had,grown,up,danced,flirted,kissed,were,on,that,list
she,wished,that,she,could,cry,do,something,to,ease,the,iron,fingers,that,were,digging,into,her,throat
i'm,sorry,scarlett,said,rhett
she,looked,up,at,him
she,had,forgotten,he,was,still,there
many,of,your,friends
she,nodded,and,struggled,to,speak,about,every,family,in,the,county,and,all,all,three,of,the,tarleton,boys
his,face,was,quiet,almost,somber,and,there,was,no,mocking,in,his,eyes
and,the,end,is,not,yet,he,said
these,are,just,the,first,lists,and,they're,incomplete
there'll,be,a,longer,list,tomorrow
he,lowered,his,voice,so,that,those,in,the,near-by,carriages,could,not,hear
scarlett,general,lee,must,have,lost,the,battle
i,heard,at,headquarters,that,he,had,retreated,back,into,maryland
she,raised,frightened,eyes,to,his,but,her,fear,did,not,spring,from,lee's,defeat
longer,casualty,lists,tomorrow
tomorrow
she,had,not,thought,of,tomorrow,so,happy,was,she,at,first,that,ashley's,name,was,not,on,that,list
tomorrow
why,right,this,minute,he,might,be,dead,and,she,would,not,know,it,until,tomorrow,or,perhaps,a,week,from,tomorrow
oh,rhett,why,do,there,have,to,be,wars
it,would,have,been,so,much,better,for,the,yankees,to,pay,for,the,darkies,or,even,for,us,to,give,them,the,darkies,free,of,charge,than,to,have,this,happen
it,isn't,the,darkies,scarlett
they're,just,the,excuse
there'll,always,be,wars,because,men,love,wars
women,don't,but,men,do,yea,passing,the,love,of,women
his,mouth,twisted,in,his,old,smile,and,the,seriousness,was,gone,from,his,face
he,lifted,his,wide,panama,hat
good-by
i'm,going,to,find,dr,meade
i,imagine,the,irony,of,me,being,the,one,to,tell,him,of,his,son's,death,will,be,lost,on,him,just,now
but,later,he'll,probably,hate,to,think,that,a,speculator,brought,the,news,of,a,hero's,death
scarlett,put,miss,pitty,to,bed,with,a,toddy,left,prissy,and,cookie,in,attendance,and,went,down,the,street,to,the,meade,house
mrs,meade,was,upstairs,with,phil,waiting,her,husband's,return,and,melanie,sat,in,the,parlor,talking,in,a,low,voice,to,a,group,of,sympathetic,neighbors
she,was,busy,with,needle,and,scissors,altering,a,mourning,dress,that,mrs,elsing,had,lent,to,mrs,meade
already,the,house,was,full,of,the,acrid,smell,of,clothes,boiling,in,homemade,black,dye,for,in,the,kitchen,the,sobbing,cook,was,stirring,all,of,mrs,meade's,dresses,in,the,huge,wash,pot
how,is,she
questioned,scarlett,softly
not,a,tear,said,melanie
it's,terrible,when,women,can't,cry
i,don't,know,how,men,stand,things,without,crying
i,guess,it's,because,they're,stronger,and,braver,than,women
she,says,she's,going,to,pennsylvania,by,herself,to,bring,him,home
the,doctor,can't,leave,the,hospital
it,will,be,dreadful,for,her
why,can't,phil,go
she's,afraid,he'll,join,the,army,if,he,gets,out,of,her,sight
you,know,he's,so,big,for,his,age,and,they're,taking,them,at,sixteen,now
one,by,one,the,neighbors,slipped,away,reluctant,to,be,present,when,the,doctor,came,home,and,scarlett,and,melanie,were,left,alone,sewing,in,the,parlor
melanie,looked,sad,but,tranquil,though,tears,dropped,down,on,the,cloth,she,held,in,her,hands
evidently,she,had,not,thought,that,the,battle,might,still,be,going,on,and,ashley,perhaps,dead,at,this,very,moment
with,panic,in,her,heart,scarlett,did,not,know,whether,to,tell,melanie,of,rhett's,words,and,have,the,dubious,comfort,of,her,misery,or,keep,it,to,herself
finally,she,decided,to,remain,quiet
it,would,never,do,for,melanie,to,think,her,too,worried,about,ashley
she,thanked,god,that,everyone,melly,and,pitty,included,had,been,too,engrossed,in,her,own,worries,that,morning,to,notice,her,conduct
after,an,interval,of,silent,sewing,they,heard,sounds,outside,and,peering,through,the,curtains,they,saw,dr,meade,alighting,from,his,horse
his,shoulders,were,sagging,and,his,head,bowed,until,his,gray,beard,spread,out,fanlike,on,his,chest
he,came,slowly,into,the,house,and,laying,down,his,hat,and,bag,kissed,both,the,girls,silently
then,he,went,tiredly,up,the,stairs
in,a,moment,phil,came,down,all,long,legs,and,arms,and,awkwardness
the,two,girls,looked,an,invitation,to,join,them,but,he,went,onto,the,front,porch,and,seating,himself,on,the,top,step,dropped,his,head,on,his,cupped,palm
melly,sighed
he's,mad,because,they,won't,let,him,go,fight,the,yankees
fifteen,years,old
oh,scarlett,it,would,be,heaven,to,have,a,son,like,that
and,have,him,get,killed,said,scarlett,shortly,thinking,of,darcy
it,would,be,better,to,have,a,son,even,if,he,did,get,killed,than,to,never,have,one,said,melanie,and,gulped
you,can't,understand,scarlett,because,you've,got,little,wade,but,i,oh,scarlett,i,want,a,baby,so,bad
i,know,you,think,i'm,horrid,to,say,it,right,out,but,it's,true,and,only,what,every,woman,wants,and,you,know,it
scarlett,restrained,herself,from,sniffing
if,god,should,will,that,ashley,should,be,taken,i,suppose,i,could,bear,it,though,i'd,rather,die,if,he,died
but,god,would,give,me,strength,to,bear,it
but,i,could,not,bear,having,him,dead,and,not,having,not,having,a,child,of,his,to,comfort,me
oh,scarlett,how,lucky,you,are
though,you,lost,charlie,you,have,his,son
and,if,ashley,goes,i'll,have,nothing
scarlett,forgive,me,but,sometimes,i've,been,so,jealous,of,you
jealous,of,me
cried,scarlett,stricken,with,guilt
because,you,have,a,son,and,i,haven't
i've,even,pretended,sometimes,that,wade,was,mine,because,it's,so,awful,not,to,have,a,child
fiddle-dee-dee
said,scarlett,in,relief
she,cast,a,quick,glance,at,the,slight,figure,with,blushing,face,bent,over,the,sewing
melanie,might,want,children,but,she,certainly,did,not,have,the,figure,for,bearing,them
she,was,hardly,taller,than,a,twelve-year-,old,child,her,hips,were,as,narrow,as,a,child's,and,her,breasts,were,very,flat
the,very,thought,of,melanie,having,a,child,was,repellent,to,scarlett
it,brought,up,too,many,thoughts,she,couldn't,bear,thinking
if,melanie,should,have,a,child,of,ashley's,it,would,be,as,though,something,were,taken,from,scarlett,that,was,her,own
do,forgive,me,for,saying,that,about,wade
you,know,i,love,him,so
you,aren't,mad,at,me,are,you
don't,be,silly,said,scarlett,shortly
and,go,out,on,the,porch,and,do,something,for,phil
he's,crying
chapter,xv
the,army,driven,back,into,virginia,went,into,winter,quarters,on,the,rapidan,a,tired,depleted,army,since,the,defeat,at,gettysburg,and,as,the,christmas,season,approached,ashley,came,home,on,furlough
scarlett,seeing,him,for,the,first,time,in,more,than,two,years,was,frightened,by,the,violence,of,her,feelings
when,she,had,stood,in,the,parlor,at,twelve,oaks,and,seen,him,married,to,melanie,she,had,thought,she,could,never,love,him,with,a,more,heartbreaking,intensity,than,she,did,at,that,moment
but,now,she,knew,her,feelings,of,that,long-past,night,were,those,of,a,spoiled,child,thwarted,of,a,toy
now,her,emotions,were,sharpened,by,her,long,dreams,of,him,heightened,by,the,repression,she,had,been,forced,to,put,on,her,tongue
this,ashley,wilkes,in,his,faded,patched,uniform,his,blond,hair,bleached,tow,by,summer,suns,was,a,different,man,from,the,easy-,going,drowsy-eyed,boy,she,had,loved,to,desperation,before,the,war
and,he,was,a,thousand,times,more,thrilling
he,was,bronzed,and,lean,now,where,he,had,once,been,fair,and,slender,and,the,long,golden,mustache,drooping,about,his,mouth,cavalry,style,was,the,last,touch,needed,to,make,him,the,perfect,picture,of,a,soldier
he,stood,with,military,straightness,in,his,old,uniform,his,pistol,in,its,worn,holster,his,battered,scabbard,smartly,slapping,his,high,boots,his,tarnished,spurs,dully,gleaming,major,ashley,wilkes,c,s,a
the,habit,of,command,sat,upon,him,now,a,quiet,air,of,self-reliance,and,authority,and,grim,lines,were,beginning,to,emerge,about,his,mouth
there,was,something,new,and,strange,about,the,square,set,of,his,shoulders,and,the,cool,bright,gleam,of,his,eyes
where,he,had,once,been,lounging,and,indolent,he,was,now,as,alert,as,a,prowling,cat,with,the,tense,alertness,of,one,whose,nerves,are,perpetually,drawn,as,tight,as,the,strings,of,a,violin
in,his,eyes,there,was,a,fagged,haunted,look,and,the,sunburned,skin,was,tight,across,the,fine,bones,of,his,face,her,same,handsome,ashley,yet,so,very,different
scarlett,had,made,her,plans,to,spend,christmas,at,tara,but,after,ashley's,telegram,came,no,power,on,earth,not,even,a,direct,command,from,the,disappointed,ellen,could,drag,her,away,from,atlanta
had,ashley,intended,going,to,twelve,oaks,she,would,have,hastened,to,tara,to,be,near,him,but,he,had,written,his,family,to,join,him,in,atlanta,and,mr,wilkes,and,honey,and,india,were,already,in,town
go,home,to,tara,and,miss,seeing,him,after,two,long,years
miss,the,heart-quickening,sound,of,his,voice,miss,reading,in,his,eyes,that,he,had,not,forgotten,her
never
not,for,all,the,mothers,in,the,world
ashley,came,home,four,days,before,christmas,with,a,group,of,the,county,boys,also,on,furlough,a,sadly,diminished,group,since,gettysburg
cade,calvert,was,among,them,a,thin,gaunt,cade,who,coughed,continually,two,of,the,munroe,boys,bubbling,with,the,excitement,of,their,first,leave,since,1861,and,alex,and,tony,fontaine,splendidly,drunk,boisterous,and,quarrelsome
the,group,had,two,hours,to,wait,between,trains,and,as,it,was,taxing,the,diplomacy,of,the,sober,members,of,the,party,to,keep,the,fontaines,from,fighting,each,other,and,perfect,strangers,in,the,depot,ashley,brought,them,all,home,to,aunt,pittypat's
you'd,think,they'd,had,enough,fighting,in,virginia,said,cade,bitterly,as,he,watched,the,two,bristle,like,game-cocks,over,who,should,be,the,first,to,kiss,the,fluttering,and,flattered,aunt,pitty
but,no
they've,been,drunk,and,picking,fights,ever,since,we,got,to,richmond
the,provost,guard,took,them,up,there,and,if,it,hadn't,been,for,ashley's,slick,tongue,they'd,have,spent,christmas,in,jail
but,scarlett,hardly,heard,a,word,he,said,so,enraptured,was,she,at,being,in,the,same,room,with,ashley,again
how,could,she,have,thought,during,these,two,years,that,other,men,were,nice,or,handsome,or,exciting
how,could,she,have,even,endured,hearing,them,make,love,to,her,when,ashley,was,in,the,world
he,was,home,again,separated,from,her,only,by,the,width,of,the,parlor,rug,and,it,took,all,her,strength,not,to,dissolve,in,happy,tears,every,time,she,looked,at,him,sitting,there,on,the,sofa,with,melly,on,one,side,and,india,on,the,other,and,honey,hanging,over,his,shoulder
if,only,she,had,the,right,to,sit,there,beside,him,her,arm,through,his
if,only,she,could,pat,his,sleeve,every,few,minutes,to,make,sure,he,was,really,there,hold,his,hand,and,use,his,handkerchief,to,wipe,away,her,tears,of,joy
for,melanie,was,doing,all,these,things,unashamedly
too,happy,to,be,shy,and,reserved,she,hung,on,her,husband's,arm,and,adored,him,openly,with,her,eyes,with,her,smiles,her,tears
and,scarlett,was,too,happy,to,resent,this,too,glad,to,be,jealous
ashley,was,home,at,last
now,and,then,she,put,her,hand,up,to,her,cheek,where,he,had,kissed,her,and,felt,again,the,thrill,of,his,lips,and,smiled,at,him
he,had,not,kissed,her,first,of,course
melly,had,hurled,herself,into,his,arms,crying,incoherently,holding,him,as,though,she,would,never,let,him,go
and,then,india,and,honey,had,hugged,him,fairly,tearing,him,from,melanie's,arms
then,he,had,kissed,his,father,with,a,dignified,affectionate,embrace,that,showed,the,strong,quiet,feeling,that,lay,between,them
and,then,aunt,pitty,who,was,jumping,up,and,down,on,her,inadequate,little,feet,with,excitement
finally,he,turned,to,her,surrounded,by,all,the,boys,who,were,claiming,their,kisses,and,said,oh,scarlett
you,pretty,pretty,thing
and,kissed,her,on,the,cheek
with,that,kiss,everything,she,had,intended,to,say,in,welcome,took,wings
not,until,hours,later,did,she,recall,that,he,had,not,kissed,her,on,the,lips
then,she,wondered,feverishly,if,he,would,have,done,it,had,she,met,him,alone,bending,his,tall,body,over,hers,pulling,her,up,on,tiptoe,holding,her,for,a,long,long,time
and,because,it,made,her,happy,to,think,so,she,believed,that,he,would
but,there,would,be,time,for,all,things,a,whole,week
surely,she,could,maneuver,to,get,him,alone,and,say,do,you,remember,those,rides,we,used,to,take,down,our,secret,bridle,paths
do,you,remember,how,the,moon,looked,that,night,when,we,sat,on,the,steps,at,tara,and,you,quoted,that,poem
good,heavens
what,was,the,name,of,that,poem,anyway
do,you,remember,that,afternoon,when,i,sprained,my,ankle,and,you,carried,me,home,in,your,arms,in,the,twilight
oh,there,were,so,many,things,she,would,preface,with,do,you,remember
so,many,dear,memories,that,would,bring,back,to,him,those,lovely,days,when,they,roamed,the,county,like,care-free,children,so,many,things,that,would,call,to,mind,the,days,before,melanie,hamilton,entered,on,the,scene
and,while,they,talked,she,could,perhaps,read,in,his,eyes,some,quickening,of,emotion,some,hint,that,behind,the,barrier,of,husbandly,affection,for,melanie,he,still,cared,cared,as,passionately,as,on,that,day,of,the,barbecue,when,he,burst,forth,with,the,truth
it,did,not,occur,to,her,to,plan,just,what,they,would,do,if,ashley,should,declare,his,love,for,her,in,unmistakable,words
it,would,be,enough,to,know,that,he,did,care
yes,she,could,wait,could,let,melanie,have,her,happy,hour,of,squeezing,his,arm,and,crying
her,time,would,come
after,all,what,did,a,girl,like,melanie,know,of,love
darling,you,look,like,a,ragamuffin,said,melanie,when,the,first,excitement,of,homecoming,was,over
who,did,mend,your,uniform,and,why,did,they,use,blue,patches
i,thought,i,looked,perfectly,dashing,said,ashley,considering,his,appearance
just,compare,me,with,those,rag-tags,over,there,and,you'll,appreciate,me,more
mose,mended,the,uniform,and,i,thought,he,did,very,well,considering,that,he'd,never,had,a,needle,in,his,hand,before,the,war
about,the,blue,cloth,when,it,comes,to,a,choice,between,having,holes,in,your,britches,or,patching,them,with,pieces,of,a,captured,yankee,uniform,well,there,just,isn't,any,choice
and,as,for,looking,like,a,ragamuffin,you,should,thank,your,stars,your,husband,didn't,come,home,barefooted
last,week,my,old,boots,wore,completely,out,and,i,would,have,come,home,with,sacks,tied,on,my,feet,if,we,hadn't,had,the,good,luck,to,shoot,two,yankee,scouts
the,boots,of,one,of,them,fitted,me,perfectly
he,stretched,out,his,long,legs,in,their,scarred,high,boots,for,them,to,admire
and,the,boots,of,the,other,scout,didn't,fit,me,said,cade
they're,two,sizes,too,small,and,they're,killing,me,this,minute
but,i'm,going,home,in,style,just,the,same
and,the,selfish,swine,won't,give,them,to,either,of,us,said,tony
and,they'd,fit,our,small,aristocratic,fontaine,feet,perfectly
hell's,afire,i'm,ashamed,to,face,mother,in,these,brogans
before,the,war,she,wouldn't,have,let,one,of,our,darkies,wear,them
don't,worry,said,alex,eyeing,cade's,boots
we'll,take,them,off,of,him,on,the,train,going,home
i,don't,mind,facing,mother,but,i'm,da,i,mean,i,don't,intend,for,dimity,munroe,to,see,my,toes,sticking,out
why,they're,my,boots
i,claimed,them,first,said,tony,beginning,to,scowl,at,his,brother,and,melanie,fluttering,with,fear,at,the,possibility,of,one,of,the,famous,fontaine,quarrels,interposed,and,made,peace
i,had,a,full,beard,to,show,you,girls,said,ashley,ruefully,rubbing,his,face,where,half-healed,razor,nicks,still,showed
it,was,a,beautiful,beard,and,if,i,do,say,it,myself,neither,jeb,stuart,nor,nathan,bedford,forrest,had,a,handsomer,one
but,when,we,got,to,richmond,those,two,scoundrels,indicating,the,fontaines,decided,that,as,they,were,shaving,their,beards,mine,should,come,off,too
they,got,me,down,and,shaved,me,and,it's,a,wonder,my,head,didn't,come,off,along,with,the,beard
it,was,only,by,the,intervention,of,evan,and,cade,that,my,mustache,was,saved
snakes,mrs,wilkes
you,ought,to,thank,me
you'd,never,have,recognized,him,and,wouldn't,have,let,him,in,the,door,said,alex
we,did,it,to,show,our,appreciation,of,his,talking,the,provost,guard,out,of,putting,us,in,jail
if,you,say,the,word,we'll,take,the,mustache,off,for,you,right,now
oh,no,thank,you
said,melanie,hastily,clutching,ashley,in,a,frightened,way,for,the,two,swarthy,little,men,looked,capable,of,any,violence
i,think,it's,perfectly,lovely
that's,love,said,the,fontaines,nodding,gravely,at,each,other
when,ashley,went,into,the,cold,to,see,the,boys,off,to,the,depot,in,aunt,pitty's,carriage,melanie,caught,scarlett's,arm
isn't,his,uniform,dreadful
won't,my,coat,be,a,surprise
oh,if,only,i,had,enough,cloth,for,britches,too
that,coat,for,ashley,was,a,sore,subject,with,scarlett,for,she,wished,so,ardently,that,she,and,not,melanie,were,bestowing,it,as,a,christmas,gift
gray,wool,for,uniforms,was,now,almost,literally,more,priceless,than,rubies,and,ashley,was,wearing,the,familiar,homespun
even,butternut,was,now,none,too,plentiful,and,many,of,the,soldiers,were,dressed,in,captured,yankee,uniforms,which,had,been,turned,a,dark-brown,color,with,walnut-shell,dye
but,melanie,by,rare,luck,had,come,into,possession,of,enough,gray,broadcloth,to,make,a,coat,a,rather,short,coat,but,a,coat,just,the,same
she,had,nursed,a,charleston,boy,in,the,hospital,and,when,he,died,had,clipped,a,lock,of,his,hair,and,sent,it,to,his,mother,along,with,the,scant,contents,of,his,pockets,and,a,comforting,account,of,his,last,hours,which,made,no,mention,of,the,torment,in,which,he,died
a,correspondence,had,sprung,up,between,them,and,learning,that,melanie,had,a,husband,at,the,front,the,mother,had,sent,her,the,length,of,gray,cloth,and,brass,buttons,which,she,had,bought,for,her,dead,son
it,was,a,beautiful,piece,of,material,thick,and,warm,and,with,a,dull,sheen,to,it,undoubtedly,blockade,goods,and,undoubtedly,very,expensive
it,was,now,in,the,hands,of,the,tailor,and,melanie,was,hurrying,him,to,have,it,ready,by,christmas,morning
scarlett,would,have,given,anything,to,be,able,to,provide,the,rest,of,the,uniform,but,the,necessary,materials,were,simply,not,to,be,had,in,atlanta
she,had,a,christmas,present,for,ashley,but,it,paled,in,insignificance,beside,the,glory,of,melanie's,gray,coat
it,was,a,small,housewife,made,of,flannel,containing,the,whole,precious,pack,of,needles,rhett,had,brought,her,from,nassau,three,of,her,linen,handkerchiefs,obtained,from,the,same,source,two,spools,of,thread,and,a,small,pair,of,scissors
but,she,wanted,to,give,him,something,more,personal,something,a,wife,could,give,a,husband,a,shirt,a,pair,of,gauntlets,a,hat
oh,yes,a,hat,by,all,means
that,little,flat-topped,forage,cap,ashley,was,wearing,looked,ridiculous
scarlett,had,always,hated,them
what,if,stonewall,jackson,had,worn,one,in,preference,to,a,slouch,felt
that,didn't,make,them,any,more,dignified,looking
but,the,only,hats,obtainable,in,atlanta,were,crudely,made,wool,hats,and,they,were,tackier,than,the,monkey-hat,forage,caps
when,she,thought,of,hats,she,thought,of,rhett,butler
he,had,so,many,hats,wide,panamas,for,summer,tall,beavers,for,formal,occasions,hunting,hats,slouch,hats,of,tan,and,black,and,blue
what,need,had,he,for,so,many,when,her,darling,ashley,rode,in,the,rain,with,moisture,dripping,down,his,collar,from,the,back,of,his,cap
i'll,make,rhett,give,me,that,new,black,felt,of,his,she,decided
and,i'll,put,a,gray,ribbon,around,the,brim,and,sew,ashley's,wreath,on,it,and,it,will,look,lovely
she,paused,and,thought,it,might,be,difficult,to,get,the,hat,without,some,explanation
she,simply,could,not,tell,rhett,she,wanted,it,for,ashley
he,would,raise,his,brows,in,that,nasty,way,he,always,had,when,she,even,mentioned,ashley's,name,and,like,as,not,would,refuse,to,give,her,the,hat
well,she'd,make,up,some,pitiful,story,about,a,soldier,in,the,hospital,who,needed,it,and,rhett,need,never,know,the,truth
all,that,afternoon,she,maneuvered,to,be,alone,with,ashley,even,for,a,few,minutes,but,melanie,was,beside,him,constantly,and,india,and,honey,their,pale,lashless,eyes,glowing,followed,him,about,the,house
even,john,wilkes,visibly,proud,of,his,son,had,no,opportunity,for,quiet,conversation,with,him
it,was,the,same,at,supper,where,they,all,plied,him,with,questions,about,the,war
the,war
who,cared,about,the,war
scarlett,didn't,think,ashley,cared,very,much,for,that,subject,either
he,talked,at,length,laughed,frequently,and,dominated,the,conversation,more,completely,than,she,had,ever,seen,him,do,before,but,he,seemed,to,say,very,little
he,told,them,jokes,and,funny,stories,about,friends,talked,gaily,about,makeshifts,making,light,of,hunger,and,long,marches,in,the,rain,and,described,in,detail,how,general,lee,had,looked,when,he,rode,by,on,the,retreat,from,gettysburg,and,questioned,gentlemen,are,you,georgia,troops
well,we,can't,get,along,without,you,georgians
it,seemed,to,scarlett,that,he,was,talking,fervishly,to,keep,them,from,asking,questions,he,did,not,want,to,answer
when,she,saw,his,eyes,falter,and,drop,before,the,long,troubled,gaze,of,his,father,a,faint,worry,and,bewilderment,rose,in,her,as,to,what,was,hidden,in,ashley's,heart
but,it,soon,passed,for,there,was,no,room,in,her,mind,for,anything,except,a,radiant,happiness,and,a,driving,desire,to,be,alone,with,him
that,radiance,lasted,until,everyone,in,the,circle,about,the,open,fire,began,to,yawn,and,mr,wilkes,and,the,girls,took,their,departure,for,the,hotel
then,as,ashley,and,melanie,and,pittypat,and,scarlett,mounted,the,stairs,lighted,by,uncle,peter,a,chill,fell,on,her,spirit
until,that,moment,when,they,stood,in,the,upstairs,hall,ashley,had,been,hers,only,hers,even,if,she,had,not,had,a,private,word,with,him,that,whole,afternoon
but,now,as,she,said,good,night,she,saw,that,melanie's,cheeks,were,suddenly,crimson,and,she,was,trembling
her,eyes,were,on,the,carpet,and,though,she,seemed,overcome,with,some,frightening,emotion,she,seemed,shyly,happy
melanie,did,not,even,look,up,when,ashley,opened,the,bedroom,door,but,sped,inside
ashley,said,good,night,abruptly,and,he,did,not,meet,scarlett's,eyes,either
the,door,closed,behind,them,leaving,scarlett,open,mouthed,and,suddenly,desolate
ashley,was,no,longer,hers
he,was,melanie's
and,as,long,as,melanie,lived,she,could,go,into,rooms,with,ashley,and,close,the,door,and,close,out,the,rest,of,the,world
now,ashley,was,going,away,back,to,virginia,back,to,the,long,marches,in,the,sleet,to,hungry,bivouacs,in,the,snow,to,pain,and,hardship,and,to,the,risk,of,all,the,bright,beauty,of,his,golden,head,and,proud,slender,body,being,blotted,out,in,an,instant,like,an,ant,beneath,a,careless,heel
the,past,week,with,its,shimmering,dreamlike,beauty,its,crowded,hours,of,happiness,was,gone
the,week,had,passed,swiftly,like,a,dream,a,dream,fragrant,with,the,smell,of,pine,boughs,and,christmas,trees,bright,with,little,candles,and,home-made,tinsel,a,dream,where,minutes,flew,as,rapidly,as,heartbeats
such,a,breathless,week,when,something,within,her,drove,scarlett,with,mingled,pain,and,pleasure,to,pack,and,cram,every,minute,with,incidents,to,remember,after,he,was,gone,happenings,which,she,could,examine,at,leisure,in,the,long,months,ahead,extracting,every,morsel,of,comfort,from,them,dance,sing,laugh,fetch,and,carry,for,ashley,anticipate,his,wants,smile,when,he,smiles,be,silent,when,he,talks,follow,him,with,your,eyes,so,that,each,line,of,his,erect,body,each,lift,of,his,eyebrows,each,quirk,of,his,mouth,will,be,indelibly,printed,on,your,mind,for,a,week,goes,by,so,fast,and,the,war,goes,on,forever
she,sat,on,the,divan,in,the,parlor,holding,her,going-away,gift,for,him,in,her,lap,waiting,while,he,said,good-by,to,melanie,praying,that,when,he,did,come,down,the,stairs,he,would,be,alone,and,she,might,be,granted,by,heaven,a,few,moments,alone,with,him
her,ears,strained,for,sounds,from,upstairs,but,the,house,was,oddly,still,so,still,that,even,the,sound,of,her,breathing,seemed,loud
aunt,pittypat,was,crying,into,her,pillows,in,her,room,for,ashley,had,told,her,good-by,half,an,hour,before
no,sounds,of,murmuring,voices,or,of,tears,came,from,behind,the,closed,door,of,melanie's,bedroom
it,seemed,to,scarlett,that,he,had,been,in,that,room,for,hours,and,she,resented,bitterly,each,moment,that,he,stayed,saying,good-by,to,his,wife,for,the,moments,were,slipping,by,so,fast,and,his,time,was,so,short
she,thought,of,all,the,things,she,had,intended,to,say,to,him,during,this,week
but,there,had,been,no,opportunity,to,say,them,and,she,knew,now,that,perhaps,she,would,never,have,the,chance,to,say,them
such,foolish,little,things,some,of,them,ashley,you,will,be,careful,won't,you
please,don't,get,your,feet,wet
you,take,cold,so,easily
don't,forget,to,put,a,newspaper,across,your,chest,under,your,shirt
it,keeps,out,the,wind,so,well
but,there,were,other,things,more,important,things,she,had,wanted,to,say,much,more,important,things,she,had,wanted,to,hear,him,say,things,she,had,wanted,to,read,in,his,eyes,even,if,he,did,not,speak,them
so,many,things,to,say,and,now,there,was,no,time
even,the,few,minutes,that,remained,might,be,snatched,away,from,her,if,melanie,followed,him,to,the,door,to,the,carriage,block
why,hadn't,she,made,the,opportunity,during,this,last,week
but,always,melanie,was,at,his,side,her,eyes,caressing,him,adoringly,always,friends,and,neighbors,and,relatives,were,in,the,house,and,from,morning,till,night,ashley,was,never,alone
then,at,night,the,door,of,the,bedroom,closed,and,he,was,alone,with,melanie
never,once,during,these,last,days,had,he,betrayed,to,scarlett,by,one,look,one,word,anything,but,the,affection,a,brother,might,show,a,sister,or,a,friend,a,lifelong,friend
she,could,not,let,him,go,away,perhaps,forever,without,knowing,whether,he,still,loved,her
then,even,if,he,died,she,could,nurse,the,warm,comfort,of,his,secret,love,to,the,end,of,her,days
after,what,seemed,an,eternity,of,waiting,she,heard,the,sound,of,his,boots,in,the,bedroom,above,and,the,door,opening,and,closing
she,heard,him,coming,down,the,steps
alone
thank,god,for,that
melanie,must,be,too,overcome,by,the,grief,of,parting,to,leave,her,room
now,she,would,have,him,for,herself,for,a,few,precious,minutes
he,came,down,the,steps,slowly,his,spurs,clinking,and,she,could,hear,the,slap-slap,of,his,saber,against,his,high,boots
when,he,came,into,the,parlor,his,eyes,were,somber
he,was,trying,to,smile,but,his,face,was,as,white,and,drawn,as,a,man,bleeding,from,an,internal,wound
she,rose,as,he,entered,thinking,with,proprietary,pride,that,he,was,the,handsomest,soldier,she,had,ever,seen
his,long,holster,and,belt,glistened,and,his,silver,spurs,and,scabbard,gleamed,from,the,industrious,polishing,uncle,peter,had,given,them
his,new,coat,did,not,fit,very,well,for,the,tailor,had,been,hurried,and,some,of,the,seams,were,awry
the,bright,new,sheen,of,the,gray,coat,was,sadly,at,variance,with,the,worn,and,patched,butternut,trousers,and,the,scarred,boots,but,if,he,had,been,clothed,in,silver,armor,he,could,not,have,looked,more,the,shining,knight,to,her
ashley,she,begged,abruptly,may,i,go,to,the,train,with,you
please,don't
father,and,the,girls,will,be,there
and,anyway,i'd,rather,remember,you,saying,good-by,to,me,here,than,shivering,at,the,depot
there's,so,much,to,memories
instantly,she,abandoned,her,plan
if,india,and,honey,who,disliked,her,so,much,were,to,be,present,at,the,leave,taking,she,would,have,no,chance,for,a,private,word
then,i,won't,go,she,said
see,ashley
i've,another,present,for,you
a,little,shy,now,that,the,time,had,come,to,give,it,to,him,she,unrolled,the,package
it,was,a,long,yellow,sash,made,of,thick,china,silk,and,edged,with,heavy,fringe
rhett,butler,had,brought,her,a,yellow,shawl,from,havana,several,months,before,a,shawl,gaudily,embroidered,with,birds,and,flowers,in,magenta,and,blue
during,this,last,week,she,had,patiently,picked,out,all,the,embroidery,and,cut,up,the,square,of,silk,and,stitched,it,into,a,sash,length
scarlett,it's,beautiful
did,you,make,it,yourself
then,i'll,value,it,all,the,more
put,it,on,me,my,dear
the,boys,will,be,green,with,envy,when,they,see,me,in,the,glory,of,my,new,coat,and,sash
she,wrapped,the,bright,lengths,about,his,slender,waist,above,his,belt,and,tied,the,ends,in,a,lover's,knot
melanie,might,have,given,him,his,new,coat,but,this,sash,was,her,gift,her,own,secret,guerdon,for,him,to,wear,into,battle,something,that,would,make,him,remember,her,every,time,he,looked,at,it
she,stood,back,and,viewed,him,with,pride,thinking,that,even,jeb,stuart,with,his,flaunting,sash,and,plume,could,not,look,so,dashing,as,her,cavalier
it's,beautiful,he,repeated,fingering,the,fringe
but,i,know,you've,cut,up,a,dress,or,a,shawl,to,make,it
you,shouldn't,have,done,it,scarlett
pretty,things,are,too,hard,to,get,these,days
oh,ashley,i'd
she,had,started,to,say,i'd,cut,up,my,heart,for,you,to,wear,if,you,wanted,it,but,she,finished,i'd,do,anything,for,you
would,you
he,questioned,and,some,of,the,somberness,lifted,from,his,face
then,there's,something,you,can,do,for,me,scarlett,something,that,will,make,my,mind,easier,when,i'm,away
what,is,it
she,asked,joyfully,ready,to,promise,prodigies
scarlett,will,you,look,after,melanie,for,me
look,after,melly
her,heart,sank,with,bitter,disappointment
so,this,was,something,beautiful,something,spectacular
and,then,anger,flared
this,moment,was,her,moment,with,ashley,hers,alone
and,yet,though,melanie,was,absent,her,pale,shadow,lay,between,them
how,could,he,bring,up,her,name,in,their,moment,of,farewell
how,could,he,ask,such,a,thing,of,her
he,did,not,notice,the,disappointment,on,her,face
as,of,old,his,eyes,were,looking,through,her,and,beyond,her,at,something,else,not,seeing,her,at,all
yes,keep,an,eye,on,her,take,care,of,her
she's,so,frail,and,she,doesn't,realize,it
she'll,wear,herself,out,nursing,and,sewing
and,she's,so,gentle,and,timid
except,for,aunt,pittypat,and,uncle,henry,and,you,she,hasn't,a,close,relative,in,the,world,except,the,burrs,in,macon,and,they're,third,cousins
and,aunt,pitty,scarlett,you,know,she's,like,a,child
and,uncle,henry,is,an,old,man
melanie,loves,you,so,much,not,just,because,you,were,charlie's,wife,but,because,well,because,you're,you,and,she,loves,you,like,a,sister
scarlett,i,have,nightmares,when,i,think,what,might,happen,to,her,if,i,were,killed,and,she,had,no,one,to,turn,to
will,you,promise
she,did,not,even,hear,his,last,request,so,terrified,was,she,by,those,ill-omened,words,if,i,were,killed
every,day,she,had,read,the,casualty,lists,read,them,with,her,heart,in,her,throat,knowing,that,the,world,would,end,if,anything,should,happen,to,him
but,always,always,she,had,an,inner,feeling,that,even,if,the,confederate,army,were,entirely,wiped,out,ashley,would,be,spared
and,now,he,had,spoken,the,frightful,words
goose,bumps,came,out,all,over,her,and,fear,swamped,her,a,superstitious,fear,she,could,not,combat,with,reason
she,was,irish,enough,to,believe,in,second,sight,especially,where,death,premonitions,were,concerned,and,in,his,wide,gray,eyes,she,saw,some,deep,sadness,which,she,could,only,interpret,as,that,of,a,man,who,has,felt,the,cold,finger,on,his,shoulder,has,heard,the,wail,of,the,banshee
you,mustn't,say,it
you,mustn't,even,think,it
it's,bad,luck,to,speak,of,death
oh,say,a,prayer,quickly
you,say,it,for,me,and,light,some,candles,too,he,said,smiling,at,the,frightened,urgency,in,her,voice
but,she,could,not,answer,so,stricken,was,she,by,the,pictures,her,mind,was,drawing,ashley,lying,dead,in,the,snows,of,virginia,so,far,away,from,her
he,went,on,speaking,and,there,was,a,quality,in,his,voice,a,sadness,a,resignation,that,increased,her,fear,until,every,vestige,of,anger,and,disappointment,was,blotted,out
i'm,asking,you,for,this,reason,scarlett
i,cannot,tell,what,will,happen,to,me,or,what,will,happen,to,any,of,us
but,when,the,end,comes,i,shall,be,far,away,from,here,even,if,i,am,alive,too,far,away,to,look,out,for,melanie
the,the,end
the,end,of,the,war,and,the,end,of,the,world
but,ashley,surely,you,can't,think,the,yankees,will,beat,us
all,this,week,you've,talked,about,how,strong,general,lee
all,this,week,i've,talked,lies,like,all,men,talk,when,they're,on,furlough
why,should,i,frighten,melanie,and,aunt,pitty,before,there's,any,need,for,them,to,be,frightened
yes,scarlett,i,think,the,yankees,have,us
gettysburg,was,the,beginning,of,the,end
the,people,back,home,don't,know,it,yet
they,can't,realize,how,things,stand,with,us,but,scarlett,some,of,my,men,are,barefooted,now,and,the,snow,is,deep,in,virginia
and,when,i,see,their,poor,frozen,feet,wrapped,in,rags,and,old,sacks,and,i,see,the,blood,prints,they,leave,in,the,snow,and,know,that,i've,got,a,whole,pair,of,boots,well,i,feel,like,i,should,give,mine,away,and,be,barefooted,too
oh,ashley,promise,me,you,won't,give,them,away
when,i,see,things,like,that,and,then,look,at,the,yankees,then,i,see,the,end,of,everything
why,scarlett,the,yankees,are,buying,soldiers,from,europe,by,the,thousands
most,of,the,prisoners,we've,taken,recently,can't,even,speak,english
they're,germans,and,poles,and,wild,irishmen,who,talk,gaelic
but,when,we,lose,a,man,he,can't,be,replaced
when,our,shoes,wear,out,there,are,no,more,shoes
we're,bottled,up,scarlett
and,we,can't,fight,the,whole,world
she,thought,wildly,let,the,whole,confederacy,crumble,in,the,dust
let,the,world,end,but,you,must,not,die
i,couldn't,live,if,you,were,dead
i,hope,you,will,not,repeat,what,i,have,said,scarlett
i,do,not,want,to,alarm,the,others
and,my,dear,i,would,not,have,alarmed,you,by,saying,these,things,were,it,not,that,i,had,to,explain,why,i,ask,you,to,look,after,melanie
she's,so,frail,and,weak,and,you're,so,strong,scarlett
it,will,be,a,comfort,to,me,to,know,that,you,are,together,if,anything,happens,to,me
you,will,promise,won't,you
oh,yes
she,cried,for,at,that,moment,seeing,death,at,his,elbow,she,would,have,promised,anything
ashley,ashley
i,can't,let,you,go,away
i,simply,can't,be,brave,about,it
you,must,be,brave,he,said,and,his,voice,changed,subtly
it,was,resonant,deeper,and,his,words,fell,swiftly,as,though,hurried,with,some,inner,urgency
you,must,be,brave
for,how,else,can,i,stand,it
her,eyes,sought,his,face,quickly,and,with,joy,wondering,if,he,meant,that,leaving,her,was,breaking,his,heart,even,as,it,was,breaking,hers
his,face,was,as,drawn,as,when,he,came,down,from,bidding,melanie,good-by,but,she,could,read,nothing,in,his,eyes
he,leaned,down,took,her,face,in,his,hands,and,kissed,her,lightly,on,the,forehead
scarlett
scarlett
you,are,so,fine,and,strong,and,good
so,beautiful,not,just,your,sweet,face,my,dear,but,all,of,you,your,body,and,your,mind,and,your,soul
oh,ashley,she,whispered,happily,thrilling,at,his,words,and,his,touch,on,her,face
nobody,else,but,you,ever
i,like,to,think,that,perhaps,i,know,you,better,than,most,people,and,that,i,can,see,beautiful,things,buried,deep,in,you,that,others,are,too,careless,and,too,hurried,to,notice
he,stopped,speaking,and,his,hands,dropped,from,her,face,but,his,eyes,still,clung,to,her,eyes
she,waited,a,moment,breathless,for,him,to,continue,a-tiptoe,to,hear,him,say,the,magic,three,words
but,they,did,not,come
she,searched,his,face,frantically,her,lips,quivering,for,she,saw,he,had,finished,speaking
this,second,blighting,of,her,hopes,was,more,than,heart,could,bear,and,she,cried,oh
in,a,childish,whisper,and,sat,down,tears,stinging,her,eyes
then,she,heard,an,ominous,sound,in,the,driveway,outside,the,window,a,sound,that,brought,home,to,her,even,more,sharply,the,imminence,of,ashley's,departure
a,pagan,hearing,the,lapping,of,the,waters,around,charon's,boat,could,not,have,felt,more,desolate
uncle,peter,muffled,in,a,quilt,was,bringing,out,the,carriage,to,take,ashley,to,the,train
ashley,said,good-by,very,softly,caught,up,from,the,table,the,wide,felt,hat,she,had,inveigled,from,rhett,and,walked,into,the,dark,front,hall
his,hand,on,the,doorknob,he,turned,and,looked,at,her,a,long,desperate,look,as,if,he,wanted,to,carry,away,with,him,every,detail,of,her,face,and,figure
through,a,blinding,mist,of,tears,she,saw,his,face,and,with,a,strangling,pain,in,her,throat,she,knew,that,he,was,going,away,away,from,her,care,away,from,the,safe,haven,of,this,house,and,out,of,her,life,perhaps,forever,without,having,spoken,the,words,she,so,yearned,to,hear
time,was,going,by,like,a,mill,race,and,now,it,was,too,late
she,ran,stumbling,across,the,parlor,and,into,the,hall,and,clutched,the,ends,of,his,sash
kiss,me,she,whispered
kiss,me,good-by
his,arms,went,around,her,gently,and,he,bent,his,head,to,her,face
at,the,first,touch,of,his,lips,on,hers,her,arms,were,about,his,neck,in,a,strangling,grip
for,a,fleeting,immeasurable,instant,he,pressed,her,body,close,to,his
then,she,felt,a,sudden,tensing,of,all,his,muscles
swiftly,he,dropped,the,hat,to,the,floor,and,reaching,up,detached,her,arms,from,his,neck
no,scarlett,no,he,said,in,a,low,voice,holding,her,crossed,wrists,in,a,grip,that,hurt
i,love,you,she,said,choking
i've,always,loved,you
i've,never,loved,anybody,else
i,just,married,charlie,to,to,try,to,hurt,you
oh,ashley,i,love,you,so,much,i'd,walk,every,step,of,the,way,to,virginia,just,to,be,near,you
and,i'd,cook,for,you,and,polish,your,boots,and,groom,your,horse,ashley,say,you,love,me
i'll,live,on,it,for,the,rest,of,my,life
he,bent,suddenly,to,retrieve,his,hat,and,she,had,one,glimpse,of,his,face
it,was,the,unhappiest,face,she,was,ever,to,see,a,face,from,which,all,aloofness,had,fled
written,on,it,were,his,love,for,and,joy,that,she,loved,him,but,battling,them,both,were,shame,and,despair
good-by,he,said,hoarsely
the,door,clicked,open,and,a,gust,of,cold,wind,swept,the,house,fluttering,the,curtains
scarlett,shivered,as,she,watched,him,run,down,the,walk,to,the,carriage,his,saber,glinting,in,the,feeble,winter,sunlight,the,fringe,of,his,sash,dancing,jauntily
chapter,xvi
january,and,february,of,1864,passed,full,of,cold,rains,and,wild,winds,clouded,by,pervasive,gloom,and,depression
in,addition,to,the,defeats,at,gettysburg,and,vicksburg,the,center,of,the,southern,line,had,caved
after,hard,fighting,nearly,all,of,tennessee,was,now,held,by,the,union,troops
but,even,with,this,loss,on,the,top,of,the,others,the,south's,spirit,was,not,broken
true,grim,determination,had,taken,the,place,of,high-hearted,hopes,but,people,could,still,find,a,silver,lining,in,the,cloud
for,one,thing,the,yankees,had,been,stoutly,repulsed,in,september,when,they,had,tried,to,follow,up,their,victories,in,tennessee,by,an,advance,into,georgia
here,in,the,northwesternmost,corner,of,the,state,at,chickamauga,serious,fighting,had,occurred,on,georgia,soil,for,the,first,time,since,the,war,began
the,yankees,had,taken,chattanooga,and,then,had,marched,through,the,mountain,passes,into,georgia,but,they,had,been,driven,back,with,heavy,losses
atlanta,and,its,railroads,had,played,a,big,part,in,making,chickamauga,a,great,victory,for,the,south
over,the,railroads,that,led,down,from,virginia,to,atlanta,and,then,northward,to,tennessee,general,longstreet's,corps,had,been,rushed,to,the,scene,of,the,battle
along,the,entire,route,of,several,hundred,miles,the,tracks,had,been,cleared,and,all,the,available,rolling,stock,in,the,southeast,had,been,assembled,for,the,movement
atlanta,had,watched,while,train,after,train,rolled,through,the,town,hour,after,hour,passenger,coaches,box,cars,flat,cars,filled,with,shouting,men
they,had,come,without,food,or,sleep,without,their,horses,ambulances,or,supply,trains,and,without,waiting,for,the,rest,they,had,leaped,from,the,trains,and,into,the,battle
and,the,yankees,had,been,driven,out,of,georgia,back,into,tennessee
it,was,the,greatest,feat,of,the,war,and,atlanta,took,pride,and,personal,satisfaction,in,the,thought,that,its,railroads,had,made,the,victory,possible
but,the,south,had,needed,the,cheering,news,from,chickamauga,to,strengthen,its,morale,through,the,winter
no,one,denied,now,that,the,yankees,were,good,fighters,and,at,last,they,had,good,generals
grant,was,a,butcher,who,did,not,care,how,many,men,he,slaughtered,for,a,victory,but,victory,he,would,have
sheridan,was,a,name,to,bring,dread,to,southern,hearts
and,then,there,was,a,man,named,sherman,who,was,being,mentioned,more,and,more,often
he,had,risen,to,prominence,in,the,campaigns,in,tennessee,and,the,west,and,his,reputation,as,a,determined,and,ruthless,fighter,was,growing
none,of,them,of,course,compared,with,general,lee
faith,in,the,general,and,the,army,was,still,strong
confidence,in,ultimate,victory,never,wavered
but,the,war,was,dragging,out,so,long
there,were,so,many,dead,so,many,wounded,and,maimed,for,life,so,many,widowed,so,many,orphaned
and,there,was,still,a,long,struggle,ahead,which,meant,more,dead,more,wounded,more,widows,and,orphans
to,make,matters,worse,a,vague,distrust,of,those,in,high,places,had,begun,to,creep,over,the,civilian,population
many,newspapers,were,outspoken,in,their,denunciation,of,president,davis,himself,and,the,manner,in,which,he,prosecuted,the,war
there,were,dissensions,within,the,confederate,cabinet,disagreements,between,president,davis,and,his,generals
the,currency,was,falling,rapidly
shoes,and,clothing,for,the,army,were,scarce,ordnance,supplies,and,drugs,were,scarcer
the,railroads,needed,new,cars,to,take,the,place,of,old,ones,and,new,iron,rails,to,replace,those,torn,up,by,the,yankees
the,generals,in,the,field,were,crying,out,for,fresh,troops,and,there,were,fewer,and,fewer,fresh,troops,to,be,had
worst,of,all,some,of,the,state,governors,governor,brown,of,georgia,among,them,were,refusing,to,send,state,militia,troops,and,arms,out,of,their,borders
there,were,thousands,of,able-bodied,men,in,the,state,troops,for,whom,the,army,was,frantic,but,the,government,pleaded,for,them,in,vain
with,the,new,fall,of,currency,prices,soared,again
beef,pork,and,butter,cost,thirty-five,dollars,a,pound,flour,fourteen,hundred,dollars,a,barrel,soda,one,hundred,dollars,a,pound,tea,five,hundred,dollars,a,pound
warm,clothing,when,it,was,obtainable,at,all,had,risen,to,such,prohibitive,prices,that,atlanta,ladies,were,lining,their,old,dresses,with,rags,and,reinforcing,them,with,newspapers,to,keep,out,the,wind
shoes,cost,from,two,hundred,to,eight,hundred,dollars,a,pair,depending,on,whether,they,were,made,of,cardboard,or,real,leather
ladies,now,wore,gaiters,made,of,their,old,wool,shawls,and,cut-up,carpets
the,soles,were,made,of,wood
the,truth,was,that,the,north,was,holding,the,south,in,a,virtual,state,of,siege,though,many,did,not,realize,it
the,yankee,gunboats,had,tightened,the,mesh,at,the,ports,and,very,few,ships,were,now,able,to,slip,past,the,blockade
the,south,had,always,lived,by,selling,cotton,and,buying,the,things,it,did,not,produce,but,now,it,could,neither,sell,nor,buy
gerald,o'hara,had,three,years',crops,of,cotton,stored,under,the,shed,near,the,gin,house,at,tara,but,little,good,it,did,him
in,liverpool,it,would,bring,one,hundred,and,fifty,thousand,dollars,but,there,was,no,hope,of,getting,it,to,liverpool
gerald,had,changed,from,a,wealthy,man,to,a,man,who,was,wondering,how,he,would,feed,his,family,and,his,negroes,through,the,winter
throughout,the,south,most,of,the,cotton,planters,were,in,the,same,fix
with,the,blockade,closing,tighter,and,tighter,there,was,no,way,to,get,the,south's,money,crop,to,its,market,in,england,no,way,to,bring,in,the,necessaries,which,cotton,money,had,brought,in,years,gone,by
and,the,agricultural,south,waging,war,with,the,industrial,north,was,needing,so,many,things,now,things,it,had,never,thought,of,buying,in,times,of,peace
it,was,a,situation,made,to,order,for,speculators,and,profiteers,and,men,were,not,lacking,to,take,advantage,of,it
as,food,and,clothing,grew,scarcer,and,prices,rose,higher,and,higher,the,public,outcry,against,the,speculators,grew,louder,and,more,venomous
in,those,early,days,of,1864,no,newspaper,could,be,opened,that,did,not,carry,scathing,editorials,denouncing,the,speculators,as,vultures,and,bloodsucking,leeches,and,calling,upon,the,government,to,put,them,down,with,a,hard,hand
the,government,did,its,best,but,the,efforts,came,to,nothing,for,the,government,was,harried,by,many,things
against,no,one,was,feeling,more,bitter,than,against,rhett,butler
he,had,sold,his,boats,when,blockading,grew,too,hazardous,and,he,was,now,openly,engaged,in,food,speculation
the,stories,about,him,that,came,back,to,atlanta,from,richmond,and,wilmington,made,those,who,had,received,him,in,other,days,writhe,with,shame
in,spite,of,all,these,trials,and,tribulations,atlanta's,ten,thousand,population,had,grown,to,double,that,number,during,the,war
even,the,blockade,had,added,to,atlanta's,prestige
from,time,immemorial,the,coast,cities,had,dominated,the,south,commercially,and,otherwise
but,now,with,the,ports,closed,and,many,of,the,port,cities,captured,or,besieged,the,south's,salvation,depended,upon,itself
the,interior,section,was,what,counted,if,the,south,was,going,to,win,the,war,and,atlanta,was,now,the,center,of,things
the,people,of,the,town,were,suffering,hardship,privation,sickness,and,death,as,severely,as,the,rest,of,the,confederacy,but,atlanta,the,city,had,gained,rather,than,lost,as,a,result,of,the,war
atlanta,the,heart,of,the,confederacy,was,still,beating,full,and,strong,the,railroads,that,were,its,arteries,throbbing,with,the,never-ending,flow,of,men,munitions,and,supplies
in,other,days,scarlett,would,have,been,bitter,about,her,shabby,dresses,and,patched,shoes,but,now,she,did,not,care,for,the,one,person,who,mattered,was,not,there,to,see,her
she,was,happy,those,two,months,happier,than,she,had,been,in,years
had,she,not,felt,the,start,of,ashley's,heart,when,her,arms,went,round,his,neck
seen,that,despairing,look,on,his,face,which,was,more,open,an,avowal,than,any,words,could,be
he,loved,her
she,was,sure,of,that,now,and,this,conviction,was,so,pleasant,she,could,even,be,kinder,to,melanie
she,could,be,sorry,for,melanie,now,sorry,with,a,faint,contempt,for,her,blindness,her,stupidity
when,the,war,is,over
she,thought
when,it's,over,then
sometimes,she,thought,with,a,small,dart,of,fear,what,then
but,she,put,the,thought,from,her,mind
when,the,war,was,over,everything,would,be,settled,somehow
if,ashley,loved,her,he,simply,couldn't,go,on,living,with,melanie
but,then,a,divorce,was,unthinkable,and,ellen,and,gerald,staunch,catholics,that,they,were,would,never,permit,her,to,marry,a,divorced,man
it,would,mean,leaving,the,church
scarlett,thought,it,over,and,decided,that,in,a,choice,between,the,church,and,ashley,she,would,choose,ashley
but,oh,it,would,make,such,a,scandal
divorced,people,were,under,the,ban,not,only,of,the,church,but,of,society
no,divorced,person,was,received
however,she,would,dare,even,that,for,ashley
she,would,sacrifice,anything,for,ashley
somehow,it,would,come,out,all,right,when,the,war,was,over
if,ashley,loved,her,so,much,he'd,find,a,way
she'd,make,him,find,a,way
and,with,every,day,that,passed,she,became,more,sure,in,her,own,mind,of,his,devotion,more,certain,he,would,arrange,matters,satisfactorily,when,the,yankees,were,finally,beaten
of,course,he,had,said,the,yankees,had,them
scarlett,thought,that,was,just,foolishness
he,had,been,tired,and,upset,when,he,said,it
but,she,hardly,cared,whether,the,yankees,won,or,not
the,thing,that,mattered,was,for,the,war,to,finish,quickly,and,for,ashley,to,come,home
then,when,the,sleets,of,march,were,keeping,everyone,indoors,the,hideous,blow,fell
melanie,her,eyes,shining,with,joy,her,head,ducked,with,embarrassed,pride,told,her,she,was,going,to,have,a,baby
dr,meade,says,it,will,be,here,in,late,august,or,september,she,said
i've,thought,but,i,wasn't,sure,till,today
oh,scarlett,isn't,it,wonderful
i've,so,envied,you,wade,and,so,wanted,a,baby
and,i,was,so,afraid,that,maybe,i,wasn't,ever,going,to,have,one,and,darling,i,want,a,dozen
scarlett,had,been,combing,her,hair,preparing,for,bed,when,melanie,spoke,and,she,stopped,the,comb,in,mid-air
dear,god
she,said,and,for,a,moment,realization,did,not,come
then,there,suddenly,leaped,to,her,mind,the,closed,door,of,melanie's,bedroom,and,a,knifelike,pain,went,through,her,a,pain,as,fierce,as,though,ashley,had,been,her,own,husband,and,had,been,unfaithful,to,her
a,baby
ashley's,baby
oh,how,could,he,when,he,loved,her,and,not,melanie
i,know,you're,surprised,melanie,rattled,on,breathlessly
and,isn't,it,too,wonderful
oh,scarlett,i,don't,know,how,i,shall,ever,write,ashley
it,wouldn't,be,so,embarrassing,if,i,could,tell,him,or,or,well,not,say,anything,and,just,let,him,notice,gradually,you,know
dear,god
said,scarlett,almost,sobbing,as,she,dropped,the,comb,and,caught,at,the,marble,top,of,the,dresser,for,support
darling,don't,look,like,that
you,know,having,a,baby,isn't,so,bad
you,said,so,yourself
and,you,mustn't,worry,about,me,though,you,are,sweet,to,be,so,upset
of,course,dr,meade,said,i,was,was,melanie,blushed,quite,narrow,but,that,perhaps,i,shouldn't,have,any,trouble,and,scarlett,did,you,write,charlie,and,tell,him,when,you,found,out,about,wade,or,did,your,mother,do,it,or,maybe,mr,o'hara
oh,dear,if,i,only,had,a,mother,to,do,it
i,just,don't,see,how
hush
said,scarlett,violently
hush
oh,scarlett,i'm,so,stupid
i'm,sorry
i,guess,all,happy,people,are,selfish
i,forgot,about,charlie,just,for,the,moment
hush
said,scarlett,again,fighting,to,control,her,face,and,make,her,emotions,quiet
never,never,must,melanie,see,or,suspect,how,she,felt
melanie,the,most,tactful,of,women,had,tears,in,her,eyes,at,her,own,cruelty
how,could,she,have,brought,back,to,scarlett,the,terrible,memories,of,wade,being,born,months,after,poor,charlie,was,dead
how,could,she,have,been,so,thoughtless
let,me,help,you,undress,dearest,she,said,humbly
and,i'll,rub,your,head,for,you
you,leave,me,alone,said,scarlett,her,face,like,stone
and,melanie,bursting,into,tears,of,self-condemnation,fled,the,room,leaving,scarlett,to,a,tearless,bed,with,wounded,pride,disillusionment,and,jealousy,for,bedfellows
she,thought,that,she,could,not,live,any,longer,in,the,same,house,with,the,woman,who,was,carrying,ashley's,child,thought,that,she,would,go,home,to,tara,home,where,she,belonged
she,did,not,see,how,she,could,ever,look,at,melanie,again,and,not,have,her,secret,read,in,her,face
and,she,arose,the,next,morning,with,the,fixed,intention,of,packing,her,trunk,immediately,after,breakfast
but,as,they,sat,at,the,table,scarlett,silent,and,gloomy,pitty,bewildered,and,melanie,miserable,a,telegram,came
it,was,to,melanie,from,ashley's,body,servant,mose
i,have,looked,everywhere,and,i,can't,find,him
must,i,come,home
no,one,knew,what,it,meant,but,the,eyes,of,the,three,women,went,to,one,another,wide,with,terror,and,scarlett,forgot,all,thoughts,of,going,home
without,finishing,their,breakfasts,they,drove,down,to,telegraph,ashley's,colonel,but,even,as,they,entered,the,office,there,was,a,telegram,from,him
regret,to,inform,you,major,wilkes,missing,since,scouting,expedition,three,days,ago
will,keep,you,informed
it,was,a,ghastly,trip,home,with,aunt,pitty,crying,into,her,handkerchief,melanie,sitting,erect,and,white,and,scarlett,slumped,stunned,in,the,corner,of,the,carriage
once,in,the,house,scarlett,stumbled,up,the,stairs,to,her,bedroom,and,clutching,her,rosary,from,the,table,dropped,to,her,knees,and,tried,to,pray
but,the,prayers,would,not,come
there,only,fell,on,her,an,abysmal,fear,a,certain,knowledge,that,god,had,turned,his,face,from,her,for,her,sin
she,had,loved,a,married,man,and,tried,to,take,him,from,his,wife,and,god,had,punished,her,by,killing,him
she,wanted,to,pray,but,she,could,not,raise,her,eyes,to,heaven
she,wanted,to,cry,but,the,tears,would,not,come
they,seemed,to,flood,her,chest,and,they,were,hot,tears,that,burned,under,her,bosom,but,they,would,not,flow
her,door,opened,and,melanie,entered
her,face,was,like,a,heart,cut,from,white,paper,framed,against,black,hair,and,her,eyes,were,wide,like,those,of,a,frightened,child,lost,in,the,dark
scarlett,she,said,putting,out,her,hands
you,must,forgive,me,for,what,i,said,yesterday,for,you're,all,i've,got,now
oh,scarlett,i,know,my,darling,is,dead
somehow,she,was,in,scarlett's,arms,her,small,breasts,heaving,with,sobs,and,somehow,they,were,lying,on,the,bed,holding,each,other,close,and,scarlett,was,crying,too,crying,with,her,face,pressed,close,against,melanie's,the,tears,of,one,wetting,the,cheeks,of,the,other
it,hurt,so,terribly,to,cry,but,not,so,much,as,not,being,able,to,cry
ashley,is,dead,dead,she,thought,and,i,have,killed,him,by,loving,him
fresh,sobs,broke,from,her,and,melanie,somehow,feeling,comfort,in,her,tears,tightened,her,arms,about,her,neck
at,least,she,whispered,at,least,i've,got,his,baby
and,i,thought,scarlett,too,stricken,now,for,anything,so,petty,as,jealousy,i've,got,nothing,nothing,nothing,except,the,look,on,his,face,when,he,told,me,good-by
the,first,reports,were,missing,believed,killed,and,so,they,appeared,on,the,casualty,list
melanie,telegraphed,colonel,sloan,a,dozen,times,and,finally,a,letter,arrived,full,of,sympathy,explaining,that,ashley,and,a,squad,had,ridden,out,on,a,scouting,expedition,and,had,not,returned
there,had,been,reports,of,a,slight,skirmish,within,the,yankee,lines,and,mose,frantic,with,grief,had,risked,his,own,life,to,search,for,ashley's,body,but,had,found,nothing
melanie,strangely,calm,now,telegraphed,him,money,and,instructions,to,come,home
when,missing,believed,captured,appeared,on,the,casualty,lists,joy,and,hope,reanimated,the,sad,household
melanie,could,hardly,be,dragged,away,from,the,telegraph,office,and,she,met,every,train,hoping,for,letters
she,was,sick,now,her,pregnancy,making,itself,felt,in,many,unpleasant,ways,but,she,refused,to,obey,dr,meade's,commands,and,stay,in,bed
a,feverish,energy,possessed,her,and,would,not,let,her,be,still,and,at,night,long,after,scarlett,had,gone,to,bed,she,could,hear,her,walking,the,floor,in,the,next,room
one,afternoon,she,came,home,from,town,driven,by,the,frightened,uncle,peter,and,supported,by,rhett,butler
she,had,fainted,at,the,telegraph,office,and,rhett,passing,by,and,observing,the,excitement,had,escorted,her,home
he,carried,her,up,the,stairs,to,her,bedroom,and,while,the,alarmed,household,fled,hither,and,yon,for,hot,bricks,blankets,and,whisky,he,propped,her,on,the,pillows,of,her,bed
mrs,wilkes,he,questioned,abruptly,you,are,going,to,have,a,baby,are,you,not
had,melanie,not,been,so,faint,so,sick,so,heartsore,she,would,have,collapsed,at,his,question
even,with,women,friends,she,was,embarrassed,by,any,mention,of,her,condition,while,visits,to,dr,meade,were,agonizing,experiences
and,for,a,man,especially,rhett,butler,to,ask,such,a,question,was,unthinkable
but,lying,weak,and,forlorn,in,the,bed,she,could,only,nod
after,she,had,nodded,it,did,not,seem,so,dreadful,for,he,looked,so,kind,and,so,concerned
then,you,must,take,better,care,of,yourself
all,this,running,about,and,worry,won't,help,you,and,may,harm,the,baby
if,you,will,permit,me,mrs,wilkes,i,will,use,what,influence,i,have,in,washington,to,learn,about,mr,wilkes',fate
if,he,is,a,prisoner,he,will,be,on,the,federal,lists,and,if,he,isn't,well,there's,nothing,worse,than,uncertainty
but,i,must,have,your,promise
take,care,of,yourself,or,before,god,i,won't,turn,a,hand
oh,you,are,so,kind,cried,melanie
how,can,people,say,such,dreadful,things,about,you
then,overcome,with,the,knowledge,of,her,tactlessness,and,also,with,horror,at,having,discussed,her,condition,with,a,man,she,began,to,cry,weakly
and,scarlett,flying,up,the,stairs,with,a,hot,brick,wrapped,in,flannel,found,rhett,patting,her,hand
he,was,as,good,as,his,word
they,never,knew,what,wires,he,pulled
they,feared,to,ask,knowing,it,might,involve,an,admission,of,his,too,close,affiliations,with,the,yankees
it,was,a,month,before,he,had,news,news,that,raised,them,to,the,heights,when,they,first,heard,it,but,later,created,a,gnawing,anxiety,in,their,hearts
ashley,was,not,dead
he,had,been,wounded,and,taken,prisoner,and,the,records,showed,that,he,was,at,rock,island,a,prison,camp,in,illinois
in,their,first,joy,they,could,think,of,nothing,except,that,he,was,alive
but,when,calmness,began,to,return,they,looked,at,one,another,and,said,rock,island
in,the,same,voice,they,would,have,said,in,hell
for,even,as,andersonville,was,a,name,that,stank,in,the,north,so,was,rock,island,one,to,bring,terror,to,the,heart,of,any,southerner,who,had,relatives,imprisoned,there
when,lincoln,refused,to,exchange,prisoners,believing,it,would,hasten,the,end,of,the,war,to,burden,the,confederacy,with,the,feeding,and,guarding,of,union,prisoners,there,were,thousands,of,bluecoats,at,andersonville,georgia
the,confederates,were,on,scant,rations,and,practically,without,drugs,or,bandages,for,their,own,sick,and,wounded
they,had,little,to,share,with,the,prisoners
they,fed,their,prisoners,on,what,the,soldiers,in,the,field,were,eating,fat,pork,and,dried,peas,and,on,this,diet,the,yankees,died,like,flies,sometimes,a,hundred,a,day
inflamed,by,the,reports,the,north,resorted,to,harsher,treatment,of,confederate,prisoners,and,at,no,place,were,conditions,worse,than,at,rock,island
food,was,scanty,one,blanket,for,three,men,and,the,ravages,of,smallpox,pneumonia,and,typhoid,gave,the,place,the,name,of,a,pest-house
three-fourths,of,all,the,men,sent,there,never,came,out,alive
and,ashley,was,in,that,horrible,place
ashley,was,alive,but,he,was,wounded,and,at,rock,island,and,the,snow,must,have,been,deep,in,illinois,when,he,was,taken,there
had,he,died,of,his,wound,since,rhett,had,learned,his,news
had,he,fallen,victim,to,smallpox
was,he,delirious,with,pneumonia,and,no,blanket,to,cover,him
oh,captain,butler,isn't,there,some,way,can't,you,use,your,influence,and,have,him,exchanged
cried,melanie
mr,lincoln,the,merciful,and,just,who,cries,large,tears,over,mrs,bixby's,five,boys,hasn't,any,tears,to,shed,about,the,thousands,of,yankees,dying,at,andersonville,said,rhett,his,mouth,twisting
he,doesn't,care,if,they,all,die
the,order,is,out
no,exchanges
i,i,hadn't,told,you,before,mrs,wilkes,but,your,husband,had,a,chance,to,get,out,and,refused,it
oh,no
cried,melanie,in,disbelief
yes,indeed
the,yankees,are,recruiting,men,for,frontier,service,to,fight,the,indians,recruiting,them,from,among,confederate,prisoners
any,prisoner,who,will,take,the,oath,of,allegiance,and,enlist,for,indian,service,for,two,years,will,be,released,and,sent,west
mr,wilkes,refused
oh,how,could,he
cried,scarlett
why,didn't,he,take,the,oath,and,then,desert,and,come,home,as,soon,as,he,got,out,of,jail
melanie,turned,on,her,like,a,small,fury
how,can,you,even,suggest,that,he,would,do,such,a,thing
betray,his,own,confederacy,by,taking,that,vile,oath,and,then,betray,his,word,to,the,yankees
i,would,rather,know,he,was,dead,at,rock,island,than,hear,he,had,taken,that,oath
i'd,be,proud,of,him,if,he,died,in,prison
but,if,he,did,that,i,would,never,look,on,his,face,again
never
of,course,he,refused
when,scarlett,was,seeing,rhett,to,the,door,she,asked,indignantly,if,it,were,you,wouldn't,you,enlist,with,the,yankees,to,keep,from,dying,in,that,place,and,then,desert
of,course,said,rhett,his,teeth,showing,beneath,his,mustache
then,why,didn't,ashley,do,it
he's,a,gentleman,said,rhett,and,scarlett,wondered,how,it,was,possible,to,convey,such,cynicism,and,contempt,in,that,one,honorable,word
part,three
chapter,xvii
may,of,1864,came,a,hot,dry,may,that,wilted,the,flowers,in,the,buds,and,the,yankees,under,general,sherman,were,in,georgia,again,above,dalton,one,hundred,miles,northwest,of,atlanta
rumor,had,it,that,there,would,be,heavy,fighting,up,there,near,the,boundary,between,georgia,and,tennessee
the,yankees,were,massing,for,an,attack,on,the,western,and,atlantic,railroad,the,line,which,connected,atlanta,with,tennessee,and,the,west,the,same,line,over,which,the,southern,troops,had,been,rushed,last,fall,to,win,the,victory,at,chickamauga
but,for,the,most,part,atlanta,was,not,disturbed,by,the,prospect,of,fighting,near,dalton
the,place,where,the,yankees,were,concentrating,was,only,a,few,miles,southeast,of,the,battle,field,of,chickamauga
they,had,been,driven,back,once,when,they,had,tried,to,break,through,the,mountain,passes,of,that,region,and,they,would,be,driven,back,again
atlanta,and,all,of,georgia,knew,that,the,state,was,far,too,important,to,the,confederacy,for,general,joe,johnston,to,let,the,yankees,remain,inside,the,state's,borders,for,long
old,joe,and,his,army,would,not,let,even,one,yankee,get,south,of,dalton,for,too,much,depended,on,the,undisturbed,functioning,of,georgia
the,unravaged,state,was,a,vast,granary,machine,shop,and,storehouse,for,the,confederacy
it,manufactured,much,of,the,powder,and,arms,used,by,the,army,and,most,of,the,cotton,and,woolen,goods
lying,between,atlanta,and,dalton,was,the,city,of,rome,with,its,cannon,foundry,and,its,other,industries,and,etowah,and,allatoona,with,the,largest,ironworks,south,of,richmond
and,in,atlanta,were,not,only,the,factories,for,making,pistols,and,saddles,tents,and,ammunition,but,also,the,most,extensive,rolling,mills,in,the,south,the,shops,of,the,principal,railroads,and,the,enormous,hospitals
and,in,atlanta,was,the,junction,of,the,four,railroads,on,which,the,very,life,of,the,confederacy,depended
so,no,one,worried,particularly
after,all,dalton,was,a,long,way,off,up,near,the,tennessee,line
there,had,been,fighting,in,tennessee,for,three,years,and,people,were,accustomed,to,the,thought,of,that,state,as,a,far-away,battle,field,almost,as,far,away,as,virginia,or,the,mississippi,river
moreover,old,joe,and,his,men,were,between,the,yankees,and,atlanta,and,everyone,knew,that,next,to,general,lee,himself,there,was,no,greater,general,than,johnston,now,that,stonewall,jackson,was,dead
dr,meade,summed,up,the,civilian,point,of,view,on,the,matter,one,warm,may,evening,on,the,veranda,of,aunt,pitty's,house,when,he,said,that,atlanta,had,nothing,to,fear,for,general,johnston,was,standing,in,the,mountains,like,an,iron,rampart
his,audience,heard,him,with,varying,emotions,for,all,who,sat,there,rocking,quietly,in,the,fading,twilight,watching,the,first,fireflies,of,the,season,moving,magically,through,the,dusk,had,weighty,matters,on,their,minds
mrs,meade,her,hand,upon,phil's,arm,was,hoping,the,doctor,was,right
if,the,war,came,closer,she,knew,that,phil,would,have,to,go
he,was,sixteen,now,and,in,the,home,guard
fanny,elsing,pale,and,hollow,eyed,since,gettysburg,was,trying,to,keep,her,mind,from,the,torturing,picture,which,had,worn,a,groove,in,her,tired,mind,these,past,several,months,lieutenant,dallas,mclure,dying,in,a,jolting,ox,cart,in,the,rain,on,the,long,terrible,retreat,into,maryland
captain,carey,ashburn's,useless,arm,was,hurting,him,again,and,moreover,he,was,depressed,by,the,thought,that,his,courtship,of,scarlett,was,at,a,standstill
that,had,been,the,situation,ever,since,the,news,of,ashley,wilkes',capture,though,the,connection,between,the,two,events,did,not,occur,to,him
scarlett,and,melanie,both,were,thinking,of,ashley,as,they,always,did,when,urgent,tasks,or,the,necessity,of,carrying,on,a,conversation,did,not,divert,them
scarlett,was,thinking,bitterly,sorrowfully,he,must,be,dead,or,else,we,would,have,heard
melanie,stemming,the,tide,of,fear,again,and,again,through,endless,hours,was,telling,herself,he,can't,be,dead
i'd,know,it,i'd,feel,it,if,he,were,dead
rhett,butler,lounged,in,the,shadows,his,long,legs,in,their,elegant,boots,crossed,negligently,his,dark,face,an,unreadable,blank
in,his,arms,wade,slept,contentedly,a,cleanly,picked,wishbone,in,his,small,hand
scarlett,always,permitted,wade,to,sit,up,late,when,rhett,called,because,the,shy,child,was,fond,of,him,and,rhett,oddly,enough,seemed,to,be,fond,of,wade
generally,scarlett,was,annoyed,by,the,child's,presence,but,he,always,behaved,nicely,in,rhett's,arms
as,for,aunt,pitty,she,was,nervously,trying,to,stifle,a,belch,for,the,rooster,they,had,had,for,supper,was,a,tough,old,bird
that,morning,aunt,pitty,had,reached,the,regretful,decision,that,she,had,better,kill,the,patriarch,before,he,died,of,old,age,and,pining,for,his,harem,which,had,long,since,been,eaten
for,days,he,had,drooped,about,the,empty,chicken,run,too,dispirited,to,crow
after,uncle,peter,had,wrung,his,neck,aunt,pitty,had,been,beset,by,conscience,at,the,thought,of,enjoying,him,en,famille,when,so,many,of,her,friends,had,not,tasted,chicken,for,weeks,so,she,suggested,company,for,dinner
melanie,who,was,now,in,her,fifth,month,had,not,been,out,in,public,or,received,guests,for,weeks,and,she,was,appalled,at,the,idea
but,aunt,pitty,for,once,was,firm
it,would,be,selfish,to,eat,the,rooster,alone,and,if,melanie,would,only,move,her,top,hoop,a,little,higher,no,one,would,notice,anything,and,she,was,so,flat,in,the,bust,anyway
oh,but,auntie,i,don't,want,to,see,people,when,ashley
it,isn't,as,if,ashley,were,had,passed,away,said,aunt,pitty,her,voice,quavering,for,in,her,heart,she,was,certain,ashley,was,dead
he's,just,as,much,alive,as,you,are,and,it,will,do,you,good,to,have,company
and,i'm,going,to,ask,fanny,elsing,too
mrs,elsing,begged,me,to,try,to,do,something,to,arouse,her,and,make,her,see,people
oh,but,auntie,it's,cruel,to,force,her,when,poor,dallas,has,only,been,dead
now,melly,i,shall,cry,with,vexation,if,you,argue,with,me
i,guess,i'm,your,auntie,and,i,know,what's,what
and,i,want,a,party
so,aunt,pitty,had,her,party,and,at,the,last,minute,a,guest,she,did,not,expect,or,desire,arrived
just,when,the,smell,of,roast,rooster,was,filling,the,house,rhett,butler,back,from,one,of,his,mysterious,trips,knocked,at,the,door,with,a,large,box,of,bonbons,packed,in,paper,lace,under,his,arm,and,a,mouthful,of,two-edged,compliments,for,her
there,was,nothing,to,do,but,invite,him,to,stay,although,aunt,pitty,knew,how,the,doctor,and,mrs,meade,felt,about,him,and,how,bitter,fanny,was,against,any,man,not,in,uniform
neither,the,meades,nor,the,elsings,would,have,spoken,to,him,on,the,street,but,in,a,friend's,home,they,would,of,course,have,to,be,polite,to,him
besides,he,was,now,more,firmly,than,ever,under,the,protection,of,the,fragile,melanie
after,he,had,intervened,for,her,to,get,the,news,about,ashley,she,had,announced,publicly,that,her,home,was,open,to,him,as,long,as,he,lived,and,no,matter,what,other,people,might,say,about,him
aunt,pitty's,apprehensions,quieted,when,she,saw,that,rhett,was,on,his,best,behavior
he,devoted,himself,to,fanny,with,such,sympathetic,deference,she,even,smiled,at,him,and,the,meal,went,well
it,was,a,princely,feast
carey,ashburn,had,brought,a,little,tea,which,he,had,found,in,the,tobacco,pouch,of,a,captured,yankee,en,route,to,andersonville,and,everyone,had,a,cup,faintly,flavored,with,tobacco
there,was,a,nibble,of,the,tough,old,bird,for,each,an,adequate,amount,of,dressing,made,of,corn,meal,and,seasoned,with,onions,a,bowl,of,dried,peas,and,plenty,of,rice,and,gravy,the,latter,somewhat,watery,for,there,was,no,flour,with,which,to,thicken,it
for,dessert,there,was,a,sweet,potato,pie,followed,by,rhett's,bonbons,and,when,rhett,produced,real,havana,cigars,for,the,gentlemen,to,enjoy,over,their,glass,of,blackberry,wine,everyone,agreed,it,was,indeed,a,lucullan,banquet
when,the,gentlemen,joined,the,ladies,on,the,front,porch,the,talk,turned,to,war
talk,always,turned,to,war,now,all,conversations,on,any,topic,led,from,war,or,back,to,war,sometimes,sad,often,gay,but,always,war
war,romances,war,weddings,deaths,in,hospitals,and,on,the,field,incidents,of,camp,and,battle,and,march,gallantry,cowardice,humor,sadness,deprivation,and,hope
always,always,hope
hope,firm,unshaken,despite,the,defeats,of,the,summer,before
when,captain,ashburn,announced,he,had,applied,for,and,been,granted,transfer,from,atlanta,to,the,army,at,dalton,the,ladies,kissed,his,stiffened,arm,with,their,eyes,and,covered,their,emotions,of,pride,by,declaring,he,couldn't,go,for,then,who,would,beau,them,about
young,carey,looked,confused,and,pleased,at,hearing,such,statements,from,settled,matrons,and,spinsters,like,mrs,meade,and,melanie,and,aunt,pitty,and,fanny,and,tried,to,hope,that,scarlett,really,meant,it
why,he'll,be,back,in,no,time,said,the,doctor,throwing,an,arm,over,carey's,shoulder
there'll,be,just,one,brief,skirmish,and,the,yankees,will,skedaddle,back,into,tennessee
and,when,they,get,there,general,forrest,will,take,care,of,them
you,ladies,need,have,no,alarm,about,the,proximity,of,the,yankees,for,general,johnston,and,his,army,stands,there,in,the,mountains,like,an,iron,rampart
yes,an,iron,rampart,he,repeated,relishing,his,phrase
sherman,will,never,pass
he'll,never,dislodge,old,joe
the,ladies,smiled,approvingly,for,his,lightest,utterance,was,regarded,as,incontrovertible,truth
after,all,men,understood,these,matters,much,better,than,women,and,if,he,said,general,johnston,was,an,iron,rampart,he,must,be,one
only,rhett,spoke
he,had,been,silent,since,supper,and,had,sat,in,the,twilight,listening,to,the,war,talk,with,a,down-twisted,mouth,holding,the,sleeping,child,against,his,shoulder
i,believe,that,rumor,has,it,that,sherman,has,over,one,hundred,thousand,men,now,that,his,reinforcements,have,come,up
the,doctor,answered,him,shortly
he,had,been,under,considerable,strain,ever,since,he,first,arrived,and,found,that,one,of,his,fellow,diners,was,this,man,whom,he,disliked,so,heartily
only,the,respect,due,miss,pittypat,and,his,presence,under,her,roof,as,a,guest,had,restrained,him,from,showing,his,feelings,more,obviously
well,sir
the,doctor,barked,in,reply
i,believe,captain,ashburn,said,just,a,while,ago,that,general,johnston,had,only,about,forty,thousand,counting,the,deserters,who,were,encouraged,to,come,back,to,the,colors,by,the,last,victory
sir,said,mrs,meade,indignantly
there,are,no,deserters,in,the,confederate,army
i,beg,your,pardon,said,rhett,with,mock,humility
i,meant,those,thousands,on,furlough,who,forgot,to,rejoin,their,regiments,and,those,who,have,been,over,their,wounds,for,six,months,but,who,remain,at,home,going,about,their,usual,business,or,doing,the,spring,plowing
his,eyes,gleamed,and,mrs,meade,bit,her,lip,in,a,huff
scarlett,wanted,to,giggle,at,her,discomfiture,for,rhett,had,caught,her,fairly
there,were,hundreds,of,men,skulking,in,the,swamps,and,the,mountains,defying,the,provost,guard,to,drag,them,back,to,the,army
they,were,the,ones,who,declared,it,was,a,rich,man's,war,and,a,poor,man's,fight,and,they,had,had,enough,of,it
but,outnumbering,these,by,far,were,men,who,though,carried,on,company,rolls,as,deserters,had,no,intention,of,deserting,permanently
they,were,the,ones,who,had,waited,three,years,in,vain,for,furloughs,and,while,they,waited,received,ill-spelled,letters,from,home,we,air,hungry,there,won't,be,no,crop,this,year,there,ain't,nobody,to,plow
we,air,hungry
the,commissary,took,the,shoats,and,we,ain't,had,no,money,from,you,in,months
we,air,livin',on,dried,peas
always,the,rising,chorus,swelled,we,are,hungry,your,wife,your,babies,your,parents
when,will,it,be,over
when,will,you,come,home
we,are,hungry,hungry
when,furloughs,from,the,rapidly,thinning,army,were,denied,these,soldiers,went,home,without,them,to,plow,their,land,and,plant,their,crops,repair,their,houses,and,build,up,their,fences
when,regimental,officers,understanding,the,situation,saw,a,hard,fight,ahead,they,wrote,these,men,telling,them,to,rejoin,their,companies,and,no,questions,would,be,asked
usually,the,men,returned,when,they,saw,that,hunger,at,home,would,be,held,at,bay,for,a,few,months,longer
plow,furloughs,were,not,looked,upon,in,the,same,light,as,desertion,in,the,face,of,the,enemy,but,they,weakened,the,army,just,the,same
dr,meade,hastily,bridged,over,the,uncomfortable,pause,his,voice,cold,captain,butler,the,numerical,difference,between,our,troops,and,those,of,the,yankees,has,never,mattered
one,confederate,is,worth,a,dozen,yankees
the,ladies,nodded
everyone,knew,that
that,was,true,at,the,first,of,the,war,said,rhett
perhaps,it's,still,true,provided,the,confederate,soldier,has,bullets,for,his,gun,and,shoes,on,his,feet,and,food,in,his,stomach
eh,captain,ashburn
his,voice,was,still,soft,and,filled,with,specious,humility
carey,ashburn,looked,unhappy,for,it,was,obvious,that,he,too,disliked,rhett,intensely
he,gladly,would,have,sided,with,the,doctor,but,he,could,not,lie
the,reason,he,had,applied,for,transfer,to,the,front,despite,his,useless,arm,was,that,he,realized,as,the,civilian,population,did,not,the,seriousness,of,the,situation
there,were,many,other,men,stumping,on,wooden,pegs,blind,in,one,eye,fingers,blown,away,one,arm,gone,who,were,quietly,transferring,from,the,commissariat,hospital,duties,mail,and,railroad,service,back,to,their,old,fighting,units
they,knew,old,joe,needed,every,man
he,did,not,speak,and,dr,meade,thundered,losing,his,temper,our,men,have,fought,without,shoes,before,and,without,food,and,won,victories
and,they,will,fight,again,and,win
i,tell,you,general,johnston,cannot,be,dislodged
the,mountain,fastnesses,have,always,been,the,refuge,and,the,strong,forts,of,invaded,peoples,from,ancient,times
think,of,think,of,thermopylae
scarlett,thought,hard,but,thermopylae,meant,nothing,to,her
they,died,to,the,last,man,at,thermopylae,didn't,they,doctor
rhett,asked,and,his,lips,twitched,with,suppressed,laughter
are,you,being,insulting,young,man
doctor
i,beg,of,you
you,misunderstood,me
i,merely,asked,for,information
my,memory,of,ancient,history,is,poor
if,need,be,our,army,will,die,to,the,last,man,before,they,permit,the,yankees,to,advance,farther,into,georgia,snapped,the,doctor
but,it,will,not,be
they,will,drive,them,out,of,georgia,in,one,skirmish
aunt,pittypat,rose,hastily,and,asked,scarlett,to,favor,them,with,a,piano,selection,and,a,song
she,saw,that,the,conversation,was,rapidly,getting,into,deep,and,stormy,water
she,had,known,very,well,there,would,be,trouble,if,she,invited,rhett,to,supper
there,was,always,trouble,when,he,was,present
just,how,he,started,it,she,never,exactly,understood
dear
dear
what,did,scarlett,see,in,the,man
and,how,could,dear,melly,defend,him
as,scarlett,went,obediently,into,the,parlor,a,silence,fell,on,the,porch,a,silence,that,pulsed,with,resentment,toward,rhett
how,could,anyone,not,believe,with,heart,and,soul,in,the,invincibility,of,general,johnston,and,his,men
believing,was,a,sacred,duty
and,those,who,were,so,traitorous,as,not,to,believe,should,at,least,have,the,decency,to,keep,their,mouths,shut
scarlett,struck,a,few,chords,and,her,voice,floated,out,to,them,from,the,parlor,sweetly,sadly,in,the,words,of,a,popular,song
into,a,ward,of,whitewashed,walls,where,the,dead,and,dying,lay,wounded,with,bayonets,shells,and,balls,somebody's,darling,was,borne,one,day
somebody's,darling
so,young,and,so,brave
wearing,still,on,his,pale,sweet,face,soon,to,be,hid,by,the,dust,of,the,grave,the,lingering,light,of,his,boyhood's,grace
matted,and,damp,are,the,curls,of,gold,mourned,scarlett's,faulty,soprano,and,fanny,half,rose,and,said,in,a,faint,strangled,voice,sing,something,else
the,piano,was,suddenly,silent,as,scarlett,was,overtaken,with,surprise,and,embarrassment
then,she,hastily,blundered,into,the,opening,bars,of,jacket,of,gray,and,stopped,with,a,discord,as,she,remembered,how,heartrending,that,selection,was,too
the,piano,was,silent,again,for,she,was,utterly,at,a,loss
all,the,songs,had,to,do,with,death,and,parting,and,sorrow
rhett,rose,swiftly,deposited,wade,in,fanny's,lap,and,went,into,the,parlor
play,'my,old,kentucky,home,',he,suggested,smoothly,and,scarlett,gratefully,plunged,into,it
her,voice,was,joined,by,rhett's,excellent,bass,and,as,they,went,into,the,second,verse,those,on,the,porch,breathed,more,easily,though,heaven,knew,it,was,none,too,cheery,a,song,either
just,a,few,more,days,for,to,tote,the,weary,load
no,matter,'twill,never,be,light
just,a,few,more,days,till,we,totter,in,the,road
then,my,old,kentucky,home,good,night
dr,meade's,prediction,was,right,as,far,as,it,went
johnston,did,stand,like,an,iron,rampart,in,the,mountains,above,dalton,one,hundred,miles,away
so,firmly,did,he,stand,and,so,bitterly,did,he,contest,sherman's,desire,to,pass,down,the,valley,toward,atlanta,that,finally,the,yankees,drew,back,and,took,counsel,with,themselves
they,could,not,break,the,gray,lines,by,direct,assault,and,so,under,cover,of,night,they,marched,through,the,mountain,passes,in,a,semicircle,hoping,to,come,upon,johnston's,rear,and,cut,the,railroad,behind,him,at,resaca,fifteen,miles,below,dalton
with,those,precious,twin,lines,of,iron,in,danger,the,confederates,left,their,desperately,defended,rifle,pits,and,under,the,starlight,made,a,forced,march,to,resaca,by,the,short,direct,road
when,the,yankees,swarming,out,of,the,hills,came,upon,them,the,southern,troops,were,waiting,for,them,entrenched,behind,breastworks,batteries,planted,bayonets,gleaming,even,as,they,had,been,at,dalton
when,the,wounded,from,dalton,brought,in,garbled,accounts,of,old,joe's,retreat,to,resaca,atlanta,was,surprised,and,a,little,disturbed
it,was,as,though,a,small,dark,cloud,had,appeared,in,the,northwest,the,first,cloud,of,a,summer,storm
what,was,the,general,thinking,about,letting,the,yankees,penetrate,eighteen,miles,farther,into,georgia
the,mountains,were,natural,fortresses,even,as,dr,meade,had,said
why,hadn't,old,joe,held,the,yankees,there
johnston,fought,desperately,at,resaca,and,repulsed,the,yankees,again,but,sherman,employing,the,same,flanking,movement,swung,his,vast,army,in,another,semicircle,crossed,the,oostanaula,river,and,again,struck,at,the,railroad,in,the,confederate,rear
again,the,gray,lines,were,summoned,swiftly,from,their,red,ditches,to,defend,the,railroad,and,weary,for,sleep,exhausted,from,marching,and,fighting,and,hungry,always,hungry,they,made,another,rapid,march,down,the,valley
they,reached,the,little,town,of,calhoun,six,miles,below,resaca,ahead,of,the,yankees,entrenched,and,were,again,ready,for,the,attack,when,the,yankees,came,up
the,attack,came,there,was,fierce,skirmishing,and,the,yankees,were,beaten,back
wearily,the,confederates,lay,on,their,arms,and,prayed,for,respite,and,rest
but,there,was,no,rest
sherman,inexorably,advanced,step,by,step,swinging,his,army,about,them,in,a,wide,curve,forcing,another,retreat,to,defend,the,railroad,at,their,back
the,confederates,marched,in,their,sleep,too,tired,to,think,for,the,most,part
but,when,they,did,think,they,trusted,old,joe
they,knew,they,were,retreating,but,they,knew,they,had,not,been,beaten
they,just,didn't,have,enough,men,to,hold,their,entrenchments,and,defeat,sherman's,flanking,movements,too
they,could,and,did,lick,the,yankees,every,time,the,yankees,would,stand,and,fight
what,would,be,the,end,of,this,retreat,they,did,not,know
but,old,joe,knew,what,he,was,doing,and,that,was,enough,for,them
he,had,conducted,the,retreat,in,masterly,fashion,for,they,had,lost,few,men,and,the,yankees,killed,and,captured,ran,high
they,hadn't,lost,a,single,wagon,and,only,four,guns
and,they,hadn't,lost,the,railroad,at,their,back,either
sherman,hadn't,laid,a,finger,on,it,for,all,his,frontal,attacks,cavalry,dashes,and,flank,movements
the,railroad
it,was,still,theirs,that,slender,iron,line,winding,through,the,sunny,valley,toward,atlanta
men,lay,down,to,sleep,where,they,could,see,the,rails,gleaming,faintly,in,the,starlight
men,lay,down,to,die,and,the,last,sight,that,met,their,puzzled,eyes,was,the,rails,shining,in,the,merciless,sun,heat,shimmering,along,them
as,they,fell,back,down,the,valley,an,army,of,refugees,fell,back,before,them
planters,and,crackers,rich,and,poor,black,and,white,women,and,children,the,old,the,dying,the,crippled,the,wounded,the,women,far,gone,in,pregnancy,crowded,the,road,to,atlanta,on,trains,afoot,on,horseback,in,carriages,and,wagons,piled,high,with,trunks,and,household,goods
five,miles,ahead,of,the,retreating,army,went,the,refugees,halting,at,resaca,at,calhoun,at,kingston,hoping,at,each,stop,to,hear,that,the,yankees,had,been,driven,back,so,they,could,return,to,their,homes
but,there,was,no,retracing,that,sunny,road
the,gray,troops,passed,by,empty,mansions,deserted,farms,lonely,cabins,with,doors,ajar
here,and,there,some,lone,woman,remained,with,a,few,frightened,slaves,and,they,came,to,the,road,to,cheer,the,soldiers,to,bring,buckets,of,well,water,for,the,thirsty,men,to,bind,up,the,wounds,and,bury,the,dead,in,their,own,family,burying,grounds
but,for,the,most,part,the,sunny,valley,was,abandoned,and,desolate,and,the,untended,crops,stood,in,parching,fields
flanked,again,at,calhoun,johnston,fell,back,to,adairsville,where,there,was,sharp,skirmishing,then,to,cassville,then,south,of,cartersville
and,the,enemy,had,now,advanced,fifty-five,miles,from,dalton
at,new,hope,church,fifteen,miles,farther,along,the,hotly,fought,way,the,gray,ranks,dug,in,for,a,determined,stand
on,came,the,blue,lines,relentlessly,like,a,monster,serpent,coiling,striking,venomously,drawing,its,injured,lengths,back,but,always,striking,again
there,was,desperate,fighting,at,new,hope,church,eleven,days,of,continuous,fighting,with,every,yankee,assault,bloodily,repulsed
then,johnston,flanked,again,withdrew,his,thinning,lines,a,few,miles,farther
the,confederate,dead,and,wounded,at,new,hope,church,ran,high
the,wounded,flooded,atlanta,in,train-loads,and,the,town,was,appalled
never,even,after,the,battle,of,chickamauga,had,the,town,seen,so,many,wounded
the,hospitals,overflowed,and,wounded,lay,on,the,floors,of,empty,stores,and,upon,cotton,bales,in,the,warehouses
every,hotel,boarding,house,and,private,residence,was,crowded,with,sufferers
aunt,pitty,had,her,share,although,she,protested,that,it,was,most,unbecoming,to,have,strange,men,in,the,house,when,melanie,was,in,a,delicate,condition,and,when,gruesome,sights,might,bring,on,premature,birth
but,melanie,reefed,up,her,top,hoop,a,little,higher,to,hide,her,thickening,figure,and,the,wounded,invaded,the,brick,house
there,was,endless,cooking,and,lifting,and,turning,and,fanning,endless,hours,of,washing,and,rerolling,bandages,and,picking,lint,and,endless,warm,nights,made,sleepless,by,the,babbling,delirium,of,men,in,the,next,room
finally,the,choked,town,could,take,care,of,no,more,and,the,overflow,of,wounded,was,sent,on,to,the,hospitals,at,macon,and,augusta
with,this,backwash,of,wounded,bearing,conflicting,reports,and,the,increase,of,frightened,refugees,crowding,into,the,already,crowded,town,atlanta,was,in,an,uproar
the,small,cloud,on,the,horizon,had,blown,up,swiftly,into,a,large,sullen,storm,cloud,and,it,was,as,though,a,faint,chilling,wind,blew,from,it
no,one,had,lost,faith,in,the,invincibility,of,the,troops,but,everyone,the,civilians,at,least,had,lost,faith,in,the,general
new,hope,church,was,only,thirty-five,miles,from,atlanta
the,general,had,let,the,yankees,push,him,back,sixty-five,miles,in,three,weeks
why,didn't,he,hold,the,yankees,instead,of,everlastingly,retreating
he,was,a,fool,and,worse,than,a,fool
graybeards,in,the,home,guard,and,members,of,the,state,militia,safe,in,atlanta,insisted,they,could,have,managed,the,campaign,better,and,drew,maps,on,tablecloths,to,prove,their,contentions
as,his,lines,grew,thinner,and,he,was,forced,back,farther,the,general,called,desperately,on,governor,brown,for,these,very,men,but,the,state,troops,felt,reasonably,safe
after,all,the,governor,had,defied,jeff,davis',demand,for,them
why,should,he,accede,to,general,johnston
fight,and,fall,back
fight,and,fall,back
for,seventy,miles,and,twenty-five,days,the,confederates,had,fought,almost,daily
new,hope,church,was,behind,the,gray,troops,now,a,memory,in,a,mad,haze,of,like,memories,heat,dust,hunger,weariness,tramp-tramp,on,the,red,rutted,roads,slop-slop,through,the,red,mud,retreat,entrench,fight,retreat,entrench,fight
new,hope,church,was,a,nightmare,of,another,life,and,so,was,big,shanty,where,they,turned,and,fought,the,yankees,like,demons
but,fight,the,yankees,till,the,fields,were,blue,with,dead,there,were,always,more,yankees,fresh,yankees,there,was,always,that,sinister,southeast,curving,of,the,blue,lines,toward,the,confederate,rear,toward,the,railroad,and,toward,atlanta
from,big,shanty,the,weary,sleepless,lines,retreated,down,the,road,to,kennesaw,mountain,near,the,little,town,of,marietta,and,here,they,spread,their,lines,in,a,ten-mile,curve
on,the,steep,sides,of,the,mountain,they,dug,their,rifle,pits,and,on,the,towering,heights,they,planted,their,batteries
swearing,sweating,men,hauled,the,heavy,guns,up,the,precipitous,slopes,for,mules,could,not,climb,the,hillsides
couriers,and,wounded,coming,into,atlanta,gave,reassuring,reports,to,the,frightened,townspeople
the,heights,of,kennesaw,were,impregnable
so,were,pine,mountain,and,lost,mountain,near,by,which,were,also,fortified
the,yankees,couldn't,dislodge,old,joe's,men,and,they,could,hardly,flank,them,now,for,the,batteries,on,the,mountain,tops,commanded,all,the,roads,for,miles
atlanta,breathed,more,easily,but
but,kennesaw,mountain,was,only,twenty-two,miles,away
on,the,day,when,the,first,wounded,from,kennesaw,mountain,were,coming,in,mrs,merriwether's,carriage,was,at,aunt,pitty's,house,at,the,unheard-of,hour,of,seven,in,the,morning,and,black,uncle,levi,sent,up,word,that,scarlett,must,dress,immediately,and,come,to,the,hospital
fanny,elsing,and,the,bonnell,girls,roused,early,from,slumber,were,yawning,on,the,back,seat,and,the,elsings',mammy,sat,grumpily,on,the,box,a,basket,of,freshly,laundered,bandages,on,her,lap
off,scarlett,went,unwillingly,for,she,had,danced,till,dawn,the,night,before,at,the,home,guard's,party,and,her,feet,were,tired
she,silently,cursed,the,efficient,and,indefatigable,mrs,merriwether,the,wounded,and,the,whole,southern,confederacy,as,prissy,buttoned,her,in,her,oldest,and,raggedest,calico,frock,which,she,used,for,hospital,work
gulping,down,the,bitter,brew,of,parched,corn,and,dried,sweet,potatoes,that,passed,for,coffee,she,went,out,to,join,the,girls
she,was,sick,of,all,this,nursing
this,very,day,she,would,tell,mrs,merriwether,that,ellen,had,written,her,to,come,home,for,a,visit
much,good,this,did,her,for,that,worthy,matron,her,sleeves,rolled,up,her,stout,figure,swathed,in,a,large,apron,gave,her,one,sharp,look,and,said,don't,let,me,hear,any,more,such,foolishness,scarlett,hamilton
i'll,write,your,mother,today,and,tell,her,how,much,we,need,you,and,i'm,sure,she'll,understand,and,let,you,stay
now,put,on,your,apron,and,trot,over,to,dr,meade
he,needs,someone,to,help,with,the,dressings
oh,god,thought,scarlett,drearily,that's,just,the,trouble
mother,will,make,me,stay,here,and,i,shall,die,if,i,have,to,smell,these,stinks,any,longer
i,wish,i,was,an,old,lady,so,i,could,bully,the,young,ones,instead,of,getting,bullied,and,tell,old,cats,like,mrs,merriwether,to,go,to,halifax
yes,she,was,sick,of,the,hospital,the,foul,smells,the,lice,the,aching,unwashed,bodies
if,there,had,ever,been,any,novelty,and,romance,about,nursing,that,had,worn,off,a,year,ago
besides,these,men,wounded,in,the,retreat,were,not,so,attractive,as,the,earlier,ones,had,been
they,didn't,show,the,slightest,interest,in,her,and,they,had,very,little,to,say,beyond,how's,the,fightin',goin'
what's,old,joe,doin',now
mighty,clever,fellow,old,joe
she,didn't,think,old,joe,a,mighty,clever,fellow
all,he,had,done,was,let,the,yankees,penetrate,eighty-eight,miles,into,georgia
no,they,were,not,an,attractive,lot
moreover,many,of,them,were,dying,dying,swiftly,silently,having,little,strength,left,to,combat,the,blood,poisoning,gangrene,typhoid,and,pneumonia,which,had,set,in,before,they,could,reach,atlanta,and,a,doctor
the,day,was,hot,and,the,flies,came,in,the,open,windows,in,swarms,fat,lazy,flies,that,broke,the,spirits,of,the,men,as,pain,could,not
the,tide,of,smells,and,pain,rose,and,rose,about,her
perspiration,soaked,through,her,freshly,starched,dress,as,she,followed,dr,meade,about,a,basin,in,her,hand
oh,the,nausea,of,standing,by,the,doctor,trying,not,to,vomit,when,his,bright,knife,cut,into,mortifying,flesh
and,oh,the,horror,of,hearing,the,screams,from,the,operating,ward,where,amputations,were,going,on
and,the,sick,helpless,sense,of,pity,at,the,sight,of,tense,white,faces,of,mangled,men,waiting,for,the,doctor,to,get,to,them,men,whose,ears,were,filled,with,screams,men,waiting,for,the,dreadful,words,i'm,sorry,my,boy,but,that,hand,will,have,to,come,off
yes,yes,i,know,but,look,see,those,red,streaks
it'll,have,to,come,off
chloroform,was,so,scarce,now,it,was,used,only,for,the,worst,amputations,and,opium,was,a,precious,thing,used,only,to,ease,the,dying,out,of,life,not,the,living,out,of,pain
there,was,no,quinine,and,no,iodine,at,all
yes,scarlett,was,sick,of,it,all,and,that,morning,she,wished,that,she,like,melanie,had,the,excuse,of,pregnancy,to,offer
that,was,about,the,only,excuse,that,was,socially,acceptable,for,not,nursing,these,days
when,noon,came,she,put,off,her,apron,and,sneaked,away,from,the,hospital,while,mrs,merriwether,was,busy,writing,a,letter,for,a,gangling,illiterate,mountaineer
scarlett,felt,that,she,could,stand,it,no,longer
it,was,an,imposition,on,her,and,she,knew,that,when,the,wounded,came,in,on,the,noon,train,there,would,be,enough,work,to,keep,her,busy,until,night-fall,and,probably,without,anything,to,eat
she,went,hastily,up,the,two,short,blocks,to,peachtree,street,breathing,the,unfouled,air,in,as,deep,gulps,as,her,tightly,laced,corset,would,permit
she,was,standing,on,the,corner,uncertain,as,to,what,she,would,do,next,ashamed,to,go,home,to,aunt,pitty's,but,determined,not,to,go,back,to,the,hospital,when,rhett,butler,drove,by
you,look,like,the,ragpicker's,child,he,observed,his,eyes,taking,in,the,mended,lavender,calico,streaked,with,perspiration,and,splotched,here,and,there,with,water,which,had,slopped,from,the,basin
scarlett,was,furious,with,embarrassment,and,indignation
why,did,he,always,notice,women's,clothing,and,why,was,he,so,rude,as,to,remark,upon,her,present,untidiness
i,don't,want,to,hear,a,word,out,of,you
you,get,out,and,help,me,in,and,drive,me,somewhere,where,nobody,will,see,me
i,won't,go,back,to,the,hospital,if,they,hang,me
my,goodness,i,didn't,start,this,war,and,i,don't,see,any,reason,why,i,should,be,worked,to,death,and
a,traitor,to,our,glorious,cause
the,pot's,calling,the,kettle,black
you,help,me,in
i,don't,care,where,you,were,going
you're,going,to,take,me,riding,now
he,swung,himself,out,of,the,carriage,to,the,ground,and,she,suddenly,thought,how,nice,it,was,to,see,a,man,who,was,whole,who,was,not,minus,eyes,or,limbs,or,white,with,pain,or,yellow,with,malaria,and,who,looked,well,fed,and,healthy
he,was,so,well,dressed,too
his,coat,and,trousers,were,actually,of,the,same,material,and,they,fitted,him,instead,of,hanging,in,folds,or,being,almost,too,tight,for,movement
and,they,were,new,not,ragged,with,dirty,bare,flesh,and,hairy,legs,showing,through
he,looked,as,if,he,had,not,a,care,in,the,world,and,that,in,itself,was,startling,these,days,when,other,men,wore,such,worried,preoccupied,grim,looks
his,brown,face,was,bland,and,his,mouth,red,lipped,clear,cut,as,a,woman's,frankly,sensual,smiled,carelessly,as,he,lifted,her,into,the,carriage
the,muscles,of,his,big,body,rippled,against,his,well-tailored,clothes,as,he,got,in,beside,her,and,as,always,the,sense,of,his,great,physical,power,struck,her,like,a,blow
she,watched,the,swell,of,his,powerful,shoulders,against,the,cloth,with,a,fascination,that,was,disturbing,a,little,frightening
his,body,seemed,so,tough,and,hard,as,tough,and,hard,as,his,keen,mind
his,was,such,an,easy,graceful,strength,lazy,as,a,panther,stretching,in,the,sun,alert,as,a,panther,to,spring,and,strike
you,little,fraud,he,said,clucking,to,the,horse
you,dance,all,night,with,the,soldiers,and,give,them,roses,and,ribbons,and,tell,them,how,you'd,die,for,the,cause,and,when,it,comes,to,bandaging,a,few,wounds,and,picking,off,a,few,lice,you,decamp,hastily
can't,you,talk,about,something,else,and,drive,faster
it,would,be,just,my,luck,for,grandpa,merriwether,to,come,out,of,his,store,and,see,me,and,tell,old,lady,i,mean,mrs
merriwether
he,touched,up,the,mare,with,the,whip,and,she,trotted,briskly,across,five,points,and,across,the,railroad,tracks,that,cut,the,town,in,two
the,train,bearing,the,wounded,had,already,come,in,and,the,litter,bearers,were,working,swiftly,in,the,hot,sun,transferring,wounded,into,ambulances,and,covered,ordnance,wagons
scarlett,had,no,qualm,of,conscience,as,she,watched,them,but,only,a,feeling,of,vast,relief,that,she,had,made,her,escape
i'm,just,sick,and,tired,of,that,old,hospital,she,said,settling,her,billowing,skirts,and,tying,her,bonnet,bow,more,firmly,under,her,chin
and,every,day,more,and,more,wounded,come,in
it's,all,general,johnston's,fault
if,he'd,just,stood,up,to,the,yankees,at,dalton,they'd,have
but,he,did,stand,up,to,the,yankees,you,ignorant,child
and,if,he'd,kept,on,standing,there,sherman,would,have,flanked,him,and,crushed,him,between,the,two,wings,of,his,army
and,he'd,have,lost,the,railroad,and,the,railroad,is,what,johnston,is,fighting,for
oh,well,said,scarlett,on,whom,military,strategy,was,utterly,lost
it's,his,fault,anyway
he,ought,to,have,done,something,about,it,and,i,think,he,ought,to,be,removed
why,doesn't,he,stand,and,fight,instead,of,retreating
you,are,like,everyone,else,screaming,'off,with,his,head',because,he,can't,do,the,impossible
he,was,jesus,the,savior,at,dalton,and,now,he's,judas,the,betrayer,at,kennesaw,mountain,all,in,six,weeks
yet,just,let,him,drive,the,yankees,back,twenty,miles,and,he'll,be,jesus,again
my,child,sherman,has,twice,as,many,men,as,johnston,and,he,can,afford,to,lose,two,men,for,every,one,of,our,gallant,laddies
and,johnston,can't,afford,to,lose,a,single,man
he,needs,reinforcements,badly,and,what,is,he,getting
'joe,brown's,pets,'
what,a,help,they'll,be
is,the,militia,really,going,to,be,called,out
the,home,guard,too
i,hadn't,heard
how,do,you,know
there's,a,rumor,floating,about,to,that,effect
the,rumor,arrived,on,the,train,from,milledgeville,this,morning
both,the,militia,and,the,home,guards,are,going,to,be,sent,in,to,reinforce,general,johnston
yes,governor,brown's,darlings,are,likely,to,smell,powder,at,last,and,i,imagine,most,of,them,will,be,much,surprised
certainly,they,never,expected,to,see,action
the,governor,as,good,as,promised,them,they,wouldn't
well,that's,a,good,joke,on,them
they,thought,they,had,bomb,proofs,because,the,governor,stood,up,to,even,jeff,davis,and,refused,to,send,them,to,virginia
said,they,were,needed,for,the,defense,of,their,state
who'd,have,ever,thought,the,war,would,come,to,their,own,back,yard,and,they'd,really,have,to,defend,their,state
oh,how,can,you,laugh,you,cruel,thing
think,of,the,old,gentlemen,and,the,little,boys,in,the,home,guard
why,little,phil,meade,will,have,to,go,and,grandpa,merriwether,and,uncle,henry,hamilton
i'm,not,talking,about,the,little,boys,and,the,mexican,war,veterans
i'm,talking,about,brave,young,men,like,willie,guinan,who,like,to,wear,pretty,uniforms,and,wave,swords
and,yourself
my,dear,that,didn't,hurt,a,bit
i,wear,no,uniform,and,wave,no,sword,and,the,fortunes,of,the,confederacy,mean,nothing,at,all,to,me
moreover,i,wouldn't,be,caught,dead,in,the,home,guard,or,in,any,army,for,that,matter
i,had,enough,of,things,military,at,west,point,to,do,me,the,rest,of,my,life
well,i,wish,old,joe,luck
general,lee,can't,send,him,any,help,because,the,yankees,are,keeping,him,busy,in,virginia
so,the,georgia,state,troops,are,the,only,reinforcements,johnston,can,get
he,deserves,better,for,he's,a,great,strategist
he,always,manages,to,get,places,before,the,yankees,do
but,he'll,have,to,keep,falling,back,if,he,wants,to,protect,the,railroad,and,mark,my,words,when,they,push,him,out,of,the,mountains,and,onto,the,flatter,land,around,here,he's,going,to,be,butchered
around,here
cried,scarlett
you,know,mighty,well,the,yankees,will,never,get,this,far
kennesaw,is,only,twenty-two,miles,away,and,i'll,wager,you
rhett,look,down,the,street
that,crowd,of,men
they,aren't,soldiers
what,on,earth
why,they're,darkies
there,was,a,great,cloud,of,red,dust,coming,up,the,street,and,from,the,cloud,came,the,sound,of,the,tramping,of,many,feet,and,a,hundred,or,more,negro,voices,deep,throated,careless,singing,a,hymn
rhett,pulled,the,carriage,over,to,the,curb,and,scarlett,looked,curiously,at,the,sweating,black,men,picks,and,shovels,over,their,shoulders,shepherded,along,by,an,officer,and,a,squad,of,men,wearing,the,insignia,of,the,engineering,corps
what,on,earth
she,began,again
then,her,eyes,lighted,on,a,singing,black,buck,in,the,front,rank
he,stood,nearly,six,and,a,half,feet,tall,a,giant,of,a,man,ebony,black,stepping,along,with,the,lithe,grace,of,a,powerful,animal,his,white,teeth,flashing,as,he,led,the,gang,in,go,down,moses
surely,there,wasn't,a,negro,on,earth,as,tall,and,loud,voiced,as,this,one,except,big,sam,the,foreman,of,tara
but,what,was,big,sam,doing,here,so,far,away,from,home,especially,now,that,there,was,no,overseer,on,the,plantation,and,he,was,gerald's,right-hand,man
as,she,half,rose,from,her,seat,to,look,closer,the,giant,caught,sight,of,her,and,his,black,face,split,in,a,grin,of,delighted,recognition
he,halted,dropped,his,shovel,and,started,toward,her,calling,to,the,negroes,nearest,him,gawdlmighty
it's,miss,scarlett
you,'lige
'postle
prophet
dar's,miss,scarlett
there,was,confusion,in,the,ranks
the,crowd,halted,uncertainly,grinning,and,big,sam,followed,by,three,other,large,negroes,ran,across,the,road,to,the,carriage,closely,followed,by,the,harried,shouting,officer

she,shook,hands,all,around,her,small,white,hand,disappearing,into,their,huge,black,paws,and,the,four,capered,with,delight,at,the,meeting,and,with,pride,at,displaying,before,their,comrades,what,a,pretty,young,miss,they,had

so,hyah,us,is
what,does,it,all,mean,captain,randall
oh,it's,quite,simple
we,have,to,strengthen,the,fortifications,of,atlanta,with,more,miles,of,rifle,pits,and,the,general,can't,spare,any,men,from,the,front,to,do,it
so,we've,been,impressing,the,strongest,bucks,in,the,countryside,for,the,work
but
a,cold,little,fear,was,beginning,to,throb,in,scarlett's,breast
more,miles,of,rifle,pits
why,should,they,need,more
within,the,last,year,a,series,of,huge,earth,redoubts,with,battery,emplacements,had,been,built,all,around,atlanta,one,mile,from,the,center,of,town
these,great,earth-works,were,connected,with,rifle,pits,and,they,ran,mile,after,mile,completely,encircling,the,city
more,rifle,pits
but,why,should,we,be,fortified,any,more,than,we,are,already,fortified
we,won't,need,what,we've,got
surely,the,general,won't,let
our,present,fortifications,are,only,a,mile,from,town,said,captain,randall,shortly
and,that's,too,close,for,comfort,or,safety
these,new,ones,are,going,to,be,farther,away
you,see,another,retreat,may,bring,our,men,into,atlanta
immediately,he,regretted,his,last,remark,as,her,eyes,widened,with,fear
but,of,course,there,won't,be,another,retreat,he,added,hastily
the,lines,around,kennesaw,mountain,are,impregnable
the,batteries,are,planted,all,up,the,mountain,sides,and,they,command,the,roads,and,the,yankees,can't,possibly,get,by
but,scarlett,saw,him,drop,his,eyes,before,the,lazy,penetrating,look,rhett,gave,him,and,she,was,frightened
she,remembered,rhett's,remark,when,the,yankees,push,him,out,of,the,mountains,and,onto,the,flatter,land,he'll,be,butchered
oh,captain,do,you,think
why,of,course,not
don't,fret,your,mind,one,minute
old,joe,just,believes,in,taking,precautions
that's,the,only,reason,we're,digging,more,entrenchments
but,i,must,be,going,now
it's,been,pleasant,talking,to,you
say,good-by,to,your,mistress,boys,and,let's,get,going
good-by,boys
now,if,you,get,sick,or,hurt,or,in,trouble,let,me,know
i,live,right,down,peachtree,street,down,there,in,almost,the,last,house,at,the,end,of,town
wait,a,minute,she,fumbled,in,her,reticule
oh,dear,i,haven't,a,cent
rhett,give,me,a,few,shinplasters
here,big,sam,buy,some,tobacco,for,yourself,and,the,boys
and,be,good,and,do,what,captain,randall,tells,you
the,straggling,line,re-formed,the,dust,arose,again,in,a,red,cloud,as,they,moved,off,and,big,sam,started,up,the,singing,again
go,do-ow,mos-es
waaa-ay,do-own,in,eeejup,laa-an
an',te-el,o-le,faa-ro-o,ter,let,mah,peee-pul,go
rhett,captain,randall,was,lying,to,me,just,like,all,the,men,do,trying,to,keep,the,truth,from,us,women,for,fear,we'll,faint
or,was,he,lying
oh,rhett,if,there's,no,danger,why,are,they,digging,these,new,breastworks
is,the,army,so,short,of,men,they've,got,to,use,darkies
rhett,clucked,to,the,mare
the,army,is,damned,short,of,men
why,else,would,the,home,guard,be,called,out
and,as,for,the,entrenchments,well,fortifications,are,supposed,to,be,of,some,value,in,case,of,a,siege
the,general,is,preparing,to,make,his,final,stand,here
a,siege
oh,turn,the,horse,around
i'm,going,home,back,home,to,tara,right,away
what,ails,you
a,siege
name,of,god,a,siege
i've,heard,about,sieges
pa,was,in,one,or,maybe,it,was,his,pa,and,pa,told,me
what,siege
the,siege,at,drogheda,when,cromwell,had,the,irish,and,they,didn't,have,anything,to,eat,and,pa,said,they,starved,and,died,in,the,streets,and,finally,they,ate,all,the,cats,and,rats,and,even,things,like,cockroaches
and,he,said,they,ate,each,other,too,before,they,surrendered,though,i,never,did,know,whether,to,believe,that,or,not
and,when,cromwell,took,the,town,all,the,women,were,a,siege
mother,of,god
you,are,the,most,barbarously,ignorant,young,person,i,ever,saw
drogheda,was,in,sixteen,hundred,and,something,and,mr,o'hara,couldn't,possibly,have,been,alive,then
besides,sherman,isn't,cromwell
no,but,he's,worse
they,say
and,as,for,the,exotic,viands,the,irish,ate,at,the,siege,personally,i'd,as,soon,eat,a,nice,juicy,rat,as,some,of,the,victuals,they've,been,serving,me,recently,at,the,hotel
i,think,i,shall,have,to,go,back,to,richmond
they,have,good,food,there,if,you,have,the,money,to,pay,for,it
his,eyes,mocked,the,fear,in,her,face
annoyed,that,she,had,shown,her,trepidation,she,cried,i,don't,see,why,you've,stayed,here,this,long
all,you,think,about,is,being,comfortable,and,eating,and,and,things,like,that
i,know,no,more,pleasant,way,to,pass,the,time,than,in,eating,and,er,things,like,that,he,said
and,as,for,why,i,stay,here,well,i've,read,a,good,deal,about,sieges,beleaguered,cities,and,the,like,but,i've,never,seen,one
so,i,think,i'll,stay,here,and,watch
i,won't,get,hurt,because,i'm,a,noncombatant,and,besides,i,want,the,experience
never,pass,up,new,experiences,scarlett
they,enrich,the,mind
my,mind's,rich,enough
perhaps,you,know,best,about,that,but,i,should,say,but,that,would,be,ungallant
and,perhaps,i'm,staying,here,to,rescue,you,when,the,siege,does,come
i've,never,rescued,a,maiden,in,distress
that,would,be,a,new,experience,too
she,knew,he,was,teasing,her,but,she,sensed,a,seriousness,behind,his,words
she,tossed,her,head
i,won't,need,you,to,rescue,me
i,can,take,care,of,myself,thank,you
don't,say,that,scarlett
think,of,it,if,you,like,but,never,never,say,it,to,a,man
that's,the,trouble,with,yankee,girls
they'd,be,most,charming,if,they,weren't,always,telling,you,that,they,can,take,care,of,themselves,thank,you
generally,they,are,telling,the,truth,god,help,them
and,so,men,let,them,take,care,of,themselves
how,you,do,run,on,she,said,coldly,for,there,was,no,insult,worse,than,being,likened,to,a,yankee,girl
i,believe,you're,lying,about,a,siege
you,know,the,yankees,will,never,get,to,atlanta
i'll,bet,you,they,will,be,here,within,the,month
i'll,bet,you,a,box,of,bonbons,against,his,dark,eyes,wandered,to,her,lips
against,a,kiss
for,a,last,brief,moment,fear,of,a,yankee,invasion,clutched,her,heart,but,at,the,word,kiss,she,forgot,about,it
this,was,familiar,ground,and,far,more,interesting,than,military,operations
with,difficulty,she,restrained,a,smile,of,glee
since,the,day,when,he,gave,her,the,green,bonnet,rhett,had,made,no,advances,which,could,in,any,way,be,construed,as,those,of,a,lover
he,could,never,be,inveigled,into,personal,conversations,try,though,she,might,but,now,with,no,angling,on,her,part,he,was,talking,about,kissing
i,don't,care,for,such,personal,conversation,she,said,coolly,and,managed,a,frown
besides,i'd,just,as,soon,kiss,a,pig
there's,no,accounting,for,tastes,and,i've,always,heard,the,irish,were,partial,to,pigs,kept,them,under,their,beds,in,fact
but,scarlett,you,need,kissing,badly
that's,what's,wrong,with,you
all,your,beaux,have,respected,you,too,much,though,god,knows,why,or,they,have,been,too,afraid,of,you,to,really,do,right,by,you
the,result,is,that,you,are,unendurably,uppity
you,should,be,kissed,and,by,someone,who,knows,how
the,conversation,was,not,going,the,way,she,wanted,it
it,never,did,when,she,was,with,him
always,it,was,a,duel,in,which,she,was,worsted
and,i,suppose,you,think,you,are,the,proper,person
she,asked,with,sarcasm,holding,her,temper,in,check,with,difficulty
oh,yes,if,i,cared,to,take,the,trouble,he,said,carelessly
they,say,i,kiss,very,well
oh,she,began,indignant,at,the,slight,to,her,charms
why,you
but,her,eyes,fell,in,sudden,confusion
he,was,smiling,but,in,the,dark,depths,of,his,eyes,a,tiny,light,flickered,for,a,brief,moment,like,a,small,raw,flame
of,course,you've,probably,wondered,why,i,never,tried,to,follow,up,that,chaste,peck,i,gave,you,the,day,i,brought,you,that,bonnet
i,have,never
then,you,aren't,a,nice,girl,scarlett,and,i'm,sorry,to,hear,it
all,really,nice,girls,wonder,when,men,don't,try,to,kiss,them
they,know,they,shouldn't,want,them,to,and,they,know,they,must,act,insulted,if,they,do,but,just,the,same,they,wish,the,men,would,try
well,my,dear,take,heart
some,day,i,will,kiss,you,and,you,will,like,it
but,not,now,so,i,beg,you,not,to,be,too,impatient
she,knew,he,was,teasing,but,as,always,his,teasing,maddened,her
there,was,always,too,much,truth,in,the,things,he,said
well,this,finished,him
if,ever,ever,he,should,be,so,ill,bred,as,to,try,to,take,any,liberties,with,her,she,would,show,him
will,you,kindly,turn,the,horse,around,captain,butler
i,wish,to,go,back,to,the,hospital
do,you,indeed,my,ministering,angel
then,lice,and,slops,are,preferable,to,my,conversation
well,far,be,it,from,me,to,keep,a,pair,of,willing,hands,from,laboring,for,our,glorious,cause
he,turned,the,horse's,head,and,they,started,back,toward,five,points
as,to,why,i,have,made,no,further,advances,he,pursued,blandly,as,though,she,had,not,signified,that,the,conversation,was,at,an,end,i'm,waiting,for,you,to,grow,up,a,little,more
you,see,it,wouldn't,be,much,fun,for,me,to,kiss,you,now,and,i'm,quite,selfish,about,my,pleasures
i,never,fancied,kissing,children
he,smothered,a,grin,as,from,the,corner,of,his,eye,he,saw,her,bosom,heave,with,silent,wrath
and,then,too,he,continued,softly,i,was,waiting,for,the,memory,of,the,estimable,ashley,wilkes,to,fade
at,the,mention,of,ashley's,name,sudden,pain,went,through,her,sudden,hot,tears,stung,her,lids
fade
the,memory,of,ashley,would,never,fade,not,if,he,were,dead,a,thousand,years
she,thought,of,ashley,wounded,dying,in,a,far-off,yankee,prison,with,no,blankets,over,him,with,no,one,who,loved,him,to,hold,his,hand,and,she,was,filled,with,hate,for,the,well-fed,man,who,sat,beside,her,jeers,just,beneath,the,surface,of,his,drawling,voice
she,was,too,angry,to,speak,and,they,rode,along,in,silence,for,some,while
i,understand,practically,everything,about,you,and,ashley,now,rhett,resumed
i,began,with,your,inelegant,scene,at,twelve,oaks,and,since,then,i've,picked,up,many,things,by,keeping,my,eyes,open
what,things
oh,that,you,still,cherish,a,romantic,schoolgirl,passion,for,him,which,he,reciprocates,as,well,as,his,honorable,nature,will,permit,him
and,that,mrs,wilkes,knows,nothing,and,that,between,the,two,of,you,you've,done,her,a,pretty,trick
i,understand,practically,everything,except,one,thing,that,piques,my,curiosity
did,the,honorable,ashley,ever,jeopardize,his,immortal,soul,by,kissing,you
a,stony,silence,and,an,averted,head,were,his,answers
ah,well,so,he,did,kiss,you
i,suppose,it,was,when,he,was,here,on,furlough
and,now,that,he's,probably,dead,you,are,cherishing,it,to,your,heart
but,i'm,sure,you'll,get,over,it,and,when,you've,forgotten,his,kiss,i'll
she,turned,in,fury
you,go,to,halifax,she,said,tensely,her,green,eyes,slits,of,rage
and,let,me,out,of,this,carriage,before,i,jump,over,the,wheels
and,i,don't,ever,want,to,speak,to,you,again
he,stopped,the,carriage,but,before,he,could,alight,and,assist,her,she,sprang,down
her,hoop,caught,on,the,wheel,and,for,a,moment,the,crowd,at,five,points,had,a,flashing,view,of,petticoats,and,pantalets
then,rhett,leaned,over,and,swiftly,released,it
she,flounced,off,without,a,word,without,even,a,backward,look,and,he,laughed,softly,and,clicked,to,the,horse
chapter,xviii
for,the,first,time,since,the,war,began,atlanta,could,hear,the,sound,of,battle
in,the,early,morning,hours,before,the,noises,of,the,town,awoke,the,cannon,at,kennesaw,mountain,could,be,heard,faintly,far,away,a,low,dim,booming,that,might,have,passed,for,summer,thunder
occasionally,it,was,loud,enough,to,be,heard,even,above,the,rattle,of,traffic,at,noon
people,tried,not,to,listen,to,it,tried,to,talk,to,laugh,to,carry,on,their,business,just,as,though,the,yankees,were,not,there,twenty-two,miles,away,but,always,ears,were,strained,for,the,sound
the,town,wore,a,preoccupied,look,for,no,matter,what,occupied,their,hands,all,were,listening,listening,their,hearts,leaping,suddenly,a,hundred,times,a,day
was,the,booming,louder
or,did,they,only,think,it,was,louder
would,general,johnston,hold,them,this,time
would,he
panic,lay,just,beneath,the,surface
nerves,which,had,been,stretched,tighter,and,tighter,each,day,of,the,retreat,began,to,reach,the,breaking,point
no,one,spoke,of,fears
that,subject,was,taboo,but,strained,nerves,found,expression,in,loud,criticism,of,the,general
public,feeling,was,at,fever,heat
sherman,was,at,the,very,doors,of,atlanta
another,retreat,might,bring,the,confederates,into,the,town
give,us,a,general,who,won't,retreat
give,us,a,man,who,will,stand,and,fight
with,the,far-off,rumbling,of,cannon,in,their,ears,the,state,militia,joe,brown's,pets,and,the,home,guard,marched,out,of,atlanta,to,defend,the,bridges,and,ferries,of,the,chattahoochee,river,at,johnston's,back
it,was,a,gray,overcast,day,and,as,they,marched,through,five,points,and,out,the,marietta,road,a,fine,rain,began,to,fall
the,whole,town,had,turned,out,to,see,them,off,and,they,stood,close,packed,under,the,wooden,awnings,of,the,stores,on,peachtree,street,and,tried,to,cheer
scarlett,and,maybelle,merriwether,picard,had,been,given,permission,to,leave,the,hospital,and,watch,the,men,go,out,because,uncle,henry,hamilton,and,grandpa,merriwether,were,in,the,home,guard,and,they,stood,with,mrs,meade,pressed,in,the,crowd,tiptoeing,to,get,a,better,view
scarlett,though,filled,with,the,universal,southern,desire,to,believe,only,the,pleasantest,and,most,reassuring,things,about,the,progress,of,the,fighting,felt,cold,as,she,watched,the,motley,ranks,go,by
surely,things,must,be,in,a,desperate,pass,if,this,rabble,of,bombproofers,old,men,and,little,boys,were,being,called,out
to,be,sure,there,were,young,and,able-bodied,men,in,the,passing,lines,tricked,out,in,the,bright,uniforms,of,socially,select,militia,units,plumes,waving,sashes,dancing
but,there,were,so,many,old,men,and,young,boys,and,the,sight,of,them,made,her,heart,contract,with,pity,and,with,fear
there,were,graybeards,older,than,her,father,trying,to,step,jauntily,along,in,the,needle-,fine,rain,to,the,rhythm,of,the,fife,and,drum,corps
grandpa,merriwether,with,mrs,merriwether's,best,plaid,shawl,laid,across,his,shoulders,to,keep,out,the,rain,was,in,the,first,rank,and,he,saluted,the,girls,with,a,grin
they,waved,their,handkerchiefs,and,cried,gay,good-bys,to,him,but,maybelle,gripping,scarlett's,arm,whispered,oh,the,poor,old,darling
a,real,good,rainstorm,will,just,about,finish,him
his,lumbago
uncle,henry,hamilton,marched,in,the,rank,behind,grandpa,merriwether,the,collar,of,his,long,black,coat,turned,up,about,his,ears,two,mexican,war,pistols,in,his,belt,and,a,small,carpetbag,in,his,hand
beside,him,marched,his,black,valet,who,was,nearly,as,old,as,uncle,henry,with,an,open,umbrella,held,over,them,both
shoulder,to,shoulder,with,their,elders,came,the,young,boys,none,of,them,looking,over,sixteen
many,of,them,had,run,away,from,school,to,join,the,army,and,here,and,there,were,clumps,of,them,in,the,cadet,uniforms,of,military,academies,the,black,cock,feathers,on,their,tight,gray,caps,wet,with,rain,the,clean,white,canvas,straps,crossing,their,chests,sodden
phil,meade,was,among,them,proudly,wearing,his,dead,brother's,saber,and,horse,pistols,his,hat,bravely,pinned,up,on,one,side
mrs,meade,managed,to,smile,and,wave,until,he,had,passed,and,then,she,leaned,her,head,on,the,back,of,scarlett's,shoulder,for,a,moment,as,though,her,strength,had,suddenly,left,her
many,of,the,men,were,totally,unarmed,for,the,confederacy,had,neither,rifles,nor,ammunition,to,issue,to,them
these,men,hoped,to,equip,themselves,from,killed,and,captured,yankees
many,carried,bowie,knives,in,their,boots,and,bore,in,their,hands,long,thick,poles,with,iron-pointed,tips,known,as,joe,brown,pikes
the,lucky,ones,had,old,flintlock,muskets,slung,over,their,shoulders,and,powder-horns,at,their,belts
johnston,had,lost,around,ten,thousand,men,in,his,retreat
he,needed,ten,thousand,more,fresh,troops
and,this,thought,scarlett,frightened,is,what,he,is,getting
as,the,artillery,rumbled,by,splashing,mud,into,the,watching,crowds,a,negro,on,a,mule,riding,close,to,a,cannon,caught,her,eye
he,was,a,young,saddle-colored,negro,with,a,serious,face,and,when,scarlett,saw,him,she,cried,it's,mose

then,as,the,last,cannon,and,limber,chest,came,groaning,and,splashing,up,she,saw,him,slender,erect,his,long,silver,hair,wet,upon,his,neck,riding,easily,upon,a,little,strawberry,mare,that,picked,her,way,as,daintily,through,the,mud,holes,as,a,lady,in,a,satin,dress

when,his,horse,came,to,the,fence,he,stopped,dead,and,over,his,head,went,your,father

he,just,isn't,up,to,active,service,scarlett
you,need,have,no,shame,about,it
after,all,someone,must,stay,home,and,raise,crops,for,the,army

good-by,my,dear
he,swung,onto,nellie,and,cantered,off,his,hat,in,his,hand,his,silver,hair,bare,to,the,rain
scarlett,had,rejoined,maybelle,and,mrs,meade,before,the,import,of,his,last,words,broke,upon,her
then,in,superstitious,terror,she,crossed,herself,and,tried,to,say,a,prayer
he,had,spoken,of,death,just,as,ashley,had,done,and,now,ashley,no,one,should,ever,speak,of,death
it,was,tempting,providence,to,mention,death
as,the,three,women,started,silently,back,to,the,hospital,in,the,rain,scarlett,was,praying,not,him,too,god
not,him,and,ashley,too
the,retreat,from,dalton,to,kennesaw,mountain,had,taken,from,early,may,to,mid-june,and,as,the,hot,rainy,days,of,june,passed,and,sherman,failed,to,dislodge,the,confederates,from,the,steep,slippery,slopes,hope,again,raised,its,head
everyone,grew,more,cheerful,and,spoke,more,kindly,of,general,johnston
as,wet,june,days,passed,into,a,wetter,july,and,the,confederates,fighting,desperately,around,the,entrenched,heights,still,held,sherman,at,bay,a,wild,gaiety,took,hold,of,atlanta
hope,went,to,their,heads,like,champagne
hurrah
hurrah
we're,holding,them
an,epidemic,of,parties,and,dances,broke,out
whenever,groups,of,men,from,the,fighting,were,in,town,for,the,night,dinners,were,given,for,them,and,afterwards,there,was,dancing,and,the,girls,outnumbering,the,men,ten,to,one,made,much,of,them,and,fought,to,dance,with,them
atlanta,was,crowded,with,visitors,refugees,families,of,wounded,men,in,the,hospitals,wives,and,mothers,of,soldiers,fighting,at,the,mountain,who,wished,to,be,near,them,in,case,of,wounds
in,addition,bevies,of,belles,from,the,country,districts,where,all,remaining,men,were,under,sixteen,or,over,sixty,descended,upon,the,town
aunt,pitty,disapproved,highly,of,these,last,for,she,felt,they,had,come,to,atlanta,for,no,reason,at,all,except,to,catch,husbands,and,the,shamelessness,of,it,made,her,wonder,what,the,world,was,coming,to
scarlett,disapproved,too
she,did,not,care,for,the,eager,competition,furnished,by,the,sixteen-year-olds,whose,fresh,cheeks,and,bright,smiles,made,one,forget,their,twice-turned,frocks,and,patched,shoes
her,own,clothes,were,prettier,and,newer,than,most,thanks,to,the,material,rhett,butler,had,brought,her,on,the,last,boat,he,ran,in,but,after,all,she,was,nineteen,and,getting,along,and,men,had,a,way,of,chasing,silly,young,things
a,widow,with,a,child,was,at,a,disadvantage,with,these,pretty,minxes,she,thought
but,in,these,exciting,days,her,widowhood,and,her,motherhood,weighed,less,heavily,upon,her,than,ever,before
between,hospital,duties,in,the,day,time,and,parties,at,night,she,hardly,ever,saw,wade
sometimes,she,actually,forgot,for,long,stretches,that,she,had,a,child
in,the,warm,wet,summer,nights,atlanta's,homes,stood,open,to,the,soldiers,the,town's,defenders
the,big,houses,from,washington,street,to,peachtree,street,blazed,with,lights,as,the,muddy,fighters,in,from,the,rifle,pits,were,entertained,and,the,sound,of,banjo,and,fiddle,and,the,scrape,of,dancing,feet,and,light,laughter,carried,far,on,the,night,air
groups,hung,over,pianos,and,voices,sang,lustily,the,sad,words,of,your,letter,came,but,came,too,late,while,ragged,gallants,looked,meaningly,at,girls,who,laughed,from,behind,turkey-tail,fans,begging,them,not,to,wait,until,it,was,too,late
none,of,the,girls,waited,if,they,could,help,it
with,the,tide,of,hysterical,gaiety,and,excitement,flooding,the,city,they,rushed,into,matrimony
there,were,so,many,marriages,that,month,while,johnston,was,holding,the,enemy,at,kennesaw,mountain,marriages,with,the,bride,turned,out,in,blushing,happiness,and,the,hastily,borrowed,finery,of,a,dozen,friends,and,the,groom,with,saber,banging,at,patched,knees
so,much,excitement,so,many,parties,so,many,thrills
hurrah
johnston,is,holding,the,yanks,twenty-two,miles,away
yes,the,lines,around,kennesaw,mountain,were,impregnable
after,twenty-five,days,of,fighting,even,general,sherman,was,convinced,of,this,for,his,losses,were,enormous
instead,of,continuing,the,direct,assault,he,swung,his,army,in,a,wide,circle,again,and,tried,to,come,between,the,confederates,and,atlanta
again,the,strategy,worked
johnston,was,forced,to,abandon,the,heights,he,had,held,so,well,in,order,to,protect,his,rear
he,had,lost,a,third,of,his,men,in,that,fight,and,the,remainder,slogged,tiredly,through,the,rain,across,the,country,toward,the,chattahoochee,river
the,confederates,could,expect,no,more,reinforcements,whereas,the,railroad,which,the,yankees,now,held,from,tennessee,south,to,the,battle,line,brought,sherman,fresh,troops,and,supplies,daily
so,the,gray,lines,went,back,through,the,muddy,fields,back,toward,atlanta
with,the,loss,of,the,supposedly,unconquerable,position,a,fresh,wave,of,terror,swept,the,town
for,twenty-five,wild,happy,days,everyone,had,assured,everyone,else,that,this,could,not,possibly,happen
and,now,it,had,happened
but,surely,the,general,would,hold,the,yankees,on,the,opposite,bank,of,the,river
though,god,knows,the,river,was,close,enough,only,seven,miles,away
but,sherman,flanked,them,again,crossing,the,stream,above,them,and,the,weary,gray,files,were,forced,to,hurry,across,the,yellow,water,and,throw,themselves,again,between,the,invaders,and,atlanta
they,dug,in,hastily,in,shallow,pits,to,the,north,of,the,town,in,the,valley,of,peachtree,creek
atlanta,was,in,agony,and,panic
fight,and,fall,back
fight,and,fall,back
and,every,retreat,was,bringing,the,yankees,closer,to,the,town
peachtree,creek,was,only,five,miles,away
what,was,the,general,thinking,about
the,cries,of,give,us,a,man,who,will,stand,and,fight
penetrated,even,to,richmond
richmond,knew,that,if,atlanta,was,lost,the,war,was,lost,and,after,the,army,had,crossed,the,chattahoochee,general,johnston,was,removed,from,command
general,hood,one,of,his,corps,commanders,took,over,the,army,and,the,town,breathed,a,little,easier
hood,wouldn't,retreat
not,that,tall,kentuckian,with,his,flowing,beard,and,flashing,eye
he,had,the,reputation,of,a,bulldog
he'd,drive,the,yankees,back,from,the,creek,yes,back,across,the,river,and,on,up,the,road,every,step,of,the,way,back,to,dalton
but,the,army,cried,give,us,back,old,joe
for,they,had,been,with,old,joe,all,the,weary,miles,from,dalton,and,they,knew,as,the,civilians,could,not,know,the,odds,that,had,opposed,them
sherman,did,not,wait,for,hood,to,get,himself,in,readiness,to,attack
on,the,day,after,the,change,in,command,the,yankee,general,struck,swiftly,at,the,little,town,of,decatur,six,miles,beyond,atlanta,captured,it,and,cut,the,railroad,there
this,was,the,railroad,connecting,atlanta,with,augusta,with,charleston,and,wilmington,and,with,virginia
sherman,had,dealt,the,confederacy,a,crippling,blow
the,time,had,come,for,action
atlanta,screamed,for,action
then,on,a,july,afternoon,of,steaming,heat,atlanta,had,its,wish
general,hood,did,more,than,stand,and,fight
he,assaulted,the,yankees,fiercely,at,peachtree,creek,hurling,his,men,from,their,rifle,pits,against,the,blue,lines,where,sherman's,men,outnumbered,him,more,than,two,to,one
frightened,praying,that,hood's,attack,would,drive,the,yankees,back,everyone,listened,to,the,sound,of,booming,cannon,and,the,crackling,of,thousands,of,rifles,which,though,five,miles,away,from,the,center,of,town,were,so,loud,as,to,seem,almost,in,the,next,block
they,could,hear,the,rumblings,of,the,batteries,see,the,smoke,which,rolled,like,low-hanging,clouds,above,the,trees,but,for,hours,no,one,knew,how,the,battle,was,going
by,late,afternoon,the,first,news,came,but,it,was,uncertain,contradictory,frightening,brought,as,it,was,by,men,wounded,in,the,early,hours,of,the,battle
these,men,began,straggling,in,singly,and,in,groups,the,less,seriously,wounded,supporting,those,who,limped,and,staggered
soon,a,steady,stream,of,them,was,established,making,their,painful,way,into,town,toward,the,hospitals,their,faces,black,as,negroes',from,powder,stains,dust,and,sweat,their,wounds,unbandaged,blood,drying,flies,swarming,about,them
aunt,pitty's,was,one,of,the,first,houses,which,the,wounded,reached,as,they,struggled,in,from,the,north,of,the,town,and,one,after,another,they,tottered,to,the,gate,sank,down,on,the,green,lawn,and,croaked
water
all,that,burning,afternoon,aunt,pitty,and,her,family,black,and,white,stood,in,the,sun,with,buckets,of,water,and,bandages,ladling,drinks,binding,wounds,until,the,bandages,gave,out,and,even,the,torn,sheets,and,towels,were,exhausted
aunt,pitty,completely,forgot,that,the,sight,of,blood,always,made,her,faint,and,she,worked,until,her,little,feet,in,their,too,small,shoes,swelled,and,would,no,longer,support,her
even,melanie,now,great,with,child,forgot,her,modesty,and,worked,feverishly,side,by,side,with,prissy,cookie,and,scarlett,her,face,as,tense,as,any,of,the,wounded
when,at,last,she,fainted,there,was,no,place,to,lay,her,except,on,the,kitchen,table,as,every,bed,chair,and,sofa,in,the,house,was,filled,with,wounded
forgotten,in,the,tumult,little,wade,crouched,behind,the,banisters,on,the,front,porch,peering,out,onto,the,lawn,like,a,caged,frightened,rabbit,his,eyes,wide,with,terror,sucking,his,thumb,and,hiccoughing
once,scarlett,saw,him,and,cried,sharply,go,play,in,the,back,yard,wade,hampton
but,he,was,too,terrified,too,fascinated,by,the,mad,scene,before,him,to,obey
the,lawn,was,covered,with,prostrate,men,too,tired,to,walk,farther,too,weak,from,wounds,to,move
these,uncle,peter,loaded,into,the,carriage,and,drove,to,the,hospital,making,trip,after,trip,until,the,old,horse,was,lathered
mrs,meade,and,mrs,merriwether,sent,their,carriages,and,they,too,drove,off,springs,sagging,beneath,the,weight,of,the,wounded
later,in,the,long,hot,summer,twilight,the,ambulances,came,rumbling,down,the,road,from,the,battle,field,and,commissary,wagons,covered,with,muddy,canvas
then,farm,wagons,ox,carts,and,even,private,carriages,commandeered,by,the,medical,corps
they,passed,aunt,pitty's,house,jolting,over,the,bumpy,road,packed,with,wounded,and,dying,men,dripping,blood,into,the,red,dust
at,the,sight,of,the,women,with,buckets,and,dippers,the,conveyances,halted,and,the,chorus,went,up,in,cries,in,whispers
water
scarlett,held,wobbling,heads,that,parched,lips,might,drink,poured,buckets,of,water,over,dusty,feverish,bodies,and,into,open,wounds,that,the,men,might,enjoy,a,brief,moment's,relief
she,tiptoed,to,hand,dippers,to,ambulance,drivers,and,of,each,she,questioned,her,heart,in,her,throat,what,news
what,news
from,all,came,back,the,answer,don't,know,fer,sartin,lady
it's,too,soon,to,tell
night,came,and,it,was,sultry
no,air,moved,and,the,flaring,pine,knots,the,negroes,held,made,the,air,hotter
dust,clogged,scarlett's,nostrils,and,dried,her,lips
her,lavender,calico,dress,so,freshly,clean,and,starched,that,morning,was,streaked,with,blood,dirt,and,sweat
this,then,was,what,ashley,had,meant,when,he,wrote,that,war,was,not,glory,but,dirt,and,misery
fatigue,gave,an,unreal,nightmarish,cast,to,the,whole,scene
it,couldn't,be,real,or,it,was,real,then,the,world,had,gone,mad
if,not,why,should,she,be,standing,here,in,aunt,pitty's,peaceful,front,yard,amid,wavering,lights,pouring,water,over,dying,beaux
for,so,many,of,them,were,her,beaux,and,they,tried,to,smile,when,they,saw,her
there,were,so,many,men,jolting,down,this,dark,dusty,road,whom,she,knew,so,well,so,many,men,dying,here,before,her,eyes,mosquitoes,and,gnats,swarming,their,bloody,faces,men,with,whom,she,had,danced,and,laughed,for,whom,she,had,played,music,and,sung,songs,teased,comforted,and,loved,a,little
she,found,carey,ashburn,on,the,bottom,layer,of,wounded,in,an,ox,cart,barely,alive,from,a,bullet,wound,in,his,head
but,she,could,not,extricate,him,without,disturbing,six,other,wounded,men,so,she,let,him,go,on,to,the,hospital
later,she,heard,he,had,died,before,a,doctor,ever,saw,him,and,was,buried,somewhere,no,one,knew,exactly
so,many,men,had,been,buried,that,month,in,shallow,hastily,dug,graves,at,oakland,cemetery
melanie,felt,it,keenly,that,they,had,not,been,able,to,get,a,lock,of,carey's,hair,to,send,to,his,mother,in,alabama
as,the,hot,night,wore,on,and,their,backs,were,aching,and,their,knees,buckling,from,weariness,scarlett,and,pitty,cried,to,man,after,man,what,news
what,news
and,as,the,long,hours,dragged,past,they,had,their,answer,an,answer,that,made,them,look,whitely,into,each,other's,eyes
we're,falling,back
we've,got,to,fall,back
they,outnumber,us,by,thousands
the,yankees,have,got,wheeler's,cavalry,cut,off,near,decatur

in,a,warm,steaming,rain,the,next,day,the,defeated,army,poured,though,atlanta,by,thousands,exhausted,by,hunger,and,weariness,depleted,by,seventy-six,days,of,battle,and,retreat,their,horses,starved,scarecrows,their,cannon,and,caissons,harnessed,with,odds,and,ends,of,rope,and,strips,of,rawhide
but,they,did,not,come,in,as,disorderly,rabble,in,full,rout
they,marched,in,good,order,jaunty,for,all,their,rags,their,torn,red,battle,flags,flying,in,the,rain
they,had,learned,retreating,under,old,joe,who,had,made,it,as,great,a,feat,of,strategy,as,advancing
the,bearded,shabby,files,swung,down,peachtree,street,to,the,tune,of,maryland
my,maryland
and,all,the,town,turned,out,to,cheer,them
in,victory,or,defeat,they,were,their,boys
the,state,militia,who,had,gone,out,so,short,a,time,before,resplendent,in,new,uniforms,could,hardly,be,distinguished,from,the,seasoned,troops,so,dirty,and,unkempt,were,they
there,was,a,new,look,in,their,eyes
three,years,of,apologizing,of,explaining,why,they,were,not,at,the,front,was,behind,them,now
they,had,traded,security,behind,the,lines,for,the,hardships,of,battle
many,of,their,number,had,traded,easy,living,for,hard,death
they,were,veterans,now,veterans,of,brief,service,but,veterans,just,the,same,and,they,had,acquitted,themselves,well
they,searched,out,the,faces,of,friends,in,the,crowd,and,stared,at,them,proudly,defiantly
they,could,hold,up,their,heads,now
the,old,men,and,boys,of,the,home,guard,marched,by,the,graybeards,almost,too,weary,to,lift,their,feet,the,boys,wearing,the,faces,of,tired,children,confronted,too,early,with,adult,problems
scarlett,caught,sight,of,phil,meade,and,hardly,recognized,him,so,black,was,his,face,with,powder,and,grime,so,taut,with,strain,and,weariness
uncle,henry,went,limping,by,hatless,in,the,rain,his,head,stuck,through,a,hole,in,a,piece,of,old,oilcloth
grandpa,merriwether,rode,in,on,a,gun,carriage,his,bare,feet,tied,in,quilt,scraps
but,search,though,she,might,she,saw,no,sign,of,john,wilkes
johnston's,veterans,however,went,by,with,the,tireless,careless,step,which,had,carried,them,for,three,years,and,they,still,had,the,energy,to,grin,and,wave,at,pretty,girls,and,to,call,rude,gibes,to,men,not,in,uniform
they,were,on,their,way,to,the,entrenchments,that,ringed,the,town,no,shallow,hastily,dug,trenches,these,but,earthworks,breast,high,reinforced,with,sandbags,and,tipped,with,sharpened,staves,of,wood
for,mile,after,mile,the,trenches,encircled,the,town,red,gashes,surmounted,by,red,mounds,waiting,for,the,men,who,would,fill,them
the,crowd,cheered,the,troops,as,they,would,have,cheered,them,in,victory
there,was,fear,in,every,heart,but,now,that,they,knew,the,truth,now,that,the,worst,had,happened,now,that,the,war,was,in,their,front,yard,a,change,came,over,the,town
there,was,no,panic,now,no,hysteria
whatever,lay,in,hearts,did,not,show,on,faces
everyone,looked,cheerful,even,if,the,cheer,was,strained
everyone,tried,to,show,brave,confident,faces,to,the,troops
everyone,repeated,what,old,joe,had,said,just,before,he,was,relieved,of,command,i,can,hold,atlanta,forever
now,that,hood,had,had,to,retreat,quite,a,number,wished,with,the,soldiers,that,they,had,old,joe,back,but,they,forebore,saying,it,and,took,courage,from,old,joe's,remark
i,can,hold,atlanta,forever
not,for,hood,the,cautious,tactics,of,general,johnston
he,assaulted,the,yankees,on,the,east,he,assaulted,them,on,the,west
sherman,was,circling,the,town,like,a,wrestler,seeking,a,fresh,hold,on,an,opponent's,body,and,hood,did,not,remain,behind,his,rifle,pits,waiting,for,the,yankees,to,attack
he,went,out,boldly,to,meet,them,and,savagely,fell,upon,them
within,the,space,of,a,few,days,the,battles,of,atlanta,and,of,ezra,church,were,fought,and,both,of,them,were,major,engagements,which,made,peachtree,creek,seem,like,a,skirmish
but,the,yankees,kept,coming,back,for,more
they,had,suffered,heavy,losses,but,they,could,afford,to,lose
and,all,the,while,their,batteries,poured,shells,into,atlanta,killing,people,in,their,homes,ripping,roofs,off,buildings,tearing,huge,craters,in,the,streets
the,townsfolk,sheltered,as,best,they,could,in,cellars,in,holes,in,the,ground,and,in,shallow,tunnels,dug,in,railroad,cuts
atlanta,was,under,siege
within,eleven,days,after,he,had,taken,command,general,hood,had,lost,almost,as,many,men,as,johnston,had,lost,in,seventy-four,days,of,battle,and,retreat,and,atlanta,was,hemmed,in,on,three,sides
the,railroad,from,atlanta,to,tennessee,was,now,in,sherman's,hands,for,its,full,length
his,army,was,across,the,railroad,to,the,east,and,he,had,cut,the,railroad,running,southwest,to,alabama
only,the,one,railroad,to,the,south,to,macon,and,savannah,was,still,open
the,town,was,crowded,with,soldiers,swamped,with,wounded,jammed,with,refugees,and,this,one,line,was,inadequate,for,the,crying,needs,of,the,stricken,city
but,as,long,as,this,railroad,could,be,held,atlanta,could,still,stand
scarlett,was,terrified,when,she,realized,how,important,this,line,had,become,how,fiercely,sherman,would,fight,to,take,it,how,desperately,hood,would,fight,to,defend,it
for,this,was,the,railroad,which,ran,through,the,county,through,jonesboro
and,tara,was,only,five,miles,from,jonesboro
tara,seemed,like,a,haven,of,refuge,by,comparison,with,the,screaming,hell,of,atlanta,but,tara,was,only,five,miles,from,jonesboro
scarlett,and,many,other,ladies,sat,on,the,flat,roofs,of,stores,shaded,by,their,tiny,parasols,and,watched,the,fighting,on,the,day,of,the,battle,of,atlanta
but,when,shells,began,falling,in,the,streets,for,the,first,time,they,fled,to,the,cellars,and,that,night,the,exodus,of,women,children,and,old,people,from,the,city,began
macon,was,their,destination,and,many,of,those,who,took,the,train,that,night,had,already,refugeed,five,and,six,times,before,as,johnston,fell,back,from,dalton
they,were,traveling,lighter,now,than,when,they,arrived,in,atlanta
most,of,them,carried,only,a,carpetbag,and,a,scanty,lunch,done,up,in,a,bandana,handkerchief
here,and,there,frightened,servants,carried,silver,pitchers,knives,and,forks,and,a,family,portrait,or,two,which,had,been,salvaged,in,the,first,fight
mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,elsing,refused,to,leave
they,were,needed,at,the,hospital,and,furthermore,they,said,proudly,they,weren't,afraid,and,no,yankees,were,going,to,run,them,out,of,their,homes
but,maybelle,and,her,baby,and,fanny,elsing,went,to,macon
mrs,meade,was,disobedient,for,the,first,time,in,her,married,life,and,flatly,refused,to,yield,to,the,doctor's,command,that,she,take,the,train,to,safety
the,doctor,needed,her,she,said
moreover,phil,was,somewhere,in,the,trenches,and,she,wanted,to,be,near,by,in,case
but,mrs,whiting,went,and,many,other,ladies,of,scarlett's,circle
aunt,pitty,who,had,been,the,first,to,denounce,old,joe,for,his,policy,of,retreat,was,among,the,first,to,pack,her,trunks
her,nerves,she,said,were,delicate,and,she,could,not,endure,noises
she,feared,she,might,faint,at,an,explosion,and,not,be,able,to,reach,the,cellar
no,she,was,not,afraid
her,baby,mouth,tried,to,set,in,martial,lines,but,failed
she'd,go,to,macon,and,stay,with,her,cousin,old,mrs,burr,and,the,girls,should,come,with,her
scarlett,did,not,want,to,go,to,macon
frightened,as,she,was,of,the,shells,she'd,rather,stay,in,atlanta,than,go,to,macon,for,she,hated,old,mrs,burr,cordially
years,ago,mrs,burr,had,said,she,was,fast,after,catching,her,kissing,her,son,willie,at,one,of,the,wilkes',house,parties
no,she,told,aunt,pitty,i'll,go,home,to,tara,and,melly,can,go,to,macon,with,you
at,this,melanie,began,to,cry,in,a,frightened,heartbroken,way
when,aunt,pitty,fled,to,get,dr,meade,melanie,caught,scarlett's,hand,in,hers,pleading
dear,don't,go,to,tara,and,leave,me
i'll,be,so,lonely,without,you
oh,scarlett,i'd,just,die,if,you,weren't,with,me,when,the,baby,came
yes,yes,i,know,i've,got,aunt,pitty,and,she,is,sweet
but,after,all,she's,never,had,a,baby,and,sometimes,she,makes,me,so,nervous,i,could,scream
don't,desert,me,darling
you've,been,just,like,a,sister,to,me,and,besides,she,smiled,wanly,you,promised,ashley,you'd,take,care,of,me
he,told,me,he,was,going,to,ask,you
scarlett,stared,down,at,her,in,wonderment
with,her,own,dislike,of,this,woman,so,strong,she,could,barely,conceal,it,how,could,melly,love,her,so
how,could,melly,be,so,stupid,as,not,to,guess,the,secret,of,her,love,of,ashley
she,had,given,herself,away,a,hundred,times,during,these,months,of,torment,waiting,for,news,of,him
but,melanie,saw,nothing,melanie,who,could,see,nothing,but,good,in,anyone,she,loved
yes,she,had,promised,ashley,she,would,look,out,for,melanie
oh,ashley
ashley
you,must,be,dead,dead,these,many,months
and,now,your,promise,reaches,out,and,clutches,me
well,she,said,shortly,i,did,promise,him,that,and,i,don't,go,back,on,my,promises
but,i,won't,go,to,macon,and,stay,with,that,old,burr,cat
i'd,claw,her,eyes,out,in,five,minutes
i'm,going,home,to,tara,and,you,can,come,with,me
mother,would,love,to,have,you
oh,i'd,like,that
your,mother,is,so,sweet
but,you,know,auntie,would,just,die,if,she,wasn't,with,me,when,the,baby,came,and,i,know,she,won't,go,to,tara
it's,too,close,to,the,fighting,and,auntie,wants,to,be,safe
dr,meade,who,had,arrived,out,of,breath,expecting,to,find,melanie,in,premature,labor,at,least,judging,by,aunt,pitty's,alarmed,summoning,was,indignant,and,said,as,much
and,upon,learning,the,cause,of,the,upset,he,settled,the,matter,with,words,that,left,no,room,for,argument
it's,out,of,the,question,for,you,to,go,to,macon,miss,melly
i,won't,answer,for,you,if,you,move
the,trains,are,crowded,and,uncertain,and,the,passengers,are,liable,to,be,put,off,in,the,woods,at,any,time,if,the,trains,are,needed,for,the,wounded,or,troops,and,supplies
in,your,condition
but,if,i,went,to,tara,with,scarlett
i,tell,you,i,won't,have,you,moved
the,train,to,tara,is,the,train,to,macon,and,the,same,conditions,prevail
moreover,no,one,knows,just,where,the,yankees,are,now,but,they,are,all,over,everywhere
your,train,might,even,be,captured
and,even,if,you,reached,jonesboro,safely,there'd,be,a,five-mile,ride,over,a,rough,road,before,you,ever,reached,tara
it's,no,trip,for,a,woman,in,a,delicate,condition
besides,there's,not,a,doctor,in,the,county,since,old,dr,fontaine,joined,the,army
but,there,are,midwives
i,said,a,doctor,he,answered,brusquely,and,his,eyes,unconsciously,went,over,her,tiny,frame
i,won't,have,you,moved
it,might,be,dangerous
you,don't,want,to,have,the,baby,on,the,train,or,in,a,buggy,do,you
this,medical,frankness,reduced,the,ladies,to,embarrassed,blushes,and,silence
you've,got,to,stay,right,here,where,i,can,watch,you,and,you,must,stay,in,bed
no,running,up,and,down,stairs,to,cellars
no,not,even,if,shells,come,right,in,the,window
after,all,there's,not,so,much,danger,here
we'll,have,the,yankees,beaten,back,in,no,time
now,miss,pitty,you,go,right,on,to,macon,and,leave,the,young,ladies,here
unchaperoned
she,cried,aghast
they,are,matrons,said,the,doctor,testily
and,mrs,meade,is,just,two,houses,away
they,won't,be,receiving,any,male,company,anyway,with,miss,melly,in,her,condition
good,heavens,miss,pitty
this,is,war,time
we,can't,think,of,the,proprieties,now
we,must,think,of,miss,melly
he,stamped,out,of,the,room,and,waited,on,the,front,porch,until,scarlett,joined,him
i,shall,talk,frankly,to,you,miss,scarlett,he,began,jerking,at,his,gray,beard
you,seem,to,be,a,young,woman,of,common,sense,so,spare,me,your,blushes
i,do,not,want,to,hear,any,further,talk,about,miss,melly,being,moved
i,doubt,if,she,could,stand,the,trip
she,is,going,to,have,a,difficult,time,even,in,the,best,of,circumstances,very,narrow,in,the,hips,as,you,know,and,probably,will,need,forceps,for,her,delivery,so,i,don't,want,any,ignorant,darky,midwife,meddling,with,her
women,like,her,should,never,have,children,but,anyway,you,pack,miss,pitty's,trunk,and,send,her,to,macon
she's,so,scared,she'll,upset,miss,melly,and,that,won't,do,any,good
and,now,miss,he,fixed,her,with,a,piercing,glance,i,don't,want,to,hear,about,you,going,home,either
you,stay,with,miss,melly,till,the,baby,comes
not,afraid,are,you
oh,no
lied,scarlett,stoutly
that's,a,brave,girl
mrs,meade,will,give,you,whatever,chaperonage,you,need,and,i'll,send,over,old,betsy,to,cook,for,you,if,miss,pitty,wants,to,take,her,servants,with,her
it,won't,be,for,long
the,baby,ought,to,be,here,in,another,five,weeks,but,you,never,can,tell,with,first,babies,and,all,this,shelling,going,on
it,may,come,any,day
so,aunt,pittypat,went,to,macon,in,floods,of,tears,taking,uncle,peter,and,cookie,with,her
the,carriage,and,horse,she,donated,to,the,hospital,in,a,burst,of,patriotism,which,she,immediately,regretted,and,that,brought,on,more,tears
and,scarlett,and,melanie,were,left,alone,with,wade,and,prissy,in,a,house,that,was,much,quieter,even,though,the,cannonading,continued
chapter,xix
in,those,first,days,of,the,siege,when,the,yankees,crashed,here,and,there,against,the,defenses,of,the,city,scarlett,was,so,frightened,by,the,bursting,shells,she,could,only,cower,helplessly,her,hands,over,her,ears,expecting,every,moment,to,be,blown,into,eternity
when,she,heard,the,whistling,screams,that,heralded,their,approach,she,rushed,to,melanie's,room,and,flung,herself,on,the,bed,beside,her,and,the,two,clutched,each,other,screaming,oh
oh
as,they,buried,their,heads,in,the,pillows
prissy,and,wade,scurried,for,the,cellar,and,crouched,in,the,cobwebbed,darkness,prissy,squalling,at,the,top,of,her,voice,and,wade,sobbing,and,hiccoughing
suffocating,under,feather,pillows,while,death,screamed,overhead,scarlett,silently,cursed,melanie,for,keeping,her,from,the,safer,regions,below,stairs
but,the,doctor,had,forbidden,melanie,to,walk,and,scarlett,had,to,stay,with,her
added,to,her,terror,of,being,blown,to,pieces,was,her,equally,active,terror,that,melanie's,baby,might,arrive,at,any,moment
sweat,broke,out,on,scarlett,with,clammy,dampness,whenever,this,thought,entered,her,mind
what,would,she,do,if,the,baby,started,coming
she,knew,she'd,rather,let,melanie,die,than,go,out,on,the,streets,to,hunt,for,the,doctor,when,the,shells,were,falling,like,april,rain
and,she,knew,prissy,could,be,beaten,to,death,before,she,would,venture,forth
what,would,she,do,if,the,baby,came
these,matters,she,discussed,with,prissy,in,whispers,one,evening,as,they,prepared,melanie's,supper,tray,and,prissy,surprisingly,enough,calmed,her,fears
miss,scarlett,effen,we,kain,git,de,doctah,w'en,miss,melly's,time,come,doan,you,bodder
ah,kin,manage
ah,knows,all,'bout,birthin'
ain',mah,ma,a,midwife
ain',she,raise,me,ter,be,a,midwife,too
jes',you,leave,it,ter,me
scarlett,breathed,more,easily,knowing,that,experienced,hands,were,near,but,she,nevertheless,yearned,to,have,the,ordeal,over,and,done,with
mad,to,be,away,from,exploding,shells,desperate,to,get,home,to,the,quiet,of,tara,she,prayed,every,night,that,the,baby,would,arrive,the,next,day,so,she,would,be,released,from,her,promise,and,could,leave,atlanta
tara,seemed,so,safe,so,far,away,from,all,this,misery
scarlett,longed,for,home,and,her,mother,as,she,had,never,longed,for,anything,in,all,her,life
if,she,were,just,near,ellen,she,wouldn't,be,afraid,no,matter,what,happened
every,night,after,a,day,of,screeching,ear-splitting,shells,she,went,to,bed,determined,to,tell,melanie,the,next,morning,that,she,could,not,stand,atlanta,another,day,that,she,would,have,to,go,home,and,melanie,would,have,to,go,to,mrs,meade's
but,as,she,lay,on,her,pillow,there,always,rose,the,memory,of,ashley's,face,as,it,had,looked,when,she,last,saw,him,drawn,as,with,an,inner,pain,but,with,a,little,smile,on,his,lips,you'll,take,care,of,melanie,won't,you
you're,so,strong
promise,me
and,she,had,promised
somewhere,ashley,lay,dead
wherever,he,was,he,was,watching,her,holding,her,to,that,promise
living,or,dead,she,could,not,fail,him,no,matter,what,the,cost
so,she,remained,day,after,day
in,response,to,ellen's,letters,pleading,with,her,to,come,home,she,wrote,minimizing,the,dangers,of,the,siege,explaining,melanie's,predicament,and,promising,to,come,as,soon,as,the,baby,was,born
ellen,sensitive,to,the,bonds,of,kin,be,they,blood,or,marriage,wrote,back,reluctantly,agreeing,that,she,must,stay,but,demanding,wade,and,prissy,be,sent,home,immediately
this,suggestion,met,with,the,complete,approval,of,prissy,who,was,now,reduced,to,teeth-,chattering,idiocy,at,every,unexpected,sound
she,spent,so,much,time,crouching,in,the,cellar,that,the,girls,would,have,fared,badly,but,for,mrs,meade's,stolid,old,betsy
scarlett,was,as,anxious,as,her,mother,to,have,wade,out,of,atlanta,not,only,for,the,child's,safety,but,because,his,constant,fear,irritated,her
wade,was,terrified,to,speechlessness,by,the,shelling,and,even,when,lulls,came,he,clung,to,scarlett's,skirts,too,terrified,to,cry
he,was,afraid,to,go,to,bed,at,night,afraid,of,the,dark,afraid,to,sleep,lest,the,yankees,should,come,and,get,him,and,the,sound,of,his,soft,nervous,whimpering,in,the,night,grated,unendurably,on,her,nerves
secretly,she,was,just,as,frightened,as,he,was,but,it,angered,her,to,be,reminded,of,it,every,minute,by,his,tense,drawn,face
yes,tara,was,the,place,for,wade
prissy,should,take,him,there,and,return,immediately,to,be,present,when,the,baby,came
but,before,scarlett,could,start,the,two,on,their,homeward,journey,news,came,that,the,yankees,had,swung,to,the,south,and,were,skirmishing,along,the,railroad,between,atlanta,and,jonesboro
suppose,the,yankees,should,capture,the,train,on,which,wade,and,prissy,were,riding,scarlett,and,melanie,turned,pale,at,the,thought,for,everyone,knew,that,yankee,atrocities,on,helpless,children,were,even,more,dreadful,than,on,women
so,she,feared,to,send,him,home,and,he,remained,in,atlanta,a,frightened,silent,little,ghost,pattering,about,desperately,after,his,mother,fearing,to,have,her,skirt,out,of,his,hand,for,even,a,minute
the,siege,went,on,through,the,hot,days,of,july,thundering,days,following,nights,of,sullen,ominous,stillness,and,the,town,began,to,adjust,itself
it,was,as,though,the,worst,having,happened,they,had,nothing,more,to,fear
they,had,feared,a,siege,and,now,they,had,a,siege,and,after,all,it,wasn't,so,bad
life,could,and,did,go,on,almost,as,usual
they,knew,they,were,sitting,on,a,volcano,but,until,that,volcano,erupted,there,was,nothing,they,could,do
so,why,worry,now
and,probably,it,wouldn't,erupt,anyway
just,look,how,general,hood,is,holding,the,yankees,out,of,the,city
and,see,how,the,cavalry,is,holding,the,railroad,to,macon
sherman,will,never,take,it
but,for,all,their,apparent,insouciance,in,the,face,of,falling,shells,and,shorter,rations,for,all,their,ignoring,the,yankees,barely,half,a,mile,away,and,for,all,their,boundless,confidence,in,the,ragged,line,of,gray,men,in,the,rifle,pits,there,pulsed,just,below,the,skin,of,atlanta,a,wild,uncertainty,over,what,the,next,day,would,bring
suspense,worry,sorrow,hunger,and,the,torment,of,rising,falling,rising,hope,was,wearing,that,skin,thin
gradually,scarlett,drew,courage,from,the,brave,faces,of,her,friends,and,from,the,merciful,adjustment,which,nature,makes,when,what,cannot,be,cured,must,be,endured
to,be,sure,she,still,jumped,at,the,sound,of,explosions,but,she,did,not,run,screaming,to,burrow,her,head,under,melanie's,pillow
she,could,now,gulp,and,say,weakly,that,was,close,wasn't,it
she,was,less,frightened,also,because,life,had,taken,on,the,quality,of,a,dream,a,dream,too,terrible,to,be,real
it,wasn't,possible,that,she,scarlett,o'hara,should,be,in,such,a,predicament,with,the,danger,of,death,about,her,every,hour,every,minute
it,wasn't,possible,that,the,quiet,tenor,of,life,could,have,changed,so,completely,in,so,short,a,time
it,was,unreal,grotesquely,unreal,that,morning,skies,which,dawned,so,tenderly,blue,could,be,profaned,with,cannon,smoke,that,hung,over,the,town,like,low,thunder,clouds,that,warm,noontides,filled,with,the,piercing,sweetness,of,massed,honeysuckle,and,climbing,roses,could,be,so,fearful,as,shells,screamed,into,the,streets,bursting,like,the,crack,of,doom,throwing,iron,splinters,hundreds,of,yards,blowing,people,and,animals,to,bits
quiet,drowsy,afternoon,siestas,had,ceased,to,be,for,though,the,clamor,of,battle,might,lull,from,time,to,time,peachtree,street,was,alive,and,noisy,at,all,hours,cannon,and,ambulances,rumbling,by,wounded,stumbling,in,from,the,rifle,pits,regiments,hurrying,past,at,double-quick,ordered,from,the,ditches,on,one,side,of,town,to,the,defense,of,some,hard-pressed,earthworks,on,the,other,and,couriers,dashing,headlong,down,the,street,toward,headquarters,as,though,the,fate,of,the,confederacy,hung,on,them
the,hot,nights,brought,a,measure,of,quiet,but,it,was,a,sinister,quiet
when,the,night,was,still,it,was,too,still,as,though,the,tree,frogs,katydids,and,sleepy,mockingbirds,were,too,frightened,to,raise,their,voices,in,the,usual,summer-night,chorus
now,and,again,the,quiet,was,broken,sharply,by,the,crack-cracking,of,musket,fire,in,the,last,line,of,defenses
often,in,the,late,night,hours,when,the,lamps,were,out,and,melanie,asleep,and,deathly,silence,pressed,over,the,town,scarlett,lying,awake,heard,the,latch,of,the,front,gate,click,and,soft,urgent,tappings,on,the,front,door
always,faceless,soldiers,stood,on,the,dark,porch,and,from,the,darkness,many,different,voices,spoke,to,her
sometimes,a,cultured,voice,came,from,the,shadows,madam,my,abject,apologies,for,disturbing,you,but,could,i,have,water,for,myself,and,my,horse
sometimes,it,was,the,hard,burring,of,a,mountain,voice,sometimes,the,odd,nasals,of,the,flat,wiregrass,country,to,the,far,south,occasionally,the,lulling,drawl,of,the,coast,that,caught,at,her,heart,reminding,her,of,ellen's,voice
missy,i,got,a,pardner,here,who,i,wuz,aimin',ter,git,ter,the,horsepittle,but,looks,like,he,ain't,goin',ter,last,that,fer
kin,you,take,him,in
lady,i,shore,could,do,with,some,vittles
i'd,shore,relish,a,corn,pone,if,it,didn't,deprive,you,none
madam,forgive,my,intrusion,but,could,i,spend,the,night,on,your,porch
i,saw,the,roses,and,smelled,the,honeysuckle,and,it,was,so,much,like,home,that,i,was,emboldened
no,these,nights,were,not,real
they,were,a,nightmare,and,the,men,were,part,of,that,nightmare,men,without,bodies,or,faces,only,tired,voices,speaking,to,her,from,the,warm,dark
draw,water,serve,food,lay,pillows,on,the,front,porch,bind,wounds,hold,the,dirty,heads,of,the,dying
no,this,could,not,be,happening,to,her
once,late,in,july,it,was,uncle,henry,hamilton,who,came,tapping,in,the,night
uncle,henry,was,minus,his,umbrella,and,carpetbag,now,and,his,fat,stomach,as,well
the,skin,of,his,pink,fat,face,hung,down,in,loose,folds,like,the,dewlaps,of,a,bulldog,and,his,long,white,hair,was,indescribably,dirty
he,was,almost,barefoot,crawling,with,lice,and,he,was,hungry,but,his,irascible,spirit,was,unimpaired
despite,his,remark,it's,a,foolish,war,when,old,fools,like,me,are,out,toting,guns,the,girls,received,the,impression,that,uncle,henry,was,enjoying,himself
he,was,needed,like,the,young,men,and,he,was,doing,a,young,man's,work
moreover,he,could,keep,up,with,the,young,men,which,was,more,than,grandpa,merriwether,could,do,he,told,them,gleefully
grandpa's,lumbago,was,troubling,him,greatly,and,the,captain,wanted,to,discharge,him
but,grandpa,wouldn't,go,home
he,said,frankly,that,he,preferred,the,captain's,swearing,and,bullying,to,his,daughter-in-law's,coddling,and,her,incessant,demands,that,he,give,up,chewing,tobacco,and,launder,his,beard,every,day
uncle,henry's,visit,was,brief,for,he,had,only,a,four-hour,furlough,and,he,needed,half,of,it,for,the,long,walk,in,from,the,breastworks,and,back
girls,i'm,not,going,to,see,you,all,for,a,while,he,announced,as,he,sat,in,melanie's,bedroom,luxuriously,wriggling,his,blistered,feet,in,the,tub,of,cold,water,scarlett,had,set,before,him
our,company,is,going,out,in,the,morning
where
questioned,melanie,frightened,clutching,his,arm
don't,put,your,hand,on,me,said,uncle,henry,irritably
i'm,crawling,with,lice
war,would,be,a,picnic,if,it,wasn't,for,lice,and,dysentery
where'm,i,going
well,i,haven't,been,told,but,i've,got,a,good,idea
we're,marching,south,toward,jonesboro,in,the,morning,unless,i'm,greatly,in,error
oh,why,toward,jonesboro
because,there's,going,to,be,big,fighting,there,missy
the,yankees,are,going,to,take,the,railroad,if,they,possibly,can
and,if,they,do,take,it,it's,good-by,atlanta
oh,uncle,henry,do,you,think,they,will
shucks,girls
no
how,can,they,when,i'm,there
uncle,henry,grinned,at,their,frightened,faces,and,then,becoming,serious,again,it's,going,to,be,a,hard,fight,girls
we've,got,to,win,it
you,know,of,course,that,the,yankees,have,got,all,the,railroads,except,the,one,to,macon,but,that,isn't,all,they've,got
maybe,you,girls,didn't,know,it,but,they've,got,every,road,too,every,wagon,lane,and,bridle,path,except,the,mcdonough,road
atlanta's,in,a,bag,and,the,strings,of,the,bag,are,at,jonesboro
and,if,the,yankees,can,take,the,railroad,there,they,can,pull,up,the,strings,and,have,us,just,like,a,possum,in,a,poke
so,we,don't,aim,to,let,them,get,that,railroad
i,may,be,gone,a,while,girls
i,just,came,in,to,tell,you,all,good-by,and,to,make,sure,scarlett,was,still,with,you,melly
of,course,she's,with,me,said,melanie,fondly
don't,you,worry,about,us,uncle,henry,and,do,take,care,of,yourself
uncle,henry,wiped,his,wet,feet,on,the,rag,rug,and,groaned,as,he,drew,on,his,tattered,shoes
i,got,to,be,going,he,said
i've,got,five,miles,to,walk
scarlett,you,fix,me,up,some,kind,of,lunch,to,take
anything,you've,got
after,he,had,kissed,melanie,good-by,he,went,down,to,the,kitchen,where,scarlett,was,wrapping,a,corn,pone,and,some,apples,in,a,napkin
uncle,henry,is,it,is,it,really,so,serious
serious
god'lmighty,yes
don't,be,a,goose
we're,in,the,last,ditch
do,you,think,they'll,get,to,tara
why,began,uncle,henry,irritated,at,the,feminine,mind,which,thought,only,of,personal,things,when,broad,issues,were,involved
then,seeing,her,frightened,woebegone,face,he,softened
of,course,they,won't
tara's,five,miles,from,the,railroad,and,it's,the,railroad,the,yankees,want
you've,got,no,more,sense,than,a,june,bug,missy
he,broke,off,abruptly
i,didn't,walk,all,this,way,here,tonight,just,to,tell,you,all,good-by
i,came,to,bring,melly,some,bad,news,but,when,i,got,up,to,it,i,just,couldn't,tell,her
so,i'm,going,to,leave,it,to,you,to,do
ashley,isn't,you,haven't,heard,anything,that,he's,dead
now,how,would,i,be,hearing,about,ashley,when,i've,been,standing,in,rifle,pits,up,to,the,seat,of,my,pants,in,mud
the,old,gentleman,asked,testily
no
it's,about,his,father
john,wilkes,is,dead
scarlett,sat,down,suddenly,the,half-wrapped,lunch,in,her,hand
i,came,to,tell,melly,but,i,couldn't
you,must,do,it
and,give,her,these
he,hauled,from,his,pockets,a,heavy,gold,watch,with,dangling,seals,a,small,miniature,of,the,long,dead,mrs,wilkes,and,a,pair,of,massive,cuff,buttons
at,the,sight,of,the,watch,which,she,had,seen,in,john,wilkes',hands,a,thousand,times,the,full,realization,came,over,scarlett,that,ashley's,father,was,really,dead
and,she,was,too,stunned,to,cry,or,to,speak
uncle,henry,fidgeted,coughed,and,did,not,look,at,her,lest,he,catch,sight,of,a,tear,that,would,upset,him
he,was,a,brave,man,scarlett
tell,melly,that
tell,her,to,write,it,to,his,girls
and,a,good,soldier,for,all,his,years
a,shell,got,him
came,right,down,on,him,and,his,horse
tore,the,horse's,i,shot,the,horse,myself,poor,creature
a,fine,little,mare,she,was
you'd,better,write,mrs,tarleton,about,that,too
she,set,a,store,on,that,mare
wrap,up,my,lunch,child
i,must,be,going
there,dear,don't,take,it,so,hard
what,better,way,can,an,old,man,die,than,doing,a,young,man's,work
oh,he,shouldn't,have,died
he,shouldn't,have,ever,gone,to,the,war
he,should,have,lived,and,seen,his,grandchild,grow,up,and,died,peacefully,in,bed
oh,why,did,he,go
he,didn't,believe,in,secession,and,he,hated,the,war,and
plenty,of,us,think,that,way,but,what,of,it
uncle,henry,blew,his,nose,grumpily
do,you,think,i,enjoy,letting,yankee,riflemen,use,me,for,a,target,at,my,age
but,there's,no,other,choice,for,a,gentleman,these,days
kiss,me,good-by,child,and,don't,worry,about,me
i'll,come,through,this,war,safely
scarlett,kissed,him,and,heard,him,go,down,the,steps,into,the,dark,heard,the,latch,click,on,the,front,gate
she,stood,for,a,minute,looking,at,the,keepsakes,in,her,hand
and,then,she,went,up,the,stairs,to,tell,melanie
at,the,end,of,july,came,the,unwelcome,news,predicted,by,uncle,henry,that,the,yankees,had,swung,around,again,toward,jonesboro
they,had,cut,the,railroad,four,miles,below,the,town,but,they,had,been,beaten,off,by,the,confederate,cavalry,and,the,engineering,corps,sweating,in,the,broiling,sun,had,repaired,the,line
scarlett,was,frantic,with,anxiety
for,three,days,she,waited,fear,growing,in,her,heart
then,a,reassuring,letter,came,from,gerald
the,enemy,had,not,reached,tara
they,had,heard,the,sound,of,the,fight,but,they,had,seen,no,yankees
gerald's,letter,was,so,full,of,brag,and,bluster,as,to,how,the,yankees,had,been,driven,from,the,railroad,that,one,would,have,thought,he,personally,had,accomplished,the,feat,single,handed
he,wrote,for,three,pages,about,the,gallantry,of,the,troops,and,then,at,the,end,of,his,letter,mentioned,briefly,that,carreen,was,ill,the,typhoid,mrs,o'hara,said,it,was
she,was,not,very,ill,and,scarlett,was,not,to,worry,about,her,but,on,no,condition,must,she,come,home,now,even,if,the,railroad,should,become,safe
mrs,o'hara,was,very,glad,now,that,scarlett,and,wade,had,not,come,home,when,the,siege,began
mrs,o'hara,said,scarlett,must,go,to,church,and,say,some,rosaries,for,carreen's,recovery
scarlett's,conscience,smote,her,at,this,last,for,it,had,been,months,since,she,had,been,to,church
once,she,would,have,thought,this,omission,a,mortal,sin,but,somehow,staying,away,from,church,did,not,seem,so,sinful,now,as,it,formerly,had
but,she,obeyed,her,mother,and,going,to,her,room,gabbled,a,hasty,rosary
when,she,rose,from,her,knees,she,did,not,feel,as,comforted,as,she,had,formerly,felt,after,prayer
for,some,time,she,had,felt,that,god,was,not,watching,out,for,her,the,confederates,or,the,south,in,spite,of,the,millions,of,prayers,ascending,to,him,daily
that,night,she,sat,on,the,front,porch,with,gerald's,letter,in,her,bosom,where,she,could,touch,it,occasionally,and,bring,tara,and,ellen,closer,to,her
the,lamp,in,the,parlor,window,threw,odd,golden,shadows,onto,the,dark,vine-shrouded,porch,and,the,matted,tangle,of,yellow,climbing,roses,and,honeysuckle,made,a,wall,of,mingled,fragrance,about,her
the,night,was,utterly,still
not,even,the,crack,of,a,rifle,had,sounded,since,sunset,and,the,world,seemed,far,away
scarlett,rocked,back,and,forth,lonely,miserable,since,reading,the,news,from,tara,wishing,that,someone,anyone,even,mrs,merriwether,were,with,her
but,mrs,merriwether,was,on,night,duty,at,the,hospital,mrs,meade,was,at,home,making,a,feast,for,phil,who,was,in,from,the,front,lines,and,melanie,was,asleep
there,was,not,even,the,hope,of,a,chance,caller
visitors,had,fallen,off,to,nothing,this,last,week,for,every,man,who,could,walk,was,in,the,rifle,pits,or,chasing,the,yankees,about,the,countryside,near,jonesboro
it,was,not,often,that,she,was,alone,like,this,and,she,did,not,like,it
when,she,was,alone,she,had,to,think,and,these,days,thoughts,were,not,so,pleasant
like,everyone,else,she,had,fallen,into,the,habit,of,thinking,of,the,past,the,dead
tonight,when,atlanta,was,so,quiet,she,could,close,her,eyes,and,imagine,she,was,back,in,the,rural,stillness,of,tara,and,that,life,was,unchanged,unchanging
but,she,knew,that,life,in,the,county,would,never,be,the,same,again
she,thought,of,the,four,tarletons,the,red-haired,twins,and,tom,and,boyd,and,a,passionate,sadness,caught,at,her,throat
why,either,stu,or,brent,might,have,been,her,husband
but,now,when,the,war,was,over,and,she,went,back,to,tara,to,live,she,would,never,again,hear,their,wild,halloos,as,they,dashed,up,the,avenue,of,cedars
and,raiford,calvert,who,danced,so,divinely,would,never,again,choose,her,to,be,his,partner
and,the,munroe,boys,and,little,joe,fontaine,and
oh,ashley
she,sobbed,dropping,her,head,into,her,hands
i'll,never,get,used,to,you,being,gone
she,heard,the,front,gate,click,and,she,hastily,raised,her,head,and,dashed,her,hand,across,her,wet,eyes
she,rose,and,saw,it,was,rhett,butler,coming,up,the,walk,carrying,his,wide,panama,hat,in,his,hand
she,had,not,seen,him,since,the,day,when,she,had,alighted,from,his,carriage,so,precipitously,at,five,points
on,that,occasion,she,had,expressed,the,desire,never,to,lay,eyes,on,him,again
but,she,was,so,glad,now,to,have,someone,to,talk,to,someone,to,divert,her,thoughts,from,ashley,that,she,hastily,put,the,memory,from,her,mind
evidently,he,had,forgotten,the,contretemps,or,pretended,to,have,forgotten,it,for,he,settled,himself,on,the,top,step,at,her,feet,without,mention,of,their,late,difference
so,you,didn't,refugee,to,macon
i,heard,that,miss,pitty,had,retreated,and,of,course,i,thought,you,had,gone,too
so,when,i,saw,your,light,i,came,here,to,investigate
why,did,you,stay
to,keep,melanie,company
you,see,she,well,she,can't,refugee,just,now
thunderation,he,said,and,in,the,lamplight,she,saw,that,he,was,frowning
you,don't,mean,to,tell,me,mrs,wilkes,is,still,here
i,never,heard,of,such,idiocy
it's,quite,dangerous,for,her,in,her,condition
scarlett,was,silent,embarrassed,for,melanie's,condition,was,not,a,subject,she,could,discuss,with,a,man
she,was,embarrassed,too,that,rhett,should,know,it,was,dangerous,for,melanie
such,knowledge,sat,ill,upon,a,bachelor
it's,quite,ungallant,of,you,not,to,think,that,i,might,get,hurt,too,she,said,tartly
his,eyes,flickered,with,amusement
i'd,back,you,against,the,yankees,any,day
i'm,not,sure,that,that's,a,compliment,she,said,uncertainly
it,isn't,he,answered
when,will,you,stop,looking,for,compliments,in,men's,lightest,utterances
when,i'm,on,my,deathbed,she,replied,and,smiled,thinking,that,there,would,always,be,men,to,compliment,her,even,if,rhett,never,did
vanity,vanity,he,said
at,least,you,are,frank,about,it
he,opened,his,cigar,case,extracted,a,black,cigar,and,held,it,to,his,nose,for,a,moment
a,match,flared,he,leaned,back,against,a,post,and,clasping,his,hands,about,his,knees,smoked,a,while,in,silence
scarlett,resumed,her,rocking,and,the,still,darkness,of,the,warm,night,closed,about,them
the,mockingbird,which,nested,in,the,tangle,of,roses,and,honeysuckle,roused,from,slumber,and,gave,one,timid,liquid,note
then,as,if,thinking,better,of,the,matter,it,was,silent,again
from,the,shadow,of,the,porch,rhett,suddenly,laughed,a,low,soft,laugh
so,you,stayed,with,mrs,wilkes
this,is,the,strangest,situation,i,ever,encountered
i,see,nothing,strange,about,it,she,answered,uncomfortably,immediately,on,the,alert
no
but,then,you,lack,the,impersonal,viewpoint
my,impression,has,been,for,some,time,past,that,you,could,hardly,endure,mrs,wilkes
you,think,her,silly,and,stupid,and,her,patriotic,notions,bore,you
you,seldom,pass,by,the,opportunity,to,slip,in,some,belittling,remark,about,her,so,naturally,it,seems,strange,to,me,that,you,should,elect,to,do,the,unselfish,thing,and,stay,here,with,her,during,this,shelling
now,just,why,did,you,do,it
because,she's,charlie's,sister,and,like,a,sister,to,me,answered,scarlett,with,as,much,dignity,as,possible,though,her,cheeks,were,growing,hot
you,mean,because,she's,ashley's,wilkes',widow
scarlett,rose,quickly,struggling,with,her,anger
i,was,almost,on,the,point,of,forgiving,you,for,your,former,boorish,conduct,but,now,i,shan't,do,it
i,wouldn't,have,ever,let,you,come,upon,this,porch,at,all,if,i,hadn't,been,feeling,so,blue,and
sit,down,and,smooth,your,ruffled,fur,he,said,and,his,voice,changed
he,reached,up,and,taking,her,hand,pulled,her,back,into,her,chair
why,are,you,blue
oh,i,had,a,letter,from,tara,today
the,yankees,are,close,to,home,and,my,little,sister,is,ill,with,typhoid,and,and,so,now,even,if,i,could,go,home,like,i,want,to,mother,wouldn't,let,me,for,fear,i'd,catch,it,too
oh,dear,and,i,do,so,want,to,go,home
well,don't,cry,about,it,he,said,but,his,voice,was,kinder
you,are,much,safer,here,in,atlanta,even,if,the,yankees,do,come,than,you'd,be,at,tara
the,yankees,won't,hurt,you,and,typhoid,would
the,yankees,wouldn't,hurt,me
how,can,you,say,such,a,lie
my,dear,girl,the,yankees,aren't,fiends
they,haven't,horns,and,hoofs,as,you,seem,to,think
they,are,pretty,much,like,southerners,except,with,worse,manners,of,course,and,terrible,accents
why,the,yankees,would
rape,you
i,think,not
though,of,course,they'd,want,to
if,you,are,going,to,talk,vilely,i,shall,go,into,the,house,she,cried,grateful,that,the,shadows,hid,her,crimson,face
be,frank
wasn't,that,what,you,were,thinking
oh,certainly,not
oh,but,it,was
no,use,getting,mad,at,me,for,reading,your,thoughts
that's,what,all,our,delicately,nurtured,and,pure-minded,southern,ladies,think
they,have,it,on,their,minds,constantly
i'll,wager,even,dowagers,like,mrs,merriwether
scarlett,gulped,in,silence,remembering,that,wherever,two,or,more,matrons,were,gathered,together,in,these,trying,days,they,whispered,of,such,happenings,always,in,virginia,or,tennessee,or,lousiana,never,close,to,home
the,yankees,raped,women,and,ran,bayonets,through,children's,stomachs,and,burned,houses,over,the,heads,of,old,people
everyone,knew,these,things,were,true,even,if,they,didn't,shout,them,on,the,street,corners
and,if,rhett,had,any,decency,he,would,realize,they,were,true
and,not,talk,about,them
and,it,wasn't,any,laughing,matter,either
she,could,hear,him,chuckling,softly
sometimes,he,was,odious
in,fact,most,of,the,time,he,was,odious
it,was,awful,for,a,man,to,know,what,women,really,thought,about,and,talked,about
it,made,a,girl,feel,positively,undressed
and,no,man,ever,learned,such,things,from,good,women,either
she,was,indignant,that,he,had,read,her,mind
she,liked,to,believe,herself,a,thing,of,mystery,to,men,but,she,knew,rhett,thought,her,as,transparent,as,glass
speaking,of,such,matters,he,continued,have,you,a,protector,or,chaperon,in,the,house
the,admirable,mrs,merriwether,or,mrs,meade
they,always,look,at,me,as,if,they,knew,i,was,here,for,no,good,purpose
mrs,meade,usually,comes,over,at,night,answered,scarlett,glad,to,change,the,subject
but,she,couldn't,tonight
phil,her,boy,is,home
what,luck,he,said,softly,to,find,you,alone
something,in,his,voice,made,her,heart,beat,pleasantly,faster,and,she,felt,her,face,flush
she,had,heard,that,note,in,men's,voices,often,enough,to,know,that,it,presaged,a,declaration,of,love
oh,what,fun
if,he,would,just,say,he,loved,her,how,she,would,torment,him,and,get,even,with,him,for,all,the,sarcastic,remarks,he,had,flung,at,her,these,past,three,years
she,would,lead,him,a,chase,that,would,make,up,for,even,that,awful,humiliation,of,the,day,he,witnessed,her,slapping,ashley
and,then,she'd,tell,him,sweetly,she,could,only,be,a,sister,to,him,and,retire,with,the,full,honors,of,war
she,laughed,nervously,in,pleasant,anticipation
don't,giggle,he,said,and,taking,her,hand,he,turned,it,over,and,pressed,his,lips,into,the,palm
something,vital,electric,leaped,from,him,to,her,at,the,touch,of,his,warm,mouth,something,that,caressed,her,whole,body,thrillingly
his,lips,traveled,to,her,wrist,and,she,knew,he,must,feel,the,leap,of,her,pulse,as,her,heart,quickened,and,she,tried,to,draw,back,her,hand
she,had,not,bargained,on,this,this,treacherous,warm,tide,of,feeling,that,made,her,want,to,run,her,hands,through,his,hair,to,feel,his,lips,upon,her,mouth
she,wasn't,in,love,with,him,she,told,herself,confusedly
she,was,in,love,with,ashley
but,how,to,explain,this,feeling,that,made,her,hands,shake,and,the,pit,of,her,stomach,grow,cold
he,laughed,softly
don't,pull,away
i,won't,hurt,you
hurt,me
i'm,not,afraid,of,you,rhett,butler,or,of,any,man,in,shoe,leather
she,cried,furious,that,her,voice,shook,as,well,as,her,hands
an,admirable,sentiment,but,do,lower,your,voice
mrs,wilkes,might,hear,you
and,pray,compose,yourself
he,sounded,as,though,delighted,at,her,flurry
scarlett,you,do,like,me,don't,you
that,was,more,like,what,she,was,expecting
well,sometimes,she,answered,cautiously
when,you,aren't,acting,like,a,varmint
he,laughed,again,and,held,the,palm,of,her,hand,against,his,hard,cheek
i,think,you,like,me,because,i,am,a,varmint
you've,known,so,few,dyed-in-the-wool,varmints,in,your,sheltered,life,that,my,very,difference,holds,a,quaint,charm,for,you
this,was,not,the,turn,she,had,anticipated,and,she,tried,again,without,success,to,pull,her,hand,free
that's,not,true
i,like,nice,men,men,you,can,depend,on,to,always,be,gentlemanly
you,mean,men,you,can,always,bully
it's,merely,a,matter,of,definition
but,no,matter
he,kissed,her,palm,again,and,again,the,skin,on,the,back,of,her,neck,crawled,excitingly
but,you,do,like,me
could,you,ever,love,me,scarlett
ah
she,thought,triumphantly
now,i've,got,him
and,she,answered,with,studied,coolness,indeed,no
that,is,not,unless,you,mended,your,manners,considerably
and,i,have,no,intention,of,mending,them
so,you,could,not,love,me
that,is,as,i,hoped
for,while,i,like,you,immensely,i,do,not,love,you,and,it,would,be,tragic,indeed,for,you,to,suffer,twice,from,unrequited,love,wouldn't,it,dear
may,i,call,you,'dear,',mrs,hamilton
i,shall,call,you,'dear',whether,you,like,it,or,not,so,no,matter,but,the,proprieties,must,be,observed
you,don't,love,me
no,indeed
did,you,hope,that,i,did
don't,be,so,presumptuous
you,hoped
alas,to,blight,your,hopes
i,should,love,you,for,you,are,charming,and,talented,at,many,useless,accomplishments
but,many,ladies,have,charm,and,accomplishments,and,are,just,as,useless,as,you,are
no,i,don't,love,you
but,i,do,like,you,tremendously,for,the,elasticity,of,your,conscience,for,the,selfishness,which,you,seldom,trouble,to,hide,and,for,the,shrewd,practicality,in,you,which,i,fear,you,get,from,some,not,too,remote,irish-peasant,ancestor
peasant
why,he,was,insulting,her
she,began,to,splutter,wordlessly
don't,interrupt,he,begged,squeezing,her,hand
i,like,you,because,i,have,those,same,qualities,in,me,and,like,begets,liking
i,realize,you,still,cherish,the,memory,of,the,godlike,and,wooden-,headed,mr,wilkes,who's,probably,been,in,his,grave,these,six,months
but,there,must,be,room,in,your,heart,for,me,too
scarlett,do,stop,wriggling
i,am,making,you,a,declaration
i,have,wanted,you,since,the,first,time,i,laid,eyes,on,you,in,the,hall,of,twelve,oaks,when,you,were,bewitching,poor,charlie,hamilton
i,want,you,more,than,i,have,ever,wanted,any,woman,and,i've,waited,longer,for,you,than,i've,ever,waited,for,any,woman
she,was,breathless,with,surprise,at,his,last,words
in,spite,of,all,his,insults,he,did,love,her,and,he,was,just,so,contrary,he,didn't,want,to,come,out,frankly,and,put,it,into,words,for,fear,she'd,laugh
well,she'd,show,him,and,right,quickly
are,you,asking,me,to,marry,you
he,dropped,her,hand,and,laughed,so,loudly,she,shrank,back,in,her,chair
good,lord,no
didn't,i,tell,you,i,wasn't,a,marrying,man
but,but,what
he,rose,to,his,feet,and,hand,on,heart,made,her,a,burlesque,bow
dear,he,said,quietly,i,am,complimenting,your,intelligence,by,asking,you,to,be,my,mistress,without,having,first,seduced,you
mistress
her,mind,shouted,the,word,shouted,that,she,had,been,vilely,insulted
but,in,that,first,startled,moment,she,did,not,feel,insulted
she,only,felt,a,furious,surge,of,indignation,that,he,should,think,her,such,a,fool
he,must,think,her,a,fool,if,he,offered,her,a,proposition,like,that,instead,of,the,proposal,of,matrimony,she,had,been,expecting
rage,punctured,vanity,and,disappointment,threw,her,mind,into,a,turmoil,and,before,she,even,thought,of,the,high,moral,grounds,on,which,she,should,upbraid,him,she,blurted,out,the,first,words,which,came,to,her,lips
mistress
what,would,i,get,out,of,that,except,a,passel,of,brats
and,then,her,jaw,dropped,in,horror,as,she,realized,what,she,had,said
he,laughed,until,he,choked,peering,at,her,in,the,shadows,as,she,sat,stricken,dumb,pressing,her,handkerchief,to,her,mouth
that's,why,i,like,you
you,are,the,only,frank,woman,i,know,the,only,woman,who,looks,on,the,practical,side,of,matters,without,beclouding,the,issue,with,mouthings,about,sin,and,morality
any,other,woman,would,have,swooned,first,and,then,shown,me,the,door
scarlett,leaped,to,her,feet,her,face,red,with,shame
how,could,she,have,said,such,a,thing
how,could,she,ellen's,daughter,with,her,upbringing,have,sat,there,and,listened,to,such,debasing,words,and,then,made,such,a,shameless,reply
she,should,have,screamed
she,should,have,fainted
she,should,have,turned,coldly,away,in,silence,and,swept,from,the,porch
too,late,now
i,will,show,you,the,door,she,shouted,not,caring,if,melanie,or,the,meades,down,the,street,did,hear,her
get,out
how,dare,you,say,such,things,to,me
what,have,i,ever,done,to,encourage,you,to,make,you,suppose
get,out,and,don't,ever,come,back,here
i,mean,it,this,time
don't,you,ever,come,back,here,with,any,of,your,piddling,papers,of,pins,and,ribbons,thinking,i'll,forgive,you
i'll,i'll,tell,my,father,and,he'll,kill,you
he,picked,up,his,hat,and,bowed,and,she,saw,in,the,light,of,the,lamp,that,his,teeth,were,showing,in,a,smile,beneath,his,mustache
he,was,not,ashamed,he,was,amused,at,what,she,had,said,and,he,was,watching,her,with,alert,interest
oh,he,was,detestable
she,swung,round,on,her,heel,and,marched,into,the,house
she,grabbed,hold,of,the,door,to,shut,it,with,a,bang,but,the,hook,which,held,it,open,was,too,heavy,for,her
she,struggled,with,it,panting
may,i,help,you
he,asked
feeling,that,she,would,burst,a,blood,vessel,if,she,stayed,another,minute,she,stormed,up,the,stairs
and,as,she,reached,the,upper,floor,she,heard,him,obligingly,slam,the,door,for,her
chapter,xx
as,the,hot,noisy,days,of,august,were,drawing,to,a,close,the,bombardment,abruptly,ceased
the,quiet,that,fell,on,the,town,was,startling
neighbors,met,on,the,streets,and,stared,at,one,another,uncertain,uneasy,as,to,what,might,be,impending
the,stillness,after,the,screaming,days,brought,no,surcease,to,strained,nerves,but,if,possible,made,the,strain,even,worse
no,one,knew,why,the,yankee,batteries,were,silent,there,was,no,news,of,the,troops,except,that,they,had,been,withdrawn,in,large,numbers,from,the,breastworks,about,the,town,and,had,marched,off,toward,the,south,to,defend,the,railroad
no,one,knew,where,the,fighting,was,if,indeed,there,was,any,fighting,or,how,the,battle,was,going,if,there,was,a,battle
nowadays,the,only,news,was,that,which,passed,from,mouth,to,mouth
short,of,paper,short,of,ink,short,of,men,the,newspapers,had,suspended,publication,after,the,siege,began,and,the,wildest,rumors,appeared,from,nowhere,and,swept,through,the,town
now,in,the,anxious,quiet,crowds,stormed,general,hood's,headquarters,demanding,information,crowds,massed,about,the,telegraph,office,and,the,depot,hoping,for,tidings,good,tidings,for,everyone,hoped,that,the,silence,of,sherman's,cannon,meant,that,the,yankees,were,in,full,retreat,and,the,confederates,chasing,them,back,up,the,road,to,dalton
but,no,news,came
the,telegraph,wires,were,still,no,trains,came,in,on,the,one,remaining,railroad,from,the,south,and,the,mail,service,was,broken
autumn,with,its,dusty,breathless,heat,was,slipping,in,to,choke,the,suddenly,quiet,town,adding,its,dry,panting,weight,to,tired,anxious,hearts
to,scarlett,mad,to,hear,from,tara,yet,trying,to,keep,up,a,brave,face,it,seemed,an,eternity,since,the,siege,began,seemed,as,though,she,had,always,lived,with,the,sound,of,cannon,in,her,ears,until,this,sinister,quiet,had,fallen
and,yet,it,was,only,thirty,days,since,the,siege,began
thirty,days,of,siege
the,city,ringed,with,red-clay,rifle,pits,the,monotonous,booming,of,cannon,that,never,rested,the,long,lines,of,ambulances,and,ox,carts,dripping,blood,down,the,dusty,streets,toward,the,hospitals,the,overworked,burial,squads,dragging,out,men,when,they,were,hardly,cold,and,dumping,them,like,so,many,logs,in,endless,rows,of,shallow,ditches
only,thirty,days
and,it,was,only,four,months,since,the,yankees,moved,south,from,dalton
only,four,months
scarlett,thought,looking,back,on,that,far,day,that,it,had,occurred,in,another,life
oh,no
surely,not,just,four,months
it,had,been,a,lifetime
four,months,ago
why,four,months,ago,dalton,resaca,kennesaw,mountain,had,been,to,her,only,names,of,places,on,the,railroad
now,they,were,battles,battles,desperately,vainly,fought,as,johnston,fell,back,toward,atlanta
and,now,peachtree,creek,decatur,ezra,church,and,utoy,creek,were,no,longer,pleasant,names,of,pleasant,places
never,again,could,she,think,of,them,as,quiet,villages,full,of,welcoming,friends,as,green,places,where,she,picnicked,with,handsome,officers,on,the,soft,banks,of,slow-moving,streams
these,names,meant,battles,too,and,the,soft,green,grasses,where,she,had,sat,were,cut,to,bits,by,heavy,cannon,wheels,trampled,by,desperate,feet,when,bayonet,met,bayonet,and,flattened,where,bodies,threshed,in,agonies
and,the,lazy,streams,were,redder,now,than,ever,georgia,clay,could,make,them
peachtree,creek,was,crimson,so,they,said,after,the,yankees,crossed,it
peachtree,creek,decatur,ezra,church,utoy,creek
never,names,of,places,any,more
names,of,graves,where,friends,lay,buried,names,of,tangled,underbrush,and,thick,woods,where,bodies,rotted,unburied,names,of,the,four,sides,of,atlanta,where,sherman,had,tried,to,force,his,army,in,and,hood's,men,had,doggedly,beaten,him,back
at,last,news,came,from,the,south,to,the,strained,town,and,it,was,alarming,news,especially,to,scarlett
general,sherman,was,trying,the,fourth,side,of,the,town,again,striking,again,at,the,railroad,at,jonesboro
yankees,in,large,numbers,were,on,that,fourth,side,of,the,town,now,no,skirmishing,units,or,cavalry,detachments,but,the,massed,yankee,forces
and,thousands,of,confederate,troops,had,been,withdrawn,from,the,lines,close,about,the,city,to,hurl,themselves,against,them
and,that,explained,the,sudden,silence
why,jonesboro
thought,scarlett,terror,striking,at,her,heart,at,the,thought,of,tara's,nearness
why,must,they,always,hit,jonesboro
why,can't,they,find,some,other,place,to,attack,the,railroad
for,a,week,she,had,not,heard,from,tara,and,the,last,brief,note,from,gerald,had,added,to,her,fears
carreen,had,taken,a,turn,for,the,worse,and,was,very,very,sick
now,it,might,be,days,before,the,mails,came,through,days,before,she,heard,whether,carreen,was,alive,or,dead
oh,if,she,had,only,gone,home,at,the,beginning,of,the,siege,melanie,or,no,melanie
there,was,fighting,at,jonesboro,that,much,atlanta,knew,but,how,the,battle,went,no,one,could,tell,and,the,most,insane,rumors,tortured,the,town
finally,a,courier,came,up,from,jonesboro,with,the,reassuring,news,that,the,yankees,had,been,beaten,back
but,they,had,made,a,sortie,into,jonesboro,burned,the,depot,cut,the,telegraph,wires,and,torn,up,three,miles,of,track,before,they,retreated
the,engineering,corps,was,working,like,mad,repairing,the,line,but,it,would,take,some,time,because,the,yankees,had,torn,up,the,crossties,made,bonfires,of,them,laid,the,wrenched-up,rails,across,them,until,they,were,red,hot,and,then,twisted,them,around,telegraph,poles,until,they,looked,like,giant,corkscrews
these,days,it,was,so,hard,to,replace,iron,rails,to,replace,anything,made,of,iron
no,the,yankees,hadn't,gotten,to,tara
the,same,courier,who,brought,the,dispatches,to,general,hood,assured,scarlett,of,that
he,had,met,gerald,in,jonesboro,after,the,battle,just,as,he,was,starting,to,atlanta,and,gerald,had,begged,him,to,bring,a,letter,to,her
but,what,was,pa,doing,in,jonesboro
the,young,courier,looked,ill,at,ease,as,he,made,answer
gerald,was,hunting,for,an,army,doctor,to,go,to,tara,with,him
as,she,stood,in,the,sunshine,on,the,front,porch,thanking,the,young,man,for,his,trouble,scarlett,felt,her,knees,go,weak
carreen,must,be,dying,if,she,was,so,far,beyond,ellen's,medical,skill,that,gerald,was,hunting,a,doctor
as,the,courier,went,off,in,a,small,whirlwind,of,red,dust,scarlett,tore,open,gerald's,letter,with,fingers,that,trembled
so,great,was,the,shortage,of,paper,in,the,confederacy,now,that,gerald's,note,was,written,between,the,lines,of,her,last,letter,to,him,and,reading,it,was,difficult
dear,daughter,your,mother,and,both,girls,have,the,typhoid
they,are,very,ill,but,we,must,hope,for,the,best
when,your,mother,took,to,her,bed,she,bade,me,write,you,that,under,no,condition,were,you,to,come,home,and,expose,yourself,and,wade,to,the,disease
she,sends,her,love,and,bids,you,pray,for,her
pray,for,her
scarlett,flew,up,the,stairs,to,her,room,and,dropping,on,her,knees,by,the,bed,prayed,as,she,had,never,prayed,before
no,formal,rosaries,now,but,the,same,words,over,and,over,mother,of,god,don't,let,her,die
i'll,be,so,good,if,you,don't,let,her,die
please,don't,let,her,die
for,the,next,week,scarlett,crept,about,the,house,like,a,stricken,animal,waiting,for,news,starting,at,every,sound,of,horses',hooves,rushing,down,the,dark,stair,at,night,when,soldiers,came,tapping,at,the,door,but,no,news,came,from,tara
the,width,of,the,continent,might,have,spread,between,her,and,home,instead,of,twenty-,five,miles,of,dusty,road
the,mails,were,still,disrupted,no,one,knew,where,the,confederates,were,or,what,the,yankees,were,up,to
no,one,knew,anything,except,that,thousands,of,soldiers,gray,and,blue,were,somewhere,between,atlanta,and,jonesboro
not,a,word,from,tara,in,a,week
scarlett,had,seen,enough,typhoid,in,the,atlanta,hospital,to,know,what,a,week,meant,in,that,dread,disease
ellen,was,ill,perhaps,dying,and,here,was,scarlett,helpless,in,atlanta,with,a,pregnant,woman,on,her,hands,and,two,armies,between,her,and,home
ellen,was,ill,perhaps,dying
but,ellen,couldn't,be,ill
she,had,never,been,ill,the,very,thought,was,incredible,and,it,struck,at,the,very,foundations,of,the,security,of,scarlett's,life
everyone,else,got,sick,but,never,ellen
ellen,looked,after,sick,people,and,made,them,well,again
she,couldn't,be,sick
scarlett,wanted,to,be,home
she,wanted,tara,with,the,desperate,desire,of,a,frightened,child,frantic,for,the,only,haven,it,had,ever,known
home
the,sprawling,white,house,with,fluttering,white,curtains,at,the,windows,the,thick,clover,on,the,lawn,with,the,bees,busy,in,it,the,little,black,boy,on,the,front,steps,shooing,the,ducks,and,turkeys,from,the,flower,beds,the,serene,red,fields,and,the,miles,and,miles,of,cotton,turning,white,in,the,sun
home
if,she,had,only,gone,home,at,the,beginning,of,the,siege,when,everyone,else,was,refugeeing
she,could,have,taken,melanie,with,her,in,safety,with,weeks,to,spare
oh,damn,melanie
she,thought,a,thousand,times
why,couldn't,she,have,gone,to,macon,with,aunt,pitty
that's,where,she,belongs,with,her,own,kinfolks,not,with,me
i'm,none,of,her,blood
why,does,she,hang,onto,me,so,hard
if,she'd,only,gone,to,macon,then,i,could,have,gone,home,to,mother
even,now,even,now,i'd,take,a,chance,on,getting,home,in,spite,of,the,yankees,if,it,wasn't,for,this,baby
maybe,general,hood,would,give,me,an,escort
he's,a,nice,man,general,hood,and,i,know,i,could,make,him,give,me,an,escort,and,a,flag,of,truce,to,get,me,through,the,lines
but,i,have,to,wait,for,this,baby
oh,mother
mother
don't,die
why,don't,this,baby,ever,come
i'll,see,dr,meade,today,and,ask,him,if,there's,any,way,to,hurry,babies,up,so,i,can,go,home,if,i,can,get,an,escort
dr,meade,said,she'd,have,a,bad,time
dear,god
suppose,she,should,die
melanie,dead
melanie,dead
and,ashley,no,i,mustn't,think,about,that,it,isn't,nice
but,ashley,no,i,mustn't,think,about,that,because,he's,probably,dead,anyway
but,he,made,me,promise,i'd,take,care,of,her
but,if,i,didn't,take,care,of,her,and,she,died,and,ashley,is,still,alive,no,i,mustn't,think,about,that
it's,sinful
and,i,promised,god,i'd,be,good,if,he,would,just,not,let,mother,die
oh,if,the,baby,would,only,come
if,i,could,only,get,away,from,here,get,home,get,anywhere,but,here
scarlett,hated,the,sight,of,the,ominously,still,town,now,and,once,she,had,loved,it
atlanta,was,no,longer,the,gay,the,desperately,gay,place,she,had,loved
it,was,a,hideous,place,like,a,plague-,stricken,city,so,quiet,so,dreadfully,quiet,after,the,din,of,the,siege
there,had,been,stimulation,in,the,noise,and,the,danger,of,the,shelling
there,was,only,horror,in,the,quiet,that,followed
the,town,seemed,haunted,haunted,with,fear,and,uncertainty,and,memories
people's,faces,looked,pinched,and,the,few,soldiers,scarlett,saw,wore,the,exhausted,look,of,racers,forcing,themselves,on,through,the,last,lap,of,a,race,already,lost
the,last,day,of,august,came,and,with,it,convincing,rumors,that,the,fiercest,fighting,since,the,battle,of,atlanta,was,taking,place
somewhere,to,the,south
atlanta,waiting,for,news,of,the,turn,of,battle,stopped,even,trying,to,laugh,and,joke
everyone,knew,now,what,the,soldiers,had,known,two,weeks,before,that,atlanta,was,in,the,last,ditch,that,if,the,macon,railroad,fell,atlanta,would,fall,too
on,the,morning,of,the,first,of,september,scarlett,awoke,with,a,suffocating,sense,of,dread,upon,her,a,dread,she,had,taken,to,her,pillow,the,night,before
she,thought,dulled,with,sleep,what,was,it,i,was,worrying,about,when,i,went,to,bed,last,night
oh,yes,the,fighting
there,was,a,battle,somewhere,yesterday
oh,who,won
she,sat,up,hastily,rubbing,her,eyes,and,her,worried,heart,took,up,yesterday's,load,again
the,air,was,oppressive,even,in,the,early,morning,hour,hot,with,the,scorching,promise,of,a,noon,of,glaring,blue,sky,and,pitiless,bronze,sun
the,road,outside,lay,silent
no,wagons,creaked,by
no,troops,raised,the,red,dust,with,their,tramping,feet
there,were,no,sounds,of,negroes',lazy,voices,in,neighboring,kitchens,no,pleasant,sounds,of,breakfasts,being,prepared,for,all,the,near,neighbors,except,mrs,meade,and,mrs,merriwether,had,refugeed,to,macon
and,she,could,hear,nothing,from,their,houses,either
farther,down,the,street,the,business,section,was,quiet,and,many,of,the,stores,and,offices,were,locked,and,boarded,up,while,their,occupants,were,somewhere,about,the,countryside,with,rifles,in,their,hands
the,stillness,that,greeted,her,seemed,even,more,sinister,this,morning,than,on,any,of,the,mornings,of,the,queer,quiet,week,preceding,it
she,rose,hastily,without,her,usual,preliminary,burrowings,and,stretchings,and,went,to,the,window,hoping,to,see,some,neighbor's,face,some,heartening,sight
but,the,road,was,empty
she,noted,how,the,leaves,on,the,trees,were,still,dark,green,but,dry,and,heavily,coated,with,red,dust,and,how,withered,and,sad,the,untended,flowers,in,the,front,yard,looked
as,she,stood,looking,out,of,the,window,there,came,to,her,ears,a,far-off,sound,faint,and,sullen,as,the,first,distant,thunder,of,an,approaching,storm
rain,she,thought,in,the,first,moment,and,her,country-bred,mind,added,we,certainly,need,it
but,in,a,split,instant,rain
no
not,rain
cannon
her,heart,racing,she,leaned,from,the,window,her,ear,cocked,to,the,far-off,roaring,trying,to,discover,from,which,direction,it,came
but,the,dim,thundering,was,so,distant,that,for,a,moment,she,could,not,tell
make,it,from,marietta,lord
she,prayed
or,decatur
or,peachtree,creek
but,not,from,the,south
not,from,the,south
she,gripped,the,window,still,tighter,and,strained,her,ears,and,the,far-away,booming,seemed,louder
and,it,was,coming,from,the,south
cannon,to,the,south
and,to,the,south,lay,jonesboro,and,tara,and,ellen
yankees,perhaps,at,tara,now,this,minute
she,listened,again,but,the,blood,thudding,in,her,ears,all,but,blurred,out,the,sound,of,far-off,firing
no,they,couldn't,be,at,jonesboro,yet
if,they,were,that,far,away,the,sound,would,be,fainter,more,indistinct
but,they,must,be,at,least,ten,miles,down,the,road,toward,jonesboro,probably,near,the,little,settlement,of,rough,and,ready
but,jonesboro,was,scarcely,more,than,ten,miles,below,rough,and,ready
cannon,to,the,south,and,they,might,be,tolling,the,knell,of,atlanta's,fall
but,to,scarlett,sick,for,her,mother's,safety,fighting,to,the,south,only,meant,fighting,near,tara
she,walked,the,floor,and,wrung,her,hands,and,for,the,first,time,the,thought,in,all,its,implications,came,to,her,that,the,gray,army,might,be,defeated
it,was,the,thought,of,sherman's,thousands,so,close,to,tara,that,brought,it,all,home,to,her,brought,the,full,horror,of,the,war,to,her,as,no,sound,of,siege,guns,shattering,windowpanes,no,privations,of,food,and,clothing,and,no,endless,rows,of,dying,men,had,done
sherman's,army,within,a,few,miles,of,tara
and,even,if,the,yankees,should,be,defeated,they,might,fall,back,down,the,road,to,tara
and,gerald,couldn't,possibly,refugee,out,of,their,way,with,three,sick,women
oh,if,she,were,only,there,now,yankees,or,not
she,paced,the,floor,in,her,bare,feet,her,nightgown,clinging,to,her,legs,and,the,more,she,walked,the,stronger,became,her,foreboding
she,wanted,to,be,at,home
she,wanted,to,be,near,ellen
from,the,kitchen,below,she,heard,the,rattle,of,china,as,prissy,prepared,breakfast,but,no,sound,of,mrs,meade's,betsy
the,shrill,melancholy,minor,of,prissy,was,raised,jes',a,few,mo',days,ter,tote,de,wee-ry,load
the,song,grated,on,scarlett,its,sad,implications,frightening,her,and,slipping,on,a,wrapper,she,pattered,out,into,the,hall,and,to,the,back,stairs,and,shouted,shut,up,that,singing,prissy
a,sullen,yas'm,drifted,up,to,her,and,she,drew,a,deep,breath,feeling,suddenly,ashamed,of,herself
where's,betsy
ah,doan,know
she,ain',came
scarlett,walked,to,melanie's,door,and,opened,it,a,crack,peering,into,the,sunny,room
melanie,lay,in,bed,in,her,nightgown,her,eyes,closed,and,circled,with,black,her,heart-shaped,face,bloated,her,slender,body,hideous,and,distorted
scarlett,wished,viciously,that,ashley,could,see,her,now
she,looked,worse,than,any,pregnant,woman,she,had,ever,seen
as,she,looked,melanie's,eyes,opened,and,a,soft,warm,smile,lit,her,face
come,in,she,invited,turning,awkwardly,on,her,side
i've,been,awake,since,sun-up,thinking,and,scarlett,there's,something,i,want,to,ask,you
she,entered,the,room,and,sat,down,on,the,bed,that,was,glaring,with,harsh,sunshine
melanie,reached,out,and,took,scarlett's,hand,in,a,gentle,confiding,clasp
dear,she,said,i'm,sorry,about,the,cannon
it's,toward,jonesboro,isn't,it
scarlett,said,um,her,heart,beginning,to,beat,faster,as,the,thought,recurred
i,know,how,worried,you,are
i,know,you'd,have,gone,home,last,week,when,you,heard,about,your,mother,if,it,hadn't,been,for,me

scarlett,darling
you've,been,so,good,to,me
no,sister,could,have,been,sweeter,or,braver
and,i,love,you,for,it
i'm,so,sorry,i'm,in,the,way
scarlett,stared

her,clasp,tightened
if,i,should,die,will,you,take,my,baby
melanie's,eyes,were,wide,and,bright,with,soft,urgency
will,you
scarlett,jerked,away,her,hand,as,fear,swamped,her
fear,roughened,her,voice,as,she,spoke
oh,don't,be,a,goose,melly
you,aren't,going,to,die
every,woman,thinks,she's,going,to,die,with,her,first,baby
i,know,i,did

you've,never,been,afraid,of,anything
you,are,just,saying,that,to,try,to,cheer,me,up

i'm,sorry,dear
but,promise,me
i,think,it'll,be,today
i'm,sure,it'll,be,today
please,promise,me
oh,all,right,i,promise,said,scarlett,looking,down,at,her,in,bewilderment
was,melanie,such,a,fool,she,really,didn't,know,how,she,cared,for,ashley
or,did,she,know,everything,and,feel,that,because,of,that,love,scarlett,would,take,good,care,of,ashley's,child
scarlett,had,a,wild,impulse,to,cry,out,questions,but,they,died,on,her,lips,as,melanie,took,her,hand,and,held,it,for,an,instant,against,her,cheek
tranquillity,had,come,back,into,her,eyes
why,do,you,think,it,will,be,today,melly
i've,been,having,pains,since,dawn,but,not,very,bad,ones

just,send,for,mrs,meade
she'll,know
oh,all,right,said,scarlett
chapter,xxi
after,sending,up,melanie's,breakfast,tray,scarlett,dispatched,prissy,for,mrs,meade,and,sat,down,with,wade,to,eat,her,own,breakfast
but,for,once,she,had,no,appetite
between,her,nervous,apprehension,over,the,thought,that,melanie's,time,was,approaching,and,her,unconscious,straining,to,hear,the,sound,of,the,cannon,she,could,hardly,eat
her,heart,acted,very,queerly,beating,regularly,for,several,minutes,and,then,thumping,so,loudly,and,swiftly,it,almost,made,her,sick,at,her,stomach
the,heavy,hominy,stuck,in,her,throat,like,glue,and,never,before,had,the,mixture,of,parched,corn,and,ground-up,yams,that,passed,for,coffee,been,so,repulsive
without,sugar,or,cream,it,was,bitter,as,gall,for,the,sorghum,used,for,long,sweetening,did,little,to,improve,the,taste
after,one,swallow,she,pushed,her,cup,away
if,for,no,other,reason,she,hated,the,yankees,because,they,kept,her,from,having,real,coffee,with,sugar,and,thick,cream,in,it
wade,was,quieter,than,usual,and,did,not,set,up,his,every,morning,complaint,against,the,hominy,that,he,so,disliked
he,ate,silently,the,spoonfuls,she,pushed,into,his,mouth,and,washed,them,down,with,noisily,gulped,water
his,soft,brown,eyes,followed,her,every,movement,large,round,as,dollars,a,childish,bewilderment,in,them,as,though,her,own,scarce-hidden,fears,had,been,communicated,to,him
when,he,had,finished,she,sent,him,off,to,the,back,yard,to,play,and,watched,him,toddle,across,the,straggling,grass,to,his,playhouse,with,great,relief
she,arose,and,stood,irresolutely,at,the,foot,of,the,stairs
she,should,go,up,and,sit,with,melanie,and,distract,her,mind,from,her,coming,ordeal,but,she,did,not,feel,equal,to,it
of,all,days,in,the,world,melanie,had,to,pick,this,day,to,have,the,baby
and,of,all,days,to,talk,about,dying
she,sat,down,on,the,bottom,step,of,the,stairs,and,tried,to,compose,herself,wondering,again,how,yesterday's,battle,had,gone,wondering,how,today's,fighting,was,going
how,strange,to,have,a,big,battle,going,on,just,a,few,miles,away,and,to,know,nothing,of,it
how,strange,the,quiet,of,this,deserted,end,of,town,in,contrast,with,the,day,of,the,fighting,at,peachtree,creek
aunt,pitty's,house,was,one,of,the,last,on,the,north,side,of,atlanta,and,with,the,fighting,somewhere,to,the,far,south,there,were,no,reinforcements,going,by,at,double-quick,no,ambulances,and,staggering,lines,of,walking,wounded,coming,back
she,wondered,if,such,scenes,were,being,enacted,on,the,south,side,of,town,and,thanked,god,she,was,not,there
if,only,everyone,except,the,meades,and,the,merriwethers,had,not,refugeed,from,this,north,end,of,peachtree
it,made,her,feel,forsaken,and,alone
she,wished,fervently,that,uncle,peter,were,with,her,so,he,could,go,down,to,headquarters,and,learn,the,news
if,it,wasn't,for,melanie,she'd,go,to,town,this,very,minute,and,learn,for,herself,but,she,couldn't,leave,until,mrs,meade,arrived
mrs,meade
why,didn't,she,come,on
and,where,was,prissy
she,rose,and,went,out,onto,the,front,porch,and,looked,for,them,impatiently,but,the,meade,house,was,around,a,shady,bend,in,the,street,and,she,could,see,no,one
after,a,long,while,prissy,came,into,view,alone,switching,her,skirts,from,side,to,side,and,looking,over,her,shoulder,to,observe,the,effect
you're,as,slow,as,molasses,in,january,snapped,scarlett,as,prissy,opened,the,gate

she,stopped,and,racked,her,brain
who,was,left,in,town,among,their,friends,who,would,be,helpful
there,was,mrs,elsing
of,course,mrs,elsing,didn't,like,her,at,all,these,days,but,she,had,always,been,fond,of,melanie
go,to,mrs,elsing's,and,explain,everything,very,carefully,and,tell,her,to,please,come,up,here

hurry,you,slow,poke
yas'm
prissy,quickened,her,gait,infinitesimally,and,scarlett,went,back,into,the,house
she,hesitated,again,before,going,upstairs,to,melanie
she,would,have,to,explain,to,her,just,why,mrs,meade,couldn't,come,and,the,knowledge,that,phil,meade,was,badly,wounded,might,upset,her
well,she'd,tell,a,lie,about,it
she,entered,melanie's,room,and,saw,that,the,breakfast,tray,was,untouched
melanie,lay,on,her,side,her,face,white
mrs,meade's,over,at,the,hospital,said,scarlett
but,mrs,elsing,is,coming
do,you,feel,bad

scarlett,how,long,did,it,take,wade,to,get,born
less,than,no,time,answered,scarlett,with,a,cheerfulness,she,was,far,from,feeling
i,was,out,in,the,yard,and,i,didn't,hardly,have,time,to,get,into,the,house
mammy,said,it,was,scandalous,just,like,one,of,the,darkies
i,hope,i'll,be,like,one,of,the,darkies,too,said,melanie,mustering,a,smile,which,suddenly,disappeared,as,pain,contorted,her,face
scarlett,looked,down,at,melanie's,tiny,hips,with,none,too,sanguine,hopes,but,said,reassuringly,oh,it's,not,really,so,bad
oh,i,know,it,isn't
i'm,afraid,i'm,a,little,coward
is,is,mrs,elsing,coming,right,away
yes,right,away,said,scarlett
i'll,go,down,and,get,some,fresh,water,and,sponge,you,off
it's,so,hot,today
she,took,as,long,a,time,as,possible,in,getting,the,water,running,to,the,front,door,every,two,minutes,to,see,if,prissy,were,coming
there,was,no,sign,of,prissy,so,she,went,back,upstairs,sponged,melanie's,perspiring,body,and,combed,out,her,long,dark,hair
when,an,hour,had,passed,she,heard,scuffing,negro,feet,coming,down,the,street,and,looking,out,of,the,window,saw,prissy,returning,slowly,switching,herself,as,before,and,tossing,her,head,with,as,many,airy,affectations,as,if,she,had,a,large,and,interested,audience
some,day,i'm,going,to,take,a,strap,to,that,little,wench,thought,scarlett,savagely,hurrying,down,the,stairs,to,meet,her

stop,bawling
miss,melanie,will,hear,you
now,go,change,your,apron,quick
spurred,to,speed,prissy,hurried,toward,the,back,of,the,house,while,scarlett,scratched,a,hasty,note,on,the,margin,of,gerald's,last,letter,to,her,the,only,bit,of,paper,in,the,house
as,she,folded,it,so,that,her,note,was,uppermost,she,caught,gerald's,words,your,mother,typhoid,under,no,condition,to,come,home,she,almost,sobbed
if,it,wasn't,for,melanie,she'd,start,home,right,this,minute,if,she,had,to,walk,every,step,of,the,way
prissy,went,off,at,a,trot,the,letter,gripped,in,her,hand,and,scarlett,went,back,upstairs,trying,to,think,of,some,plausible,lie,to,explain,mrs,elsing's,failure,to,appear
but,melanie,asked,no,questions
she,lay,upon,her,back,her,face,tranquil,and,sweet,and,the,sight,of,her,quieted,scarlett,for,a,while
she,sat,down,and,tried,to,talk,of,inconsequential,things,but,the,thoughts,of,tara,and,a,possible,defeat,by,the,yankees,prodded,cruelly
she,thought,of,ellen,dying,and,of,the,yankees,coming,into,atlanta,burning,everything,killing,everybody
through,it,all,the,dull,far-off,thundering,persisted,rolling,into,her,ears,in,waves,of,fear
finally,she,could,not,talk,at,all,and,only,stared,out,of,the,window,at,the,hot,still,street,and,the,dusty,leaves,hanging,motionless,on,the,trees
melanie,was,silent,too,but,at,intervals,her,quiet,face,was,wrenched,with,pain
she,said,after,each,pain,it,wasn't,very,bad,really,and,scarlett,knew,she,was,lying
she,would,have,preferred,a,loud,scream,to,silent,endurance
she,knew,she,should,feel,sorry,for,melanie,but,somehow,she,could,not,muster,a,spark,of,sympathy
her,mind,was,too,torn,with,her,own,anguish
once,she,looked,sharply,at,the,pain-twisted,face,and,wondered,why,it,should,be,that,she,of,all,people,in,the,world,should,be,here,with,melanie,at,this,particular,time,she,who,had,nothing,in,common,with,her,who,hated,her,who,would,gladly,have,seen,her,dead
well,maybe,she'd,have,her,wish,and,before,the,day,was,over,too
a,cold,superstitious,fear,swept,her,at,this,thought
it,was,bad,luck,to,wish,that,someone,were,dead,almost,as,bad,luck,as,to,curse,someone
curses,came,home,to,roost,mammy,said
she,hastily,prayed,that,melanie,wouldn't,die,and,broke,into,feverish,small,talk,hardly,aware,of,what,she,said
at,last,melanie,put,a,hot,hand,on,her,wrist
don't,bother,about,talking,dear
i,know,how,worried,you,are
i'm,so,sorry,i'm,so,much,trouble
scarlett,relapsed,into,silence,but,she,could,not,sit,still
what,would,she,do,if,neither,the,doctor,nor,prissy,got,there,in,time
she,walked,to,the,window,and,looked,down,the,street,and,came,back,and,sat,down,again
then,she,rose,and,looked,out,of,the,window,on,the,other,side,of,the,room
an,hour,went,by,and,then,another
noon,came,and,the,sun,was,high,and,hot,and,not,a,breath,of,air,stirred,the,dusty,leaves
melanie's,pains,were,harder,now
her,long,hair,was,drenched,in,sweat,and,her,gown,stuck,in,wet,spots,to,her,body
scarlett,sponged,her,face,in,silence,but,fear,was,gnawing,at,her
god,in,heaven,suppose,the,baby,came,before,the,doctor,arrived
what,would,she,do
she,knew,less,than,nothing,of,midwifery
this,was,exactly,the,emergency,she,had,been,dreading,for,weeks
she,had,been,counting,on,prissy,to,handle,the,situation,if,no,doctor,should,be,available
prissy,knew,all,about,midwifery
she'd,said,so,time,and,again
but,where,was,prissy
why,didn't,she,come
why,didn't,the,doctor,come
she,went,to,the,window,and,looked,again
she,listened,hard,and,suddenly,she,wondered,if,it,were,only,her,imagination,or,if,the,sound,of,cannon,in,the,distance,had,died,away
if,it,were,farther,away,it,would,mean,that,the,fighting,was,nearer,jonesboro,and,that,would,mean
at,last,she,saw,prissy,coming,down,the,street,at,a,quick,trot,and,she,leaned,out,of,the,window
prissy,looking,up,saw,her,and,her,mouth,opened,to,yell
seeing,the,panic,written,on,the,little,black,face,and,fearing,she,might,alarm,melanie,by,crying,out,evil,tidings,scarlett,hastily,put,her,finger,to,her,lips,and,left,the,window
i'll,get,some,cooler,water,she,said,looking,down,into,melanie's,dark,deep-circled,eyes,and,trying,to,smile
then,she,hastily,left,the,room,closing,the,door,carefully,behind,her
prissy,was,sitting,on,the,bottom,step,in,the,hall,panting

she,looked,in,the,mirror,and,automatically,pushed,up,loose,strands,of,hair,but,she,did,not,see,her,own,reflection
cold,little,ripples,of,fear,that,started,in,the,pit,of,her,stomach,were,radiating,outward,until,the,fingers,that,touched,her,cheeks,were,cold,though,the,rest,of,her,body,streamed,perspiration
she,hurried,out,of,the,house,and,into,the,heat,of,the,sun
it,was,blindingly,glaring,hot,and,as,she,hurried,down,peachtree,street,her,temples,began,to,throb,from,the,heat
from,far,down,the,street,she,could,hear,the,rise,and,fall,and,roar,of,many,voices
by,the,time,she,caught,sight,of,the,leyden,house,she,was,beginning,to,pant,for,her,stays,were,tightly,laced,but,she,did,not,slow,her,gait
the,roar,of,noise,grew,louder

negroes,were,running,up,and,down,the,street,panic,in,their,faces,and,on,porches,white,children,sat,crying,untended
the,street,was,crowded,with,army,wagons,and,ambulances,filled,with,wounded,and,carriages,piled,high,with,valises,and,pieces,of,furniture
men,on,horseback,dashed,out,of,side,streets,pell-mell,down,peachtree,toward,hood's,headquarters

the,yankees,were,coming
at,wesley,chapel,she,paused,to,catch,her,breath,and,wait,for,her,hammering,heart,to,subside
if,she,did,not,quiet,herself,she,would,certainly,faint
as,she,stood,clutching,a,lamp,post,for,support,she,saw,an,officer,on,horseback,come,charging,up,the,street,from,five,points,and,on,an,impulse,she,ran,out,into,the,street,and,waved,at,him
oh,stop
please,stop
he,reined,in,so,suddenly,the,horse,went,back,on,its,haunches,pawing,the,air
there,were,harsh,lines,of,fatigue,and,urgency,in,his,face,but,his,tattered,gray,hat,was,off,with,a,sweep

the,spurred,horse,went,off,as,though,on,springs,and,scarlett,was,left,standing,in,the,middle,of,the,street,with,the,red,dust,thick,upon,her,ankles
the,yankees,were,coming
the,army,was,leaving
the,yankees,were,coming
what,should,she,do
where,should,she,run
no,she,couldn't,run
there,was,melanie,back,there,in,the,bed,expecting,that,baby
oh,why,did,women,have,babies
if,it,wasn't,for,melanie,she,could,take,wade,and,prissy,and,hide,in,the,woods,where,the,yankees,could,never,find,them
but,she,couldn't,take,melanie,to,the,woods
no,not,now
oh,if,she'd,only,had,the,baby,sooner,yesterday,even,perhaps,they,could,get,an,ambulance,and,take,her,away,and,hide,her,somewhere
but,now,she,must,find,dr,meade,and,make,him,come,home,with,her
perhaps,he,could,hurry,the,baby
she,gathered,up,her,skirts,and,ran,down,the,street,and,the,rhythm,of,her,feet,was,the,yankees,are,coming
the,yankees,are,coming
five,points,was,crowded,with,people,who,rushed,here,and,there,with,unseeing,eyes,jammed,with,wagons,ambulances,ox,carts,carriages,loaded,with,wounded
a,roaring,sound,like,the,breaking,of,surf,rose,from,the,crowd
then,a,strangely,incongruous,sight,struck,her,eyes
throngs,of,women,were,coming,up,from,the,direction,of,the,railroad,tracks,carrying,hams,across,their,shoulders
little,children,hurried,by,their,sides,staggering,under,buckets,of,steaming,molasses
young,boys,dragged,sacks,of,corn,and,potatoes
one,old,man,struggled,along,with,a,small,barrel,of,flour,on,a,wheelbarrow
men,women,and,children,black,and,white,hurried,hurried,with,straining,faces,lugging,packages,and,sacks,and,boxes,of,food,more,food,than,she,had,seen,in,a,year
the,crowd,suddenly,gave,a,lane,for,a,careening,carriage,and,through,the,lane,came,the,frail,and,elegant,mrs,elsing,standing,up,in,the,front,of,her,victoria,reins,in,one,hand,whip,in,the,other
she,was,hatless,and,white,faced,and,her,long,gray,hair,streamed,down,her,back,as,she,lashed,the,horse,like,a,fury
jouncing,on,the,back,seat,of,the,carriage,was,her,black,mammy,melissy,clutching,a,greasy,side,of,bacon,to,her,with,one,hand,while,with,the,other,and,both,feet,she,attempted,to,hold,the,boxes,and,bags,piled,all,about,her
one,bag,of,dried,peas,had,burst,and,the,peas,strewed,themselves,into,the,street
scarlett,screamed,to,her,but,the,tumult,of,the,crowd,drowned,her,voice,and,the,carriage,rocked,madly,by
for,a,moment,she,could,not,understand,what,it,all,meant,and,then,remembering,that,the,commissary,warehouses,were,down,by,the,railroad,tracks,she,realized,that,the,army,had,thrown,them,open,to,the,people,to,salvage,what,they,could,before,the,yankees,came
she,pushed,her,way,swiftly,through,the,crowds,past,the,packed,hysterical,mob,surging,in,the,open,space,of,five,points,and,hurried,as,fast,as,she,could,down,the,short,block,toward,the,depot
through,the,tangle,of,ambulances,and,the,clouds,of,dust,she,could,see,doctors,and,stretcher,bearers,bending,lifting,hurrying
thank,god,she'd,find,dr,meade,soon
as,she,rounded,the,corner,of,the,atlanta,hotel,and,came,in,full,view,of,the,depot,and,the,tracks,she,halted,appalled
lying,in,the,pitiless,sun,shoulder,to,shoulder,head,to,feet,were,hundreds,of,wounded,men,lining,the,tracks,the,sidewalks,stretched,out,in,endless,rows,under,the,car,shed
some,lay,stiff,and,still,but,many,writhed,under,the,hot,sun,moaning
everywhere,swarms,of,flies,hovered,over,the,men,crawling,and,buzzing,in,their,faces,everywhere,was,blood,dirty,bandages,groans,screamed,curses,of,pain,as,stretcher,bearers,lifted,men
the,smell,of,sweat,of,blood,of,unwashed,bodies,of,excrement,rose,up,in,waves,of,blistering,heat,until,the,fetid,stench,almost,nauseated,her
the,ambulance,men,hurrying,here,and,there,among,the,prostrate,forms,frequently,stepped,on,wounded,men,so,thickly,packed,were,the,rows,and,those,trodden,upon,stared,stolidly,up,waiting,their,turn
she,shrank,back,clapping,her,hand,to,her,mouth,feeling,that,she,was,going,to,vomit
she,couldn't,go,on
she,had,seen,wounded,men,in,the,hospitals,wounded,men,on,aunt,pitty's,lawn,after,the,fighting,at,the,creek,but,never,anything,like,this
never,anything,like,these,stinking,bleeding,bodies,broiling,under,the,glaring,sun
this,was,an,inferno,of,pain,and,smell,and,noise,and,hurry,hurry,hurry
the,yankees,are,coming
the,yankees,are,coming
she,braced,her,shoulders,and,went,down,among,them,straining,her,eyes,among,the,upright,figures,to,distinguish,dr,meade
but,she,discovered,she,could,not,look,for,him,for,if,she,did,not,step,carefully,she,would,tread,on,some,poor,soldier
she,raised,her,skirts,and,tried,to,pick,her,way,among,them,toward,a,knot,of,men,who,were,directing,the,stretcher,bearers
as,she,walked,feverish,hands,plucked,at,her,skirt,and,voices,croaked,lady,water
please,lady,water
for,christ's,sake,water
perspiration,came,down,her,face,in,streams,as,she,pulled,her,skirts,from,clutching,hands
if,she,stepped,on,one,of,these,men,she'd,scream,and,faint
she,stepped,over,dead,men,over,men,who,lay,dull,eyed,with,hands,clutched,to,bellies,where,dried,blood,had,glued,torn,uniforms,to,wounds,over,men,whose,beards,were,stiff,with,blood,and,from,whose,broken,jaws,came,sounds,which,must,mean
water
water
if,she,did,not,find,dr,meade,soon,she,would,begin,screaming,with,hysteria
she,looked,toward,the,group,of,men,under,the,car,shed,and,cried,as,loudly,as,she,could
dr,meade
is,dr,meade,there
from,the,group,one,man,detached,himself,and,looked,toward,her
it,was,the,doctor
he,was,coatless,and,his,sleeves,were,rolled,up,to,his,shoulders
his,shirt,and,trousers,were,as,red,as,a,butcher's,and,even,the,end,of,his,iron-gray,beard,was,matted,with,blood
his,face,was,the,face,of,a,man,drunk,with,fatigue,and,impotent,rage,and,burning,pity
it,was,gray,and,dusty,and,sweat,had,streaked,long,rivulets,across,his,cheeks
but,his,voice,was,calm,and,decisive,as,he,called,to,her
thank,god,you,are,here
i,can,use,every,pair,of,hands
for,a,moment,she,stared,at,him,bewildered,dropping,her,skirts,in,dismay
they,fell,over,the,dirty,face,of,a,wounded,man,who,feebly,tried,to,turn,his,head,to,escape,from,their,smothering,folds
what,did,the,doctor,mean
the,dust,from,the,ambulances,came,into,her,face,with,choking,dryness,and,the,rotten,smells,were,like,a,foul,liquid,in,her,nostrils
hurry,child
come,here
she,picked,up,her,skirts,and,went,to,him,as,fast,as,she,could,go,across,the,rows,of,bodies
she,put,her,hand,on,his,arm,and,felt,that,it,was,trembling,with,weariness,but,there,was,no,weakness,in,his,face
oh,doctor
she,cried
you,must,come
melanie,is,having,her,baby
he,looked,at,her,as,if,her,words,did,not,register,on,his,mind
a,man,who,lay,upon,the,ground,at,her,feet,his,head,pillowed,on,his,canteen,grinned,up,companionably,at,her,words
they,will,do,it,he,said,cheerfully
she,did,not,even,look,down,but,shook,the,doctor's,arm
it's,melanie
the,baby
doctor,you,must,come
she,the,this,was,no,time,for,delicacy,but,it,was,hard,to,bring,out,the,words,with,the,ears,of,hundreds,of,strange,men,listening
the,pains,are,getting,hard
please,doctor

great,god
thundered,the,doctor,and,his,face,was,suddenly,contorted,with,hate,and,rage,a,rage,not,directed,at,her,or,at,anyone,except,a,world,wherein,such,things,could,happen
are,you,crazy
i,can't,leave,these,men

i,can't,leave,them,for,a,damned,baby
get,some,woman,to,help,you
get,my,wife
she,opened,her,mouth,to,tell,him,why,mrs,meade,could,not,come,and,then,shut,it,abruptly
he,did,not,know,his,own,son,was,wounded
she,wondered,if,he,would,still,be,here,if,he,did,know,and,something,told,her,that,even,if,phil,were,dying,he,would,still,be,standing,on,this,spot,giving,aid,to,the,many,instead,of,the,one
no,you,must,come,doctor
you,know,you,said,she'd,have,a,hard,time,was,it,really,she,scarlett,standing,here,saying,these,dreadful,indelicate,things,at,the,top,of,her,voice,in,this,hell,of,heat,and,groans
she'll,die,if,you,don't,come
he,shook,off,her,hand,roughly,and,spoke,as,though,he,hardly,heard,her,hardly,knew,what,she,said
die
yes,they'll,all,die,all,these,men
no,bandages,no,salves,no,quinine,no,chloroform

said,the,man,on,the,ground,his,teeth,showing,in,his,beard
scarlett,began,to,shake,and,her,eyes,burned,with,tears,of,fright
the,doctor,wasn't,coming,with,her
melanie,would,die,and,she,had,wished,that,she,would,die
the,doctor,wasn't,coming

but,i'll,try

don't,bother,me
there's,nothing,much,to,bringing,a,baby
just,tie,up,the,cord
he,turned,as,an,orderly,touched,his,arm,and,began,firing,directions,and,pointing,to,this,and,that,wounded,man
the,man,at,her,feet,looked,up,at,scarlett,compassionately
she,turned,away,for,the,doctor,had,forgotten,her
she,picked,her,way,rapidly,through,the,wounded,and,back,to,peachtree,street
the,doctor,wasn't,coming
she,would,have,to,see,it,through,herself
thank,god,prissy,knew,all,about,midwifery
her,head,ached,from,the,heat,and,she,could,feel,her,basque,soaking,wet,from,perspiration,sticking,to,her
her,mind,felt,numb,and,so,did,her,legs,numb,as,in,a,nightmare,when,she,tried,to,run,and,could,not,move,them
she,thought,of,the,long,walk,back,to,the,house,and,it,seemed,interminable
then,the,yankees,are,coming
began,to,beat,its,refrain,in,her,mind,again
her,heart,began,to,pound,and,new,life,came,into,her,limbs
she,hurried,into,the,crowd,at,five,points,now,so,thick,there,was,no,room,on,the,narrow,sidewalks,and,she,was,forced,to,walk,in,the,street
long,lines,of,soldiers,were,passing,dust,covered,sodden,with,weariness
there,seemed,thousands,of,them,bearded,dirty,their,guns,slung,over,their,shoulders,swiftly,passing,at,route,step
cannon,rolled,past,the,drivers,flaying,the,thin,mules,with,lengths,of,rawhide
commissary,wagons,with,torn,canvas,covers,rocked,through,the,ruts
cavalry,raising,clouds,of,choking,dust,went,past,endlessly
she,had,never,seen,so,many,soldiers,together,before
retreat
retreat
the,army,was,moving,out
the,hurrying,lines,pushed,her,back,onto,the,packed,sidewalk,and,she,smelled,the,reek,of,cheap,corn,whisky
there,were,women,in,the,mob,near,decatur,street,garishly,dressed,women,whose,bright,finery,and,painted,faces,gave,a,discordant,note,of,holiday
most,of,them,were,drunk,and,the,soldiers,on,whose,arms,they,hung,were,drunker
she,caught,a,fleeting,glimpse,of,a,head,of,red,curls,and,saw,that,creature,belle,watling,heard,her,shrill,drunken,laughter,as,she,clung,for,support,to,a,one-armed,soldier,who,reeled,and,staggered
when,she,had,shoved,and,pushed,her,way,through,the,mob,for,a,block,beyond,five,points,the,crowd,thinned,a,little,and,gathering,up,her,skirts,she,began,to,run,again
when,she,reached,wesley,chapel,she,was,breathless,and,dizzy,and,sick,at,her,stomach
her,stays,were,cutting,her,ribs,in,two
she,sank,down,on,the,steps,of,the,church,and,buried,her,head,in,her,hands,until,she,could,breathe,more,easily
if,she,could,only,get,one,deep,breath,way,down,in,her,abdomen
if,her,heart,would,only,stop,bumping,and,drumming,and,cavorting
if,there,were,only,someone,in,this,mad,place,to,whom,she,could,turn
why,she,had,never,had,to,do,a,thing,for,herself,in,all,her,life
there,had,always,been,someone,to,do,things,for,her,to,look,after,her,shelter,and,protect,her,and,spoil,her
it,was,incredible,that,she,could,be,in,such,a,fix
not,a,friend,not,a,neighbor,to,help,her
there,had,always,been,friends,neighbors,the,competent,hands,of,willing,slaves
and,now,in,this,hour,of,greatest,need,there,was,no,one
it,was,incredible,that,she,could,be,so,completely,alone,and,frightened,and,far,from,home
home
if,she,were,only,home,yankees,or,no,yankees
home,even,if,ellen,was,sick
she,longed,for,the,sight,of,ellen's,sweet,face,for,mammy's,strong,arms,around,her
she,rose,dizzily,to,her,feet,and,started,walking,again
when,she,came,in,sight,of,the,house,she,saw,wade,swinging,on,the,front,gate
when,he,saw,her,his,face,puckered,and,he,began,to,cry,holding,up,a,grubby,bruised,finger

she,looked,up,and,saw,prissy,leaning,out,of,the,upstairs,window,fright,and,worry,written,on,her,face,but,in,an,instant,they,were,wiped,away,in,relief,as,she,saw,her,mistress
scarlett,beckoned,to,her,to,come,down,and,went,into,the,house
how,cool,it,was,in,the,hall
she,untied,her,bonnet,and,flung,it,on,the,table,drawing,her,forearms,across,her,wet,forehead

scarlett,glared,at,her,and,prissy,shrank,back,trying,to,pull,loose
for,a,moment,her,mind,refused,to,accept,the,truth,but,when,realization,finally,came,to,her,that,prissy,knew,no,more,about,midwifery,than,she,did,anger,went,over,her,like,a,flame
she,had,never,struck,a,slave,in,all,her,life,but,now,she,slapped,the,black,cheek,with,all,the,force,in,her,tired,arm
prissy,screamed,at,the,top,of,her,voice,more,from,fright,than,pain,and,began,to,dance,up,and,down,writhing,to,break,scarlett's,grip
as,she,screamed,the,moaning,from,the,second,floor,ceased,and,a,moment,later,melanie's,voice,weak,and,trembling,called,scarlett
is,it,you
please,come
please
scarlett,dropped,prissy's,arm,and,the,wench,sank,whimpering,to,the,steps
for,a,moment,scarlett,stood,still,looking,up,listening,to,the,low,moaning,which,had,begun,again
as,she,stood,there,it,seemed,as,though,a,yoke,descended,heavily,upon,her,neck,felt,as,though,a,heavy,load,were,harnessed,to,it,a,load,she,would,feel,as,soon,as,she,took,a,step
she,tried,to,think,of,all,the,things,mammy,and,ellen,had,done,for,her,when,wade,was,born,but,the,merciful,blurring,of,the,childbirth,pains,obscured,almost,everything,in,mist
she,did,recall,a,few,things,and,she,spoke,to,prissy,rapidly,authority,in,her,voice
build,a,fire,in,the,stove,and,keep,hot,water,boiling,in,the,kettle
and,bring,up,all,the,towels,you,can,find,and,that,ball,of,twine
and,get,me,the,scissors
don't,come,telling,me,you,can't,find,them
get,them,and,get,them,quick
now,hurry
she,jerked,prissy,to,her,feet,and,sent,her,kitchenwards,with,a,shove
then,she,squared,her,shoulders,and,started,up,the,stairs
it,was,going,to,be,difficult,telling,melanie,that,she,and,prissy,were,to,deliver,her,baby
chapter,xxii
there,would,never,again,be,an,afternoon,as,long,as,this,one
or,as,hot
or,as,full,of,lazy,insolent,flies
they,swarmed,on,melanie,despite,the,fan,scarlett,kept,in,constant,motion
her,arms,ached,from,swinging,the,wide,palmetto,leaf
all,her,efforts,seemed,futile,for,while,she,brushed,them,from,melanie's,moist,face,they,crawled,on,her,clammy,feet,and,legs,and,made,her,jerk,them,weakly,and,cry,please
on,my,feet
the,room,was,in,semigloom,for,scarlett,had,pulled,down,the,shades,to,shut,out,the,heat,and,brightness
pin,points,of,sunlight,came,in,through,minute,holes,in,the,shades,and,about,the,edges
the,room,was,an,oven,and,scarlett's,sweat-drenched,clothes,never,dried,but,became,wetter,and,stickier,as,the,hours,went,by
prissy,was,crouched,in,a,corner,sweating,too,and,smelled,so,abominably,scarlett,would,have,sent,her,from,the,room,had,she,not,feared,the,girl,would,take,to,her,heels,if,once,out,of,sight
melanie,lay,on,the,bed,on,a,sheet,dark,with,perspiration,and,splotched,with,dampness,where,scarlett,had,spilled,water
she,twisted,endlessly,to,one,side,to,the,other,to,left,to,right,and,back,again
sometimes,she,tried,to,sit,up,and,fell,back,and,began,twisting,again
at,first,she,had,tried,to,keep,from,crying,out,biting,her,lips,until,they,were,raw,and,scarlett,whose,nerves,were,as,raw,as,the,lips,said,huskily,melly,for,god's,sake,don't,try,to,be,brave
yell,if,you,want,to
there's,nobody,to,hear,you,but,us
as,the,afternoon,wore,on,melanie,moaned,whether,she,wanted,to,be,brave,or,not,and,sometimes,she,screamed
when,she,did,scarlett,dropped,her,head,into,her,hands,and,covered,her,ears,and,twisted,her,body,and,wished,that,she,herself,were,dead
anything,was,preferable,to,being,a,helpless,witness,to,such,pain
anything,was,better,than,being,tied,here,waiting,for,a,baby,that,took,such,a,long,time,coming
waiting,when,for,all,she,knew,the,yankees,were,actually,at,five,points
she,fervently,wished,she,had,paid,more,attention,to,the,whispered,conversations,of,matrons,on,the,subject,of,childbirth
if,only,she,had
if,only,she,had,been,more,interested,in,such,matters,she'd,know,whether,melanie,was,taking,a,long,time,or,not
she,had,a,vague,memory,of,one,of,aunt,pitty's,stories,of,a,friend,who,was,in,labor,for,two,days,and,died,without,ever,having,the,baby
suppose,melanie,should,go,on,like,this,for,two,days
but,melanie,was,so,delicate
she,couldn't,stand,two,days,of,this,pain
she'd,die,soon,if,the,baby,didn't,hurry
and,how,could,she,ever,face,ashley,if,he,were,still,alive,and,tell,him,that,melanie,had,died,after,she,had,promised,to,take,care,of,her
at,first,melanie,wanted,to,hold,scarlett's,hand,when,the,pain,was,bad,but,she,clamped,down,on,it,so,hard,she,nearly,broke,the,bones
after,an,hour,of,this,scarlett's,hands,were,so,swollen,and,bruised,she,could,hardly,flex,them
she,knotted,two,long,towels,together,and,tied,them,to,the,foot,of,the,bed,and,put,the,knotted,end,in,melanie's,hands
melanie,hung,onto,it,as,though,it,were,a,life,line,straining,pulling,it,taut,slackening,it,tearing,it
throughout,the,afternoon,her,voice,went,on,like,an,animal,dying,in,a,trap
occasionally,she,dropped,the,towel,and,rubbed,her,hands,feebly,and,looked,up,at,scarlett,with,eyes,enormous,with,pain
talk,to,me
please,talk,to,me,she,whispered,and,scarlett,would,gabble,something,until,melanie,again,gripped,the,knot,and,again,began,writhing
the,dim,room,swam,with,heat,and,pain,and,droning,flies,and,time,went,by,on,such,dragging,feet,scarlett,could,scarcely,remember,the,morning
she,felt,as,if,she,had,been,in,this,steaming,dark,sweating,place,all,her,life
she,wanted,very,much,to,scream,every,time,melanie,did,and,only,by,biting,her,lips,so,hard,it,infuriated,her,could,she,restrain,herself,and,drive,off,hysteria
once,wade,came,tiptoeing,up,the,stairs,and,stood,outside,the,door,wailing
wade,hungwy
scarlett,started,to,go,to,him,but,melanie,whispered,don't,leave,me
please
i,can,stand,it,when,you're,here
so,scarlett,sent,prissy,down,to,warm,up,the,breakfast,hominy,and,feed,him
for,herself,she,felt,that,she,could,never,eat,again,after,this,afternoon
the,clock,on,the,mantel,had,stopped,and,she,had,no,way,of,telling,the,time,but,as,the,heat,in,the,room,lessened,and,the,bright,pin,points,of,light,grew,duller,she,pulled,the,shade,aside
she,saw,to,her,surprise,that,it,was,late,afternoon,and,the,sun,a,ball,of,crimson,was,far,down,the,sky
somehow,she,had,imagined,it,would,remain,broiling,hot,noon,forever
she,wondered,passionately,what,was,going,on,downtown
had,all,the,troops,moved,out,yet
had,the,yankees,come
would,the,confederates,march,away,without,even,a,fight
then,she,remembered,with,a,sick,dropping,in,her,stomach,how,few,confederates,there,were,and,how,many,men,sherman,had,and,how,well,fed,they,were
sherman
the,name,of,satan,himself,did,not,frighten,her,half,so,much
but,there,was,no,time,for,thinking,now,as,melanie,called,for,water,for,a,cold,towel,on,her,head,to,be,fanned,to,have,the,flies,brushed,away,from,her,face
when,twilight,came,on,and,prissy,scurrying,like,a,black,wraith,lit,a,lamp,melanie,became,weaker
she,began,calling,for,ashley,over,and,over,as,if,in,a,delirium,until,the,hideous,monotony,gave,scarlett,a,fierce,desire,to,smother,her,voice,with,a,pillow
perhaps,the,doctor,would,come,after,all
if,he,would,only,come,quickly
hope,raising,its,head,she,turned,to,prissy,and,ordered,her,to,run,quickly,to,the,meades',house,and,see,if,he,were,there,or,mrs,meade
and,if,he's,not,there,ask,mrs,meade,or,cookie,what,to,do
beg,them,to,come
prissy,was,off,with,a,clatter,and,scarlett,watched,her,hurrying,down,the,street,going,faster,than,she,had,ever,dreamed,the,worthless,child,could,move
after,a,prolonged,time,she,was,back,alone
de,doctah,ain',been,home,all,day

scarlett,wanted,to,slap,her,again,for,this,helpful,information,but,melanie,opened,wide,dilated,eyes,and,whispered,dear,are,the,yankees,coming
no,said,scarlett,stoutly
prissy's,a,liar
yas'm,ah,sho,is,prissy,agreed,fervently

my,poor,baby
and,after,a,long,interval,oh,scarlett,you,mustn't,stay,here
you,must,go,and,take,wade
what,melanie,said,was,no,more,than,scarlett,had,been,thinking,but,hearing,it,put,into,words,infuriated,her,shamed,her,as,if,her,secret,cowardice,was,written,plainly,in,her,face
don't,be,a,goose
i'm,not,afraid
you,know,i,won't,leave,you
you,might,as,well
i'm,going,to,die
and,she,began,moaning,again
scarlett,came,down,the,dark,stairs,slowly,like,an,old,woman,feeling,her,way,clinging,to,the,banisters,lest,she,fall
her,legs,were,leaden,trembling,with,fatigue,and,strain,and,she,shivered,with,cold,from,the,clammy,sweat,that,soaked,her,body
feebly,she,made,her,way,onto,the,front,porch,and,sank,down,on,the,top,step
she,sprawled,back,against,a,pillar,of,the,porch,and,with,a,shaking,hand,unbuttoned,her,basque,halfway,down,her,bosom
the,night,was,drenched,in,warm,soft,darkness,and,she,lay,staring,into,it,dull,as,an,ox
it,was,all,over
melanie,was,not,dead,and,the,small,baby,boy,who,made,noises,like,a,young,kitten,was,receiving,his,first,bath,at,prissy's,hands
melanie,was,asleep
how,could,she,sleep,after,that,nightmare,of,screaming,pain,and,ignorant,midwifery,that,hurt,more,than,it,helped
why,wasn't,she,dead
scarlett,knew,that,she,herself,would,have,died,under,such,handling
but,when,it,was,over,melanie,had,even,whispered,so,weakly,she,had,to,bend,over,her,to,hear,thank,you
and,then,she,had,gone,to,sleep
how,could,she,go,to,sleep
scarlett,forgot,that,she,too,had,gone,to,sleep,after,wade,was,born
she,forgot,everything
her,mind,was,a,vacuum,the,world,was,a,vacuum,there,had,been,no,life,before,this,endless,day,and,there,would,be,none,hereafter,only,a,heavily,hot,night,only,the,sound,of,her,hoarse,tired,breathing,only,the,sweat,trickling,coldly,from,armpit,to,waist,from,hip,to,knee,clammy,sticky,chilling
she,heard,her,own,breath,pass,from,loud,evenness,to,spasmodic,sobbing,but,her,eyes,were,dry,and,burning,as,though,there,would,never,be,tears,in,them,again
slowly,laboriously,she,heaved,herself,over,and,pulled,her,heavy,skirts,up,to,her,thighs
she,was,warm,and,cold,and,sticky,all,at,the,same,time,and,the,feel,of,the,night,air,on,her,limbs,was,refreshing
she,thought,dully,what,aunt,pitty,would,say,if,she,could,see,her,sprawled,here,on,the,front,porch,with,her,skirts,up,and,her,drawers,showing,but,she,did,not,care
she,did,not,care,about,anything
time,had,stood,still
it,might,be,just,after,twilight,and,it,might,be,midnight
she,didn't,know,or,care
she,heard,sounds,of,moving,feet,upstairs,and,thought,may,the,lord,damn,prissy,before,her,eyes,closed,and,something,like,sleep,descended,upon,her
then,after,an,indeterminate,dark,interval,prissy,was,beside,her,chattering,on,in,a,pleased,way
we,done,right,good,miss,scarlett
ah,specs,maw,couldn',a,did,no,better
from,the,shadows,scarlett,glared,at,her,too,tired,to,rail,too,tired,to,upbraid,too,tired,to,enumerate,prissy's,offenses,her,boastful,assumption,of,experience,she,didn't,possess,her,fright,her,blundering,awkwardness,her,utter,inefficiency,when,the,emergency,was,hot,the,misplacing,of,the,scissors,the,spilling,of,the,basin,of,water,on,the,bed,the,dropping,of,the,new,born,baby
and,now,she,bragged,about,how,good,she,had,been
and,the,yankees,wanted,to,free,the,negroes
well,the,yankees,were,welcome,to,them
she,lay,back,against,the,pillar,in,silence,and,prissy,aware,of,her,mood,tiptoed,away,into,the,darkness,of,the,porch
after,a,long,interval,in,which,her,breathing,finally,quieted,and,her,mind,steadied,scarlett,heard,the,sound,of,faint,voices,from,up,the,road,the,tramping,of,many,feet,coming,from,the,north
soldiers
she,sat,up,slowly,pulling,down,her,skirts,although,she,knew,no,one,could,see,her,in,the,darkness
as,they,came,abreast,the,house,an,indeterminate,number,passing,like,shadows,she,called,to,them
oh,please
a,shadow,disengaged,itself,from,the,mass,and,came,to,the,gate
are,you,going
are,you,leaving,us
the,shadow,seemed,to,take,off,a,hat,and,a,quiet,voice,came,from,the,darkness
yes,ma'm
that's,what,we're,doing
we're,the,last,of,the,men,from,the,breastworks,'bout,a,mile,north,from,here
are,you,is,the,army,really,retreating
yes,ma'm
you,see,the,yankees,are,coming
the,yankees,are,coming
she,had,forgotten,that
her,throat,suddenly,contracted,and,she,could,say,nothing,more
the,shadow,moved,away,merged,itself,with,the,other,shadows,and,the,feet,tramped,off,into,the,darkness
the,yankees,are,coming
the,yankees,are,coming
that,was,what,the,rhythm,of,their,feet,said,that,was,what,her,suddenly,bumping,heart,thudded,out,with,each,beat
the,yankees,are,coming
de,yankees,is,comin'
bawled,prissy,shrinking,close,to,her
oh,miss,scarlett,dey'll,kill,us,all
dey'll,run,dey,baynits,in,our,stummicks
dey'll
oh,hush
it,was,terrifying,enough,to,think,these,things,without,hearing,them,put,into,trembling,words
renewed,fear,swept,her
what,could,she,do
how,could,she,escape
where,could,she,turn,for,help
every,friend,had,failed,her
suddenly,she,thought,of,rhett,butler,and,calm,dispelled,her,fears
why,hadn't,she,thought,of,him,this,morning,when,she,had,been,tearing,about,like,a,chicken,with,its,head,off
she,hated,him,but,he,was,strong,and,smart,and,he,wasn't,afraid,of,the,yankees
and,he,was,still,in,town
of,course,she,was,mad,at,him
but,she,could,overlook,such,things,at,a,time,like,this
and,he,had,a,horse,and,carriage,too
oh,why,hadn't,she,thought,of,him,before
he,could,take,them,all,away,from,this,doomed,place,away,from,the,yankees,somewhere,anywhere
she,turned,to,prissy,and,spoke,with,feverish,urgency

gawdlmighty,miss,scarlett
but,under,the,determined,pressure,of,her,mistress',hand,she,started,down,the,steps
the,front,gate,clicked,and,scarlett,cried,run,you,goose
she,heard,the,patter,of,prissy's,feet,as,she,broke,into,a,trot,and,then,the,sound,died,away,on,the,soft,earth
chapter,xxiii
after,prissy,had,gone,scarlett,went,wearily,into,the,downstairs,hall,and,lit,a,lamp
the,house,felt,steamingly,hot,as,though,it,held,in,its,walls,all,the,heat,of,the,noontide
some,of,her,dullness,was,passing,now,and,her,stomach,was,clamoring,for,food
she,remembered,she,had,had,nothing,to,eat,since,the,night,before,except,a,spoonful,of,hominy,and,picking,up,the,lamp,she,went,into,the,kitchen
the,fire,in,the,oven,had,died,but,the,room,was,stifling,hot
she,found,half,a,pone,of,hard,corn,bread,in,the,skillet,and,gnawed,hungrily,on,it,while,she,looked,about,for,other,food
there,was,some,hominy,left,in,the,pot,and,she,ate,it,with,a,big,cooking,spoon,not,waiting,to,put,it,on,a,plate
it,needed,salt,badly,but,she,was,too,hungry,to,hunt,for,it
after,four,spoonfuls,of,it,the,heat,of,the,room,was,too,much,and,taking,the,lamp,in,one,hand,and,a,fragment,of,pone,in,the,other,she,went,out,into,the,hall
she,knew,she,should,go,upstairs,and,sit,beside,melanie
if,anything,went,wrong,melanie,would,be,too,weak,to,call
but,the,idea,of,returning,to,that,room,where,she,had,spent,so,many,nightmare,hours,was,repulsive,to,her
even,if,melanie,were,dying,she,couldn't,go,back,up,there
she,never,wanted,to,see,that,room,again
she,set,the,lamp,on,the,candle,stand,by,the,window,and,returned,to,the,front,porch
it,was,so,much,cooler,here,and,even,the,night,was,drowned,in,soft,warmth
she,sat,down,on,the,steps,in,the,circle,of,faint,light,thrown,by,the,lamp,and,continued,gnawing,on,the,corn,bread
when,she,had,finished,it,a,measure,of,strength,came,back,to,her,and,with,the,strength,came,again,the,pricking,of,fear
she,could,hear,a,humming,of,noise,far,down,the,street,but,what,it,portended,she,did,not,know
she,could,distinguish,nothing,but,a,volume,of,sound,that,rose,and,fell
she,strained,forward,trying,to,hear,and,soon,she,found,her,muscles,aching,from,the,tension
more,than,anything,in,the,world,she,yearned,to,hear,the,sound,of,hooves,and,to,see,rhett's,careless,self-confident,eyes,laughing,at,her,fears
rhett,would,take,them,away,somewhere
she,didn't,know,where
she,didn't,care
as,she,sat,straining,her,ears,toward,town,a,faint,glow,appeared,above,the,trees
it,puzzled,her
she,watched,it,and,saw,it,grow,brighter
the,dark,sky,became,pink,and,then,dull,red,and,suddenly,above,the,trees,she,saw,a,huge,tongue,of,flame,leap,high,to,the,heavens
she,jumped,to,her,feet,her,heart,beginning,again,its,sickening,thudding,and,bumping
the,yankees,had,come
she,knew,they,had,come,and,they,were,burning,the,town
the,flames,seemed,to,be,off,to,the,east,of,the,center,of,town
they,shot,higher,and,higher,and,widened,rapidly,into,a,broad,expanse,of,red,before,her,terrified,eyes
a,whole,block,must,be,burning
a,faint,hot,breeze,that,had,sprung,up,bore,the,smell,of,smoke,to,her
she,fled,up,the,stairs,to,her,own,room,and,hung,out,the,window,for,a,better,view
the,sky,was,a,hideous,lurid,color,and,great,swirls,of,black,smoke,went,twisting,up,to,hand,in,billowy,clouds,above,the,flames
the,smell,of,smoke,was,stronger,now
her,mind,rushed,incoherently,here,and,there,thinking,how,soon,the,flames,would,spread,up,peachtree,street,and,burn,this,house,how,soon,the,yankees,would,be,rushing,in,upon,her,where,she,would,run,what,she,would,do
all,the,fiends,of,hell,seemed,screaming,in,her,ears,and,her,brain,swirled,with,confusion,and,panic,so,overpowering,she,clung,to,the,window,sill,for,support
i,must,think,she,told,herself,over,and,over
i,must,think
but,thoughts,eluded,her,darting,in,and,out,of,her,mind,like,frightened,humming,birds
as,she,stood,hanging,to,the,sill,a,deafening,explosion,burst,on,her,ears,louder,than,any,cannon,she,had,ever,heard
the,sky,was,rent,with,gigantic,flame
then,other,explosions
the,earth,shook,and,the,glass,in,the,panes,above,her,head,shivered,and,came,down,around,her
the,world,became,an,inferno,of,noise,and,flame,and,trembling,earth,as,one,explosion,followed,another,in,earsplitting,succession
torrents,of,sparks,shot,to,the,sky,and,descended,slowly,lazily,through,blood-colored,clouds,of,smoke
she,thought,she,heard,a,feeble,call,from,the,next,room,but,she,paid,it,no,heed
she,had,no,time,for,melanie,now
no,time,for,anything,except,a,fear,that,licked,through,her,veins,as,swiftly,as,the,flames,she,saw
she,was,a,child,and,mad,with,fright,and,she,wanted,to,bury,her,head,in,her,mother's,lap,and,shut,out,this,sight
if,she,were,only,home
home,with,mother
through,the,nerve-shivering,sounds,she,heard,another,sound,that,of,fear-sped,feet,coming,up,the,stairs,three,at,a,time,heard,a,voice,yelping,like,a,lost,hound
prissy,broke,into,the,room,and,flying,to,scarlett,clutched,her,arm,in,a,grip,that,seemed,to,pinch,out,pieces,of,flesh

so,he,say
she,drew,a,long,breath,of,relief
if,there,was,any,way,of,getting,a,horse,rhett,butler,would,get,one
a,smart,man,rhett
she,would,forgive,him,anything,if,he,got,them,out,of,this,mess

and,with,rhett,she,would,have,no,fear
rhett,would,protect,them
thank,god,for,rhett
with,safety,in,view,she,turned,practical
wake,wade,up,and,dress,him,and,pack,some,clothes,for,all,of,us
put,them,in,the,small,trunk
and,don't,tell,miss,mellie,we're,going
not,yet
but,wrap,the,baby,in,a,couple,of,thick,towels,and,be,sure,and,pack,his,clothes
prissy,still,clung,to,her,skirts,and,hardly,anything,showed,in,her,eyes,except,the,whites
scarlett,gave,her,a,shove,and,loosened,her,grip
hurry,she,cried,and,prissy,went,off,like,a,rabbit
scarlett,knew,she,should,go,in,and,quiet,melanie's,fear,knew,melanie,must,be,frightened,out,of,her,senses,by,the,thunderous,noises,that,continued,unabated,and,the,glare,that,lighted,the,sky
it,looked,and,sounded,like,the,end,of,the,world
but,she,could,not,bring,herself,to,go,back,into,that,room,just,yet
she,ran,down,the,stairs,with,some,idea,of,packing,up,miss,pittypat's,china,and,the,little,silver,she,had,left,when,she,refugeed,to,macon
but,when,she,reached,the,dining,room,her,hands,were,shaking,so,badly,she,dropped,three,plates,and,shattered,them
she,ran,out,onto,the,porch,to,listen,and,back,again,to,the,dining,room,and,dropped,the,silver,clattering,to,the,floor
everything,she,touched,she,dropped
in,her,hurry,she,slipped,on,the,rag,rug,and,fell,to,the,floor,with,a,jolt,but,leaped,up,so,quickly,she,was,not,even,aware,of,the,pain
upstairs,she,could,hear,prissy,galloping,about,like,a,wild,animal,and,the,sound,maddened,her,for,she,was,galloping,just,as,aimlessly
for,the,dozenth,time,she,ran,out,onto,the,porch,but,this,time,she,did,not,go,back,to,her,futile,packing
she,sat,down
it,was,just,impossible,to,pack,anything
impossible,to,do,anything,but,sit,with,hammering,heart,and,wait,for,rhett
it,seemed,hours,before,he,came
at,last,far,up,the,road,she,heard,the,protesting,screech,of,unoiled,axles,and,the,slow,uncertain,plodding,of,hooves
why,didn't,he,hurry
why,didn't,he,make,the,horse,trot
the,sounds,came,nearer,and,she,leaped,to,her,feet,and,called,rhett's,name
then,she,saw,him,dimly,as,he,climbed,down,from,the,seat,of,a,small,wagon,heard,the,clicking,of,the,gate,as,he,came,toward,her
he,came,into,view,and,the,light,of,the,lamp,showed,him,plainly
his,dress,was,as,debonaire,as,if,he,were,going,to,a,ball,well-tailored,white,linen,coat,and,trousers,embroidered,gray,watered-silk,waistcoat,and,a,hint,of,ruffle,on,his,shirt,bosom
his,wide,panama,hat,was,set,dashingly,on,one,side,of,his,head,and,in,the,belt,of,his,trousers,were,thrust,two,ivory-handled,long-,barreled,dueling,pistols
the,pockets,of,his,coat,sagged,heavily,with,ammunition
he,came,up,the,walk,with,the,springy,stride,of,a,savage,and,his,fine,head,was,carried,like,a,pagan,prince
the,dangers,of,the,night,which,had,driven,scarlett,into,panic,had,affected,him,like,an,intoxicant
there,was,a,carefully,restrained,ferocity,in,his,dark,face,a,ruthlessness,which,would,have,frightened,her,had,she,the,wits,to,see,it
his,black,eyes,danced,as,though,amused,by,the,whole,affair,as,though,the,earth-splitting,sounds,and,the,horrid,glare,were,merely,things,to,frighten,children
she,swayed,toward,him,as,he,came,up,the,steps,her,face,white,her,green,eyes,burning
good,evening,he,said,in,his,drawling,voice,as,he,removed,his,hat,with,a,sweeping,gesture
fine,weather,we're,having
i,hear,you're,going,to,take,a,trip
if,you,make,any,jokes,i,shall,never,speak,to,you,again,she,said,with,quivering,voice
don't,tell,me,you,are,frightened
he,pretended,to,be,surprised,and,smiled,in,a,way,that,made,her,long,to,push,him,backwards,down,the,steep,steps
yes,i,am
i'm,frightened,to,death,and,if,you,had,the,sense,god,gave,a,goat,you'd,be,frightened,too
but,we,haven't,got,time,to,talk
we,must,get,out,of,here
at,your,service,madam
but,just,where,were,you,figuring,on,going
i,made,the,trip,out,here,for,curiosity,just,to,see,where,you,were,intending,to,go
you,can't,go,north,or,east,or,south,or,west
the,yankees,are,all,around
there's,just,one,road,out,of,town,which,the,yankees,haven't,got,yet,and,the,army,is,retreating,by,that,road
and,that,road,won't,be,open,long
general,steve,lee's,cavalry,is,fighting,a,rear-guard,action,at,rough,and,ready,to,hold,it,open,long,enough,for,the,army,to,get,away
if,you,follow,the,army,down,the,mcdonough,road,they'll,take,the,horse,away,from,you,and,while,it's,not,much,of,a,horse,i,did,go,to,a,lot,of,trouble,stealing,it
just,where,are,you,going
she,stood,shaking,listening,to,his,words,hardly,hearing,them
but,at,his,question,she,suddenly,knew,where,she,was,going,knew,that,all,this,miserable,day,she,had,known,where,she,was,going
the,only,place
i'm,going,home,she,said
home
you,mean,to,tara
yes,yes
to,tara
oh,rhett,we,must,hurry
he,looked,at,her,as,if,she,had,lost,her,mind
tara
god,almighty,scarlett
don't,you,know,they,fought,all,day,at,jonesboro
fought,for,ten,miles,up,and,down,the,road,from,rough,and,ready,even,into,the,streets,of,jonesboro
the,yankees,may,be,all,over,tara,by,now,all,over,the,county
nobody,knows,where,they,are,but,they're,in,that,neighborhood
you,can't,go,home
you,can't,go,right,through,the,yankee,army
i,will,go,home
she,cried
i,will
i,will
you,little,fool,and,his,voice,was,swift,and,rough
you,can't,go,that,way
even,if,you,didn't,run,into,the,yankees,the,woods,are,full,of,stragglers,and,deserters,from,both,armies
and,lots,of,our,troops,are,still,retreating,from,jonesboro
they'd,take,the,horse,away,from,you,as,quickly,as,the,yankees,would
your,only,chance,is,to,follow,the,troops,down,the,mcdonough,road,and,pray,that,they,won't,see,you,in,the,dark
you,can't,go,to,tara
even,if,you,got,there,you'd,probably,find,it,burned,down
i,won't,let,you,go,home
it's,insanity
i,will,go,home
she,cried,and,her,voice,broke,and,rose,to,a,scream
i,will,go,home
you,can't,stop,me
i,will,go,home
i,want,my,mother
i'll,kill,you,if,you,try,to,stop,me
i,will,go,home
tears,of,fright,and,hysteria,streamed,down,her,face,as,she,finally,gave,way,under,the,long,strain
she,beat,on,his,chest,with,her,fists,and,screamed,again,i,will
i,will
if,i,have,to,walk,every,step,of,the,way
suddenly,she,was,in,his,arms,her,wet,cheek,against,the,starched,ruffle,of,his,shirt,her,beating,hands,stilled,against,him
his,hands,caressed,her,tumbled,hair,gently,soothingly,and,his,voice,was,gentle,too
so,gentle,so,quiet,so,devoid,of,mockery,it,did,not,seem,rhett,butler's,voice,at,all,but,the,voice,of,some,kind,strong,stranger,who,smelled,of,brandy,and,tobacco,and,horses,comforting,smells,because,they,reminded,her,of,gerald
there,there,darling,he,said,softly
don't,cry
you,shall,go,home,my,brave,little,girl
you,shall,go,home
don't,cry
she,felt,something,brush,her,hair,and,wondered,vaguely,through,her,tumult,if,it,were,his,lips
he,was,so,tender,so,infinitely,soothing,she,longed,to,stay,in,his,arms,forever
with,such,strong,arms,about,her,surely,nothing,could,harm,her
he,fumbled,in,his,pocket,and,produced,a,handkerchief,and,wiped,her,eyes
now,blow,your,nose,like,a,good,child,he,ordered,a,glint,of,a,smile,in,his,eyes,and,tell,me,what,to,do
we,must,work,fast
she,blew,her,nose,obediently,still,trembling,but,she,could,not,think,what,to,tell,him,to,do
seeing,how,her,lip,quivered,and,her,eyes,looked,up,at,him,helplessly,he,took,command
mrs,wilkes,has,had,her,child
it,will,be,dangerous,to,move,her,dangerous,to,drive,her,twenty-five,miles,in,that,rickety,wagon
we'd,better,leave,her,with,mrs
meade
the,meades,aren't,home
i,can't,leave,her
very,well
into,the,wagon,she,goes
where,is,that,simple-minded,little,wench
upstairs,packing,the,trunk
trunk
you,can't,take,any,trunk,in,that,wagon
it's,almost,too,small,to,hold,all,of,you,and,the,wheels,are,ready,to,come,off,with,no,encouragement
call,her,and,tell,her,to,get,the,smallest,feather,bed,in,the,house,and,put,it,in,the,wagon
still,scarlett,could,not,move
he,took,her,arm,in,a,strong,grasp,and,some,of,the,vitality,which,animated,him,seemed,to,flow,into,her,body
if,only,she,could,be,as,cool,and,casual,as,he,was
he,propelled,her,into,the,hall,but,she,still,stood,helplessly,looking,at,him
his,lip,went,down,mockingly,can,this,be,the,heroic,young,woman,who,assured,me,she,feared,neither,god,nor,man
he,suddenly,burst,into,laughter,and,dropped,her,arm
stung,she,glared,at,him,hating,him
i'm,not,afraid,she,said
yes,you,are
in,another,moment,you'll,be,in,a,swoon,and,i,have,no,smelling,salts,about,me
she,stamped,her,foot,impotently,because,she,could,not,think,of,anything,else,to,do,and,without,a,word,picked,up,the,lamp,and,started,up,the,stairs
he,was,close,behind,her,and,she,could,hear,him,laughing,softly,to,himself
that,sound,stiffened,her,spine
she,went,into,wade's,nursery,and,found,him,sitting,clutched,in,prissy's,arms,half,dressed,hiccoughing,quietly
prissy,was,whimpering
the,feather,tick,on,wade's,bed,was,small,and,she,ordered,prissy,to,drag,it,down,the,stairs,and,into,the,wagon
prissy,put,down,the,child,and,obeyed
wade,followed,her,down,the,stairs,his,hiccoughs,stilled,by,his,interest,in,the,proceedings
come,said,scarlett,turning,to,melanie's,door,and,rhett,followed,her,hat,in,hand
melanie,lay,quietly,with,the,sheet,up,to,her,chin
her,face,was,deathly,white,but,her,eyes,sunken,and,black,circled,were,serene
she,showed,no,surprise,at,the,sight,of,rhett,in,her,bedroom,but,seemed,to,take,it,as,a,matter,of,course
she,tried,to,smile,weakly,but,the,smile,died,before,it,reached,the,corners,of,her,mouth
we,are,going,home,to,tara,scarlett,explained,rapidly
the,yankees,are,coming
rhett,is,going,to,take,us
it's,the,only,way,melly
melanie,tried,to,nod,her,head,feebly,and,gestured,toward,the,baby
scarlett,picked,up,the,small,baby,and,wrapped,him,hastily,in,a,thick,towel
rhett,stepped,to,the,bed
i'll,try,not,to,hurt,you,he,said,quietly,tucking,the,sheet,about,her
see,if,you,can,put,your,arms,around,my,neck
melanie,tried,but,they,fell,back,weakly
he,bent,slipped,an,arm,under,her,shoulders,and,another,across,her,knees,and,lifted,her,gently
she,did,not,cry,out,but,scarlett,saw,her,bite,her,lip,and,go,even,whiter
scarlett,held,the,lamp,high,for,rhett,to,see,and,started,toward,the,door,when,melanie,made,a,feeble,gesture,toward,the,wall
what,is,it
rhett,asked,softly
please,melanie,whispered,trying,to,point
charles
rhett,looked,down,at,her,as,if,he,thought,her,delirious,but,scarlett,understood,and,was,irritated
she,knew,melanie,wanted,the,daguerreotype,of,charles,which,hung,on,the,wall,below,his,sword,and,pistol
please,melanie,whispered,again,the,sword
oh,all,right,said,scarlett,and,after,she,had,lighted,rhett's,careful,way,down,the,steps,she,went,back,and,unhooked,the,sword,and,pistol,belts
it,would,be,awkward,carrying,them,as,well,as,the,baby,and,the,lamp
that,was,just,like,melanie,not,to,be,at,all,bothered,over,nearly,dying,and,having,the,yankees,at,her,heels,but,to,worry,about,charles',things
as,she,took,down,the,daguerreotype,she,caught,a,glimpse,of,charles',face
his,large,brown,eyes,met,hers,and,she,stopped,for,a,moment,to,look,at,the,picture,curiously
this,man,had,been,her,husband,had,lain,beside,her,for,a,few,nights,had,given,her,a,child,with,eyes,as,soft,and,brown,as,his
and,she,could,hardly,remember,him
the,child,in,her,arms,waved,small,fists,and,mewed,softly,and,she,looked,down,at,him
for,the,first,time,she,realized,that,this,was,ashley's,baby,and,suddenly,wished,with,all,the,strength,left,in,her,that,he,were,her,baby,hers,and,ashley's
prissy,came,bounding,up,the,stairs,and,scarlett,handed,the,child,to,her
they,went,hastily,down,the,lamp,throwing,uncertain,shadows,on,the,wall
in,the,hall,scarlett,saw,a,bonnet,and,put,it,on,hurriedly,tying,the,ribbons,under,her,chin
it,was,melanie's,black,mourning,bonnet,and,it,did,not,fit,scarlett's,head,but,she,could,not,recall,where,she,had,put,her,own,bonnet
she,went,out,of,the,house,and,down,the,front,steps,carrying,the,lamp,and,trying,to,keep,the,saber,from,banging,against,her,legs
melanie,lay,full,length,in,the,back,of,the,wagon,and,beside,her,were,wade,and,the,towel-swathed,baby
prissy,climbed,in,and,took,the,baby,in,her,arms
the,wagon,was,very,small,and,the,boards,about,the,sides,very,low
the,wheels,leaned,inward,as,if,their,first,revolution,would,make,them,come,off
she,took,one,look,at,the,horse,and,her,heart,sank
he,was,a,small,emaciated,animal,and,he,stood,with,his,head,dispiritedly,low,almost,between,his,forelegs
his,back,was,raw,with,sores,and,harness,galls,and,he,breathed,as,no,sound,horse,should
not,much,of,an,animal,is,it
grinned,rhett
looks,like,he'll,die,in,the,shafts
but,he's,the,best,i,could,do
some,day,i'll,tell,you,with,embellishments,just,where,and,how,i,stole,him,and,how,narrowly,i,missed,getting,shot
nothing,but,my,devotion,to,you,would,make,me,at,this,stage,of,my,career,turn,horse,thief,and,thief,of,such,a,horse
let,me,help,you,in
he,took,the,lamp,from,her,and,set,it,on,the,ground
the,front,seat,was,only,a,narrow,plank,across,the,sides,of,the,wagon
rhett,picked,scarlett,up,bodily,and,swung,her,to,it
how,wonderful,to,be,a,man,and,as,strong,as,rhett,she,thought,tucking,her,wide,skirts,about,her
with,rhett,beside,her,she,did,not,fear,anything,neither,the,fire,nor,the,noise,nor,the,yankees
he,climbed,onto,the,seat,beside,her,and,picked,up,the,reins
oh,wait
she,cried
i,forgot,to,lock,the,front,door
he,burst,into,a,roar,of,laughter,and,slapped,the,reins,upon,the,horse's,back
what,are,you,laughing,at
at,you,locking,the,yankees,out,he,said,and,the,horse,started,off,slowly,reluctantly
the,lamp,on,the,sidewalk,burned,on,making,a,tiny,yellow,circle,of,light,which,grew,smaller,and,smaller,as,they,moved,away
rhett,turned,the,horse's,slow,feet,westward,from,peachtree,and,the,wobbling,wagon,jounced,into,the,rutty,lane,with,a,violence,that,wrenched,an,abruptly,stifled,moan,from,melanie
dark,trees,interlaced,above,their,heads,dark,silent,houses,loomed,up,on,either,side,and,the,white,palings,of,fences,gleamed,faintly,like,a,row,of,tombstones
the,narrow,street,was,a,dim,tunnel,but,faintly,through,the,thick,leafy,ceiling,the,hideous,red,glow,of,the,sky,penetrated,and,shadows,chased,one,another,down,the,dark,way,like,mad,ghosts
the,smell,of,smoke,came,stronger,and,stronger,and,on,the,wings,of,the,hot,breeze,came,a,pandemonium,of,sound,from,the,center,of,town,yells,the,dull,rumbling,of,heavy,army,wagons,and,the,steady,tramp,of,marching,feet
as,rhett,jerked,the,horse's,head,and,turned,him,into,another,street,another,deafening,explosion,tore,the,air,and,a,monstrous,skyrocket,of,flame,and,smoke,shot,up,in,the,west
that,must,be,the,last,of,the,ammunition,trains,rhett,said,calmly
why,didn't,they,get,them,out,this,morning,the,fools
there,was,plenty,of,time
well,too,bad,for,us
i,thought,by,circling,around,the,center,of,town,we,might,avoid,the,fire,and,that,drunken,mob,on,decatur,street,and,get,through,to,the,southwest,part,of,town,without,any,danger
but,we've,got,to,cross,marietta,street,somewhere,and,that,explosion,was,near,marietta,street,or,i,miss,my,guess
must,must,we,go,through,the,fire
scarlett,quavered
not,if,we,hurry,said,rhett,and,springing,from,the,wagon,he,disappeared,into,the,darkness,of,a,yard
when,he,returned,he,had,a,small,limb,of,a,tree,in,his,hand,and,he,laid,it,mercilessly,across,the,horse's,galled,back
the,animal,broke,into,a,shambling,trot,his,breath,panting,and,labored,and,the,wagon,swayed,forward,with,a,jolt,that,threw,them,about,like,popcorn,in,a,popper
the,baby,wailed,and,prissy,and,wade,cried,out,as,they,bruised,themselves,against,the,sides,of,the,wagon
but,from,melanie,there,was,no,sound
as,they,neared,marietta,street,the,trees,thinned,out,and,the,tall,flames,roaring,up,above,the,buildings,threw,street,and,houses,into,a,glare,of,light,brighter,than,day,casting,monstrous,shadows,that,twisted,as,wildly,as,torn,sails,flapping,in,a,gale,on,a,sinking,ship
scarlett's,teeth,chattered,but,so,great,was,her,terror,she,was,not,even,aware,of,it
she,was,cold,and,she,shivered,even,though,the,heat,of,the,flames,was,already,hot,against,their,faces
this,was,hell,and,she,was,in,it,and,if,she,could,only,have,conquered,her,shaking,knees,she,would,have,leaped,from,the,wagon,and,run,screaming,back,the,dark,road,they,had,come,back,to,the,refuge,of,miss,pittypat's,house
she,shrank,closer,to,rhett,took,his,arm,in,fingers,that,trembled,and,looked,up,at,him,for,words,for,comfort,for,something,reassuring
in,the,unholy,crimson,glow,that,bathed,them,his,dark,profile,stood,out,as,clearly,as,the,head,on,an,ancient,coin,beautiful,cruel,and,decadent
at,her,touch,he,turned,to,her,his,eyes,gleaming,with,a,light,as,frightening,as,the,fire
to,scarlett,he,seemed,as,exhilarated,and,contemptuous,as,if,he,got,strong,pleasure,from,the,situation,as,if,he,welcomed,the,inferno,they,were,approaching
here,he,said,laying,a,hand,on,one,of,the,long-barreled,pistols,in,his,belt
if,anyone,black,or,white,comes,up,on,your,side,of,the,wagon,and,tries,to,lay,hand,on,the,horse,shoot,him,and,we'll,ask,questions,later
but,for,god's,sake,don't,shoot,the,nag,in,your,excitement
i,i,have,a,pistol,she,whispered,clutching,the,weapon,in,her,lap,perfectly,certain,that,if,death,stared,her,in,the,face,she,would,be,too,frightened,to,pull,the,trigger
you,have
where,did,you,get,it
it's,charles'
charles
yes,charles,my,husband
did,you,ever,really,have,a,husband,my,dear
he,whispered,and,laughed,softly
if,he,would,only,be,serious
if,he,would,only,hurry
how,do,you,suppose,i,got,my,boy
she,cried,fiercely
oh,there,are,other,ways,than,husbands
will,you,hush,and,hurry
but,he,drew,rein,abruptly,almost,at,marietta,street,in,the,shadow,of,a,warehouse,not,yet,touched,by,the,flames
hurry
it,was,the,only,word,in,her,mind
hurry
hurry
soldiers,he,said
the,detachment,came,down,marietta,street,between,the,burning,buildings,walking,at,route,step,tiredly,rifles,held,any,way,heads,down,too,weary,to,hurry,too,weary,to,care,if,timbers,were,crashing,to,right,and,left,and,smoke,billowing,about,them
they,were,all,ragged,so,ragged,that,between,officers,and,men,there,were,no,distinguishing,insignia,except,here,and,there,a,torn,hat,brim,pinned,up,with,a,wreathed,c,s,a
many,were,barefooted,and,here,and,there,a,dirty,bandage,wrapped,a,head,or,arm
they,went,past,looking,neither,to,left,nor,right,so,silent,that,had,it,not,been,for,the,steady,tramp,of,feet,they,might,all,have,been,ghosts
take,a,good,look,at,them,came,rhett's,gibing,voice,so,you,can,tell,your,grandchildren,you,saw,the,rear,guard,of,the,glorious,cause,in,retreat
suddenly,she,hated,him,hated,him,with,a,strength,that,momentarily,overpowered,her,fear,made,it,seem,petty,and,small
she,knew,her,safety,and,that,of,the,others,in,the,back,of,the,wagon,depended,on,him,and,him,alone,but,she,hated,him,for,his,sneering,at,those,ragged,ranks
she,thought,of,charles,who,was,dead,and,ashley,who,might,be,dead,and,all,the,gay,and,gallant,young,men,who,were,rotting,in,shallow,graves,and,she,forgot,that,she,too,had,once,thought,them,fools
she,could,not,speak,but,hatred,and,disgust,burned,in,her,eyes,as,she,stared,at,him,fiercely
as,the,last,of,the,soldiers,were,passing,a,small,figure,in,the,rear,rank,his,rifle,butt,dragging,the,ground,wavered,stopped,and,stared,after,the,others,with,a,dirty,face,so,dulled,by,fatigue,he,looked,like,a,sleepwalker
he,was,as,small,as,scarlett,so,small,his,rifle,was,almost,as,tall,as,he,was,and,his,grime-smeared,face,was,unbearded
sixteen,at,the,most,thought,scarlett,irrelevantly,must,be,one,of,the,home,guard,or,a,runaway,schoolboy
as,she,watched,the,boy's,knees,buckled,slowly,and,he,went,down,in,the,dust
without,a,word,two,men,fell,out,of,the,last,rank,and,walked,back,to,him
one,a,tall,spare,man,with,a,black,beard,that,hung,to,his,belt,silently,handed,his,own,rifle,and,that,of,the,boy,to,the,other
then,stooping,he,jerked,the,boy,to,his,shoulders,with,an,ease,that,looked,like,sleight,of,hand
he,started,off,slowly,after,the,retreating,column,his,shoulders,bowed,under,the,weight,while,the,boy,weak,infuriated,like,a,child,teased,by,its,elders,screamed,out,put,me,down,damn,you
put,me,down
i,can,walk
the,bearded,man,said,nothing,and,plodded,on,out,of,sight,around,the,bend,of,the,road
rhett,sat,still,the,reins,lax,in,his,hands,looking,after,them,a,curious,moody,look,on,his,swarthy,face
then,there,was,a,crash,of,falling,timbers,near,by,and,scarlett,saw,a,thin,tongue,of,flame,lick,up,over,the,roof,of,the,warehouse,in,whose,sheltering,shadow,they,sat
then,pennons,and,battle,flags,of,flame,flared,triumphantly,to,the,sky,above,them
smoke,burnt,her,nostrils,and,wade,and,prissy,began,coughing
the,baby,made,soft,sneezing,sounds
oh,name,of,god,rhett
are,you,crazy
hurry
hurry
rhett,made,no,reply,but,brought,the,tree,limb,down,on,the,horse's,back,with,a,cruel,force,that,made,the,animal,leap,forward
with,all,the,speed,the,horse,could,summon,they,jolted,and,bounced,across,marietta,street
ahead,of,them,was,a,tunnel,of,fire,where,buildings,were,blazing,on,either,side,of,the,short,narrow,street,that,led,down,to,the,railroad,tracks
they,plunged,into,it
a,glare,brighter,than,a,dozen,suns,dazzled,their,eyes,scorching,heat,seared,their,skins,and,the,roaring,cracking,and,crashing,beat,upon,their,ears,in,painful,waves
for,an,eternity,it,seemed,they,were,in,the,midst,of,flaming,torment,and,then,abruptly,they,were,in,semidarkness,again
as,they,dashed,down,the,street,and,bumped,over,the,railroad,tracks,rhett,applied,the,whip,automatically
his,face,looked,set,and,absent,as,though,he,had,forgotten,where,he,was
his,broad,shoulders,were,hunched,forward,and,his,chin,jutted,out,as,though,the,thoughts,in,his,mind,were,not,pleasant
the,heat,of,the,fire,made,sweat,stream,down,his,forehead,and,cheeks,but,he,did,not,wipe,it,off
they,pulled,into,a,side,street,then,another,then,turned,and,twisted,from,one,narrow,street,to,another,until,scarlett,completely,lost,her,bearings,and,the,roaring,of,the,flames,died,behind,them
still,rhett,did,not,speak
he,only,laid,on,the,whip,with,regularity
the,red,glow,in,the,sky,was,fading,now,and,the,road,became,so,dark,so,frightening,scarlett,would,have,welcomed,words,any,words,from,him,even,jeering,insulting,words,words,that,cut
but,he,did,not,speak
silent,or,not,she,thanked,heaven,for,the,comfort,of,his,presence
it,was,so,good,to,have,a,man,beside,her,to,lean,close,to,him,and,feel,the,hard,swell,of,his,arm,and,know,that,he,stood,between,her,and,unnamable,terrors,even,though,he,merely,sat,there,and,stared
oh,rhett,she,whispered,clasping,his,arm,what,would,we,ever,have,done,without,you
i'm,so,glad,you,aren't,in,the,army
he,turned,his,head,and,gave,her,one,look,a,look,that,made,her,drop,his,arm,and,shrink,back
there,was,no,mockery,in,his,eyes,now
they,were,naked,and,there,was,anger,and,something,like,bewilderment,in,them
his,lip,curled,down,and,he,turned,his,head,away
for,a,long,time,they,jounced,along,in,a,silence,unbroken,except,for,the,faint,wails,of,the,baby,and,sniffles,from,prissy
when,she,was,able,to,bear,the,sniffling,noise,no,longer,scarlett,turned,and,pinched,her,viciously,causing,prissy,to,scream,in,good,earnest,before,she,relapsed,into,frightened,silence
finally,rhett,turned,the,horse,at,right,angles,and,after,a,while,they,were,on,a,wider,smoother,road
the,dim,shapes,of,houses,grew,farther,and,farther,apart,and,unbroken,woods,loomed,wall-like,on,either,side
we're,out,of,town,now,said,rhett,briefly,drawing,rein,and,on,the,main,road,to,rough,and,ready
hurry
don't,stop
let,the,animal,breathe,a,bit
then,turning,to,her,he,asked,slowly,scarlett,are,you,still,determined,to,do,this,crazy,thing
do,what
do,you,still,want,to,try,to,get,through,to,tara
it's,suicidal
steve,lee's,cavalry,and,the,yankee,army,are,between,you,and,tara
oh,dear,god
was,he,going,to,refuse,to,take,her,home,after,all,she'd,gone,through,this,terrible,day
oh,yes
yes
please,rhett,let's,hurry
the,horse,isn't,tired
just,a,minute
you,can't,go,down,to,jonesboro,on,this,road
you,can't,follow,the,train,tracks
they've,been,fighting,up,and,down,there,all,day,from,rough,and,ready,on,south
do,you,know,any,other,roads,small,wagon,roads,or,lanes,that,don't,go,through,rough,and,ready,or,jonesboro
oh,yes,cried,scarlett,in,relief
if,we,can,just,get,near,to,rough,and,ready,i,know,a,wagon,trace,that,winds,off,from,the,main,jonesboro,road,and,wanders,around,for,miles
pa,and,i,used,to,ride,it
it,comes,out,right,near,the,macintosh,place,and,that's,only,a,mile,from,tara
good
maybe,you,can,get,past,rough,and,ready,all,right
general,steve,lee,was,there,during,the,afternoon,covering,the,retreat
maybe,the,yankees,aren't,there,yet
maybe,you,can,get,through,there,if,steve,lee's,men,don't,pick,up,your,horse
_i_,can,get,through
yes,you
his,voice,was,rough
but,rhett,you,aren't,going,to,take,us
no
i'm,leaving,you,here
she,looked,around,wildly,at,the,livid,sky,behind,them,at,the,dark,trees,on,either,hand,hemming,them,in,like,a,prison,wall,at,the,frightened,figures,in,the,back,of,the,wagon,and,finally,at,him
had,she,gone,crazy
was,she,not,hearing,right
he,was,grinning,now
she,could,just,see,his,white,teeth,in,the,faint,light,and,the,old,mockery,was,back,in,his,eyes
leaving,us
where,where,are,you,going
i,am,going,dear,girl,with,the,army
she,sighed,with,relief,and,irritation
why,did,he,joke,at,this,time,of,all,times
rhett,in,the,army
after,all,he'd,said,about,stupid,fools,who,were,enticed,into,losing,their,lives,by,a,roll,of,drums,and,brave,words,from,orators,fools,who,killed,themselves,that,wise,men,might,make,money
oh,i,could,choke,you,for,scaring,me,so
let's,get,on
i'm,not,joking,my,dear
and,i,am,hurt,scarlett,that,you,do,not,take,my,gallant,sacrifice,with,better,spirit
where,is,your,patriotism,your,love,for,our,glorious,cause
now,is,your,chance,to,tell,me,to,return,with,my,shield,or,on,it
but,talk,fast,for,i,want,time,to,make,a,brave,speech,before,departing,for,the,wars
his,drawling,voice,gibed,in,her,ears
he,was,jeering,at,her,and,somehow,she,knew,he,was,jeering,at,himself,too
what,was,he,talking,about
patriotism,shields,brave,speeches
it,wasn't,possible,that,he,meant,what,he,was,saying
it,just,wasn't,believable,that,he,could,talk,so,blithely,of,leaving,her,here,on,this,dark,road,with,a,woman,who,might,be,dying,a,new-born,infant,a,foolish,black,wench,and,a,frightened,child,leaving,her,to,pilot,them,through,miles,of,battle,fields,and,stragglers,and,yankees,and,fire,and,god,knows,what
once,when,she,was,six,years,old,she,had,fallen,from,a,tree,flat,on,her,stomach
she,could,still,recall,that,sickening,interval,before,breath,came,back,into,her,body
now,as,she,looked,at,rhett,she,felt,the,same,way,she,had,felt,then,breathless,stunned,nauseated
rhett,you,are,joking
she,grabbed,his,arm,and,felt,her,tears,of,fright,splash,down,her,wrist
he,raised,her,hand,and,kissed,it,arily
selfish,to,the,end,aren't,you,my,dear
thinking,only,of,your,own,precious,hide,and,not,of,the,gallant,confederacy
think,how,our,troops,will,be,heartened,by,my,eleventh-hour,appearance
there,was,a,malicious,tenderness,in,his,voice
oh,rhett,she,wailed,how,can,you,do,this,to,me
why,are,you,leaving,me
why
he,laughed,jauntily
because,perhaps,of,the,betraying,sentimentality,that,lurks,in,all,of,us,southerners
perhaps,perhaps,because,i,am,ashamed
who,knows
ashamed
you,should,die,of,shame
to,desert,us,here,alone,helpless
dear,scarlett
you,aren't,helpless
anyone,as,selfish,and,determined,as,you,are,is,never,helpless
god,help,the,yankees,if,they,should,get,you
he,stepped,abruptly,down,from,the,wagon,and,as,she,watched,him,stunned,with,bewilderment,he,came,around,to,her,side,of,the,wagon
get,out,he,ordered
she,stared,at,him
he,reached,up,roughly,caught,her,under,the,arms,and,swung,her,to,the,ground,beside,him
with,a,tight,grip,on,her,he,dragged,her,several,paces,away,from,the,wagon
she,felt,the,dust,and,gravel,in,her,slippers,hurting,her,feet
the,still,hot,darkness,wrapped,her,like,a,dream
i'm,not,asking,you,to,understand,or,forgive
i,don't,give,a,damn,whether,you,do,either,for,i,shall,never,understand,or,forgive,myself,for,this,idiocy
i,am,annoyed,at,myself,to,find,that,so,much,quixoticism,still,lingers,in,me
but,our,fair,southland,needs,every,man
didn't,our,brave,governor,brown,say,just,that
not,matter
i'm,off,to,the,wars
he,laughed,suddenly,a,ringing,free,laugh,that,startled,the,echoes,in,the,dark,woods
'i,could,not,love,thee,dear,so,much,loved,i,not,honour,more,'
that's,a,pat,speech,isn't,it
certainly,better,than,anything,i,can,think,up,myself,at,the,present,moment
for,i,do,love,you,scarlett,in,spite,of,what,i,said,that,night,on,the,porch,last,month
his,drawl,was,caressing,and,his,hands,slid,up,her,bare,arms,warm,strong,hands
i,love,you,scarlett,because,we,are,so,much,alike,renegades,both,of,us,dear,and,selfish,rascals
neither,of,us,cares,a,rap,if,the,whole,world,goes,to,pot,so,long,as,we,are,safe,and,comfortable
his,voice,went,on,in,the,darkness,and,she,heard,words,but,they,made,no,sense,to,her
her,mind,was,tiredly,trying,to,take,in,the,harsh,truth,that,he,was,leaving,her,here,to,face,the,yankees,alone
her,mind,said,he's,leaving,me
he's,leaving,me
but,no,emotion,stirred
then,his,arms,went,around,her,waist,and,shoulders,and,she,felt,the,hard,muscles,of,his,thighs,against,her,body,and,the,buttons,of,his,coat,pressing,into,her,breast
a,warm,tide,of,feeling,bewildering,frightening,swept,over,her,carrying,out,of,her,mind,the,time,and,place,and,circumstances
she,felt,as,limp,as,a,rag,doll,warm,weak,and,helpless,and,his,supporting,arms,were,so,pleasant
you,don't,want,to,change,your,mind,about,what,i,said,last,month
there's,nothing,like,danger,and,death,to,give,an,added,fillip
be,patriotic,scarlett
think,how,you,would,be,sending,a,soldier,to,his,death,with,beautiful,memories
he,was,kissing,her,now,and,his,mustache,tickled,her,mouth,kissing,her,with,slow,hot,lips,that,were,so,leisurely,as,though,he,had,the,whole,night,before,him
charles,had,never,kissed,her,like,this
never,had,the,kisses,of,the,tarleton,and,calvert,boys,made,her,go,hot,and,cold,and,shaky,like,this
he,bent,her,body,backward,and,his,lips,traveled,down,her,throat,to,where,the,cameo,fastened,her,basque
sweet,he,whispered
sweet
she,saw,the,wagon,dimly,in,the,dark,and,heard,the,treble,piping,of,wade's,voice
muvver
wade,fwightened
into,her,swaying,darkened,mind,cold,sanity,came,back,with,a,rush,and,she,remembered,what,she,had,forgotten,for,the,moment,that,she,was,frightened,too,and,rhett,was,leaving,her,leaving,her,the,damned,cad
and,on,top,of,it,all,he,had,the,consummate,gall,to,stand,here,in,the,road,and,insult,her,with,his,infamous,proposals
rage,and,hate,flowed,into,her,and,stiffened,her,spine,and,with,one,wrench,she,tore,herself,loose,from,his,arms
oh,you,cad
she,cried,and,her,mind,leaped,about,trying,to,think,of,worse,things,to,call,him,things,she,had,heard,gerald,call,mr,lincoln,the,macintoshes,and,balky,mules,but,the,words,would,not,come
you,low-down,cowardly,nasty,stinking,thing
and,because,she,could,not,think,of,anything,crushing,enough,she,drew,back,her,arm,and,slapped,him,across,the,mouth,with,all,the,force,she,had,left
he,took,a,step,backward,his,hand,going,to,his,face
ah,he,said,quietly,and,for,a,moment,they,stood,facing,each,other,in,the,darkness
scarlett,could,hear,his,heavy,breathing,and,her,own,breath,came,in,gasps,as,if,she,had,been,running,hard
they,were,right
everybody,was,right
you,aren't,a,gentleman
my,dear,girl,he,said,how,inadequate
she,knew,he,was,laughing,and,the,thought,goaded,her
go,on

she,heard,him,laugh,as,he,turned,away,and,walked,back,toward,the,wagon
she,saw,him,stand,beside,it,heard,him,speak,and,his,voice,was,changed,courteous,and,respectful,as,it,always,was,when,he,spoke,to,melanie

she,knew,he,had,turned,and,was,facing,her,but,she,did,not,speak
hate,choked,all,utterance
his,feet,ground,on,the,pebbles,of,the,road,and,for,a,moment,she,saw,his,big,shoulders,looming,up,in,the,dark
then,he,was,gone
she,could,hear,the,sound,of,his,feet,for,a,while,and,then,they,died,away
she,came,slowly,back,to,the,wagon,her,knees,shaking
why,had,he,gone,stepping,off,into,the,dark,into,the,war,into,a,cause,that,was,lost,into,a,world,that,was,mad

now,he,had,set,his,varnished,boots,upon,a,bitter,road,where,hunger,tramped,with,tireless,stride,and,wounds,and,weariness,and,heartbreak,ran,like,yelping,wolves
and,the,end,of,the,road,was,death
he,need,not,have,gone
he,was,safe,rich,comfortable
but,he,had,gone,leaving,her,alone,in,a,night,as,black,as,blindness,with,the,yankee,army,between,her,and,home
now,she,remembered,all,the,bad,names,she,had,wanted,to,call,him,but,it,was,too,late
she,leaned,her,head,against,the,bowed,neck,of,the,horse,and,cried
chapter,xxiv
the,bright,glare,of,morning,sunlight,streaming,through,the,trees,overhead,awakened,scarlett
for,a,moment,stiffened,by,the,cramped,position,in,which,she,had,slept,she,could,not,remember,where,she,was
the,sun,blinded,her,the,hard,boards,of,the,wagon,under,her,were,harsh,against,her,body,and,a,heavy,weight,lay,across,her,legs
she,tried,to,sit,up,and,discovered,that,the,weight,was,wade,who,lay,sleeping,with,his,head,pillowed,on,her,knees
melanie's,bare,feet,were,almost,in,her,face,and,under,the,wagon,seat,prissy,was,curled,up,like,a,black,cat,with,the,small,baby,wedged,in,between,her,and,wade
then,she,remembered,everything
she,popped,up,to,a,sitting,position,and,looked,hastily,all,around
thank,god,no,yankees,in,sight
their,hiding,place,had,not,been,discovered,in,the,night
it,all,came,back,to,her,now,the,nightmare,journey,after,rhett's,footsteps,died,away,the,endless,night,the,black,road,full,of,ruts,and,boulders,along,which,they,jolted,the,deep,gullies,on,either,side,into,which,the,wagon,slipped,the,fear-crazed,strength,with,which,she,and,prissy,had,pushed,the,wheels,out,of,the,gullies
she,recalled,with,a,shudder,how,often,she,had,driven,the,unwilling,horse,into,fields,and,woods,when,she,heard,soldiers,approaching,not,knowing,if,they,were,friends,or,foes,recalled,too,her,anguish,lest,a,cough,a,sneeze,or,wade's,hiccoughing,might,betray,them,to,the,marching,men
oh,that,dark,road,where,men,went,by,like,ghosts,voices,stilled,only,the,muffled,tramping,of,feet,on,soft,dirt,the,faint,clicking,of,bridles,and,the,straining,creak,of,leather
and,oh,that,dreadful,moment,when,the,sick,horse,balked,and,cavalry,and,light,cannon,rumbled,past,in,the,darkness,past,where,they,sat,breathless,so,close,she,could,almost,reach,out,and,touch,them,so,close,she,could,smell,the,stale,sweat,on,the,soldiers',bodies
when,at,last,they,had,neared,rough,and,ready,a,few,camp,fires,were,gleaming,where,the,last,of,steve,lee's,rear,guard,was,awaiting,orders,to,fall,back
she,had,circled,through,a,plowed,field,for,a,mile,until,the,light,of,the,fires,died,out,behind,her
and,then,she,had,lost,her,way,in,the,darkness,and,sobbed,when,she,could,not,find,the,little,wagon,path,she,knew,so,well
then,finally,having,found,it,the,horse,sank,in,the,traces,and,refused,to,move,refused,to,rise,even,when,she,and,prissy,tugged,at,the,bridle
so,she,had,unharnessed,him,and,crawled,sodden,with,fatigue,into,the,back,of,the,wagon,and,stretched,her,aching,legs
she,had,a,faint,memory,of,melanie's,voice,before,sleep,clamped,down,her,eyelids,a,weak,voice,that,apologized,even,as,it,begged,scarlett,can,i,have,some,water,please
she,had,said,there,isn't,any,and,gone,to,sleep,before,the,words,were,out,of,her,mouth
now,it,was,morning,and,the,world,was,still,and,serene,and,green,and,gold,with,dappled,sunshine
and,no,soldiers,in,sight,anywhere
she,was,hungry,and,dry,with,thirst,aching,and,cramped,and,filled,with,wonder,that,she,scarlett,o'hara,who,could,never,rest,well,except,between,linen,sheets,and,on,the,softest,of,feather,beds,had,slept,like,a,field,hand,on,hard,planks
blinking,in,the,sunlight,her,eyes,fell,on,melanie,and,she,gasped,horrified
melanie,lay,so,still,and,white,scarlett,thought,she,must,be,dead
she,looked,dead
she,looked,like,a,dead,old,woman,with,her,ravaged,face,and,her,dark,hair,snarled,and,tangled,across,it
then,scarlett,saw,with,relief,the,faint,rise,and,fall,of,her,shallow,breathing,and,knew,that,melanie,had,survived,the,night
scarlett,shaded,her,eyes,with,her,hand,and,looked,about,her
they,had,evidently,spent,the,night,under,the,trees,in,someone's,front,yard,for,a,sand,and,gravel,driveway,stretched,out,before,her,winding,away,under,an,avenue,of,cedars
why,it's,the,mallory,place
she,thought,her,heart,leaping,with,gladness,at,the,thought,of,friends,and,help
but,a,stillness,as,of,death,hung,over,the,plantation
the,shrubs,and,grass,of,the,lawn,were,cut,to,pieces,where,hooves,and,wheels,and,feet,had,torn,frantically,back,and,forth,until,the,soil,was,churned,up
she,looked,toward,the,house,and,instead,of,the,old,white,clapboard,place,she,knew,so,well,she,saw,there,only,a,long,rectangle,of,blackened,granite,foundation,stones,and,two,tall,chimneys,rearing,smoke-stained,bricks,into,the,charred,leaves,of,still,trees
she,drew,a,deep,shuddering,breath
would,she,find,tara,like,this,level,with,the,ground,silent,as,the,dead
i,mustn't,think,about,that,now,she,told,herself,hurriedly
i,mustn't,let,myself,think,about,it
i'll,get,scared,again,if,i,think,about,it
but,in,spite,of,herself,her,heart,quickened,and,each,beat,seemed,to,thunder,home
hurry

they,must,be,starting,on,toward,home,again
but,first,they,must,find,some,food,and,water,especially,water

you're,a,long,way,from,there,said,scarlett,trying,to,smooth,back,her,untidy,hair
her,face,was,damp,and,her,body,was,already,wet,with,sweat
she,felt,dirty,and,messy,and,sticky,almost,as,if,she,smelled,bad
her,clothes,were,crushed,and,wrinkled,from,sleeping,in,them,and,she,had,never,felt,more,acutely,tired,and,sore,in,all,her,life
muscles,she,did,not,know,she,possessed,ached,from,her,unaccustomed,exertions,of,the,night,before,and,every,movement,brought,sharp,pain
she,looked,down,at,melanie,and,saw,that,her,dark,eyes,were,opened
they,were,sick,eyes,fever,bright,and,dark,baggy,circles,were,beneath,them
she,opened,cracking,lips,and,whispered,appealingly,water

and,then,she,thought,of,the,horse
name,of,god
suppose,the,horse,had,died,in,the,night
he,had,seemed,ready,to,die,when,she,unharnessed,him
she,ran,around,the,wagon,and,saw,him,lying,on,his,side
if,he,were,dead,she,would,curse,god,and,die,too
somebody,in,the,bible,had,done,just,that,thing
cursed,god,and,died
she,knew,just,how,that,person,felt
but,the,horse,was,alive,breathing,heavily,sick,eyes,half,closed,but,alive
well,some,water,would,help,him,too
prissy,climbed,reluctantly,from,the,wagon,with,many,groans,and,timorously,followed,scarlett,up,the,avenue
behind,the,ruins,the,row,of,whitewashed,slave,quarters,stood,silent,and,deserted,under,the,overhanging,trees
between,the,quarters,and,the,smoked,stone,foundations,they,found,the,well,and,the,roof,of,it,still,stood,with,the,bucket,far,down,the,well
between,them,they,wound,up,the,rope,and,when,the,bucket,of,cool,sparkling,water,appeared,out,of,the,dark,depths,scarlett,tilted,it,to,her,lips,and,drank,with,loud,sucking,noises,spilling,the,water,all,over,herself
she,drank,until,prissy's,petulant,well,ah's,thusty,too,miss,scarlett,made,her,recall,the,needs,of,the,others

hurry,now
i'm,going,to,try,to,find,something,to,eat
scarlett's,search,was,futile,until,in,the,orchard,she,found,a,few,apples
soldiers,had,been,there,before,her,and,there,was,none,on,the,trees
those,she,found,on,the,ground,were,mostly,rotten
she,filled,her,skirt,with,the,best,of,them,and,came,back,across,the,soft,earth,collecting,small,pebbles,in,her,slippers
why,hadn't,she,thought,of,putting,on,stouter,shoes,last,night
why,hadn't,she,brought,her,sun,hat
why,hadn't,she,brought,something,to,eat
she'd,acted,like,a,fool
but,of,course,she'd,thought,rhett,would,take,care,of,them
rhett
she,spat,on,the,ground,for,the,very,name,tasted,bad
how,she,hated,him
how,contemptible,he,had,been
and,she,had,stood,there,in,the,road,and,let,him,kiss,her,and,almost,liked,it
she,had,been,crazy,last,night
how,despicable,he,was
when,she,came,back,she,divided,up,the,apples,and,threw,the,rest,into,the,back,of,the,wagon
the,horse,was,on,his,feet,now,but,the,water,did,not,seem,to,have,refreshed,him,much
he,looked,far,worse,in,the,daylight,than,he,had,the,night,before
his,hip,bones,stood,out,like,an,old,cow's,his,ribs,showed,like,a,washboard,and,his,back,was,a,mass,of,sores
she,shrank,from,touching,him,as,she,harnessed,him
when,she,slipped,the,bit,into,his,mouth,she,saw,that,he,was,practically,toothless
as,old,as,the,hills
while,rhett,was,stealing,a,horse,why,couldn't,he,have,stolen,a,good,one
she,mounted,the,seat,and,brought,down,the,hickory,limb,on,his,back
he,wheezed,and,started,but,he,walked,so,slowly,as,she,turned,him,into,the,road,she,knew,she,could,walk,faster,herself,with,no,effort,whatever
oh,if,only,she,didn't,have,melanie,and,wade,and,the,baby,and,prissy,to,bother,with
how,swiftly,she,could,walk,home
why,she,would,run,home,run,every,step,of,the,way,that,would,bring,her,closer,to,tara,and,to,mother
they,couldn't,be,more,than,fifteen,miles,from,home,but,at,the,rate,this,old,nag,traveled,it,would,take,all,day,for,she,would,have,to,stop,frequently,to,rest,him
all,day
she,looked,down,the,glaring,red,road,cut,in,deep,ruts,where,cannon,wheels,and,ambulances,had,gone,over,it
it,would,be,hours,before,she,knew,if,tara,still,stood,and,if,ellen,were,there
it,would,be,hours,before,she,finished,her,journey,under,the,broiling,september,sun
she,looked,back,at,melanie,who,lay,with,sick,eyes,closed,against,the,sun,and,jerked,loose,the,strings,of,her,bonnet,and,tossed,it,to,prissy
put,that,over,her,face
it'll,keep,the,sun,out,of,her,eyes
then,as,the,heat,beat,down,upon,her,unprotected,head,she,thought,i'll,be,as,freckled,as,a,guinea,egg,before,this,day,is,over
she,had,never,in,her,life,been,out,in,the,sunshine,without,a,hat,or,veils,never,handled,reins,without,gloves,to,protect,the,white,skin,of,her,dimpled,hands
yet,here,she,was,exposed,to,the,sun,in,a,broken-down,wagon,with,a,broken-down,horse,dirty,sweaty,hungry,helpless,to,do,anything,but,plod,along,at,a,snail's,pace,through,a,deserted,land
what,a,few,short,weeks,it,had,been,since,she,was,safe,and,secure
what,a,little,while,since,she,and,everyone,else,had,thought,that,atlanta,could,never,fall,that,georgia,could,never,be,invaded
but,the,small,cloud,which,appeared,in,the,northwest,four,months,ago,had,blown,up,into,a,mighty,storm,and,then,into,a,screaming,tornado,sweeping,away,her,world,whirling,her,out,of,her,sheltered,life,and,dropping,her,down,in,the,midst,of,this,still,haunted,desolation
was,tara,still,standing
or,was,tara,also,gone,with,the,wind,which,had,swept,through,georgia
she,laid,the,whip,on,the,tired,horse's,back,and,tried,to,urge,him,on,while,the,waggling,wheels,rocked,them,drunkenly,from,side,to,side
there,was,death,in,the,air
in,the,rays,of,the,late,afternoon,sun,every,well-remembered,field,and,forest,grove,was,green,and,still,with,an,unearthly,quiet,that,struck,terror,to,scarlett's,heart
every,empty,shell-pitted,house,they,had,passed,that,day,every,gaunt,chimney,standing,sentinel,over,smoke-blackened,ruins,had,frightened,her,more
they,had,not,seen,a,living,human,being,or,animal,since,the,night,before
dead,men,and,dead,horses,yes,and,dead,mules,lying,by,the,road,swollen,covered,with,flies,but,nothing,alive
no,far-off,cattle,lowed,no,birds,sang,no,wind,waved,the,trees
only,the,tired,plop-plop,of,the,horse's,feet,and,the,weak,wailing,of,melanie's,baby,broke,the,stillness
the,countryside,lay,as,under,some,dread,enchantment
or,worse,still,thought,scarlett,with,a,chill,like,the,familiar,and,dear,face,of,a,mother,beautiful,and,quiet,at,last,after,death,agonies
she,felt,that,the,once-familiar,woods,were,full,of,ghosts
thousands,had,died,in,the,fighting,near,jonesboro
they,were,here,in,these,haunted,woods,where,the,slanting,afternoon,sun,gleamed,eerily,through,unmoving,leaves,friends,and,foes,peering,at,her,in,her,rickety,wagon,through,eyes,blinded,with,blood,and,red,dust,glazed,horrible,eyes
mother
mother
she,whispered
if,she,could,only,win,to,ellen
if,only,by,a,miracle,of,god,tara,were,still,standing,and,she,could,drive,up,the,long,avenue,of,trees,and,go,into,the,house,and,see,her,mother's,kind,tender,face,could,feel,once,more,the,soft,capable,hands,that,drove,out,fear,could,clutch,ellen's,skirts,and,bury,her,face,in,them
mother,would,know,what,to,do
she,wouldn't,let,melanie,and,her,baby,die
she,would,drive,away,all,ghosts,and,fears,with,her,quiet,hush,hush
but,mother,was,ill,perhaps,dying
scarlett,laid,the,whip,across,the,weary,rump,of,the,horse
they,must,go,faster
they,had,crept,along,this,never-ending,road,all,the,long,hot,day
soon,it,would,be,night,and,they,would,be,alone,in,this,desolation,that,was,death
she,gripped,the,reins,tighter,with,hands,that,were,blistered,and,slapped,them,fiercely,on,the,horse's,back,her,aching,arms,burning,at,the,movement
if,she,could,only,reach,the,kind,arms,of,tara,and,ellen,and,lay,down,her,burdens,far,too,heavy,for,her,young,shoulders,the,dying,woman,the,fading,baby,her,own,hungry,little,boy,the,frightened,negro,all,looking,to,her,for,strength,for,guidance,all,reading,in,her,straight,back,courage,she,did,not,possess,and,strength,which,had,long,since,failed
the,exhausted,horse,did,not,respond,to,the,whip,or,reins,but,shambled,on,dragging,his,feet,stumbling,on,small,rocks,and,swaying,as,if,ready,to,fall,to,his,knees
but,as,twilight,came,they,at,last,entered,the,final,lap,of,the,long,journey
they,rounded,the,bend,of,the,wagon,path,and,turned,into,the,main,road
tara,was,only,a,mile,away
here,loomed,up,the,dark,bulk,of,the,mock-orange,hedge,that,marked,the,beginning,of,the,macintosh,property
a,little,farther,on,scarlett,drew,rein,in,front,of,the,avenue,of,oaks,that,led,from,the,road,to,old,angus,macintosh's,house
she,peered,through,the,gathering,dusk,down,the,two,lines,of,ancient,trees
all,was,dark
not,a,single,light,showed,in,the,house,or,in,the,quarters
straining,her,eyes,in,the,darkness,she,dimly,discerned,a,sight,which,had,grown,familiar,through,that,terrible,day,two,tall,chimneys,like,gigantic,tombstones,towering,above,the,ruined,second,floor,and,broken,unlit,windows,blotching,the,walls,like,still,blind,eyes
hello

she,flapped,the,reins,and,urged,the,horse,forward
the,sight,of,the,macintosh,house,had,pricked,the,last,bubble,of,hope,remaining,to,her
it,was,burned,in,ruins,deserted,as,were,all,the,plantations,she,had,passed,that,day
tara,lay,only,half,a,mile,away,on,the,same,road,right,in,the,path,of,the,army
tara,was,leveled,too
she,would,find,only,the,blackened,bricks,starlight,shining,through,the,roofless,walls,ellen,and,gerald,gone,the,girls,gone,mammy,gone,the,negroes,gone,god,knows,where,and,this,hideous,stillness,over,everything
why,had,she,come,on,this,fool's,errand,against,all,common,sense,dragging,melanie,and,her,child
better,that,they,had,died,in,atlanta,than,tortured,by,this,day,of,burning,sun,and,jolting,wagon,to,die,in,the,silent,ruins,of,tara

but,she,had,promised,and,now,they,belonged,to,her,even,as,wade,and,prissy,belonged,to,her,and,she,must,struggle,and,fight,for,them,as,long,as,she,had,strength,or,breath
she,could,have,left,them,in,atlanta,dumped,melanie,into,the,hospital,and,deserted,her
but,had,she,done,that,she,could,never,face,ashley,either,on,this,earth,or,in,the,hereafter,and,tell,him,she,had,left,his,wife,and,child,to,die,among,strangers
oh,ashley
where,was,he,tonight,while,she,toiled,down,this,haunted,road,with,his,wife,and,baby

or,was,he,dead,of,smallpox,months,ago,rotting,in,some,long,ditch,with,hundreds,of,other,confederates
scarlett's,taut,nerves,almost,cracked,as,a,sudden,noise,sounded,in,the,underbrush,near,them

she,untied,the,waist,tape,and,slipped,it,down,over,her,feet,crushing,the,soft,linen,folds,between,her,hands
rhett,had,brought,her,that,linen,and,lace,from,nassau,on,the,last,boat,he,slipped,through,the,blockade,and,she,had,worked,a,week,to,make,the,garment
resolutely,she,took,it,by,the,hem,and,jerked,put,it,in,her,mouth,and,gnawed,until,finally,the,material,gave,with,a,rip,and,tore,the,length
she,gnawed,furiously,tore,with,both,hands,and,the,petticoat,lay,in,strips,in,her,hands

you're,a,fool,nigger,and,the,worst,day's,work,pa,ever,did,was,to,buy,you,said,scarlett,slowly,too,tired,for,anger
and,if,i,ever,get,the,use,of,my,arm,again,i'll,wear,this,whip,out,on,you
there,she,thought,i've,said,nigger,and,mother,wouldn't,like,that,at,all
prissy,rolled,her,eyes,wildly,peeping,first,at,the,set,face,of,her,mistress,and,then,at,the,cow,which,bawled,plaintively
scarlett,seemed,the,less,dangerous,of,the,two,so,prissy,clutched,at,the,sides,of,the,wagon,and,remained,where,she,was
stiffly,scarlett,climbed,down,from,the,seat,each,movement,of,agony,of,aching,muscles
prissy,was,not,the,only,one,who,was,sceered,of,cows
scarlett,had,always,feared,them,even,the,mildest,cow,seemed,sinister,to,her,but,this,was,no,time,to,truckle,to,small,fears,when,great,ones,crowded,so,thick,upon,her
fortunately,the,cow,was,gentle
in,its,pain,it,had,sought,human,companionship,and,help,and,it,made,no,threatening,gesture,as,she,looped,one,end,of,the,torn,petticoat,about,its,horns
she,tied,the,other,end,to,the,back,of,the,wagon,as,securely,as,her,awkward,fingers,would,permit
then,as,she,started,back,toward,the,driver's,seat,a,vast,weariness,assailed,her,and,she,swayed,dizzily
she,clutched,the,side,of,the,wagon,to,keep,from,falling
melanie,opened,her,eyes,and,seeing,scarlett,standing,beside,her,whispered,dear,are,we,home
home
hot,tears,came,to,scarlett's,eyes,at,the,word
home
melanie,did,not,know,there,was,no,home,and,that,they,were,alone,in,a,mad,and,desolate,world
not,yet,she,said,as,gently,as,the,constriction,of,her,throat,would,permit,but,we,will,be,soon
i've,just,found,a,cow,and,soon,we'll,have,some,milk,for,you,and,the,baby
poor,baby,whispered,melanie,her,hand,creeping,feebly,toward,the,child,and,falling,short
climbing,back,into,the,wagon,required,all,the,strength,scarlett,could,muster,but,at,last,it,was,done,and,she,picked,up,the,lines
the,horse,stood,with,head,drooping,dejectedly,and,refused,to,start
scarlett,laid,on,the,whip,mercilessly
she,hoped,god,would,forgive,her,for,hurting,a,tired,animal
if,he,didn't,she,was,sorry
after,all,tara,lay,just,ahead,and,after,the,next,quarter,of,a,mile,the,horse,could,drop,in,the,shafts,if,he,liked
finally,he,started,slowly,the,wagon,creaking,and,the,cow,lowing,mournfully,at,every,step
the,pained,animal's,voice,rasped,on,scarlett's,nerves,until,she,was,tempted,to,stop,and,untie,the,beast
what,good,would,the,cow,do,them,anyway,if,there,should,be,no,one,at,tara
she,couldn't,milk,her,and,even,if,she,could,the,animal,would,probably,kick,anyone,who,touched,her,sore,udder
but,she,had,the,cow,and,she,might,as,well,keep,her
there,was,little,else,she,had,in,this,world,now
scarlett's,eyes,grew,misty,when,at,last,they,reached,the,bottom,of,a,gentle,incline,for,just,over,the,rise,lay,tara
then,her,heart,sank
the,decrepit,animal,would,never,pull,the,hill
the,slope,had,always,seemed,so,slight,so,gradual,in,days,when,she,galloped,up,it,on,her,fleet-footed,mare
it,did,not,seem,possible,it,could,have,grown,so,steep,since,she,saw,it,last
the,horse,would,never,make,it,with,the,heavy,load
wearily,she,dismounted,and,took,the,animal,by,the,bridle

prissy,moaned,peering,at,the,dark,trees,that,closed,about,them,on,both,sides,of,the,road,trees,which,might,reach,out,and,clutch,her,if,she,left,the,shelter,of,the,wagon
but,she,laid,the,baby,beside,melanie,scrambled,to,the,ground,and,reaching,up,lifted,wade,out
the,little,boy,sobbed,shrinking,close,to,his,nurse

why,had,god,invented,children,she,thought,savagely,as,she,turned,her,ankle,cruelly,on,the,dark,road,useless,crying,nuisances,they,were,always,demanding,care,always,in,the,way
in,her,exhaustion,there,was,no,room,for,compassion,for,the,frightened,child,trotting,by,prissy's,side,dragging,at,her,hand,and,sniffling,only,a,weariness,that,she,had,borne,him,only,a,tired,wonder,that,she,had,ever,married,charles,hamilton

then,give,me,wade's,hand
you,can,sit,right,down,here,and,stay
no'm
no'm
then,hush
how,slowly,the,horse,moved
the,moisture,from,his,slobbering,mouth,dripped,down,upon,her,hand
through,her,mind,ran,a,few,words,of,the,song,she,had,once,sung,with,rhett,she,could,not,recall,the,rest
just,a,few,more,days,for,to,tote,the,weary,load
just,a,few,more,steps,hummed,her,brain,over,and,over,just,a,few,more,steps,for,to,tote,the,weary,load
then,they,topped,the,rise,and,before,them,lay,the,oaks,of,tara,a,towering,dark,mass,against,the,darkening,sky
scarlett,looked,hastily,to,see,if,there,was,a,light,anywhere
there,was,none
they,are,gone
said,her,heart,like,cold,lead,in,her,breast
gone
she,turned,the,horse's,head,into,the,driveway,and,the,cedars,meeting,over,their,heads,cast,them,into,midnight,blackness
peering,up,the,long,tunnel,of,darkness,straining,her,eyes,she,saw,ahead,or,did,she,see
were,her,tired,eyes,playing,her,tricks,the,white,bricks,of,tara,blurred,and,indistinct
home
home
the,dear,white,walls,the,windows,with,the,fluttering,curtains,the,wide,verandas,were,they,all,there,ahead,of,her,in,the,gloom
or,did,the,darkness,mercifully,conceal,such,a,horror,as,the,macintosh,house
the,avenue,seemed,miles,long,and,the,horse,pulling,stubbornly,at,her,hand,plopped,slower,and,slower
eagerly,her,eyes,searched,the,darkness
the,roof,seemed,to,be,intact
could,it,be,could,it,be
no,it,wasn't,possible
war,stopped,for,nothing,not,even,tara,built,to,last,five,hundred,years
it,could,not,have,passed,over,tara
then,the,shadowy,outline,did,take,form
she,pulled,the,horse,forward,faster
the,white,walls,did,show,there,through,the,darkness
and,untarnished,by,smoke
tara,had,escaped
home
she,dropped,the,bridle,and,ran,the,last,few,steps,leaped,forward,with,an,urge,to,clutch,the,walls,themselves,in,her,arms
then,she,saw,a,form,shadowy,in,the,dimness,emerging,from,the,blackness,of,the,front,veranda,and,standing,at,the,top,of,the,steps
tara,was,not,deserted
someone,was,home
a,cry,of,joy,rose,to,her,throat,and,died,there
the,house,was,so,dark,and,still,and,the,figure,did,not,move,or,call,to,her
what,was,wrong
what,was,wrong
tara,stood,intact,yet,shrouded,with,the,same,eerie,quiet,that,hung,over,the,whole,stricken,countryside
then,the,figure,moved
stiffly,and,slowly,it,came,down,the,steps
pa
she,whispered,huskily,doubting,almost,that,it,was,he
it's,me,katie,scarlett
i've,come,home
gerald,moved,toward,her,silent,as,a,sleepwalker,his,stiff,leg,dragging
he,came,close,to,her,looking,at,her,in,a,dazed,way,as,if,he,believed,she,was,part,of,a,dream
putting,out,his,hand,he,laid,it,on,her,shoulder
scarlett,felt,it,tremble,tremble,as,if,he,had,been,awakened,from,a,nightmare,into,a,half-sense,of,reality
daughter,he,said,with,an,effort
daughter
then,he,was,silent
why,he's,an,old,man
thought,scarlett
gerald's,shoulders,sagged
in,the,face,which,she,could,only,see,dimly,there,was,none,of,the,virility,the,restless,vitality,of,gerald,and,the,eyes,that,looked,into,hers,had,almost,the,same,fear-stunned,look,that,lay,in,little,wade's,eyes
he,was,only,a,little,old,man,and,broken
and,now,fear,of,unknown,things,seized,her,leaped,swiftly,out,of,the,darkness,at,her,and,she,could,only,stand,and,stare,at,him,all,the,flood,of,questioning,dammed,up,at,her,lips
from,the,wagon,the,faint,wailing,sounded,again,and,gerald,seemed,to,rouse,himself,with,an,effort
it's,melanie,and,her,baby,whispered,scarlett,rapidly
she's,very,ill,i,brought,her,home
gerald,dropped,his,hand,from,her,arm,and,straightened,his,shoulders
as,he,moved,slowly,to,the,side,of,the,wagon,there,was,a,ghostly,semblance,of,the,old,host,of,tara,welcoming,guests,as,if,gerald,spoke,words,from,out,of,shadowy,memory
cousin,melanie
melanie's,voice,murmured,indistinctly
cousin,melanie,this,is,your,home
twelve,oaks,is,burned
you,must,stay,with,us
thoughts,of,melanie's,prolonged,suffering,spurred,scarlett,to,action
the,present,was,with,her,again,the,necessity,of,laying,melanie,and,her,child,on,a,soft,bed,and,doing,those,small,things,for,her,that,could,be,done
she,must,be,carried
she,can't,walk
there,was,a,scuffle,of,feet,and,a,dark,figure,emerged,from,the,cave,of,the,front,hall
pork,ran,down,the,steps
miss,scarlett
miss,scarlett
he,cried
scarlett,caught,him,by,the,arms
pork,part,and,parcel,of,tara,as,dear,as,the,bricks,and,the,cool,corridors
she,felt,his,tears,stream,down,on,her,hands,as,he,patted,her,clumsily,crying,sho,is,glad,you,back
sho,is
prissy,burst,into,tears,and,incoherent,mumblings,poke
poke,honey
and,little,wade,encouraged,by,the,weakness,of,his,elders,began,sniffling,wade,thirsty
scarlett,caught,them,all,in,hand
miss,melanie,is,in,the,wagon,and,her,baby,too
pork,you,must,carry,her,upstairs,very,carefully,and,put,her,in,the,back,company,room

is,mammy,here,pork
tell,her,i,want,her
galvanized,by,the,authority,in,her,voice,pork,approached,the,wagon,and,fumbled,at,the,backboard
a,moan,was,wrenched,from,melanie,as,he,half-lifted,half-dragged,her,from,the,feather,tick,on,which,she,had,lain,so,many,hours
and,then,she,was,in,pork's,strong,arms,her,head,drooping,like,a,child's,across,his,shoulder
prissy,holding,the,baby,and,dragging,wade,by,the,hand,followed,them,up,the,wide,steps,and,disappeared,into,the,blackness,of,the,hall
scarlett's,bleeding,fingers,sought,her,father's,hand,urgently
did,they,get,well,pa
the,girls,are,recovering
silence,fell,and,in,the,silence,an,idea,too,monstrous,for,words,took,form
she,could,not,could,not,force,it,to,her,lips
she,swallowed,and,swallowed,but,a,sudden,dryness,seemed,to,have,stuck,the,sides,of,her,throat,together
was,this,the,answer,to,the,frightening,riddle,of,tara's,silence
as,if,answering,the,question,in,her,mind,gerald,spoke
your,mother,he,said,and,stopped
and,mother
your,mother,died,yesterday
her,father's,arm,held,tightly,in,her,own,scarlett,felt,her,way,down,the,wide,dark,hall,which,even,in,its,blackness,was,as,familiar,as,her,own,mind
she,avoided,the,high-backed,chairs,the,empty,gun,rack,the,old,sideboard,with,its,protruding,claw,feet,and,she,felt,herself,drawn,by,instinct,to,the,tiny,office,at,the,back,of,the,house,where,ellen,always,sat,keeping,her,endless,accounts
surely,when,she,entered,that,room,mother,would,again,be,sitting,there,before,the,secretary,and,would,look,up,quill,poised,and,rise,with,sweet,fragrance,and,rustling,hoops,to,meet,her,tired,daughter
ellen,could,not,be,dead,not,even,though,pa,had,said,it,said,it,over,and,over,like,a,parrot,that,knows,only,one,phrase,she,died,yesterday,she,died,yesterday,she,died,yesterday
queer,that,she,should,feel,nothing,now,nothing,except,a,weariness,that,shackled,her,limbs,with,heavy,iron,chains,and,a,hunger,that,made,her,knees,tremble
she,would,think,of,mother,later
she,must,put,her,mother,out,of,her,mind,now,else,she,would,stumble,stupidly,like,gerald,or,sob,monotonously,like,wade
pork,came,down,the,wide,dark,steps,toward,them,hurrying,to,press,close,to,scarlett,like,a,cold,animal,toward,a,fire

pork,pattered,into,the,dining,room,and,scarlett,groped,her,way,into,the,inky,small,room,and,sank,down,on,the,sofa
her,father's,arm,still,lay,in,the,crook,of,hers,helpless,appealing,trusting,as,only,the,hands,of,the,very,young,and,the,very,old,can,be
he's,an,old,man,an,old,tired,man,she,thought,again,and,vaguely,wondered,why,she,could,not,care
light,wavered,into,the,room,as,pork,entered,carrying,high,a,half-,burned,candle,stuck,in,a,saucer
the,dark,cave,came,to,life,the,sagging,old,sofa,on,which,they,sat,the,tall,secretary,reaching,toward,the,ceiling,with,mother's,fragile,carved,chair,before,it,the,racks,of,pigeonholes,still,stuffed,with,papers,written,in,her,fine,hand,the,worn,carpet,all,all,were,the,same,except,that,ellen,was,not,there,ellen,with,the,faint,scent,of,lemon,verbena,sachet,and,the,sweet,look,in,her,up-tilted,eyes
scarlett,felt,a,small,pain,in,her,heart,as,of,nerves,numbed,by,a,deep,wound,struggling,to,make,themselves,felt,again
she,must,not,let,them,come,to,life,now,there,was,all,the,rest,of,her,life,ahead,of,her,in,which,they,could,ache
but,not,now

she,looked,into,gerald's,putty-colored,face,and,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,saw,him,unshaven,his,once,florid,face,covered,with,silvery,bristles
pork,placed,the,candle,on,the,candle,stand,and,came,to,her,side
scarlett,felt,that,if,he,had,been,a,dog,he,would,have,laid,his,muzzle,in,her,lap,and,whined,for,a,kind,hand,upon,his,head

gerald,stared,at,her,for,a,moment,as,if,not,hearing,her,and,she,repeated,her,question
why,he,fumbled,they,used,the,house,as,a,headquarters
yankees,in,this,house
a,feeling,that,the,beloved,walls,had,been,defiled,rose,in,her
this,house,sacred,because,ellen,had,lived,in,it,and,those,those,in,it
so,they,were,daughter
we,saw,the,smoke,from,twelve,oaks,across,the,river,before,they,came
but,miss,honey,and,miss,india,and,some,of,their,darkies,had,refugeed,to,macon,so,we,did,not,worry,about,them
but,we,couldn't,be,going,to,macon
the,girls,were,so,sick,your,mother,we,couldn't,be,going
our,darkies,ran,i'm,not,knowing,where
they,stole,the,wagons,and,the,mules
mammy,and,dilcey,and,pork,they,didn't,run
the,girls,your,mother,we,couldn't,be,moving,them
yes,yes
he,mustn't,talk,about,mother
anything,else
even,that,general,sherman,himself,had,used,this,room,mother's,office,for,his,headquarters
anything,else
the,yankees,were,moving,on,jonesboro,to,cut,the,railroad
and,they,came,up,the,road,from,the,river,thousands,and,thousands,and,cannon,and,horses,thousands
i,met,them,on,the,front,porch
oh,gallant,little,gerald
thought,scarlett,her,heart,swelling,gerald,meeting,the,enemy,on,the,stairs,of,tara,as,if,an,army,stood,behind,him,instead,of,in,front,of,him
they,said,for,me,to,leave,that,they,would,be,burning,the,place
and,i,said,that,they,would,be,burning,it,over,my,head
we,could,not,leave,the,girls,your,mother,were
and,then
must,he,revert,to,ellen,always
i,told,them,there,was,sickness,in,the,house,the,typhoid,and,it,was,death,to,move,them
they,could,burn,the,roof,over,us
i,did,not,want,to,leave,anyway,leave,tara
his,voice,trailed,off,into,silence,as,he,looked,absently,about,the,walls,and,scarlett,understood
there,were,too,many,irish,ancestors,crowding,behind,gerald's,shoulders,men,who,had,died,on,scant,acres,fighting,to,the,end,rather,than,leave,the,homes,where,they,had,lived,plowed,loved,begotten,sons
i,said,that,they,would,be,burning,the,house,over,the,heads,of,three,dying,women
but,we,would,not,leave
the,young,officer,was,was,a,gentleman
a,yankee,a,gentleman
why,pa
a,gentleman
he,galloped,away,and,soon,he,was,back,with,a,captain,a,surgeon,and,he,looked,at,the,girls,and,your,mother
you,let,a,damned,yankee,into,their,room
he,had,opium
we,had,none
he,saved,your,sisters
suellen,was,hemorrhaging
he,was,as,kind,as,he,knew,how
and,when,he,reported,that,they,were,ill,they,did,not,burn,the,house
they,moved,in,some,general,his,staff,crowding,in
they,filled,all,the,rooms,except,the,sick,room
and,the,soldiers
he,paused,again,as,if,too,tired,to,go,on
his,stubbly,chin,sank,heavily,in,loose,folds,of,flesh,on,his,chest
with,an,effort,he,spoke,again
they,camped,all,round,the,house,everywhere,in,the,cotton,in,the,corn
the,pasture,was,blue,with,them
that,night,there,were,a,thousand,campfires
they,tore,down,the,fences,and,burned,them,to,cook,with,and,the,barns,and,the,stables,and,the,smokehouse
they,killed,the,cows,and,the,hogs,and,the,chickens,even,my,turkeys
gerald's,precious,turkeys
so,they,were,gone
they,took,things,even,the,pictures,some,of,the,furniture,the,china
the,silver
pork,and,mammy,did,something,with,the,silver,put,it,in,the,well,but,i'm,not,remembering,now,gerald's,voice,was,fretful
then,they,fought,the,battle,from,here,from,tara,there,was,so,much,noise,people,galloping,up,and,stamping,about
and,later,the,cannon,at,jonesboro,it,sounded,like,thunder,even,the,girls,could,hear,it,sick,as,they,were,and,they,kept,saying,over,and,over,'papa,make,it,stop,thundering,'
and,and,mother
did,she,know,yankees,were,in,the,house
she,never,knew,anything
thank,god,said,scarlett
mother,was,spared,that
mother,never,knew,never,heard,the,enemy,in,the,rooms,below,never,heard,the,guns,at,jonesboro,never,learned,that,the,land,which,was,part,of,her,heart,was,under,yankee,feet
i,saw,few,of,them,for,i,stayed,upstairs,with,the,girls,and,your,mother
i,saw,the,young,surgeon,mostly
he,was,kind,so,kind,scarlett
after,he'd,worked,all,day,with,the,wounded,he,came,and,sat,with,them
he,even,left,some,medicine
he,told,me,when,they,moved,on,that,the,girls,would,recover,but,your,mother,she,was,so,frail,he,said,too,frail,to,stand,it,all
he,said,she,had,undermined,her,strength
in,the,silence,that,fell,scarlett,saw,her,mother,as,she,must,have,been,in,those,last,days,a,thin,power,of,strength,in,tara,nursing,working,doing,without,sleep,and,food,that,the,others,might,rest,and,eat
and,then,they,moved,on
then,they,moved,on
he,was,silent,for,a,long,time,and,then,fumbled,at,her,hand
it's,glad,i,am,you,are,home,he,said,simply
there,was,a,scraping,noise,on,the,back,porch
poor,pork,trained,for,forty,years,to,clean,his,shoes,before,entering,the,house,did,not,forget,even,in,a,time,like,this
he,came,in,carefully,carrying,two,gourds,and,the,strong,smell,of,dripping,spirits,entered,before,him
ah,spilt,a,plen'y,miss,scarlett
it's,pow'ful,hard,ter,po',outer,a,bung,hole,inter,a,go'de
that's,quite,all,right,pork,and,thank,you
she,took,the,wet,gourd,dipper,from,him,her,nostrils,wrinkling,in,distaste,at,the,reek
drink,this,father,she,said,pushing,the,whisky,in,its,strange,receptacle,into,his,hand,and,taking,the,second,gourd,of,water,from,pork
gerald,raised,it,obedient,as,a,child,and,gulped,noisily
she,handed,the,water,to,him,but,he,shook,his,head
as,she,took,the,whisky,from,him,and,held,it,to,her,mouth,she,saw,his,eyes,follow,her,a,vague,stirring,of,disapproval,in,them
i,know,no,lady,drinks,spirits,she,said,briefly
but,today,i'm,no,lady,pa,and,there,is,work,to,do,tonight
she,tilted,the,dipper,drew,a,deep,breath,and,drank,swiftly
the,hot,liquid,burned,down,her,throat,to,her,stomach,choking,her,and,bringing,tears,to,her,eyes
she,drew,another,breath,and,raised,it,again
katie,scarlett,said,gerald,the,first,note,of,authority,she,had,heard,in,his,voice,since,her,return,that,is,enough
you're,not,knowing,spirits,and,they,will,be,making,you,tipsy
tipsy
she,laughed,an,ugly,laugh
tipsy
i,hope,it,makes,me,drunk
i,would,like,to,be,drunk,and,forget,all,of,this
she,drank,again,a,slow,train,of,warmth,lighting,in,her,veins,and,stealing,through,her,body,until,even,her,finger,tips,tingled
what,a,blessed,feeling,this,kindly,fire
it,seemed,to,penetrate,even,her,ice-locked,heart,and,strength,came,coursing,back,into,her,body
seeing,gerald's,puzzled,hurt,face,she,patted,his,knee,again,and,managed,an,imitation,of,the,pert,smile,he,used,to,love
how,could,it,make,me,tipsy,pa
i'm,your,daughter
haven't,i,inherited,the,steadiest,head,in,clayton,county
he,almost,smiled,into,her,tired,face
the,whisky,was,bracing,him,too
she,handed,it,back,to,him
now,you're,going,to,take,another,drink,and,then,i,am,going,to,take,you,upstairs,and,put,you,to,bed
she,caught,herself
why,this,was,the,way,she,talked,to,wade,she,should,not,address,her,father,like,this
it,was,disrespectful
but,he,hung,on,her,words
yes,put,you,to,bed,she,added,lightly,and,give,you,another,drink,maybe,all,the,dipper,and,make,you,go,to,sleep
you,need,sleep,and,katie,scarlett,is,here,so,you,need,not,worry,about,anything
drink
he,drank,again,obediently,and,slipping,her,arm,through,his,she,pulled,him,to,his,feet
pork
pork,took,the,gourd,in,one,hand,and,gerald's,arm,in,the,other
scarlett,picked,up,the,flaring,candle,and,the,three,walked,slowly,into,the,dark,hall,and,up,the,winding,steps,toward,gerald's,room
the,room,where,suellen,and,carreen,lay,mumbling,and,tossing,on,the,same,bed,stank,vilely,with,the,smell,of,the,twisted,rag,burning,in,a,saucer,of,bacon,fat,which,provided,the,only,light
when,scarlett,first,opened,the,door,the,thick,atmosphere,of,the,room,with,all,windows,closed,and,the,air,reeking,with,sick-room,odors,medicine,smells,and,stinking,grease,almost,made,her,faint
doctors,might,say,that,fresh,air,was,fatal,in,a,sick,room,but,if,she,were,to,sit,here,she,must,have,air,or,die
she,opened,the,three,windows,bringing,in,the,smell,of,oak,leaves,and,earth,but,the,fresh,air,could,do,little,toward,dispelling,the,sickening,odors,which,had,accumulated,for,weeks,in,this,close,room
carreen,and,suellen,emaciated,and,white,slept,brokenly,and,awoke,to,mumble,with,wide,staring,eyes,in,the,tall,four-poster,bed,where,they,had,whispered,together,in,better,happier,days
in,the,corner,of,the,room,was,an,empty,bed,a,narrow,french,empire,bed,with,curling,head,and,foot,a,bed,which,ellen,had,brought,from,savannah
this,was,where,ellen,had,lain
scarlett,sat,beside,the,two,girls,staring,at,them,stupidly
the,whisky,taken,on,a,stomach,long,empty,was,playing,tricks,on,her
sometimes,her,sisters,seemed,far,away,and,tiny,and,their,incoherent,voices,came,to,her,like,the,buzz,of,insects
and,again,they,loomed,large,rushing,at,her,with,lightning,speed
she,was,tired,tired,to,the,bone
she,could,lie,down,and,sleep,for,days
if,she,could,only,lie,down,and,sleep,and,wake,to,feel,ellen,gently,shaking,her,arm,and,saying,it,is,late,scarlett
you,must,not,be,so,lazy
but,she,could,not,ever,do,that,again
if,there,were,only,ellen,someone,older,than,she,wiser,and,unweary,to,whom,she,could,go
someone,in,whose,lap,she,could,lay,her,head,someone,on,whose,shoulders,she,could,rest,her,burdens
the,door,opened,softly,and,dilcey,entered,melanie's,baby,held,to,her,breast,the,gourd,of,whisky,in,her,hand
in,the,smoky,uncertain,light,she,seemed,thinner,than,when,scarlett,last,saw,her,and,the,indian,blood,was,more,evident,in,her,face
the,high,cheek,bones,were,more,prominent,the,hawk-bridged,nose,was,sharper,and,her,copper,skin,gleamed,with,a,brighter,hue
her,faded,calico,dress,was,open,to,the,waist,and,her,large,bronze,breast,exposed
held,close,against,her,melanie's,baby,pressed,his,pale,rosebud,mouth,greedily,to,the,dark,nipple,sucking,gripping,tiny,fists,against,the,soft,flesh,like,a,kitten,in,the,warm,fur,of,its,mother's,belly
scarlett,rose,unsteadily,and,put,a,hand,on,dilcey's,arm
it,was,good,of,you,to,stay,dilcey
how,could,i,go,off,wid,them,trashy,niggers,miss,scarlett,after,yo',pa,been,so,good,to,buy,me,and,my,little,prissy,and,yo',ma,been,so,kine

but,i,hesh,her,and,give,her,some,of,whut,was,lef',in,that,go'de,and,she,sleepin'
so,the,corn,whisky,had,been,used,by,the,whole,family
scarlett,thought,hysterically,that,perhaps,she,had,better,give,a,drink,to,little,wade,and,see,if,it,would,stop,his,hiccoughs,and,melanie,would,not,die
and,when,ashley,came,home,if,he,did,come,home
no,she,would,think,of,that,later,too
so,much,to,think,of,later
so,many,things,to,unravel,to,decide
if,only,she,could,put,off,the,hour,of,reckoning,forever
she,started,suddenly,as,a,creaking,noise,and,a,rhythmic,ker-bunk,ker-bunk,broke,the,stillness,of,the,air,outside
that's,mammy,gettin',the,water,to,sponge,off,the,young,misses
they,takes,a,heap,of,bathin',explained,dilcey,propping,the,gourd,on,the,table,between,medicine,bottles,and,a,glass
scarlett,laughed,suddenly
her,nerves,must,be,shredded,if,the,noise,of,the,well,windlass,bound,up,in,her,earliest,memories,could,frighten,her
dilcey,looked,at,her,steadily,as,she,laughed,her,face,immobile,in,its,dignity,but,scarlett,felt,that,dilcey,understood
she,sank,back,in,her,chair
if,she,could,only,be,rid,of,her,tight,stays,the,collar,that,choked,her,and,the,slippers,still,full,of,sand,and,gravel,that,blistered,her,feet
the,windlass,creaked,slowly,as,the,rope,wound,up,each,creak,bringing,the,bucket,nearer,the,top
soon,mammy,would,be,with,her,ellen's,mammy,her,mammy
she,sat,silent,intent,on,nothing,while,the,baby,already,glutted,with,milk,whimpered,because,he,had,lost,the,friendly,nipple
dilcey,silent,too,guided,the,child's,mouth,back,quieting,him,in,her,arms,as,scarlett,listened,to,the,slow,scuffing,of,mammy's,feet,across,the,back,yard
how,still,the,night,air,was
the,slightest,sounds,roared,in,her,ears
the,upstairs,hall,seemed,to,shake,as,mammy's,ponderous,weight,came,toward,the,door
then,mammy,was,in,the,room,mammy,with,shoulders,dragged,down,by,two,heavy,wooden,buckets,her,kind,black,face,sad,with,the,uncomprehending,sadness,of,a,monkey's,face
her,eyes,lighted,up,at,the,sight,of,scarlett,her,white,teeth,gleamed,as,she,set,down,the,buckets,and,scarlett,ran,to,her,laying,her,head,on,the,broad,sagging,breasts,which,had,held,so,many,heads,black,and,white
here,was,something,of,stability,thought,scarlett,something,of,the,old,life,that,was,unchanging
but,mammy's,first,words,dispelled,this,illusion
mammy's,chile,is,home

those,were,the,words,which,had,hummed,in,her,brain,that,afternoon,so,monotonously,they,had,sickened,her

in,another,moment,she,would,be,saying,that,young,misses,with,blistered,hands,and,freckles,most,generally,didn't,never,catch,husbands,and,scarlett,forestalled,the,remark
mammy,i,want,you,to,tell,me,about,mother
i,couldn't,bear,to,hear,pa,talk,about,her
tears,started,from,mammy's,eyes,as,she,leaned,down,to,pick,up,the,buckets
in,silence,she,carried,them,to,the,bedside,and,turning,down,the,sheet,began,pulling,up,the,night,clothes,of,suellen,and,carreen
scarlett,peering,at,her,sisters,in,the,dim,flaring,light,saw,that,carreen,wore,a,nightgown,clean,but,in,tatters,and,suellen,lay,wrapped,in,an,old,negligee,a,brown,linen,garment,heavy,with,tagging,ends,of,irish,lace

her,father,was,old,and,stunned,her,sisters,ill,melanie,frail,and,weak,the,children,helpless,and,the,negroes,looking,up,to,her,with,childlike,faith,clinging,to,her,skirts,knowing,that,ellen's,daughter,would,be,the,refuge,ellen,had,always,been
through,the,window,in,the,faint,light,of,the,rising,moon,tara,stretched,before,her,negroes,gone,acres,desolate,barns,ruined,like,a,body,bleeding,under,her,eyes,like,her,own,body,slowly,bleeding
this,was,the,end,of,the,road,quivering,old,age,sickness,hungry,mouths,helpless,hands,plucking,at,her,skirts
and,at,the,end,of,this,road,there,was,nothing,nothing,but,scarlett,o'hara,hamilton,nineteen,years,old,a,widow,with,a,little,child
what,would,she,do,with,all,of,this
aunt,pitty,and,the,burrs,in,macon,could,take,melanie,and,her,baby
if,the,girls,recovered,ellen's,family,would,have,to,take,them,whether,they,liked,it,or,not
and,she,and,gerald,could,turn,to,uncle,james,and,andrew
she,looked,at,the,thin,forms,tossing,before,her,the,sheets,about,them,moist,and,dark,from,dripping,water
she,did,not,like,suellen
she,saw,it,now,with,a,sudden,clarity
she,had,never,liked,her
she,did,not,especially,love,carreen,she,could,not,love,anyone,who,was,weak
but,they,were,of,her,blood,part,of,tara
no,she,could,not,let,them,live,out,their,lives,in,their,aunts',homes,as,poor,relations
an,o'hara,a,poor,relation,living,on,charity,bread,and,sufferance
oh,never,that
was,there,no,escape,from,this,dead,end
her,tired,brain,moved,so,slowly
she,raised,her,hands,to,her,head,as,wearily,as,if,the,air,were,water,against,which,her,arms,struggled
she,took,the,gourd,from,between,the,glass,and,bottle,and,looked,in,it
there,was,some,whisky,left,in,the,bottom,how,much,she,could,not,tell,in,the,uncertain,light
strange,that,the,sharp,smell,did,not,offend,her,nostrils,now
she,drank,slowly,but,this,time,the,liquid,did,not,burn,only,a,dull,warmth,followed
she,set,down,the,empty,gourd,and,looked,about,her
this,was,all,a,dream,this,smoke-filled,dim,room,the,scrawny,girls,mammy,shapeless,and,huge,crouching,beside,the,bed,dilcey,a,still,bronze,image,with,the,sleeping,pink,morsel,against,her,dark,breast,all,a,dream,from,which,she,would,awake,to,smell,bacon,frying,in,the,kitchen,hear,the,throaty,laughter,of,the,negroes,and,the,creaking,of,wagons,fieldward,bound,and,ellen's,gentle,insistent,hand,upon,her
then,she,discovered,she,was,in,her,own,room,on,her,own,bed,faint,moonlight,pricking,the,darkness,and,mammy,and,dilcey,were,undressing,her
the,torturing,stays,no,longer,pinched,her,waist,and,she,could,breathe,deeply,and,quietly,to,the,bottom,of,her,lungs,and,her,abdomen
she,felt,her,stockings,being,stripped,gently,from,her,and,heard,mammy,murmuring,indistinguishable,comforting,sounds,as,she,bathed,her,blistered,feet
how,cool,the,water,was,how,good,to,lie,here,in,softness,like,a,child
she,sighed,and,relaxed,and,after,a,time,which,might,have,been,a,year,or,a,second,she,was,alone,and,the,room,was,brighter,as,the,rays,of,the,moon,streamed,in,across,the,bed
she,did,not,know,she,was,drunk,drunk,with,fatigue,and,whisky
she,only,knew,she,had,left,her,tired,body,and,floated,somewhere,above,it,where,there,was,no,pain,and,weariness,and,her,brain,saw,things,with,an,inhuman,clarity
she,was,seeing,things,with,new,eyes,for,somewhere,along,the,long,road,to,tara,she,had,left,her,girlhood,behind,her
she,was,no,longer,plastic,clay,yielding,imprint,to,each,new,experience
the,clay,had,hardened,some,time,in,this,indeterminate,day,which,had,lasted,a,thousand,years
tonight,was,the,last,time,she,would,ever,be,ministered,to,as,a,child
she,was,a,woman,now,and,youth,was,gone
no,she,could,not,would,not,turn,to,gerald's,or,ellen's,families
the,o'haras,did,not,take,charity
the,o'haras,looked,after,their,own
her,burdens,were,her,own,and,burdens,were,for,shoulders,strong,enough,to,bear,them
she,thought,without,surprise,looking,down,from,her,height,that,her,shoulders,were,strong,enough,to,bear,anything,now,having,borne,the,worst,that,could,ever,happen,to,her
she,could,not,desert,tara,she,belonged,to,the,red,acres,far,more,than,they,could,ever,belong,to,her
her,roots,went,deep,into,the,blood-colored,soil,and,sucked,up,life,as,did,the,cotton
she,would,stay,at,tara,and,keep,it,somehow,keep,her,father,and,her,sisters,melanie,and,ashley's,child,the,negroes
tomorrow,oh,tomorrow
tomorrow,she,would,fit,the,yoke,about,her,neck
tomorrow,there,would,be,so,many,things,to,do
go,to,twelve,oaks,and,the,macintosh,place,and,see,if,anything,was,left,in,the,deserted,gardens,go,to,the,river,swamps,and,beat,them,for,straying,hogs,and,chickens,go,to,jonesboro,and,lovejoy,with,ellen's,jewelry,there,must,be,someone,left,there,who,would,sell,something,to,eat
tomorrow,tomorrow,her,brain,ticked,slowly,and,more,slowly,like,a,clock,running,down,but,the,clarity,of,vision,persisted
of,a,sudden,the,oft-told,family,tales,to,which,she,had,listened,since,babyhood,listened,half-bored,impatient,and,but,partly,comprehending,were,crystal,clear
gerald,penniless,had,raised,tara,ellen,had,risen,above,some,mysterious,sorrow,grandfather,robillard,surviving,the,wreck,of,napoleon's,throne,had,founded,his,fortunes,anew,on,the,fertile,georgia,coast,great-grandfather,prudhomme,had,carved,a,small,kingdom,out,of,the,dark,jungles,of,haiti,lost,it,and,lived,to,see,his,name,honored,in,savannah
there,were,the,scarletts,who,had,fought,with,the,irish,volunteers,for,a,free,ireland,and,been,hanged,for,their,pains,and,the,o'haras,who,died,at,the,boyne,battling,to,the,end,for,what,was,theirs
all,had,suffered,crushing,misfortunes,and,had,not,been,crushed
they,had,not,been,broken,by,the,crash,of,empires,the,machetes,of,revolting,slaves,war,rebellion,proscription,confiscation
malign,fate,had,broken,their,necks,perhaps,but,never,their,hearts
they,had,not,whined,they,had,fought
and,when,they,died,they,died,spent,but,unquenched
all,of,those,shadowy,folks,whose,blood,flowed,in,her,veins,seemed,to,move,quietly,in,the,moonlit,room
and,scarlett,was,not,surprised,to,see,them,these,kinsmen,who,had,taken,the,worst,that,fate,could,send,and,hammered,it,into,the,best
tara,was,her,fate,her,fight,and,she,must,conquer,it
she,turned,drowsily,on,her,side,a,slow,creeping,blackness,enveloping,her,mind
were,they,really,there,whispering,wordless,encouragement,to,her,or,was,this,part,of,her,dream
whether,you,are,there,or,not,she,murmured,sleepily,good,night,and,thank,you
chapter,xxv
the,next,morning,scarlett's,body,was,so,stiff,and,sore,from,the,long,miles,of,walking,and,jolting,in,the,wagon,that,every,movement,was,agony
her,face,was,crimson,with,sunburn,and,her,blistered,palms,raw
her,tongue,was,furred,and,her,throat,parched,as,if,flames,had,scorched,it,and,no,amount,of,water,could,assuage,her,thirst
her,head,felt,swollen,and,she,winced,even,when,she,turned,her,eyes
a,queasiness,of,the,stomach,reminiscent,of,the,early,days,of,her,pregnancy,made,the,smoking,yams,on,the,breakfast,table,unendurable,even,to,the,smell
gerald,could,have,told,her,she,was,suffering,the,normal,aftermath,of,her,first,experience,with,hard,drinking,but,gerald,noticed,nothing
he,sat,at,the,head,of,the,table,a,gray,old,man,with,absent,faded,eyes,fastened,on,the,door,and,head,cocked,slightly,to,hear,the,rustle,of,ellen's,petticoats,to,smell,the,lemon,verbena,sachet
as,scarlett,sat,down,he,mumbled,we,will,wait,for,mrs,o'hara
she,is,late
she,raised,an,aching,head,looked,at,him,with,startled,incredulity,and,met,the,pleading,eyes,of,mammy,who,stood,behind,gerald's,chair
she,rose,unsteadily,her,hand,at,her,throat,and,looked,down,at,her,father,in,the,morning,sunlight
he,peered,up,at,her,vaguely,and,she,saw,that,his,hands,were,shaking,that,his,head,trembled,a,little
until,this,moment,she,had,not,realized,how,much,she,had,counted,on,gerald,to,take,command,to,tell,her,what,she,must,do,and,now,why,last,night,he,had,seemed,almost,himself
there,had,been,none,of,his,usual,bluster,and,vitality,but,at,least,he,had,told,a,connected,story,and,now,now,he,did,not,even,remember,ellen,was,dead
the,combined,shock,of,the,coming,of,the,yankees,and,her,death,had,stunned,him
she,started,to,speak,but,mammy,shook,her,head,vehemently,and,raising,her,apron,dabbed,at,her,red,eyes
oh,can,pa,have,lost,his,mind
thought,scarlett,and,her,throbbing,head,felt,as,if,it,would,crack,with,this,added,strain
no,no

what,will,i,do,if,he,doesn't,i,won't,think,about,it,now
i,won't,think,of,him,or,mother,or,any,of,these,awful,things,now
no,not,till,i,can,stand,it
there,are,too,many,other,things,to,think,about,things,that,can,be,helped,without,my,thinking,of,those,i,can't,help
she,left,the,dining,room,without,eating,and,went,out,onto,the,back,porch,where,she,found,pork,barefooted,and,in,the,ragged,remains,of,his,best,livery,sitting,on,the,steps,cracking,peanuts
her,head,was,hammering,and,throbbing,and,the,bright,sunlight,stabbed,into,her,eyes
merely,holding,herself,erect,required,an,effort,of,will,power,and,she,talked,as,briefly,as,possible,dispensing,with,the,usual,forms,of,courtesy,her,mother,had,always,taught,her,to,use,with,negroes
she,began,asking,questions,so,brusquely,and,giving,orders,so,decisively,pork's,eyebrows,went,up,in,mystification
miss,ellen,didn't,never,talk,so,short,to,nobody,not,even,when,she,caught,them,stealing,pullets,and,watermelons

three,bales
that,was,little,more,than,the,shiftless,slatterys,raised
to,make,matters,worse,there,was,the,question,of,taxes
the,confederate,government,took,cotton,for,taxes,in,lieu,of,money,but,three,bales,wouldn't,even,cover,the,taxes
little,did,it,matter,though,to,her,or,the,confederacy,now,that,all,the,field,hands,had,run,away,and,there,was,no,one,to,pick,the,cotton

there,might,be,yankees,or,mean,niggers,at,twelve,oaks
she,mustn't,go,alone
that,will,be,enough,pork
tell,dilcey,to,start,immediately
and,you,and,prissy,go,bring,in,the,sow,and,her,litter,she,said,briefly,turning,on,her,heel
mammy's,old,sunbonnet,faded,but,clean,hung,on,its,peg,on,the,back,porch,and,scarlett,put,it,on,her,head,remembering,as,from,another,world,the,bonnet,with,the,curling,green,plume,which,rhett,had,brought,her,from,paris
she,picked,up,a,large,split-oak,basket,and,started,down,the,back,stairs,each,step,jouncing,her,head,until,her,spine,seemed,to,be,trying,to,crash,through,the,top,of,her,skull
the,road,down,to,the,river,lay,red,and,scorching,between,the,ruined,cotton,fields
there,were,no,trees,to,cast,a,shade,and,the,sun,beat,down,through,mammy's,sunbonnet,as,if,it,were,made,of,tarlatan,instead,of,heavy,quilted,calico,while,the,dust,floating,upward,sifted,into,her,nose,and,throat,until,she,felt,the,membranes,would,crack,dryly,if,she,spoke
deep,ruts,and,furrows,were,cut,into,the,road,where,horses,had,dragged,heavy,guns,along,it,and,the,red,gullies,on,either,side,were,deeply,gashed,by,the,wheels
the,cotton,was,mangled,and,trampled,where,cavalry,and,infantry,forced,off,the,narrow,road,by,the,artillery,had,marched,through,the,green,bushes,grinding,them,into,the,earth
here,and,there,in,the,road,and,fields,lay,buckles,and,bits,of,harness,leather,canteens,flattened,by,hooves,and,caisson,wheels,buttons,blue,caps,worn,socks,bits,of,bloody,rags,all,the,litter,left,by,the,marching,army
she,passed,the,clump,of,cedars,and,the,low,brick,wall,which,marked,the,family,burying,ground,trying,not,to,think,of,the,new,grave,lying,by,the,three,short,mounds,of,her,little,brothers
oh,ellen,she,trudged,on,down,the,dusty,hill,passing,the,heap,of,ashes,and,the,stumpy,chimney,where,the,slattery,house,had,stood,and,she,wished,savagely,that,the,whole,tribe,of,them,had,been,part,of,the,ashes
if,it,hadn't,been,for,the,slatterys,if,it,hadn't,been,for,that,nasty,emmie,who'd,had,a,bastard,brat,by,their,overseer,ellen,wouldn't,have,died
she,moaned,as,a,sharp,pebble,cut,into,her,blistered,foot
what,was,she,doing,here
why,was,scarlett,o'hara,the,belle,of,the,county,the,sheltered,pride,of,tara,tramping,down,this,rough,road,almost,barefoot
her,little,feet,were,made,to,dance,not,to,limp,her,tiny,slippers,to,peep,daringly,from,under,bright,silks,not,to,collect,sharp,pebbles,and,dust
she,was,born,to,be,pampered,and,waited,upon,and,here,she,was,sick,and,ragged,driven,by,hunger,to,hunt,for,food,in,the,gardens,of,her,neighbors
at,the,bottom,of,the,long,hill,was,the,river,and,how,cool,and,still,were,the,tangled,trees,overhanging,the,water
she,sank,down,on,the,low,bank,and,stripping,off,the,remnants,of,her,slippers,and,stockings,dabbled,her,burning,feet,in,the,cool,water
it,would,be,so,good,to,sit,here,all,day,away,from,the,helpless,eyes,of,tara,here,where,only,the,rustle,of,leaves,and,the,gurgle,of,slow,water,broke,the,stillness
but,reluctantly,she,replaced,her,shoes,and,stockings,and,trudged,down,the,bank,spongy,with,moss,under,the,shady,trees
the,yankees,had,burned,the,bridge,but,she,knew,of,a,footlog,bridge,across,a,narrow,point,of,the,stream,a,hundred,yards,below
she,crossed,it,cautiously,and,trudged,uphill,the,hot,half-,mile,to,twelve,oaks
there,towered,the,twelve,oaks,as,they,had,stood,since,indian,days,but,with,their,leaves,brown,from,fire,and,the,branches,burned,and,scorched
within,their,circle,lay,the,ruins,of,john,wilkes',house,the,charred,remains,of,that,once,stately,home,which,had,crowned,the,hill,in,white-columned,dignity
the,deep,pit,which,had,been,the,cellar,the,blackened,field-stone,foundations,and,two,mighty,chimneys,marked,the,site
one,long,column,half-burned,had,fallen,across,the,lawn,crushing,the,cape,jessamine,bushes
scarlett,sat,down,on,the,column,too,sick,at,the,sight,to,go,on
this,desolation,went,to,her,heart,as,nothing,she,had,ever,experienced
here,was,the,wilkes,pride,in,the,dust,at,her,feet
here,was,the,end,of,the,kindly,courteous,house,which,had,always,welcomed,her,the,house,where,in,futile,dreams,she,had,aspired,to,be,mistress
here,she,had,danced,and,dined,and,flirted,and,here,she,had,watched,with,a,jealous,hurting,heart,how,melanie,smiled,up,at,ashley
here,too,in,the,cool,shadows,of,the,trees,charles,hamilton,had,rapturously,pressed,her,hand,when,she,said,she,would,marry,him
oh,ashley,she,thought,i,hope,you,are,dead
i,could,never,bear,for,you,to,see,this
ashley,had,married,his,bride,here,but,his,son,and,his,son's,son,would,never,bring,brides,to,this,house
there,would,be,no,more,matings,and,births,beneath,this,roof,which,she,had,so,loved,and,longed,to,rule
the,house,was,dead,and,to,scarlett,it,was,as,if,all,the,wilkeses,too,were,dead,in,its,ashes
i,won't,think,of,it,now
i,can't,stand,it,now
i'll,think,of,it,later,she,said,aloud,turning,her,eyes,away
seeking,the,garden,she,limped,around,the,ruins,by,the,trampled,rose,beds,the,wilkes,girls,had,tended,so,zealously,across,the,back,yard,and,through,the,ashes,to,the,smokehouse,barns,and,chicken,houses
the,split-rail,fence,around,the,kitchen,garden,had,been,demolished,and,the,once,orderly,rows,of,green,plants,had,suffered,the,same,treatment,as,those,at,tara
the,soft,earth,was,scarred,with,hoof,prints,and,heavy,wheels,and,the,vegetables,were,mashed,into,the,soil
there,was,nothing,for,her,here
she,walked,back,across,the,yard,and,took,the,path,down,toward,the,silent,row,of,whitewashed,cabins,in,the,quarters,calling,hello
as,she,went
but,no,voice,answered,her
not,even,a,dog,barked
evidently,the,wilkes,negroes,had,taken,flight,or,followed,the,yankees
she,knew,every,slave,had,his,own,garden,patch,and,as,she,reached,the,quarters,she,hoped,these,little,patches,had,been,spared
her,search,was,rewarded,but,she,was,too,tired,even,to,feel,pleasure,at,the,sight,of,turnips,and,cabbages,wilted,for,want,of,water,but,still,standing,and,straggling,butter,beans,and,snap,beans,yellow,but,edible
she,sat,down,in,the,furrows,and,dug,into,the,earth,with,hands,that,shook,filling,her,basket,slowly
there,would,be,a,good,meal,at,tara,tonight,in,spite,of,the,lack,of,side,meat,to,boil,with,the,vegetables
perhaps,some,of,the,bacon,grease,dilcey,was,using,for,illumination,could,be,used,for,seasoning
she,must,remember,to,tell,dilcey,to,use,pine,knots,and,save,the,grease,for,cooking
close,to,the,back,step,of,one,cabin,she,found,a,short,row,of,radishes,and,hunger,assaulted,her,suddenly
a,spicy,sharp-tasting,radish,was,exactly,what,her,stomach,craved
hardly,waiting,to,rub,the,dirt,off,on,her,skirt,she,bit,off,half,and,swallowed,it,hastily
it,was,old,and,coarse,and,so,peppery,that,tears,started,in,her,eyes
no,sooner,had,the,lump,gone,down,than,her,empty,outraged,stomach,revolted,and,she,lay,in,the,soft,dirt,and,vomited,tiredly
the,faint,niggery,smell,which,crept,from,the,cabin,increased,her,nausea,and,without,strength,to,combat,it,she,kept,on,retching,miserably,while,the,cabins,and,trees,revolved,swiftly,around,her
after,a,long,time,she,lay,weakly,on,her,face,the,earth,as,soft,and,comfortable,as,a,feather,pillow,and,her,mind,wandered,feebly,here,and,there
she,scarlett,o'hara,was,lying,behind,a,negro,cabin,in,the,midst,of,ruins,too,sick,and,too,weak,to,move,and,no,one,in,the,world,knew,or,cared
no,one,would,care,if,they,did,know,for,everyone,had,too,many,troubles,of,his,own,to,worry,about,her
and,all,this,was,happening,to,her,scarlett,o'hara,who,had,never,raised,her,hand,even,to,pick,up,her,discarded,stockings,from,the,floor,or,to,tie,the,laces,of,her,slippers,scarlett,whose,little,headaches,and,tempers,had,been,coddled,and,catered,to,all,her,life
as,she,lay,prostrate,too,weak,to,fight,off,memories,and,worries,they,rushed,at,her,like,buzzards,waiting,for,death
no,longer,had,she,the,strength,to,say,i'll,think,of,mother,and,pa,and,ashley,and,all,this,ruin,later,yes,later,when,i,can,stand,it
she,could,not,stand,it,now,but,she,was,thinking,of,them,whether,she,willed,it,or,not
the,thoughts,circled,and,swooped,above,her,dived,down,and,drove,tearing,claws,and,sharp,beaks,into,her,mind
for,a,timeless,time,she,lay,still,her,face,in,the,dirt,the,sun,beating,hotly,upon,her,remembering,things,and,people,who,were,dead,remembering,a,way,of,living,that,was,gone,forever,and,looking,upon,the,harsh,vista,of,the,dark,future
when,she,arose,at,last,and,saw,again,the,black,ruins,of,twelve,oaks,her,head,was,raised,high,and,something,that,was,youth,and,beauty,and,potential,tenderness,had,gone,out,of,her,face,forever
what,was,past,was,past
those,who,were,dead,were,dead
the,lazy,luxury,of,the,old,days,was,gone,never,to,return
and,as,scarlett,settled,the,heavy,basket,across,her,arm,she,had,settled,her,own,mind,and,her,own,life
there,was,no,going,back,and,she,was,going,forward
throughout,the,south,for,fifty,years,there,would,be,bitter-eyed,women,who,looked,backward,to,dead,times,to,dead,men,evoking,memories,that,hurt,and,were,futile,bearing,poverty,with,bitter,pride,because,they,had,those,memories
but,scarlett,was,never,to,look,back
she,gazed,at,the,blackened,stones,and,for,the,last,time,she,saw,twelve,oaks,rise,before,her,eyes,as,it,had,once,stood,rich,and,proud,symbol,of,a,race,and,a,way,of,living
then,she,started,down,the,road,toward,tara,the,heavy,basket,cutting,into,her,flesh
hunger,gnawed,at,her,empty,stomach,again,and,she,said,aloud,as,god,is,my,witness,as,god,is,my,witness,the,yankees,aren't,going,to,lick,me
i'm,going,to,live,through,this,and,when,it's,over,i'm,never,going,to,be,hungry,again
no,nor,any,of,my,folks
if,i,have,to,steal,or,kill,as,god,is,my,witness,i'm,never,going,to,be,hungry,again
in,the,days,that,followed,tara,might,have,been,crusoe's,desert,island,so,still,it,was,so,isolated,from,the,rest,of,the,world
the,world,lay,only,a,few,miles,away,but,a,thousand,miles,of,tumbling,waves,might,have,stretched,between,tara,and,jonesboro,and,fayetteville,and,lovejoy,even,between,tara,and,the,neighbors',plantations
with,the,old,horse,dead,their,one,mode,of,conveyance,was,gone,and,there,was,neither,time,nor,strength,for,walking,the,weary,red,miles
sometimes,in,the,days,of,backbreaking,work,in,the,desperate,struggle,for,food,and,the,never-ceasing,care,of,the,three,sick,girls,scarlett,found,herself,straining,her,ears,for,familiar,sounds,the,shrill,laughter,of,the,pickaninnies,in,the,quarters,the,creaking,of,wagons,home,from,the,fields,the,thunder,of,gerald's,stallion,tearing,across,the,pasture,the,crunching,of,carriage,wheels,on,the,drive,and,the,gay,voices,of,neighbors,dropping,in,for,an,afternoon,of,gossip
but,she,listened,in,vain
the,road,lay,still,and,deserted,and,never,a,cloud,of,red,dust,proclaimed,the,approach,of,visitors
tara,was,an,island,in,a,sea,of,rolling,green,hills,and,red,fields
somewhere,was,the,world,and,families,who,ate,and,slept,safely,under,their,own,roofs
somewhere,girls,in,thrice-turned,dresses,were,flirting,gaily,and,singing,when,this,cruel,war,is,over,as,she,had,done,only,a,few,weeks,before
somewhere,there,was,a,war,and,cannon,booming,and,burning,towns,and,men,who,rotted,in,hospitals,amid,sickening-sweet,stinks
somewhere,a,barefoot,army,in,dirty,homespun,was,marching,fighting,sleeping,hungry,and,weary,with,the,weariness,that,comes,when,hope,is,gone
and,somewhere,the,hills,of,georgia,were,blue,with,yankees,well-fed,yankees,on,sleek,corn-stuffed,horses
beyond,tara,was,the,war,and,the,world
but,on,the,plantation,the,war,and,the,world,did,not,exist,except,as,memories,which,must,be,fought,back,when,they,rushed,to,mind,in,moments,of,exhaustion
the,world,outside,receded,before,the,demands,of,empty,and,half-empty,stomachs,and,life,resolved,itself,into,two,related,thoughts,food,and,how,to,get,it
food
food
why,did,the,stomach,have,a,longer,memory,than,the,mind
scarlett,could,banish,heartbreak,but,not,hunger,and,each,morning,as,she,lay,half,asleep,before,memory,brought,back,to,her,mind,war,and,hunger,she,curled,drowsily,expecting,the,sweet,smells,of,bacon,frying,and,rolls,baking
and,each,morning,she,sniffed,so,hard,to,really,smell,the,food,she,woke,herself,up
there,were,apples,yams,peanuts,and,milk,on,the,table,at,tara,but,never,enough,of,even,this,primitive,fare
at,the,sight,of,them,three,times,a,day,her,memory,would,rush,back,to,the,old,days,the,meals,of,the,old,days,the,candle-lit,table,and,the,food,perfuming,the,air
how,careless,they,had,been,of,food,then,what,prodigal,waste
rolls,corn,muffins,biscuits,and,waffles,dripping,butter,all,at,one,meal
ham,at,one,end,of,the,table,and,fried,chicken,at,the,other,collards,swimming,richly,in,pot,liquor,iridescent,with,grease,snap,beans,in,mountains,on,brightly,flowered,porcelain,fried,squash,stewed,okra,carrots,in,cream,sauce,thick,enough,to,cut
and,three,desserts,so,everyone,might,have,his,choice,chocolate,layer,cake,vanilla,blanc,mange,and,pound,cake,topped,with,sweet,whipped,cream
the,memory,of,those,savory,meals,had,the,power,to,bring,tears,to,her,eyes,as,death,and,war,had,failed,to,do,and,the,power,to,turn,her,ever-gnawing,stomach,from,rumbling,emptiness,to,nausea
for,the,appetite,mammy,had,always,deplored,the,healthy,appetite,of,a,nineteen-year-old,girl,now,was,increased,fourfold,by,the,hard,and,unremitting,labor,she,had,never,known,before
hers,was,not,the,only,troublesome,appetite,at,tara,for,wherever,she,turned,hungry,faces,black,and,white,met,her,eyes

give,my,share,of,the,milk,to,dilcey
she,needs,it,to,nurse,the,babies
sick,people,are,never,hungry
it,was,her,gentle,hardihood,which,irritated,scarlett,more,than,the,nagging,whining,voices,of,the,others
she,could,and,did,shout,them,down,with,bitter,sarcasm,but,before,melanie's,unselfishness,she,was,helpless,helpless,and,resentful
gerald,the,negroes,and,wade,clung,to,melanie,now,because,even,in,her,weakness,she,was,kind,and,sympathetic,and,these,days,scarlett,was,neither
wade,especially,haunted,melanie's,room
there,was,something,wrong,with,wade,but,just,what,it,was,scarlett,had,no,time,to,discover
she,took,mammy's,word,that,the,little,boy,had,worms,and,dosed,him,with,the,mixture,of,dried,herbs,and,bark,which,ellen,always,used,to,worm,the,pickaninnies
but,the,vermifuge,only,made,the,child,look,paler
these,days,scarlett,hardly,thought,of,wade,as,a,person
he,was,only,another,worry,another,mouth,to,feed
some,day,when,the,present,emergency,was,over,she,would,play,with,him,tell,him,stories,and,teach,him,his,a,b,c's,but,now,she,did,not,have,the,time,or,the,soul,or,the,inclination
and,because,he,always,seemed,underfoot,when,she,was,most,weary,and,worried,she,often,spoke,sharply,to,him
it,annoyed,her,that,her,quick,reprimands,brought,such,acute,fright,to,his,round,eyes,for,he,looked,so,simple,minded,when,he,was,frightened
she,did,not,realize,that,the,little,boy,lived,shoulder,to,shoulder,with,terror,too,great,for,an,adult,to,comprehend
fear,lived,with,wade,fear,that,shook,his,soul,and,made,him,wake,screaming,in,the,night
any,unexpected,noise,or,sharp,word,set,him,to,trembling,for,in,his,mind,noises,and,harsh,words,were,inextricably,mixed,with,yankees,and,he,was,more,afraid,of,yankees,than,of,prissy's,hants
until,the,thunders,of,the,siege,began,he,had,never,known,anything,but,a,happy,placid,quiet,life
even,though,his,mother,paid,him,little,attention,he,had,known,nothing,but,petting,and,kind,words,until,the,night,when,he,was,jerked,from,slumber,to,find,the,sky,aflame,and,the,air,deafening,with,explosions
in,that,night,and,the,day,which,followed,he,had,been,slapped,by,his,mother,for,the,first,time,and,had,heard,her,voice,raised,at,him,in,harsh,words
life,in,the,pleasant,brick,house,on,peachtree,street,the,only,life,he,knew,had,vanished,that,night,and,he,would,never,recover,from,its,loss
in,the,flight,from,atlanta,he,had,understood,nothing,except,that,the,yankees,were,after,him,and,now,he,still,lived,in,fear,that,the,yankees,would,catch,him,and,cut,him,to,pieces
whenever,scarlett,raised,her,voice,in,reproof,he,went,weak,with,fright,as,his,vague,childish,memory,brought,up,the,horrors,of,the,first,time,she,had,ever,done,it
now,yankees,and,a,cross,voice,were,linked,forever,in,his,mind,and,he,was,afraid,of,his,mother
scarlett,could,not,help,noticing,that,the,child,was,beginning,to,avoid,her,and,in,the,rare,moments,when,her,unending,duties,gave,her,time,to,think,about,it,it,bothered,her,a,great,deal
it,was,even,worse,than,having,him,at,her,skirts,all,the,time,and,she,was,offended,that,his,refuge,was,melanie's,bed,where,he,played,quietly,at,games,melanie,suggested,or,listened,to,stories,she,told
wade,adored,auntee,who,had,a,gentle,voice,who,always,smiled,and,who,never,said,hush,wade
you,give,me,a,headache,or,stop,fidgeting,wade,for,heaven's,sake
scarlett,had,neither,the,time,nor,the,impulse,to,pet,him,but,it,made,her,jealous,to,see,melanie,do,it
when,she,found,him,one,day,standing,on,his,head,in,melanie's,bed,and,saw,him,collapse,on,her,she,slapped,him
don't,you,know,better,than,to,jiggle,auntee,like,that,when,she's,sick
now,trot,right,out,in,the,yard,and,play,and,don't,come,in,here,again
but,melanie,reached,out,a,weak,arm,and,drew,the,wailing,child,to,her
there,there,wade
you,didn't,mean,to,jiggle,me,did,you
he,doesn't,bother,me,scarlett
do,let,him,stay,with,me
let,me,take,care,of,him
it's,the,only,thing,i,can,do,till,i,get,well,and,you've,got,your,hands,full,enough,without,having,to,watch,him
don't,be,a,goose,melly,said,scarlett,shortly
you,aren't,getting,well,like,you,should,and,having,wade,fall,on,your,stomach,won't,help,you
now,wade,if,i,ever,catch,you,on,auntee's,bed,again,i'll,wear,you,out
and,stop,sniffling
you,are,always,sniffling
try,to,be,a,little,man
wade,flew,sobbing,to,hide,himself,under,the,house
melanie,bit,her,lip,and,tears,came,to,her,eyes,and,mammy,standing,in,the,hall,a,witness,to,the,scene,scowled,and,breathed,hard
but,no,one,talked,back,to,scarlett,these,days
they,were,all,afraid,of,her,sharp,tongue,all,afraid,of,the,new,person,who,walked,in,her,body
scarlett,reigned,supreme,at,tara,now,and,like,others,suddenly,elevated,to,authority,all,the,bullying,instincts,in,her,nature,rose,to,the,surface
it,was,not,that,she,was,basically,unkind
it,was,because,she,was,so,frightened,and,unsure,of,herself,she,was,harsh,lest,others,learn,her,inadequacies,and,refuse,her,authority
besides,there,was,some,pleasure,in,shouting,at,people,and,knowing,they,were,afraid
scarlett,found,that,it,relieved,her,overwrought,nerves
she,was,not,blind,to,the,fact,that,her,personality,was,changing
sometimes,when,her,curt,orders,made,pork,stick,out,his,under,lip,and,mammy,mutter,some,folks,rides,mighty,high,dese,days,she,wondered,where,her,good,manners,had,gone
all,the,courtesy,all,the,gentleness,ellen,had,striven,to,instill,in,her,had,fallen,away,from,her,as,quickly,as,leaves,fall,from,trees,in,the,first,chill,wind,of,autumn
time,and,again,ellen,had,said,be,firm,but,be,gentle,with,inferiors,especially,darkies
but,if,she,was,gentle,the,darkies,would,sit,in,the,kitchen,all,day,talking,endlessly,about,the,good,old,days,when,a,house,nigger,wasn't,supposed,to,do,a,field,hand's,work
love,and,cherish,your,sisters
be,kind,to,the,afflicted,said,ellen
show,tenderness,to,those,in,sorrow,and,in,trouble
she,couldn't,love,her,sisters,now
they,were,simply,a,dead,weight,on,her,shoulders
and,as,for,cherishing,them,wasn't,she,bathing,them,combing,their,hair,and,feeding,them,even,at,the,expense,of,walking,miles,every,day,to,find,vegetables
wasn't,she,learning,to,milk,the,cow,even,though,her,heart,was,always,in,her,throat,when,that,fearsome,animal,shook,its,horns,at,her
and,as,for,being,kind,that,was,a,waste,of,time
if,she,was,overly,kind,to,them,they'd,probably,prolong,their,stay,in,bed,and,she,wanted,them,on,their,feet,again,as,soon,as,possible,so,there,would,be,four,more,hands,to,help,her
they,were,convalescing,slowly,and,lay,scrawny,and,weak,in,their,bed
while,they,had,been,unconscious,the,world,had,changed
the,yankees,had,come,the,darkies,had,gone,and,mother,had,died
here,were,three,unbelievable,happenings,and,their,minds,could,not,take,them,in
sometimes,they,believed,they,must,still,be,delirious,and,these,things,had,not,happened,at,all
certainly,scarlett,was,so,changed,she,couldn't,be,real
when,she,hung,over,the,foot,of,their,bed,and,outlined,the,work,she,expected,them,to,do,when,they,recovered,they,looked,at,her,as,if,she,were,a,hobgoblin
it,was,beyond,their,comprehension,that,they,no,longer,had,a,hundred,slaves,to,do,the,work
it,was,beyond,their,comprehension,that,an,o'hara,lady,should,do,manual,labor
but,sister,said,carreen,her,sweet,childish,face,blank,with,consternation
i,couldn't,split,kindling
it,would,ruin,my,hands
look,at,mine,answered,scarlett,with,a,frightening,smile,as,she,pushed,blistered,and,calloused,palms,toward,her
i,think,you,are,hateful,to,talk,to,baby,and,me,like,this
cried,suellen
i,think,you,are,lying,and,trying,to,frighten,us
if,mother,were,only,here,she,wouldn't,let,you,talk,to,us,like,this
split,kindling,indeed
suellen,looked,with,weak,loathing,at,her,older,sister,feeling,sure,scarlett,said,these,things,just,to,be,mean
suellen,had,nearly,died,and,she,had,lost,her,mother,and,she,was,lonely,and,scared,and,she,wanted,to,be,petted,and,made,much,of
instead,scarlett,looked,over,the,foot,of,the,bed,each,day,appraising,their,improvement,with,a,hateful,new,gleam,in,her,slanting,green,eyes,and,talked,about,making,beds,preparing,food,carrying,water,buckets,and,splitting,kindling
and,she,looked,as,if,she,took,a,pleasure,in,saying,such,awful,things
scarlett,did,take,pleasure,in,it
she,bullied,the,negroes,and,harrowed,the,feelings,of,her,sisters,not,only,because,she,was,too,worried,and,strained,and,tired,to,do,otherwise,but,because,it,helped,her,to,forget,her,own,bitterness,that,everything,her,mother,had,told,her,about,life,was,wrong
nothing,her,mother,had,taught,her,was,of,any,value,whatsoever,now,and,scarlett's,heart,was,sore,and,puzzled
it,did,not,occur,to,her,that,ellen,could,not,have,foreseen,the,collapse,of,the,civilization,in,which,she,raised,her,daughters,could,not,have,anticipated,the,disappearings,of,the,places,in,society,for,which,she,trained,them,so,well
it,did,not,occur,to,her,that,ellen,had,looked,down,a,vista,of,placid,future,years,all,like,the,uneventful,years,of,her,own,life,when,she,had,taught,her,to,be,gentle,and,gracious,honorable,and,kind,modest,and,truthful
life,treated,women,well,when,they,had,learned,those,lessons,said,ellen
scarlett,thought,in,despair,nothing,no,nothing,she,taught,me,is,of,any,help,to,me
what,good,will,kindness,do,me,now
what,value,is,gentleness
better,that,i'd,learned,to,plow,or,chop,cotton,like,a,darky
oh,mother,you,were,wrong
she,did,not,stop,to,think,that,ellen's,ordered,world,was,gone,and,a,brutal,world,had,taken,its,place,a,world,wherein,every,standard,every,value,had,changed
she,only,saw,or,thought,she,saw,that,her,mother,had,been,wrong,and,she,changed,swiftly,to,meet,this,new,world,for,which,she,was,not,prepared
only,her,feeling,for,tara,had,not,changed
she,never,came,wearily,home,across,the,fields,and,saw,the,sprawling,white,house,that,her,heart,did,not,swell,with,love,and,the,joy,of,homecoming
she,never,looked,out,of,her,window,at,green,pastures,and,red,fields,and,tall,tangled,swamp,forest,that,a,sense,of,beauty,did,not,fill,her
her,love,for,this,land,with,its,softly,rolling,hills,of,bright-red,soil,this,beautiful,red,earth,that,was,blood,colored,garnet,brick,dust,vermilion,which,so,miraculously,grew,green,bushes,starred,with,white,puffs,was,one,part,of,scarlett,which,did,not,change,when,all,else,was,changing
nowhere,else,in,the,world,was,there,land,like,this
when,she,looked,at,tara,she,could,understand,in,part,why,wars,were,fought
rhett,was,wrong,when,he,said,men,fought,wars,for,money
no,they,fought,for,swelling,acres,softly,furrowed,by,the,plow,for,pastures,green,with,stubby,cropped,grass,for,lazy,yellow,rivers,and,white,houses,that,were,cool,amid,magnolias
these,were,the,only,things,worth,fighting,for,the,red,earth,which,was,theirs,and,would,be,their,sons',the,red,earth,which,would,bear,cotton,for,their,sons,and,their,sons',sons
the,trampled,acres,of,tara,were,all,that,was,left,to,her,now,that,mother,and,ashley,were,gone,now,that,gerald,was,senile,from,shock,and,money,and,darkies,and,security,and,position,had,vanished,overnight
as,from,another,world,she,remembered,a,conversation,with,her,father,about,the,land,and,wondered,how,she,could,have,been,so,young,so,ignorant,as,not,to,understand,what,he,meant,when,he,said,that,the,land,was,the,one,thing,in,the,world,worth,fighting,for
for,'tis,the,only,thing,in,the,world,that,lasts
and,to,anyone,with,a,drop,of,irish,blood,in,them,the,land,they,live,on,is,like,their,mother
'tis,the,only,thing,worth,working,for,fighting,for,dying,for
yes,tara,was,worth,fighting,for,and,she,accepted,simply,and,without,question,the,fight
no,one,was,going,to,get,tara,away,from,her
no,one,was,going,to,set,her,and,her,people,adrift,on,the,charity,of,relatives
she,would,hold,tara,if,she,had,to,break,the,back,of,every,person,on,it
chapter,xxvi
scarlett,had,been,at,tara,two,weeks,since,her,return,from,atlanta,when,the,largest,blister,on,her,foot,began,to,fester,swelling,until,it,was,impossible,for,her,to,put,on,her,shoe,or,do,more,than,hobble,about,on,her,heel
desperation,plucked,at,her,when,she,looked,at,the,angry,sore,on,her,toe
suppose,it,should,gangrene,like,the,soldiers',wounds,and,she,should,die,far,away,from,a,doctor
bitter,as,life,was,now,she,had,no,desire,to,leave,it
and,who,would,look,after,tara,if,she,should,die
she,had,hoped,when,she,first,came,home,that,gerald's,old,spirit,would,revive,and,he,would,take,command,but,in,these,two,weeks,that,hope,had,vanished
she,knew,now,that,whether,she,liked,it,or,not,she,had,the,plantation,and,all,its,people,on,her,two,inexperienced,hands,for,gerald,still,sat,quietly,like,a,man,in,a,dream,so,frighteningly,absent,from,tara,so,gentle
to,her,pleas,for,advice,he,gave,as,his,only,answer,do,what,you,think,best,daughter
or,worse,still,consult,with,your,mother,puss
he,never,would,be,any,different,and,now,scarlett,realized,the,truth,and,accepted,it,without,emotion,that,until,he,died,gerald,would,always,be,waiting,for,ellen,always,listening,for,her
he,was,in,some,dim,borderline,country,where,time,was,standing,still,and,ellen,was,always,in,the,next,room
the,mainspring,of,his,existence,was,taken,away,when,she,died,and,with,it,had,gone,his,bounding,assurance,his,impudence,and,his,restless,vitality
ellen,was,the,audience,before,which,the,blustering,drama,of,gerald,o'hara,had,been,played
now,the,curtain,had,been,rung,down,forever,the,footlights,dimmed,and,the,audience,suddenly,vanished,while,the,stunned,old,actor,remained,on,his,empty,stage,waiting,for,his,cues
that,morning,the,house,was,still,for,everyone,except,scarlett,wade,and,the,three,sick,girls,was,in,the,swamp,hunting,the,sow
even,gerald,had,aroused,a,little,and,stumped,off,across,the,furrowed,fields,one,hand,on,pork's,arm,and,a,coil,of,rope,in,the,other
suellen,and,careen,had,cried,themselves,to,sleep,as,they,did,at,least,twice,a,day,when,they,thought,of,ellen,tears,of,grief,and,weakness,oozing,down,their,sunken,cheeks
melanie,who,had,been,propped,up,on,pillows,for,the,first,time,that,day,lay,covered,with,a,mended,sheet,between,two,babies,the,downy,flaxen,head,of,one,cuddled,in,her,arm,the,kinky,black,head,of,dilcey's,child,held,as,gently,in,the,other
wade,sat,at,the,bottom,of,the,bed,listening,to,a,fairy,story
to,scarlett,the,stillness,at,tara,was,unbearable,for,it,reminded,her,too,sharply,of,the,deathlike,stillness,of,the,desolate,country,through,which,she,had,passed,that,long,day,on,her,way,home,from,atlanta
the,cow,and,the,calf,had,made,no,sound,for,hours
there,were,no,birds,twittering,outside,her,window,and,even,the,noisy,family,of,mockers,who,had,lived,among,the,harshly,rustling,leaves,of,the,magnolia,for,generations,had,no,song,that,day
she,had,drawn,a,low,chair,close,to,the,open,window,of,her,bedroom,looking,out,on,the,front,drive,the,lawn,and,the,empty,green,pasture,across,the,road,and,she,sat,with,her,skirts,well,above,her,knees,and,her,chin,resting,on,her,arms,on,the,window,sill
there,was,a,bucket,of,well,water,on,the,floor,beside,her,and,every,now,and,then,she,lowered,her,blistered,foot,into,it,screwing,up,her,face,at,the,stinging,sensation
fretting,she,dug,her,chin,into,her,arm
just,when,she,needed,her,strength,most,this,toe,had,to,fester
those,fools,would,never,catch,the,sow
it,had,taken,them,a,week,to,capture,the,pigs,one,by,one,and,now,after,two,weeks,the,sow,was,still,at,liberty
scarlett,knew,that,if,she,were,just,there,in,the,swamp,with,them,she,could,tuck,up,her,dress,to,her,knees,and,take,the,rope,and,lasso,the,sow,before,you,could,say,jack,robinson
but,even,after,the,sow,was,caught,if,she,were,caught
what,then,after,she,and,her,litter,were,eaten
life,would,go,on,and,so,would,appetites
winter,was,coming,and,there,would,be,no,food,not,even,the,poor,remnants,of,the,vegetables,from,the,neighbors',gardens
they,must,have,dried,peas,and,sorghum,and,meal,and,rice,and,and,oh,so,many,things
corn,and,cotton,seed,for,next,spring's,planting,and,new,clothes,too
where,was,it,all,to,come,from,and,how,would,she,pay,for,it
she,had,privately,gone,through,gerald's,pockets,and,his,cash,box,and,all,she,could,find,was,stacks,of,confederate,bonds,and,three,thousand,dollars,in,confederate,bills
that,was,about,enough,to,buy,one,square,meal,for,them,all,she,thought,ironically,now,that,confederate,money,was,worth,almost,less,than,nothing,at,all
but,if,she,did,have,money,and,could,find,food,how,would,she,haul,it,home,to,tara
why,had,god,let,the,old,horse,die
even,that,sorry,animal,rhett,had,stolen,would,make,all,the,difference,in,the,world,to,them
oh,those,fine,sleek,mules,which,used,to,kick,up,their,heels,in,the,pasture,across,the,road,and,the,handsome,carriage,horses,her,little,mare,the,girls',ponies,and,gerald's,big,stallion,racing,about,and,tearing,up,the,turf,oh,for,one,of,them,even,the,balkiest,mule
but,no,matter,when,her,foot,healed,she,would,walk,to,jonesboro
it,would,be,the,longest,walk,she,had,ever,taken,in,her,life,but,walk,it,she,would
even,if,the,yankees,had,burned,the,town,completely,she,would,certainly,find,someone,in,the,neighborhood,who,could,tell,her,where,to,get,food
wade's,pinched,face,rose,up,before,her,eyes
he,didn't,like,yams,he,repeated,wanted,a,drumstick,and,some,rice,and,gravy
the,bright,sunlight,in,the,front,yard,suddenly,clouded,and,the,trees,blurred,through,tears
scarlett,dropped,her,head,on,her,arms,and,struggled,not,to,cry
crying,was,so,useless,now
the,only,time,crying,ever,did,any,good,was,when,there,was,a,man,around,from,whom,you,wished,favors
as,she,crouched,there,squeezing,her,eyes,tightly,to,keep,back,the,tears,she,was,startled,by,the,sound,of,trotting,hooves
but,she,did,not,raise,her,head
she,had,imagined,that,sound,too,often,in,the,nights,and,days,of,these,last,two,weeks,just,as,she,had,imagined,she,heard,the,rustle,of,ellen's,skirts
her,heart,hammered,as,it,always,did,at,such,moments,before,she,told,herself,sternly,don't,be,a,fool
but,the,hooves,slowed,down,in,a,startlingly,natural,way,to,the,rhythm,of,a,walk,and,there,was,the,measured,scrunch-scrunch,on,the,gravel
it,was,a,horse,the,tarletons,the,fontaines
she,looked,up,quickly
it,was,a,yankee,cavalryman
automatically,she,dodged,behind,the,curtain,and,peered,fascinated,at,him,through,the,dim,folds,of,the,cloth,so,startled,that,the,breath,went,out,of,her,lungs,with,a,gasp
he,sat,slouched,in,the,saddle,a,thick,rough-looking,man,with,an,unkempt,black,beard,straggling,over,his,unbuttoned,blue,jacket
little,close-set,eyes,squinting,in,the,sun,glare,calmly,surveyed,the,house,from,beneath,the,visor,of,his,tight,blue,cap
as,he,slowly,dismounted,and,tossed,the,bridle,reins,over,the,hitching,post,scarlett's,breath,came,back,to,her,as,suddenly,and,painfully,as,after,a,blow,in,the,stomach
a,yankee,a,yankee,with,a,long,pistol,on,his,hip
and,she,was,alone,in,the,house,with,three,sick,girls,and,the,babies
as,he,lounged,up,the,walk,hand,on,holster,beady,little,eyes,glancing,to,right,and,left,a,kaleidoscope,of,jumbled,pictures,spun,in,her,mind,stories,aunt,pittypat,had,whispered,of,attacks,on,unprotected,women,throat,cuttings,houses,burned,over,the,heads,of,dying,women,children,bayoneted,because,they,cried,all,of,the,unspeakable,horrors,that,lay,bound,up,in,the,name,of,yankee
her,first,terrified,impulse,was,to,hide,in,the,closet,crawl,under,the,bed,fly,down,the,back,stairs,and,run,screaming,to,the,swamp,anything,to,escape,him
then,she,heard,his,cautious,feet,on,the,front,steps,and,his,stealthy,tread,as,he,entered,the,hall,and,she,knew,that,escape,was,cut,off
too,cold,with,fear,to,move,she,heard,his,progress,from,room,to,room,downstairs,his,steps,growing,louder,and,bolder,as,he,discovered,no,one
now,he,was,in,the,dining,room,and,in,a,moment,he,would,walk,out,into,the,kitchen
at,the,thought,of,the,kitchen,rage,suddenly,leaped,up,in,scarlett's,breast,so,sharply,that,it,jabbed,at,her,heart,like,a,knife,thrust,and,fear,fell,away,before,her,overpowering,fury
the,kitchen
there,over,the,open,kitchen,fire,were,two,pots,one,filled,with,apples,stewing,and,the,other,with,a,hodgepodge,of,vegetables,brought,painfully,from,twelve,oaks,and,the,macintosh,garden,dinner,that,must,serve,for,nine,hungry,people,and,hardly,enough,for,two
scarlett,had,been,restraining,her,appetite,for,hours,waiting,for,the,return,of,the,others,and,the,thought,of,the,yankee,eating,their,meager,meal,made,her,shake,with,anger
god,damn,them,all
they,descended,like,locusts,and,left,tara,to,starve,slowly,and,now,they,were,back,again,to,steal,the,poor,leavings
her,empty,stomach,writhed,within,her
by,god,this,was,one,yankee,who,would,do,no,more,stealing
she,slipped,off,her,worn,shoe,and,barefooted,she,pattered,swiftly,to,the,bureau,not,even,feeling,her,festered,toe
she,opened,the,top,drawer,soundlessly,and,caught,up,the,heavy,pistol,she,had,brought,from,atlanta,the,weapon,charles,had,worn,but,never,fired
she,fumbled,in,the,leather,box,that,hung,on,the,wall,below,his,saber,and,brought,out,a,cap
she,slipped,it,into,place,with,a,hand,that,did,not,shake
quickly,and,noiselessly,she,ran,into,the,upper,hall,and,down,the,stairs,steadying,herself,on,the,banisters,with,one,hand,and,holding,the,pistol,close,to,her,thigh,in,the,folds,of,her,skirt
who's,there
cried,a,nasal,voice,and,she,stopped,on,the,middle,of,the,stairs,the,blood,thudding,in,her,ears,so,loudly,she,could,hardly,hear,him
halt,or,i'll,shoot
came,the,voice
he,stood,in,the,door,of,the,dining,room,crouched,tensely,his,pistol,in,one,hand,and,in,the,other,the,small,rosewood,sewing,box,fitted,with,gold,thimble,gold-handled,scissors,and,tiny,gold-,topped,acorn,of,emery
scarlett's,legs,felt,cold,to,the,knees,but,rage,scorched,her,face
ellen's,sewing,box,in,his,hands
she,wanted,to,cry,put,it,down
put,it,down,you,dirty,but,words,would,not,come
she,could,only,stare,over,the,banisters,at,him,and,watch,his,face,change,from,harsh,tenseness,to,a,half-contemptuous,half-ingratiating,smile
so,there,is,somebody,ter,home,he,said,slipping,his,pistol,back,into,its,holster,and,moving,into,the,hall,until,he,stood,directly,below,her
all,alone,little,lady
like,lightning,she,shoved,her,weapon,over,the,banisters,and,into,the,startled,bearded,face
before,he,could,even,fumble,at,his,belt,she,pulled,the,trigger
the,back,kick,of,the,pistol,made,her,reel,as,the,roar,of,the,explosion,filled,her,ears,and,the,acrid,smoke,stung,her,nostrils
the,man,crashed,backwards,to,the,floor,sprawling,into,the,dining,room,with,a,violence,that,shook,the,furniture
the,box,clattered,from,his,hand,the,contents,spilling,about,him
hardly,aware,that,she,was,moving,scarlett,ran,down,the,stairs,and,stood,over,him,gazing,down,into,what,was,left,of,the,face,above,the,beard,a,bloody,pit,where,the,nose,had,been,glazing,eyes,burned,with,powder
as,she,looked,two,streams,of,blood,crept,across,the,shining,floor,one,from,his,face,and,one,from,the,back,of,his,head
yes,he,was,dead
undoubtedly
she,had,killed,a,man
the,smoke,curled,slowly,to,the,ceiling,and,the,red,streams,widened,about,her,feet
for,a,timeless,moment,she,stood,there,and,in,the,still,hot,hush,of,the,summer,morning,every,irrelevant,sound,and,scent,seemed,magnified,the,quick,thudding,of,her,heart,like,a,drumbeat,the,slight,rough,rustling,of,the,magnolia,leaves,the,far-off,plaintive,sound,of,a,swamp,bird,and,the,sweet,smell,of,the,flowers,outside,the,window
she,had,killed,a,man,she,who,took,care,never,to,be,in,at,the,kill,on,a,hunt,she,who,could,not,bear,the,squealing,of,a,hog,at,slaughter,or,the,squeak,of,a,rabbit,in,a,snare
murder
she,thought,dully
i've,done,murder
oh,this,can't,be,happening,to,me
her,eyes,went,to,the,stubby,hairy,hand,on,the,floor,so,close,to,the,sewing,box,and,suddenly,she,was,vitally,alive,again,vitally,glad,with,a,cool,tigerish,joy
she,could,have,ground,her,heel,into,the,gaping,wound,which,had,been,his,nose,and,taken,sweet,pleasure,in,the,feel,of,his,warm,blood,on,her,bare,feet
she,had,struck,a,blow,of,revenge,for,tara,and,for,ellen
there,were,hurried,stumbling,steps,in,the,upper,hall,a,pause,and,then,more,steps,weak,dragging,steps,now,punctuated,by,metallic,clankings
a,sense,of,time,and,reality,coming,back,to,her,scarlett,looked,up,and,saw,melanie,at,the,top,of,the,stairs,clad,only,in,the,ragged,chemise,which,served,her,as,a,nightgown,her,weak,arm,weighed,down,with,charles',saber
melanie's,eyes,took,in,the,scene,below,in,its,entirety,the,sprawling,blue-clad,body,in,the,red,pool,the,sewing,box,beside,him,scarlett,barefooted,and,gray-faced,clutching,the,long,pistol
in,silence,her,eyes,met,scarlett's
there,was,a,glow,of,grim,pride,in,her,usually,gentle,face,approbation,and,a,fierce,joy,in,her,smile,that,equaled,the,fiery,tumult,in,scarlett's,own,bosom
why,why,she's,like,me
she,understands,how,i,feel
thought,scarlett,in,that,long,moment
she'd,have,done,the,same,thing
with,a,thrill,she,looked,up,at,the,frail,swaying,girl,for,whom,she,had,never,had,any,feelings,but,of,dislike,and,contempt
now,struggling,against,hatred,for,ashley's,wife,there,surged,a,feeling,of,admiration,and,comradeship
she,saw,in,a,flash,of,clarity,untouched,by,any,petty,emotion,that,beneath,the,gentle,voice,and,the,dovelike,eyes,of,melanie,there,was,a,thin,flashing,blade,of,unbreakable,steel,felt,too,that,there,were,banners,and,bugles,of,courage,in,melanie's,quiet,blood
scarlett
scarlett
shrilled,the,weak,frightened,voices,of,suellen,and,carreen,muffled,by,their,closed,door,and,wade's,voice,screamed,auntee
auntee
swiftly,melanie,put,her,finger,to,her,lips,and,laying,the,sword,on,the,top,step,she,painfully,made,her,way,down,the,upstairs,hall,and,opened,the,door,of,the,sick,room
don't,be,scared,chickens
came,her,voice,with,teasing,gaiety
your,big,sister,was,trying,to,clean,the,rust,off,charles',pistol,and,it,went,off,and,nearly,scared,her,to,death
now,wade,hampton,mama,just,shot,off,your,dear,papa's,pistol
when,you,are,bigger,she,will,let,you,shoot,it
what,a,cool,liar
thought,scarlett,with,admiration
i,couldn't,have,thought,that,quickly
but,why,lie
they've,got,to,know,i've,done,it
she,looked,down,at,the,body,again,and,now,revulsion,came,over,her,as,her,rage,and,fright,melted,away,and,her,knees,began,to,quiver,with,the,reaction
melanie,dragged,herself,to,the,top,step,again,and,started,down,holding,onto,the,banisters,her,pale,lower,lip,caught,between,her,teeth
go,back,to,bed,silly,you'll,kill,yourself
scarlett,cried,but,the,half-naked,melanie,made,her,painful,way,down,into,the,lower,hall
scarlett,she,whispered,we,must,get,him,out,of,here,and,bury,him
he,may,not,be,alone,and,if,they,find,him,here,she,steadied,herself,on,scarlett's,arm
he,must,be,alone,said,scarlett
i,didn't,see,anyone,else,from,the,upstairs,window
he,must,be,a,deserter
even,if,he,is,alone,no,one,must,know,about,it
the,negroes,might,talk,and,then,they'd,come,and,get,you
scarlett,we,must,get,him,hidden,before,the,folks,come,back,from,the,swamp
her,mind,prodded,to,action,by,the,feverish,urgency,of,melanie's,voice,scarlett,thought,hard
i,could,bury,him,in,the,corner,of,the,garden,under,the,arbor,the,ground,is,soft,there,where,pork,dug,up,the,whisky,barrel
but,how,will,i,get,him,there
we'll,both,take,a,leg,and,drag,him,said,melanie,firmly
reluctantly,scarlett's,admiration,went,still,higher
you,couldn't,drag,a,cat
i'll,drag,him,she,said,roughly
you,go,back,to,bed
you'll,kill,yourself
don't,dare,try,to,help,me,either,or,i'll,carry,you,upstairs,myself
melanie's,white,face,broke,into,a,sweet,understanding,smile
you,are,very,dear,scarlett,she,said,and,softly,brushed,her,lips,against,scarlett's,cheek
before,scarlett,could,recover,from,her,surprise,melanie,went,on,if,you,can,drag,him,out,i'll,mop,up,the,the,mess,before,the,folks,get,home,and,scarlett
yes
do,you,suppose,it,would,be,dishonest,to,go,through,his,knapsack
he,might,have,something,to,eat
i,do,not,said,scarlett,annoyed,that,she,had,not,thought,of,this,herself
you,take,the,knapsack,and,i'll,go,through,his,pockets
stooping,over,the,dead,man,with,distaste,she,unbuttoned,the,remaining,buttons,of,his,jacket,and,systematically,began,rifling,his,pockets
dear,god,she,whispered,pulling,out,a,bulging,wallet,wrapped,about,with,a,rag
melanie,melly,i,think,it's,full,of,money
melanie,said,nothing,but,abruptly,sat,down,on,the,floor,and,leaned,back,against,the,wall
you,look,she,said,shakily
i'm,feeling,a,little,weak
scarlett,tore,off,the,rag,and,with,trembling,hands,opened,the,leather,folds
look,melly,just,look
melanie,looked,and,her,eyes,dilated
jumbled,together,was,a,mass,of,bills,united,states,greenbacks,mingling,with,confederate,money,and,glinting,from,between,them,were,one,ten-dollar,gold,piece,and,two,five-dollar,gold,pieces
don't,stop,to,count,it,now,said,melanie,as,scarlett,began,fingering,the,bills
we,haven't,time
do,you,realize,melanie,that,this,money,means,that,we'll,eat
yes,yes,dear
i,know,but,we,haven't,time,now
you,look,in,his,other,pockets,and,i'll,take,the,knapsack
scarlett,was,loath,to,put,down,the,wallet
bright,vistas,opened,before,her,real,money,the,yankee's,horse,food
there,was,a,god,after,all,and,he,did,provide,even,if,he,did,take,very,odd,ways,of,providing
she,sat,on,her,haunches,and,stared,at,the,wallet,smiling
food
melanie,plucked,it,from,her,hands
hurry
she,said
the,trouser,pockets,yielded,nothing,except,a,candle,end,a,jackknife,a,plug,of,tobacco,and,a,bit,of,twine
melanie,removed,from,the,knapsack,a,small,package,of,coffee,which,she,sniffed,as,if,it,were,the,sweetest,of,perfumes,hardtack,and,her,face,changing,a,miniature,of,a,little,girl,in,a,gold,frame,set,with,seed,pearls,a,garnet,brooch,two,broad,gold,bracelets,with,tiny,dangling,gold,chains,a,gold,thimble,a,small,silver,baby's,cup,gold,embroidery,scissors,a,diamond,solitaire,ring,and,a,pair,of,earrings,with,pendant,pear-shaped,diamonds,which,even,their,unpracticed,eyes,could,tell,were,well,over,a,carat,each
a,thief
whispered,melanie,recoiling,from,the,still,body
scarlett,he,must,have,stolen,all,of,this
of,course,said,scarlett
and,he,came,here,hoping,to,steal,more,from,us
i'm,glad,you,killed,him,said,melanie,her,gentle,eyes,hard
now,hurry,darling,and,get,him,out,of,here
scarlett,bent,over,caught,the,dead,man,by,his,boots,and,tugged
how,heavy,he,was,and,how,weak,she,suddenly,felt
suppose,she,shouldn't,be,able,to,move,him
turning,so,that,she,backed,the,corpse,she,caught,a,heavy,boot,under,each,arm,and,threw,her,weight,forward
he,moved,and,she,jerked,again
her,sore,foot,forgotten,in,the,excitement,now,gave,a,tremendous,throb,that,made,her,grit,her,teeth,and,shift,her,weight,to,the,heel
tugging,and,straining,perspiration,dripping,from,her,forehead,she,dragged,him,down,the,hall,a,red,stain,following,her,path
if,he,bleeds,across,the,yard,we,can't,hide,it,she,gasped
give,me,your,shimmy,melanie,and,i'll,wad,it,around,his,head
melanie's,white,face,went,crimson
don't,be,silly,i,won't,look,at,you,said,scarlett
if,i,had,on,a,petticoat,or,pantalets,i'd,use,them
crouching,back,against,the,wall,melanie,pulled,the,ragged,linen,garment,over,her,head,and,silently,tossed,it,to,scarlett,shielding,herself,as,best,she,could,with,her,arms
thank,god,i'm,not,that,modest,thought,scarlett,feeling,rather,than,seeing,melanie's,agony,of,embarrassment,as,she,wrapped,the,ragged,cloth,about,the,shattered,face
by,a,series,of,limping,jerks,she,pulled,the,body,down,the,hall,toward,the,back,porch,and,pausing,to,wipe,her,forehead,with,the,back,of,her,hand,glanced,back,toward,melanie,sitting,against,the,wall,hugging,her,thin,knees,to,her,bare,breasts
how,silly,of,melanie,to,be,bothering,about,modesty,at,a,time,like,this,scarlett,thought,irritably
it,was,just,part,of,her,nicey-nice,way,of,acting,which,had,always,made,scarlett,despise,her
then,shame,rose,in,her
after,all,after,all,melanie,had,dragged,herself,from,bed,so,soon,after,having,a,baby,and,had,come,to,her,aid,with,a,weapon,too,heavy,even,for,her,to,lift
that,had,taken,courage,the,kind,of,courage,scarlett,honestly,knew,she,herself,did,not,possess,the,thin-steel,spun-silk,courage,which,had,characterized,melanie,on,the,terrible,night,atlanta,fell,and,on,the,long,trip,home
it,was,the,same,intangible,unspectacular,courage,that,all,the,wilkeses,possessed,a,quality,which,scarlett,did,not,understand,but,to,which,she,gave,grudging,tribute
go,back,to,bed,she,threw,over,her,shoulder
you'll,be,dead,if,you,don't
i'll,clean,up,the,mess,after,i've,buried,him
i'll,do,it,with,one,of,the,rag,rugs,whispered,melanie,looking,at,the,pool,of,blood,with,a,sick,face
well,kill,yourself,then,and,see,if,i,care
and,if,any,of,the,folks,come,back,before,i'm,finished,keep,them,in,the,house,and,tell,them,the,horse,just,walked,in,from,nowhere
melanie,sat,shivering,in,the,morning,sunlight,and,covered,her,ears,against,the,sickening,series,of,thuds,as,the,dead,man's,head,bumped,down,the,porch,steps
no,one,questioned,whence,the,horse,had,come
it,was,so,obvious,he,was,a,stray,from,the,recent,battle,and,they,were,well,pleased,to,have,him
the,yankee,lay,in,the,shallow,pit,scarlett,had,scraped,out,under,the,scuppernong,arbor
the,uprights,which,held,the,thick,vines,were,rotten,and,that,night,scarlett,hacked,at,them,with,the,kitchen,knife,until,they,fell,and,the,tangled,mass,ran,wild,over,the,grave
the,replacing,of,these,posts,was,one,bit,of,repair,work,scarlett,did,not,suggest,and,if,the,negroes,knew,why,they,kept,their,silence
no,ghost,rose,from,that,shallow,grave,to,haunt,her,in,the,long,nights,when,she,lay,awake,too,tired,to,sleep
no,feeling,of,horror,or,remorse,assailed,her,at,the,memory
she,wondered,why,knowing,that,even,a,month,before,she,could,never,have,done,the,deed
pretty,young,mrs,hamilton,with,her,dimple,and,her,jingling,earbobs,and,her,helpless,little,ways,blowing,a,man's,face,to,a,pulp,and,then,burying,him,in,a,hastily,scratched-out,hole
scarlett,grinned,a,little,grimly,thinking,of,the,consternation,such,an,idea,would,bring,to,those,who,knew,her
i,won't,think,about,it,any,more,she,decided
it's,over,and,done,with,and,i'd,have,been,a,ninny,not,to,kill,him
i,reckon,i,reckon,i,must,have,changed,a,little,since,coming,home,or,else,i,couldn't,have,done,it
she,did,not,think,of,it,consciously,but,in,the,back,of,her,mind,whenever,she,was,confronted,by,an,unpleasant,and,difficult,task,the,idea,lurked,giving,her,strength,i've,done,murder,and,so,i,can,surely,do,this
she,had,changed,more,than,she,knew,and,the,shell,of,hardness,which,had,begun,to,form,about,her,heart,when,she,lay,in,the,slave,garden,at,twelve,oaks,was,slowly,thickening
now,that,she,had,a,horse,scarlett,could,find,out,for,herself,what,had,happened,to,their,neighbors
since,she,came,home,she,had,wondered,despairingly,a,thousand,times,are,we,the,only,folks,left,in,the,county
has,everybody,else,been,burned,out
have,they,all,refugeed,to,macon
with,the,memory,of,the,ruins,of,twelve,oaks,the,macintosh,place,and,the,slattery,shack,fresh,in,her,mind,she,almost,dreaded,to,discover,the,truth
but,it,was,better,to,know,the,worst,than,to,wonder
she,decided,to,ride,to,the,fontaines',first,not,because,they,were,the,nearest,neighbors,but,because,old,dr,fontaine,might,be,there
melanie,needed,a,doctor
she,was,not,recovering,as,she,should,and,scarlett,was,frightened,by,her,white,weakness
so,on,the,first,day,when,her,foot,had,healed,enough,to,stand,a,slipper,she,mounted,the,yankee's,horse
one,foot,in,the,shortened,stirrup,and,the,other,leg,crooked,about,the,pommel,in,an,approximation,of,a,side,saddle,she,set,out,across,the,fields,toward,mimosa,steeling,herself,to,find,it,burned
to,her,surprise,and,pleasure,she,saw,the,faded,yellow-stucco,house,standing,amid,the,mimosa,trees,looking,as,it,had,always,looked
warm,happiness,happiness,that,almost,brought,tears,flooded,her,when,the,three,fontaine,women,came,out,of,the,house,to,welcome,her,with,kisses,and,cries,of,joy
but,when,the,first,exclamations,of,affectionate,greeting,were,over,and,they,all,had,trooped,into,the,dining,room,to,sit,down,scarlett,felt,a,chill
the,yankees,had,not,reached,mimosa,because,it,was,far,off,the,main,road
and,so,the,fontaines,still,had,their,stock,and,their,provisions,but,mimosa,was,held,by,the,same,strange,silence,that,hung,over,tara,over,the,whole,countryside
all,the,slaves,except,four,women,house,servants,had,run,away,frightened,by,the,approach,of,the,yankees
there,was,not,a,man,on,the,place,unless,sally's,little,boy,joe,hardly,out,of,diapers,could,be,counted,as,a,man
alone,in,the,big,house,were,grandma,fontaine,in,her,seventies,her,daughter-in-law,who,would,always,be,known,as,young,miss,though,she,was,in,her,fifties,and,sally,who,had,barely,turned,twenty
they,were,far,away,from,neighbors,and,unprotected,but,if,they,were,afraid,it,did,not,show,on,their,faces
probably,thought,scarlett,because,sally,and,young,miss,were,too,afraid,of,the,porcelain-frail,but,indomitable,old,grandma,to,dare,voice,any,qualms
scarlett,herself,was,afraid,of,the,old,lady,for,she,had,sharp,eyes,and,a,sharper,tongue,and,scarlett,had,felt,them,both,in,the,past
though,unrelated,by,blood,and,far,apart,in,age,there,was,a,kinship,of,spirit,and,experience,binding,these,women,together
all,three,wore,home-dyed,mourning,all,were,worn,sad,worried,all,bitter,with,a,bitterness,that,did,not,sulk,or,complain,but,nevertheless,peered,out,from,behind,their,smiles,and,their,words,of,welcome
for,their,slaves,were,gone,their,money,was,worthless,sally's,husband,joe,had,died,at,gettysburg,and,young,miss,was,also,a,widow,for,young,dr,fontaine,had,died,of,dysentery,at,vicksburg
the,other,two,boys,alex,and,tony,were,somewhere,in,virginia,and,nobody,knew,whether,they,were,alive,or,dead,and,old,dr,fontaine,was,off,somewhere,with,wheeler's,cavalry
and,the,old,fool,is,seventy-three,years,old,though,he,tries,to,act,younger,and,he's,as,full,of,rheumatism,as,a,hog,is,of,fleas,said,grandma,proud,of,her,husband,the,light,in,her,eyes,belying,her,sharp,words
have,you,all,had,any,news,of,what's,been,happening,in,atlanta
asked,scarlett,when,they,were,comfortably,settled
we're,completely,buried,at,tara
law,child,said,old,miss,taking,charge,of,the,conversation,as,was,her,habit,we're,in,the,same,fix,as,you,are
we,don't,know,a,thing,except,that,sherman,finally,got,the,town
so,he,did,get,it
what's,he,doing,now
where's,the,fighting,now
and,how,would,three,lone,women,out,here,in,the,country,know,about,the,war,when,we,haven't,seen,a,letter,or,a,newspaper,in,weeks
said,the,old,lady,tartly
one,of,our,darkies,talked,to,a,darky,who'd,seen,a,darky,who'd,been,to,jonesboro,and,except,for,that,we,haven't,heard,anything
what,they,said,was,that,the,yankees,were,just,squatting,in,atlanta,resting,up,their,men,and,their,horses,but,whether,it's,true,or,not,you're,as,good,a,judge,as,i,am
not,that,they,wouldn't,need,a,rest,after,the,fight,we,gave,them
to,think,you've,been,at,tara,all,this,time,and,we,didn't,know
young,miss,broke,in
oh,how,i,blame,myself,for,not,riding,over,to,see
but,there's,been,so,much,to,do,here,with,most,all,the,darkies,gone,that,i,just,couldn't,get,away
but,i,should,have,made,time,to,go
it,wasn't,neighborly,of,me
but,of,course,we,thought,the,yankees,had,burned,tara,like,they,did,twelve,oaks,and,the,macintosh,house,and,that,your,folks,had,gone,to,macon
and,we,never,dreamed,you,were,home,scarlett
well,how,were,we,to,know,different,when,mr,o'hara's,darkies,came,through,here,so,scared,they,were,popeyed,and,told,us,the,yankees,were,going,to,burn,tara
grandma,interrupted
and,we,could,see,sally,began
i'm,telling,this,please,said,old,miss,shortly
and,they,said,the,yankees,were,camped,all,over,tara,and,your,folks,were,fixing,to,go,to,macon
and,then,that,night,we,saw,the,glare,of,fire,over,toward,tara,and,it,lasted,for,hours,and,it,scared,our,fool,darkies,so,bad,they,all,ran,off
what,burned
all,our,cotton,a,hundred,and,fifty,thousand,dollars,worth,said,scarlett,bitterly
be,thankful,it,wasn't,your,house,said,grandma,leaning,her,chin,on,her,cane
you,can,always,grow,more,cotton,and,you,can't,grow,a,house
by,the,bye,had,you,all,started,picking,your,cotton
no,said,scarlett,and,now,most,of,it,is,ruined
i,don't,imagine,there's,more,than,three,bales,left,standing,in,the,far,field,in,the,creek,bottom,and,what,earthly,good,will,it,do
all,our,field,hands,are,gone,and,there's,nobody,to,pick,it
mercy,me,all,our,field,hands,are,gone,and,there's,nobody,to,pick,it
mimicked,grandma,and,bent,a,satiric,glance,on,scarlett
what's,wrong,with,your,own,pretty,paws,miss,and,those,of,your,sisters
me
pick,cotton
cried,scarlett,aghast,as,if,grandma,had,been,suggesting,some,repulsive,crime
like,a,field,hand
like,white,trash
like,the,slattery,women
white,trash,indeed
well,isn't,this,generation,soft,and,ladylike
let,me,tell,you,miss,when,i,was,a,girl,my,father,lost,all,his,money,and,i,wasn't,above,doing,honest,work,with,my,hands,and,in,the,fields,too,till,pa,got,enough,money,to,buy,some,more,darkies
i've,hoed,my,row,and,i've,picked,my,cotton,and,i,can,do,it,again,if,i,have,to
and,it,looks,like,i'll,have,to
white,trash,indeed
oh,but,mama,fontaine,cried,her,daughter-in-law,casting,imploring,glances,at,the,two,girls,urging,them,to,help,her,smooth,the,old,lady's,feathers
that,was,so,long,ago,a,different,day,entirely,and,times,have,changed
times,never,change,when,there's,a,need,for,honest,work,to,be,done,stated,the,sharp-eyed,old,lady,refusing,to,be,soothed
and,i'm,ashamed,for,your,mother,scarlett,to,hear,you,stand,there,and,talk,as,though,honest,work,made,white,trash,out,of,nice,people
'when,adam,delved,and,eve,span'
to,change,the,subject,scarlett,hastily,questioned,what,about,the,tarletons,and,the,calverts
were,they,burned,out
have,they,refugeed,to,macon
the,yankees,never,got,to,the,tarletons
they're,off,the,main,road,like,we,are,but,they,did,get,to,the,calverts,and,they,stole,all,their,stock,and,poultry,and,got,all,the,darkies,to,run,off,with,them,sally,began
grandma,interrupted
hah
they,promised,all,the,black,wenches,silk,dresses,and,gold,earbobs,that's,what,they,did
and,cathleen,calvert,said,some,of,the,troopers,went,off,with,the,black,fools,behind,them,on,their,saddles
well,all,they'll,get,will,be,yellow,babies,and,i,can't,say,that,yankee,blood,will,improve,the,stock
oh,mama,fontaine
don't,pull,such,a,shocked,face,jane
we're,all,married,aren't,we
and,god,knows,we've,seen,mulatto,babies,before,this
why,didn't,they,burn,the,calverts',house
the,house,was,saved,by,the,combined,accents,of,the,second,mrs,calvert,and,that,yankee,overseer,of,hers,hilton,said,old,miss,who,always,referred,to,the,ex-governess,as,the,second,mrs,calvert,although,the,first,mrs,calvert,had,been,dead,twenty,years
'we,are,staunch,union,sympathizers,',mimicked,the,old,lady,twanging,the,words,through,her,long,thin,nose
cathleen,said,the,two,of,them,swore,up,hill,and,down,dale,that,the,whole,passel,of,calverts,were,yankees
and,mr,calvert,dead,in,the,wilderness
and,raiford,at,gettysburg,and,cade,in,virginia,with,the,army
cathleen,was,so,mortified,she,said,she'd,rather,the,house,had,been,burned
she,said,cade,would,bust,when,he,came,home,and,heard,about,it
but,then,that's,what,a,man,gets,for,marrying,a,yankee,woman,no,pride,no,decency,always,thinking,about,their,own,skins
how,come,they,didn't,burn,tara,scarlett
for,a,moment,scarlett,paused,before,answering
she,knew,the,very,next,question,would,be,and,how,are,all,your,folks
and,how,is,your,dear,mother
she,knew,she,could,not,tell,them,ellen,was,dead
she,knew,that,if,she,spoke,those,words,or,even,let,herself,think,of,them,in,the,presence,of,these,sympathetic,women,she,would,burst,into,a,storm,of,tears,and,cry,until,she,was,sick
and,she,could,not,let,herself,cry
she,had,not,really,cried,since,she,came,home,and,she,knew,that,if,she,once,let,down,the,floodgates,her,closely,husbanded,courage,would,all,be,gone
but,she,knew,too,looking,with,confusion,at,the,friendly,faces,about,her,that,if,she,withheld,the,news,of,ellen's,death,the,fontaines,would,never,forgive,her
grandma,in,particular,was,devoted,to,ellen,and,there,were,very,few,people,in,the,county,for,whom,the,old,lady,gave,a,snap,of,her,skinny,fingers
well,speak,up,said,grandma,looking,sharply,at,her
don't,you,know,miss
well,you,see,i,didn't,get,home,till,the,day,after,the,battle,she,answered,hastily
the,yankees,were,all,gone,then
pa,pa,told,me,that,that,he,got,them,not,to,burn,the,house,because,suellen,and,carreen,were,so,ill,with,typhoid,they,couldn't,be,moved
that's,the,first,time,i,ever,heard,of,a,yankee,doing,a,decent,thing,said,grandma,as,if,she,regretted,hearing,anything,good,about,the,invaders
and,how,are,the,girls,now
oh,they,are,better,much,better,almost,well,but,quite,weak,answered,scarlett
then,seeing,the,question,she,feared,hovering,on,the,old,lady's,lips,she,cast,hastily,about,for,some,other,topic,of,conversation
i,i,wonder,if,you,could,lend,us,something,to,eat
the,yankees,cleaned,us,out,like,a,swarm,of,locusts
but,if,you,are,on,short,rations,just,tell,me,so,plainly,and
send,over,pork,with,a,wagon,and,you,shall,have,half,of,what,we've,got,rice,meal,ham,some,chickens,said,old,miss,giving,scarlett,a,sudden,keen,look
oh,that's,too,much
really,i
not,a,word
i,won't,hear,it
what,are,neighbors,for
you,are,so,kind,that,i,can't,but,i,have,to,be,going,now
the,folks,at,home,will,be,worrying,about,me
grandma,rose,abruptly,and,took,scarlett,by,the,arm
you,two,stay,here,she,commanded,pushing,scarlett,toward,the,back,porch
i,have,a,private,word,for,this,child
help,me,down,the,steps,scarlett
young,miss,and,sally,said,good-by,and,promised,to,come,calling,soon
they,were,devoured,by,curiosity,as,to,what,grandma,had,to,say,to,scarlett,but,unless,she,chose,to,tell,them,they,would,never,know
old,ladies,were,so,difficult,young,miss,whispered,to,sally,as,they,went,back,to,their,sewing
scarlett,stood,with,her,hand,on,the,horse's,bridle,a,dull,feeling,at,her,heart
now,said,grandma,peering,into,her,face,what's,wrong,at,tara
what,are,you,keeping,back
scarlett,looked,up,into,the,keen,old,eyes,and,knew,she,could,tell,the,truth,without,tears
no,one,could,cry,in,the,presence,of,grandma,fontaine,without,her,express,permission
mother,is,dead,she,said,flatly
the,hand,on,her,arm,tightened,until,it,pinched,and,the,wrinkled,lids,over,the,yellow,eyes,blinked
did,the,yankees,kill,her
she,died,of,typhoid
died,the,day,before,i,came,home
don't,think,about,it,said,grandma,sternly,and,scarlett,saw,her,swallow
and,your,pa
pa,is,pa,is,not,himself
what,do,you,mean
speak,up
is,he,ill
the,shock,he,is,so,strange,he,is,not
don't,tell,me,he's,not,himself
do,you,mean,his,mind,is,unhinged
it,was,a,relief,to,hear,the,truth,put,so,baldly
how,good,the,old,lady,was,to,offer,no,sympathy,that,would,make,her,cry
yes,she,said,dully,he's,lost,his,mind
he,acts,dazed,and,sometimes,he,can't,seem,to,remember,that,mother,is,dead
oh,old,miss,it's,more,than,i,can,stand,to,see,him,sit,by,the,hour,waiting,for,her,and,so,patiently,too,and,he,used,to,have,no,more,patience,than,a,child
but,it's,worse,when,he,does,remember,that,she's,gone
every,now,and,then,after,he's,sat,still,with,his,ear,cocked,listening,for,her,he,jumps,up,suddenly,and,stumps,out,of,the,house,and,down,to,the,burying,ground
and,then,he,comes,dragging,back,with,the,tears,all,over,his,face,and,he,says,over,and,over,till,i,could,scream,'katie,scarlett,mrs,o'hara,is,dead
your,mother,is,dead,',and,it's,just,like,i,was,hearing,it,again,for,the,first,time
and,sometimes,late,at,night,i,hear,him,calling,her,and,i,get,out,of,bed,and,go,to,him,and,tell,him,she's,down,at,the,quarters,with,a,sick,darky
and,he,fusses,because,she's,always,tiring,herself,out,nursing,people
and,it's,so,hard,to,get,him,back,to,bed
he's,like,a,child
oh,i,wish,dr,fontaine,was,here
i,know,he,could,do,something,for,pa
and,melanie,needs,a,doctor,too
she,isn't,getting,over,her,baby,like,she,should
melly,a,baby
and,she's,with,you
yes
what's,melly,doing,with,you
why,isn't,she,in,macon,with,her,aunt,and,her,kinfolks
i,never,thought,you,liked,her,any,too,well,miss,for,all,she,was,charles',sister
now,tell,me,all,about,it
it's,a,long,story,old,miss
don't,you,want,to,go,back,in,the,house,and,sit,down
i,can,stand,said,grandma,shortly
and,if,you,told,your,story,in,front,of,the,others,they'd,be,bawling,and,making,you,feel,sorry,for,yourself
now,let's,have,it
scarlett,began,haltingly,with,the,siege,and,melanie's,condition,but,as,her,story,progressed,beneath,the,sharp,old,eyes,which,never,faltered,in,their,gaze,she,found,words,words,of,power,and,horror
it,all,came,back,to,her,the,sickeningly,hot,day,of,the,baby's,birth,the,agony,of,fear,the,flight,and,rhett's,desertion
she,spoke,of,the,wild,darkness,of,the,night,the,blazing,camp,fires,which,might,be,friends,or,foes,the,gaunt,chimneys,which,met,her,gaze,in,the,morning,sun,the,dead,men,and,horses,along,the,road,the,hunger,the,desolation,the,fear,that,tara,had,been,burned
i,thought,if,i,could,just,get,home,to,mother,she,could,manage,everything,and,i,could,lay,down,the,weary,load
on,the,way,home,i,thought,the,worst,had,already,happened,to,me,but,when,i,knew,she,was,dead,i,knew,what,the,worst,really,was
she,dropped,her,eyes,to,the,ground,and,waited,for,grandma,to,speak
the,silence,was,so,prolonged,she,wondered,if,grandma,could,have,failed,to,comprehend,her,desperate,plight
finally,the,old,voice,spoke,and,her,tones,were,kind,kinder,than,scarlett,had,ever,heard,her,use,in,addressing,anyone
child,it's,a,very,bad,thing,for,a,woman,to,face,the,worst,that,can,happen,to,her,because,after,she's,faced,the,worst,she,can't,ever,really,fear,anything,again
and,it's,very,bad,for,a,woman,not,to,be,afraid,of,something
you,think,i,don't,understand,what,you've,told,me,what,you've,been,through
well,i,understand,very,well
when,i,was,about,your,age,i,was,in,the,creek,uprising,right,after,the,fort,mims,massacre,yes,she,said,in,a,far-away,voice,just,about,your,age,for,that,was,fifty-odd,years,ago
and,i,managed,to,get,into,the,bushes,and,hide,and,i,lay,there,and,saw,our,house,burn,and,i,saw,the,indians,scalp,my,brothers,and,sisters
and,i,could,only,lie,there,and,pray,that,the,light,of,the,flames,wouldn't,show,up,my,hiding,place
and,they,dragged,mother,out,and,killed,her,about,twenty,feet,from,where,i,was,lying
and,scalped,her,too
and,ever,so,often,one,indian,would,go,back,to,her,and,sink,his,tommyhawk,into,her,skull,again
i,i,was,my,mother's,pet,and,i,lay,there,and,saw,it,all
and,in,the,morning,i,set,out,for,the,nearest,settlement,and,it,was,thirty,miles,away
it,took,me,three,days,to,get,there,through,the,swamps,and,the,indians,and,afterward,they,thought,i'd,lose,my,mind
that's,where,i,met,dr,fontaine
he,looked,after,me
ah,well,that's,been,fifty,years,ago,as,i,said,and,since,that,time,i've,never,been,afraid,of,anything,or,anybody,because,i'd,known,the,worst,that,could,happen,to,me
and,that,lack,of,fear,has,gotten,me,into,a,lot,of,trouble,and,cost,me,a,lot,of,happiness
god,intended,women,to,be,timid,frightened,creatures,and,there's,something,unnatural,about,a,woman,who,isn't,afraid
scarlett,always,save,something,to,fear,even,as,you,save,something,to,love
her,voice,trailed,off,and,she,stood,silent,with,eyes,looking,back,over,half,a,century,to,the,day,when,she,had,been,afraid
scarlett,moved,impatiently
she,had,thought,grandma,was,going,to,understand,and,perhaps,show,her,some,way,to,solve,her,problems
but,like,all,old,people,she'd,gotten,to,talking,about,things,that,happened,before,anyone,was,born,things,no,one,was,interested,in
scarlett,wished,she,had,not,confided,in,her
well,go,home,child,or,they'll,be,worrying,about,you,she,said,suddenly
send,pork,with,the,wagon,this,afternoon
and,don't,think,you,can,lay,down,the,load,ever
because,you,can't
i,know
indian,summer,lingered,into,november,that,year,and,the,warm,days,were,bright,days,for,those,at,tara
the,worst,was,over
they,had,a,horse,now,and,they,could,ride,instead,of,walk
they,had,fried,eggs,for,breakfast,and,fried,ham,for,supper,to,vary,the,monotony,of,the,yams,peanuts,and,dried,apples,and,on,one,festal,occasion,they,even,had,roast,chicken
the,old,sow,had,finally,been,captured,and,she,and,her,brood,rooted,and,grunted,happily,under,the,house,where,they,were,penned
sometimes,they,squealed,so,loudly,no,one,in,the,house,could,talk,but,it,was,a,pleasant,sound
it,meant,fresh,pork,for,the,white,folks,and,chitterlings,for,the,negroes,when,cold,weather,and,hog-killing,time,should,arrive,and,it,meant,food,for,the,winter,for,all
scarlett's,visit,to,the,fontaines,had,heartened,her,more,than,she,realized
just,the,knowledge,that,she,had,neighbors,that,some,of,the,family,friends,and,old,homes,had,survived,drove,out,the,terrible,loss,and,alone,feeling,which,had,oppressed,her,in,her,first,weeks,at,tara
and,the,fontaines,and,tarletons,whose,plantations,had,not,been,in,the,path,of,the,army,were,most,generous,in,sharing,what,little,they,had
it,was,the,tradition,of,the,county,that,neighbor,helped,neighbor,and,they,refused,to,accept,a,penny,from,scarlett,telling,her,that,she,would,do,the,same,for,them,and,she,could,pay,them,back,in,kind,next,year,when,tara,was,again,producing
scarlett,now,had,food,for,her,household,she,had,a,horse,she,had,the,money,and,jewelry,taken,from,the,yankee,straggler,and,the,greatest,need,was,new,clothing
she,knew,it,would,be,risky,business,sending,pork,south,to,buy,clothes,when,the,horse,might,be,captured,by,either,yankees,or,confederates
but,at,least,she,had,the,money,with,which,to,buy,the,clothes,a,horse,and,wagon,for,the,trip,and,perhaps,pork,could,make,the,trip,without,getting,caught
yes,the,worst,was,over
every,morning,when,scarlett,arose,she,thanked,god,for,the,pale-blue,sky,and,the,warm,sun,for,each,day,of,good,weather,put,off,the,inevitable,time,when,warm,clothing,would,be,needed
and,each,warm,day,saw,more,and,more,cotton,piling,up,in,the,empty,slave,quarters,the,only,storage,place,left,on,the,plantation
there,was,more,cotton,in,the,fields,than,she,or,pork,had,estimated,probably,four,bales,and,soon,the,cabins,would,be,full
scarlett,had,not,intended,to,do,any,cotton,picking,herself,even,after,grandma,fontaine's,tart,remark
it,was,unthinkable,that,she,an,o'hara,lady,now,the,mistress,of,tara,should,work,in,the,fields
it,put,her,on,the,same,level,with,the,snarly,haired,mrs,slattery,and,emmie
she,had,intended,that,the,negroes,should,do,the,field,work,while,she,and,the,convalescent,girls,attended,to,the,house,but,here,she,was,confronted,with,a,caste,feeling,even,stronger,than,her,own
pork,mammy,and,prissy,set,up,outcries,at,the,idea,of,working,in,the,fields
they,reiterated,that,they,were,house,niggers,not,field,hands
mammy,in,particular,declared,vehemently,that,she,had,never,even,been,a,yard,nigger
she,had,been,born,in,the,robillard,great,house,not,in,the,quarters,and,had,been,raised,in,ole,miss',bedroom,sleeping,on,a,pallet,at,the,foot,of,the,bed
dilcey,alone,said,nothing,and,she,fixed,her,prissy,with,an,unwinking,eye,that,made,her,squirm
scarlett,refused,to,listen,to,the,protests,and,drove,them,all,into,the,cotton,rows
but,mammy,and,pork,worked,so,slowly,and,with,so,many,lamentations,that,scarlett,sent,mammy,back,to,the,kitchen,to,cook,and,pork,to,the,woods,and,the,river,with,snares,for,rabbits,and,possums,and,lines,for,fish
cotton,picking,was,beneath,pork's,dignity,but,hunting,and,fishing,were,not
scarlett,next,had,tried,her,sisters,and,melanie,in,the,fields,but,that,had,worked,no,better
melanie,had,picked,neatly,quickly,and,willingly,for,an,hour,in,the,hot,sun,and,then,fainted,quietly,and,had,to,stay,in,bed,for,a,week
suellen,sullen,and,tearful,pretended,to,faint,too,but,came,back,to,consciousness,spitting,like,an,angry,cat,when,scarlett,poured,a,gourdful,of,water,in,her,face
finally,she,refused,point-blank
i,won't,work,in,the,fields,like,a,darky
you,can't,make,me
what,if,any,of,our,friends,ever,heard,of,it
what,if,if,mr,kennedy,ever,knew
oh,if,mother,knew,about,this
you,just,mention,mother's,name,once,more,suellen,o'hara,and,i'll,slap,you,flat,cried,scarlett
mother,worked,harder,than,any,darky,on,this,place,and,you,know,it,miss,fine,airs
she,did,not
at,least,not,in,the,fields
and,you,can't,make,me
i'll,tell,papa,on,you,and,he,won't,make,me,work
don't,you,dare,go,bothering,pa,with,any,of,our,troubles
cried,scarlett,distracted,between,indignation,at,her,sister,and,fear,for,gerald
i'll,help,you,sissy,interposed,carreen,docilely
i'll,work,for,sue,and,me,too
she,isn't,well,yet,and,she,shouldn't,be,out,in,the,sun
scarlett,said,gratefully,thank,you,sugarbaby,but,looked,worriedly,at,her,younger,sister
carreen,who,had,always,been,as,delicately,pink,and,white,as,the,orchard,blossoms,that,are,scattered,by,the,spring,wind,was,no,longer,pink,but,still,conveyed,in,her,sweet,thoughtful,face,a,blossomlike,quality
she,had,been,silent,a,little,dazed,since,she,came,back,to,consciousness,and,found,ellen,gone,scarlett,a,termagant,the,world,changed,and,unceasing,labor,the,order,of,the,new,day
it,was,not,in,carreen's,delicate,nature,to,adjust,herself,to,change
she,simply,could,not,comprehend,what,had,happened,and,she,went,about,tara,like,a,sleepwalker,doing,exactly,what,she,was,told
she,looked,and,was,frail,but,she,was,willing,obedient,and,obliging
when,she,was,not,doing,scarlett's,bidding,her,rosary,beads,were,always,in,her,hands,and,her,lips,moving,in,prayers,for,her,mother,and,for,brent,tarleton
it,did,not,occur,to,scarlett,that,carreen,had,taken,brent's,death,so,seriously,and,that,her,grief,was,unhealed
to,scarlet,carreen,was,still,baby,sister,far,too,young,to,have,had,a,really,serious,love,affair
scarlett,standing,in,the,sun,in,the,cotton,rows,her,back,breaking,from,the,eternal,bending,and,her,hands,roughened,by,the,dry,bolls,wished,she,had,a,sister,who,combined,suellen's,energy,and,strength,with,carreen's,sweet,disposition
for,carreen,picked,diligently,and,earnestly
but,after,she,had,labored,for,an,hour,it,was,obvious,that,she,and,not,suellen,was,the,one,not,yet,well,enough,for,such,work
so,scarlett,sent,carreen,back,to,the,house,too
there,remained,with,her,now,in,the,long,rows,only,dilcey,and,prissy
prissy,picked,lazily,spasmodically,complaining,of,her,feet,her,back,her,internal,miseries,her,complete,weariness,until,her,mother,took,a,cotton,stalk,to,her,and,whipped,her,until,she,screamed
after,that,she,worked,a,little,better,taking,care,to,stay,far,from,her,mother's,reach
dilcey,worked,tirelessly,silently,like,a,machine,and,scarlett,with,her,back,aching,and,her,shoulder,raw,from,the,tugging,weight,of,the,cotton,bag,she,carried,thought,that,dilcey,was,worth,her,weight,in,gold
dilcey,she,said,when,good,times,come,back,i'm,not,going,to,forget,how,you've,acted
you've,been,mighty,good
the,bronze,giantess,did,not,grin,pleasedly,or,squirm,under,praise,like,the,other,negroes
she,turned,an,immobile,face,to,scarlett,and,said,with,dignity,thankee,ma'm
but,mist',gerald,and,miss,ellen,been,good,to,me
mist',gerald,buy,my,prissy,so,i,wouldn',grieve,and,i,doan,forgit,it
i,is,part,indian,and,indians,doan,forgit,them,as,is,good,to,them
i,sorry,'bout,my,prissy
she,mighty,wuthless
look,lak,she,all,nigger,lak,her,pa,her,pa,was,mighty,flighty
in,spite,of,scarlett's,problem,of,getting,help,from,the,others,in,the,picking,and,in,spite,of,the,weariness,of,doing,the,labor,herself,her,spirits,lifted,as,the,cotton,slowly,made,its,way,from,the,fields,to,the,cabins
there,was,something,about,cotton,that,was,reassuring,steadying
tara,had,risen,to,riches,on,cotton,even,as,the,whole,south,had,risen,and,scarlett,was,southerner,enough,to,believe,that,both,tara,and,the,south,would,rise,again,out,of,the,red,fields
of,course,this,little,cotton,she,had,gathered,was,not,much,but,it,was,something
it,would,bring,a,little,in,confederate,money,and,that,little,would,help,her,to,save,the,hoarded,greenbacks,and,gold,in,the,yankee's,wallet,until,they,had,to,be,spent
next,spring,she,would,try,to,make,the,confederate,government,send,back,big,sam,and,the,other,field,hands,they,had,commandeered,and,if,the,government,wouldn't,release,them,she'd,use,the,yankee's,money,to,hire,field,hands,from,the,neighbors
next,spring,she,would,plant,and,plant
she,straightened,her,tired,back,and,looking,over,the,browning,autumn,fields,she,saw,next,year's,crop,standing,sturdy,and,green,acre,upon,acre
next,spring
perhaps,by,next,spring,the,war,would,be,over,and,good,times,would,be,back
and,whether,the,confederacy,won,or,lost,times,would,be,better
anything,was,better,than,the,constant,danger,of,raids,from,both,armies
when,the,war,was,over,a,plantation,could,earn,an,honest,living
oh,if,the,war,were,only,over
then,people,could,plant,crops,with,some,certainty,of,reaping,them
there,was,hope,now
the,war,couldn't,last,forever
she,had,her,little,cotton,she,had,food,she,had,a,horse,she,had,her,small,but,treasured,hoard,of,money
yes,the,worst,was,over
chapter,xxvii
on,a,noonday,in,mid-november,they,all,sat,grouped,about,the,dinner,table,eating,the,last,of,the,dessert,concocted,by,mammy,from,corn,meal,and,dried,huckleberries,sweetened,with,sorghum
there,was,a,chill,in,the,air,the,first,chill,of,the,year,and,pork,standing,behind,scarlett's,chair,rubbed,his,hands,together,in,glee,and,questioned,ain',it,'bout,time,fer,de,hawg,killin',miss,scarlett
you,can,taste,those,chitlins,already,can't,you
said,scarlett,with,a,grin
well,i,can,taste,fresh,pork,myself,and,if,the,weather,holds,for,a,few,days,more,we'll
melanie,interrupted,her,spoon,at,her,lips
listen,dear
somebody's,coming
somebody,hollerin',said,pork,uneasily
on,the,crisp,autumn,air,came,clear,the,sound,of,horse's,hooves,thudding,as,swiftly,as,a,frightened,heart,and,a,woman's,voice,high,pitched,screaming,scarlett
scarlett
eye,met,eye,for,a,dreadful,second,around,the,table,before,chairs,were,pushed,back,and,everyone,leaped,up
despite,the,fear,that,made,it,shrill,they,recognized,the,voice,of,sally,fontaine,who,only,an,hour,before,had,stopped,at,tara,for,a,brief,chat,on,her,way,to,jonesboro
now,as,they,all,rushed,pell-mell,to,crowd,the,front,door,they,saw,her,coming,up,the,drive,like,the,wind,on,a,lathered,horse,her,hair,streaming,behind,her,her,bonnet,dangling,by,its,ribbons
she,did,not,draw,rein,but,as,she,galloped,madly,toward,them,she,waved,her,arm,back,in,the,direction,from,which,she,had,come
the,yankees,are,coming
i,saw,them
down,the,road
the,yankees
she,sawed,savagely,at,the,horse's,mouth,just,in,time,to,swerve,him,from,leaping,up,the,front,steps
he,swung,around,sharply,covered,the,side,lawn,in,three,leaps,and,she,put,him,across,the,four-foot,hedge,as,if,she,were,on,the,hunting,field
they,heard,the,heavy,pounding,of,his,hooves,as,he,went,through,the,back,yard,and,down,the,narrow,lane,between,the,cabins,of,the,quarters,and,knew,she,was,cutting,across,the,fields,to,mimosa
for,a,moment,they,stood,paralyzed,and,then,suellen,and,carreen,began,to,sob,and,clutch,each,other's,fingers
little,wade,stood,rooted,trembling,unable,to,cry
what,he,had,feared,since,the,night,he,left,atlanta,had,happened
the,yankees,were,coming,to,get,him
yankees
said,gerald,vaguely
but,the,yankees,have,already,been,here
mother,of,god
cried,scarlett,her,eyes,meeting,melanie's,frightened,eyes
for,a,swift,instant,there,went,through,her,memory,again,the,horrors,of,her,last,night,in,atlanta,the,ruined,homes,that,dotted,the,countryside,all,the,stories,of,rape,and,torture,and,murder
she,saw,again,the,yankee,soldier,standing,in,the,hall,with,ellen's,sewing,box,in,his,hand
she,thought,i,shall,die
i,shall,die,right,here
i,thought,we,were,through,with,all,that
i,shall,die
i,can't,stand,any,more
then,her,eyes,fell,on,the,horse,saddled,and,hitched,and,waiting,for,pork,to,ride,him,to,the,tarleton,place,on,an,errand
her,horse
her,only,horse
the,yankees,would,take,him,and,the,cow,and,the,calf
and,the,sow,and,her,litter,oh,how,many,tiring,hours,it,had,taken,to,catch,that,sow,and,her,agile,young
and,they'd,take,the,rooster,and,the,setting,hens,and,the,ducks,the,fontaines,had,given,her
and,the,apples,and,the,yams,in,the,pantry,bins
and,the,flour,and,rice,and,dried,peas
and,the,money,in,the,yankee,soldier's,wallet
they'd,take,everything,and,leave,them,to,starve
they,shan't,have,them
she,cried,aloud,and,they,all,turned,startled,faces,to,her,fearful,her,mind,had,cracked,under,the,tidings
i,won't,go,hungry
they,shan't,have,them
what,is,it,scarlett
what,is,it
the,horse
the,cow
the,pigs
they,shan't,have,them
i,won't,let,them,have,them
she,turned,swiftly,to,the,four,negroes,who,huddled,in,the,doorway,their,black,faces,a,peculiarly,ashen,shade
the,swamp,she,said,rapidly
whut,swamp
the,river,swamp,you,fools
take,the,pigs,to,the,swamp
all,of,you
quickly
pork,you,and,prissy,crawl,under,the,house,and,get,the,pigs,out
suellen,you,and,carreen,fill,the,baskets,with,as,much,food,as,you,can,carry,and,get,to,the,woods
mammy,put,the,silver,in,the,well,again
and,pork
pork,listen,to,me,don't,stand,there,like,that
take,pa,with,you
don't,ask,me,where
anywhere
go,with,pork,pa,that's,a,sweet,pa
even,in,her,frenzy,she,thought,what,the,sight,of,bluecoats,might,do,to,gerald's,wavering,mind
she,stopped,and,wrung,her,hands,and,the,frightened,sobbing,of,little,wade,who,was,clutching,melanie's,skirt,added,to,her,panic
what,shall,i,do,scarlett
melanie's,voice,was,calm,amid,the,wailing,and,tears,and,scurrying,feet
though,her,face,was,paper,white,and,her,whole,body,trembled,the,very,quietness,of,her,voice,steadied,scarlett,revealing,to,her,that,they,all,looked,to,her,for,commands,for,guidance
the,cow,and,the,calf,she,said,quickly
they're,in,the,old,pasture
take,the,horse,and,drive,them,into,the,swamp,and
before,she,could,finish,her,sentence,melanie,shook,off,wade's,clutches,and,was,down,the,front,steps,and,running,toward,the,horse,pulling,up,her,wide,skirts,as,she,ran
scarlett,caught,a,flashing,glimpse,of,thin,legs,a,flurry,of,skirts,and,underclothing,and,melanie,was,in,the,saddle,her,feet,dangling,far,above,the,stirrups
she,gathered,up,the,reins,and,clapped,her,heels,against,the,animal's,sides,and,then,abruptly,pulled,him,in,her,face,twisting,with,horror
my,baby
she,cried
oh,my,baby
the,yankees,will,kill,him
give,him,to,me
her,hand,was,on,the,pommel,and,she,was,preparing,to,slide,off,but,scarlett,screamed,at,her
go,on
go,on
get,the,cow
i'll,look,after,the,baby
go,on,i,tell,you
do,you,think,i'd,let,them,get,ashley's,baby
go,on
melly,looked,despairingly,backward,but,hammered,her,heels,into,the,horse,and,with,a,scattering,of,gravel,was,off,down,the,drive,toward,the,pasture
scarlett,thought,i,never,expected,to,see,melly,hamilton,straddling,a,horse
and,then,she,ran,into,the,house
wade,was,at,her,heels,sobbing,trying,to,catch,her,flying,skirts
as,she,went,up,the,steps,three,at,a,bound,she,saw,suellen,and,carreen,with,split-oak,baskets,on,their,arms,running,toward,the,pantry,and,pork,tugging,none,too,gently,at,gerald's,arm,dragging,him,toward,the,back,porch
gerald,was,mumbling,querulously,and,pulling,away,like,a,child
from,the,back,yard,she,heard,mammy's,strident,voice,you,priss
you,git,unner,dat,house,an',han',me,dem,shoats
you,knows,mighty,well,ah's,too,big,ter,crawl,thoo,dem,lattices
dilcey,comyere,an',mek,dis,wuthless,chile
and,i,thought,it,was,such,a,good,idea,to,keep,the,pigs,under,the,house,so,nobody,could,steal,them,thought,scarlett,running,into,her,room
why,oh,why,didn't,i,build,a,pen,for,them,down,in,the,swamp
she,tore,open,her,top,bureau,drawer,and,scratched,about,in,the,clothing,until,the,yankee's,wallet,was,in,her,hand
hastily,she,picked,up,the,solitaire,ring,and,the,diamond,earbobs,from,where,she,had,hidden,them,in,her,sewing,basket,and,shoved,them,into,the,wallet
but,where,to,hide,it
in,the,mattress
up,the,chimney
throw,it,in,the,well
put,it,in,her,bosom
no,never,there
the,outlines,of,the,wallet,might,show,through,her,basque,and,if,the,yankees,saw,it,they,would,strip,her,naked,and,search,her
i,shall,die,if,they,do
she,thought,wildly
downstairs,there,was,a,pandemonium,of,racing,feet,and,sobbing,voices
even,in,her,frenzy,scarlett,wished,she,had,melanie,with,her,melly,with,her,quiet,voice,melly,who,was,so,brave,the,day,she,shot,the,yankee
melly,was,worth,three,of,the,others
melly,what,had,melly,said
oh,yes,the,baby
clutching,the,wallet,to,her,scarlett,ran,across,the,hall,to,the,room,where,little,beau,was,sleeping,in,the,low,cradle
she,snatched,him,up,into,her,arms,and,he,awoke,waving,small,fists,and,slobbering,sleepily
she,heard,suellen,crying,come,on,carreen
come,on
we've,got,enough
oh,sister,hurry
there,were,wild,squealings,indignant,gruntings,in,the,back,yard,and,running,to,the,widow,scarlett,saw,mammy,waddling,hurriedly,across,the,cotton,field,with,a,struggling,young,pig,under,each,arm
behind,her,was,pork,also,carrying,two,pigs,and,pushing,gerald,before,him
gerald,was,stumping,across,the,furrows,waving,his,cane
leaning,out,of,the,window,scarlett,yelled,get,the,sow,dilcey
make,prissy,drive,her,out
you,can,chase,her,across,the,fields
dilcey,looked,up,her,bronzed,face,harassed
in,her,apron,was,a,pile,of,silver,tableware
she,pointed,under,the,house
the,sow,done,bit,prissy,and,got,her,penned,up,unner,the,house
good,for,the,sow,thought,scarlett
she,hurried,back,into,her,room,and,hastily,gathered,from,their,hiding,place,the,bracelets,brooch,miniature,and,cup,she,had,found,on,the,dead,yankee
but,where,to,hide,them
it,was,awkward,carrying,little,beau,in,one,arm,and,the,wallet,and,the,trinkets,in,the,other
she,started,to,lay,him,on,the,bed
he,set,up,a,wail,at,leaving,her,arms,and,a,welcome,thought,came,to,her
what,better,hiding,place,could,there,be,than,a,baby's,diaper
she,quickly,turned,him,over,pulled,up,his,dress,and,thrust,the,wallet,down,the,diaper,next,to,his,backside
he,yelled,louder,at,this,treatment,and,she,hastily,tightened,the,triangular,garment,about,his,threshing,legs
now,she,thought,drawing,a,deep,breath,now,for,the,swamp
tucking,him,screaming,under,one,arm,and,clutching,the,jewelry,to,her,with,the,other,she,raced,into,the,upstairs,hall
suddenly,her,rapid,steps,paused,fright,weakening,her,knees
how,silent,the,house,was
how,dreadfully,still
had,they,all,gone,off,and,left,her
hadn't,anyone,waited,for,her
she,hadn't,meant,for,them,to,leave,her,here,alone
these,days,anything,could,happen,to,a,lone,woman,and,with,the,yankees,coming
she,jumped,as,a,slight,noise,sounded,and,turning,quickly,saw,crouched,by,the,banisters,her,forgotten,son,his,eyes,enormous,with,terror
he,tried,to,speak,but,his,throat,only,worked,silently
get,up,wade,hampton,she,commanded,swiftly
get,up,and,walk
mother,can't,carry,you,now
he,ran,to,her,like,a,small,frightened,animal,and,clutching,her,wide,skirt,buried,his,face,in,it
she,could,feel,his,small,hands,groping,through,the,folds,for,her,legs
she,started,down,the,stairs,each,step,hampered,by,wade's,dragging,hands,and,she,said,fiercely,turn,me,loose,wade
turn,me,loose,and,walk
but,the,child,only,clung,the,closer
as,she,reached,the,landing,the,whole,lower,floor,leaped,up,at,her
all,the,homely,well-loved,articles,of,furniture,seemed,to,whisper,good-by
good-by
a,sob,rose,in,her,throat
there,was,the,open,door,of,the,office,where,ellen,had,labored,so,diligently,and,she,could,glimpse,a,corner,of,the,old,secretary
there,was,the,dining,room,with,chairs,pushed,awry,and,food,still,on,the,plates
there,on,the,floor,were,the,rag,rugs,ellen,had,dyed,and,woven,herself
and,there,was,the,old,portrait,of,grandma,robillard,with,bosoms,half,bared,hair,piled,high,and,nostrils,cut,so,deeply,as,to,give,her,face,a,perpetual,well-bred,sneer
everything,which,had,been,part,of,her,earliest,memories,everything,bound,up,with,the,deepest,roots,in,her,good-by
good-by,scarlett,o'hara
the,yankees,would,burn,it,all,all
this,was,her,last,view,of,home,her,last,view,except,what,she,might,see,from,the,cover,of,the,woods,or,the,swamp,the,tall,chimneys,wrapped,in,smoke,the,roof,crashing,in,flame
i,can't,leave,you,she,thought,and,her,teeth,chattered,with,fear
i,can't,leave,you
pa,wouldn't,leave,you
he,told,them,they'd,have,to,burn,you,over,his,head
then,they'll,burn,you,over,my,head,for,i,can't,leave,you,either
you're,all,i've,got,left
with,the,decision,some,of,her,fear,fell,away,and,there,remained,only,a,congealed,feeling,in,her,breast,as,if,all,hope,and,fear,had,frozen
as,she,stood,there,she,heard,from,the,avenue,the,sound,of,many,horses',feet,the,jingle,of,bridle,bits,and,sabers,rattling,in,scabbards,and,a,harsh,voice,crying,a,command,dismount
swiftly,she,bent,to,the,child,beside,her,and,her,voice,was,urgent,but,oddly,gentle
turn,me,loose,wade,honey
you,run,down,the,stairs,quick,and,through,the,back,yard,toward,the,swamp
mammy,will,be,there,and,aunt,melly
run,quickly,darling,and,don't,be,afraid
at,the,change,in,her,tone,the,boy,looked,up,and,scarlett,was,appalled,at,the,look,in,his,eyes,like,a,baby,rabbit,in,a,trap
oh,mother,of,god
she,prayed
don't,let,him,have,a,convulsion
not,not,before,the,yankees
they,mustn't,know,we,are,afraid
and,as,the,child,only,gripped,her,skirt,the,tighter,she,said,clearly,be,a,little,man,wade
they're,only,a,passel,of,damn,yankees
and,she,went,down,the,steps,to,meet,them
sherman,was,marching,through,georgia,from,atlanta,to,the,sea
behind,him,lay,the,smoking,ruins,of,atlanta,to,which,the,torch,had,been,set,as,the,blue,army,tramped,out
before,him,lay,three,hundred,miles,of,territory,virtually,undefended,save,by,a,few,state,militia,and,the,old,men,and,young,boys,of,the,home,guard
here,lay,the,fertile,state,dotted,with,plantations,sheltering,the,women,and,children,the,very,old,and,the,negroes
in,a,swath,eighty,miles,wide,the,yankees,were,looting,and,burning
there,were,hundreds,of,homes,in,flames,hundreds,of,homes,resounding,with,their,footsteps
but,to,scarlett,watching,the,bluecoats,pour,into,the,front,hall,it,was,not,a,countrywide,affair
it,was,entirely,personal,a,malicious,action,aimed,directly,at,her,and,hers
she,stood,at,the,foot,of,the,stairs,the,baby,in,her,arms,wade,pressed,tightly,against,her,his,head,hidden,in,her,skirts,as,the,yankees,swarmed,through,the,house,pushing,roughly,past,her,up,the,stairs,dragging,furniture,onto,the,front,porch,running,bayonets,and,knives,into,upholstery,and,digging,inside,for,concealed,valuables
upstairs,they,were,ripping,open,mattresses,and,feather,beds,until,the,air,in,the,hall,was,thick,with,feathers,that,floated,softly,down,on,her,head
impotent,rage,quelled,what,little,fear,was,left,in,her,heart,as,she,stood,helpless,while,they,plundered,and,stole,and,ruined
the,sergeant,in,charge,was,a,bow-legged,grizzled,little,man,with,a,large,wad,of,tobacco,in,his,cheek
he,reached,scarlett,before,any,of,his,men,and,spitting,freely,on,the,floor,and,her,skirts,said,briefly
lemme,have,what,you,got,in,yore,hand,lady
she,had,forgotten,the,trinkets,she,had,intended,to,hide,and,with,a,sneer,which,she,hoped,was,as,eloquent,as,that,pictured,on,grandma,robillard's,face,she,flung,the,articles,to,the,floor,and,almost,enjoyed,the,rapacious,scramble,that,ensued
i'll,trouble,you,for,thet,ring,and,them,earbobs
scarlett,tucked,the,baby,more,securely,under,her,arm,so,that,he,hung,face,downward,crimson,and,screaming,and,removed,the,garnet,earrings,which,had,been,gerald's,wedding,present,to,ellen
then,she,stripped,off,the,large,sapphire,solitaire,which,charles,had,given,her,as,an,engagement,ring
don't,throw,um
hand,um,to,me,said,the,sergeant,putting,out,his,hands
them,bastards,got,enough,already
what,else,have,you,got
his,eyes,went,over,her,basque,sharply
for,a,moment,scarlett,went,faint,already,feeling,rough,hands,thrusting,themselves,into,her,bosom,fumbling,at,her,garters
that,is,all,but,i,suppose,it,is,customary,to,strip,your,victims
oh,i'll,take,your,word,said,the,sergeant,good-naturedly,spitting,again,as,he,turned,away
scarlett,righted,the,baby,and,tried,to,soothe,him,holding,her,hand,over,the,place,on,the,diaper,where,the,wallet,was,hidden,thanking,god,that,melanie,had,a,baby,and,that,baby,had,a,diaper
upstairs,she,could,hear,heavy,boots,trampling,the,protesting,screech,of,furniture,pulled,across,the,floor,the,crashing,of,china,and,mirrors,the,curses,when,nothing,of,value,appeared
from,the,yard,came,loud,cries,head,um,off
don't,let,um,get,away
and,the,despairing,squawks,of,the,hens,and,quacking,and,honking,of,the,ducks,and,geese
a,pang,went,through,her,as,she,heard,an,agonized,squealing,which,was,suddenly,stilled,by,a,pistol,shot,and,she,knew,that,the,sow,was,dead
damn,prissy
she,had,run,off,and,left,her
if,only,the,shoats,were,safe
if,only,the,family,had,gotten,safely,to,the,swamp
but,there,was,no,way,of,knowing
she,stood,quietly,in,the,hall,while,the,soldiers,boiled,about,her,shouting,and,cursing
wade's,fingers,were,in,her,skirt,in,a,terrified,grip
she,could,feel,his,body,shaking,as,he,pressed,against,her,but,she,could,not,bring,herself,to,speak,reassuringly,to,him
she,could,not,bring,herself,to,utter,any,word,to,the,yankees,either,of,pleading,protest,or,anger
she,could,only,thank,god,that,her,knees,still,had,the,strength,to,support,her,that,her,neck,was,still,strong,enough,to,hold,her,head,high
but,when,a,squad,of,bearded,men,came,lumbering,down,the,steps,laden,with,an,assortment,of,stolen,articles,and,she,saw,charles',sword,in,the,hands,of,one,she,did,cry,out
that,sword,was,wade's
it,had,been,his,father's,and,his,grandfather's,sword,and,scarlett,had,given,it,to,the,little,boy,on,his,last,birthday
they,had,made,quite,a,ceremony,of,it,and,melanie,had,cried,cried,with,tears,of,pride,and,sorrowful,memory,and,kissed,him,and,said,he,must,grow,up,to,be,a,brave,soldier,like,his,father,and,his,grandfather
wade,was,very,proud,of,it,and,often,climbed,upon,the,table,beneath,where,it,hung,to,pat,it
scarlett,could,endure,seeing,her,own,possessions,going,out,of,the,house,in,hateful,alien,hands,but,not,this,not,her,little,boy's,pride
wade,peering,from,the,protection,of,her,skirts,at,the,sound,of,her,cry,found,speech,and,courage,in,a,mighty,sob
stretching,out,one,hand,he,cried
mine

the,sergeant,pleased,at,his,promotion,stepped,forward
lemme,see,thet,sword,bub,he,said
reluctantly,the,little,trooper,handed,it,to,him
it's,got,a,solid-gold,hilt,he,said
the,sergeant,turned,it,in,his,hand,held,the,hilt,up,to,the,sunlight,to,read,the,engraved,inscription
'to,colonel,william,r,hamilton,',he,deciphered
'from,his,staff

well,he,can,have,it,said,the,sergeant,who,was,satisfied,enough,with,the,jewelry,and,trinkets,tied,up,in,his,handkerchief
but,it's,got,a,solid-gold,hilt,insisted,the,little,trooper
we'll,leave,her,thet,to,remember,us,by,grinned,the,sergeant
scarlett,took,the,sword,not,even,saying,thank,you
why,should,she,thank,these,thieves,for,returning,her,own,property,to,her
she,held,the,sword,against,her,while,the,little,cavalryman,argued,and,wrangled,with,the,sergeant
by,god,i'll,give,these,damn,rebels,something,to,remember,me,by,shouted,the,private,finally,when,the,sergeant,losing,his,good,nature,told,him,to,go,to,hell,and,not,talk,back
the,little,man,went,charging,toward,the,back,of,the,house,and,scarlett,breathed,more,easily
they,had,said,nothing,about,burning,the,house
they,hadn't,told,her,to,leave,so,they,could,fire,it
perhaps,perhaps,the,men,came,rambling,into,the,hall,from,the,upstairs,and,the,out,of,doors
anything
questioned,the,sergeant
one,hog,and,a,few,chickens,and,ducks
some,corn,and,a,few,yams,and,beans

i'd,forgot
scarlett,saw,it,was,ellen's,gold,thimble,that,he,held
how,often,she,had,seen,it,gleaming,in,and,out,of,ellen's,fancy,work
the,sight,of,it,brought,back,too,many,hurting,memories,of,the,slender,hand,which,had,worn,it
there,it,lay,in,this,stranger's,calloused,dirty,palm,and,soon,it,would,find,its,way,north,and,onto,the,finger,of,some,yankee,woman,who,would,be,proud,to,wear,stolen,things
ellen's,thimble
scarlett,dropped,her,head,so,the,enemy,could,not,see,her,cry,and,the,tears,fell,slowly,down,on,the,baby's,head
through,the,blur,she,saw,the,men,moving,toward,the,doorway,heard,the,sergeant,calling,commands,in,a,loud,rough,voice
they,were,going,and,tara,was,safe,but,with,the,pain,of,ellen's,memory,on,her,she,was,hardly,glad
the,sound,of,the,banging,sabers,and,horses',hooves,brought,little,relief,and,she,stood,suddenly,weak,and,nerveless,as,they,moved,off,down,the,avenue,every,man,laden,with,stolen,goods,clothing,blankets,pictures,hens,and,ducks,the,sow
then,to,her,nostrils,was,borne,the,smell,of,smoke,and,she,turned,too,weak,with,lessening,strain,to,care,about,the,cotton
through,the,open,windows,of,the,dining,room,she,saw,smoke,drifting,lazily,out,of,the,negro,cabins
there,went,the,cotton
there,went,the,tax,money,and,part,of,the,money,which,was,to,see,them,through,this,bitter,winter
there,was,nothing,she,could,do,about,it,either,except,watch
she,had,seen,fires,in,cotton,before,and,she,knew,how,difficult,they,were,to,put,out,even,with,many,men,laboring,at,it
thank,god,the,quarters,were,so,far,from,the,house
thank,god,there,was,no,wind,today,to,carry,sparks,to,the,roof,of,tara
suddenly,she,swung,about,rigid,as,a,pointer,and,stared,with,horror-struck,eyes,down,the,hall,down,the,covered,passageway,toward,the,kitchen
there,was,smoke,coming,from,the,kitchen
somewhere,between,the,hall,and,the,kitchen,she,laid,the,baby,down
somewhere,she,flung,off,wade's,grip,slinging,him,against,the,wall
she,burst,into,the,smoke-filled,kitchen,and,reeled,back,coughing,her,eyes,streaming,tears,from,the,smoke
again,she,plunged,in,her,skirt,held,over,her,nose
the,room,was,dark,lit,as,it,was,by,one,small,window,and,so,thick,with,smoke,that,she,was,blinded,but,she,could,hear,the,hiss,and,crackle,of,flames
dashing,a,hand,across,her,eyes,she,peered,squinting,and,saw,thin,lines,of,flame,creeping,across,the,kitchen,floor,toward,the,walls
someone,had,scattered,the,blazing,logs,in,the,open,fireplace,across,the,whole,room,and,the,tinder-dry,pine,floor,was,sucking,in,the,flames,and,spewing,them,up,like,water
back,she,rushed,to,the,dining,room,and,snatched,a,rag,rug,from,the,floor,spilling,two,chairs,with,a,crash
i'll,never,beat,it,out,never,never
oh,god,if,only,there,was,someone,to,help
tara,is,gone,gone
oh,god
this,was,what,that,little,wretch,meant,when,he,said,he'd,give,me,something,to,remember,him,by
oh,if,i'd,only,let,him,have,the,sword
in,the,hallway,she,passed,her,son,lying,in,the,corner,with,his,sword
his,eyes,were,closed,and,his,face,had,a,look,of,slack,unearthly,peace
my,god
he's,dead
they've,frightened,him,to,death
she,thought,in,agony,but,she,raced,by,him,to,the,bucket,of,drinking,water,which,always,stood,in,the,passageway,by,the,kitchen,door
she,soused,the,end,of,the,rug,into,the,bucket,and,drawing,a,deep,breath,plunged,again,into,the,smoke-filled,room,slamming,the,door,behind,her
for,an,eternity,she,reeled,and,coughed,beating,the,rug,against,the,lines,of,fire,that,shot,swiftly,beyond,her
twice,her,long,skirt,took,fire,and,she,slapped,it,out,with,her,hands
she,could,smell,the,sickening,smell,of,her,hair,scorching,as,it,came,loose,from,its,pins,and,swept,about,her,shoulders
the,flames,raced,ever,beyond,her,toward,the,walls,of,the,covered,runway,fiery,snakes,that,writhed,and,leaped,and,exhaustion,sweeping,her,she,knew,that,it,was,hopeless
then,the,door,swung,open,and,the,sucking,draft,flung,the,flames,higher
it,closed,with,a,bang,and,in,the,swirling,smoke,scarlett,half,blind,saw,melanie,stamping,her,feet,on,the,flames,beating,at,them,with,something,dark,and,heavy
she,saw,her,staggering,heard,her,coughing,caught,a,lightning-flash,glimpse,of,her,set,white,face,and,eyes,narrow,to,slits,against,the,smoke,saw,her,small,body,curving,back,and,forth,as,she,swung,her,rug,up,and,down
for,another,eternity,they,fought,and,swayed,side,by,side,and,scarlett,could,see,that,the,lines,of,fire,were,shortening
then,suddenly,melanie,turned,toward,her,and,with,a,cry,hit,her,across,the,shoulders,with,all,her,might
scarlett,went,down,in,a,whirlwind,of,smoke,and,darkness
when,she,opened,her,eyes,she,was,lying,on,the,back,porch,her,head,pillowed,comfortably,on,melanie's,lap,and,the,afternoon,sunlight,was,shining,on,her,face
her,hands,face,and,shoulders,smarted,intolerably,from,burns
smoke,was,still,rolling,from,the,quarters,enveloping,the,cabins,in,thick,clouds,and,the,smell,of,burning,cotton,was,strong
scarlett,saw,wisps,of,smoke,drifting,from,the,kitchen,and,she,stirred,frantically,to,rise
but,she,was,pushed,back,as,melanie's,calm,voice,said,lie,still,dear
the,fire's,out
she,lay,quiet,for,a,moment,eyes,closed,sighing,with,relief,and,heard,the,slobbery,gurgle,of,the,baby,near,by,and,the,reassuring,sound,of,wade's,hiccoughing
so,he,wasn't,dead,thank,god
she,opened,her,eyes,and,looked,up,into,melanie's,face
her,curls,were,singed,her,face,black,with,smut,but,her,eyes,were,sparkling,with,excitement,and,she,was,smiling
you,look,like,a,nigger,murmured,scarlett,burrowing,her,head,wearily,into,its,soft,pillow
and,you,look,like,the,end,man,in,a,minstrel,show,replied,melanie,equably
why,did,you,have,to,hit,me
because,my,darling,your,back,was,on,fire
i,didn't,dream,you'd,faint,though,the,lord,knows,you've,had,enough,today,to,kill,you
i,came,back,as,soon,as,i,got,the,stock,safe,in,the,woods
i,nearly,died,thinking,about,you,and,the,baby,alone
did,the,yankees,harm,you
if,you,mean,did,they,rape,me,no,said,scarlett,groaning,as,she,tried,to,sit,up
though,melanie's,lap,was,soft,the,porch,on,which,she,was,lying,was,far,from,comfortable
but,they've,stolen,everything,everything
we've,lost,everything,well,what,is,there,to,look,so,happy,about
we,haven't,lost,each,other,and,our,babies,are,all,right,and,we,have,a,roof,over,our,heads,said,melanie,and,there,was,a,lilt,in,her,voice
and,that's,all,anyone,can,hope,for,now
goodness,but,beau,is,wet
i,suppose,the,yankees,even,stole,his,extra,diapers
he,scarlett,what,on,earth,is,in,his,diaper
she,thrust,a,suddenly,frightened,hand,down,the,baby's,back,and,brought,up,the,wallet
for,a,moment,she,looked,at,it,as,if,she,had,never,seen,it,before,and,then,she,began,to,laugh,peal,on,peal,of,mirth,that,had,in,it,no,hint,of,hysteria
nobody,but,you,would,ever,have,thought,of,it,she,cried,and,flinging,her,arms,around,scarlett's,neck,she,kissed,her
you,are,the,beatenest,sister,i,ever,had
scarlett,permitted,the,embrace,because,she,was,too,tired,to,struggle,because,the,words,of,praise,brought,balm,to,her,spirit,and,because,in,the,dark,smoke-filled,kitchen,there,had,been,born,a,greater,respect,for,her,sister-in-law,a,closer,feeling,of,comradeship
i'll,say,this,for,her,she,thought,grudgingly,she's,always,there,when,you,need,her

the,rutted,red,roads,were,frozen,to,flintiness,and,hunger,rode,the,winds,through,georgia
scarlett,recalled,bitterly,her,conversation,with,grandma,fontaine
on,that,afternoon,two,months,ago,which,now,seemed,years,in,the,past,she,had,told,the,old,lady,she,had,already,known,the,worst,which,could,possibly,happen,to,her,and,she,had,spoken,from,the,bottom,of,her,heart
now,that,remark,sounded,like,schoolgirl,hyperbole
before,sherman's,men,came,through,tara,the,second,time,she,had,her,small,riches,of,food,and,money,she,had,neighbors,more,fortunate,than,she,and,she,had,the,cotton,which,would,tide,her,over,until,spring
now,the,cotton,was,gone,the,food,was,gone,the,money,was,of,no,use,to,her,for,there,was,no,food,to,buy,with,it,and,the,neighbors,were,in,worse,plight,than,she
at,least,she,had,the,cow,and,the,calf,a,few,shoats,and,the,horse,and,the,neighbors,had,nothing,but,the,little,they,had,been,able,to,hide,in,the,woods,and,bury,in,the,ground

the,wooden,wing,of,mimosa,had,burned,and,only,the,thick,resistant,stucco,of,the,main,house,and,the,frenzied,work,of,the,fontaine,women,and,their,slaves,with,wet,blankets,and,quilts,had,saved,it
the,calverts',house,had,again,been,spared,due,to,the,intercession,of,hilton,the,yankee,overseer,but,there,was,not,a,head,of,livestock,not,a,fowl,not,an,ear,of,corn,left,on,the,place
at,tara,and,throughout,the,county,the,problem,was,food
most,of,the,families,had,nothing,at,all,but,the,remains,of,their,yam,crops,and,their,peanuts,and,such,game,as,they,could,catch,in,the,woods
what,they,had,each,shared,with,less,fortunate,friends,as,they,had,done,in,more,prosperous,days
but,the,time,soon,came,when,there,was,nothing,to,share
at,tara,they,ate,rabbit,and,possum,and,catfish,if,pork,was,lucky
on,other,days,a,small,amount,of,milk,hickory,nuts,roasted,acorns,and,yams
they,were,always,hungry
to,scarlett,it,seemed,that,at,every,turn,she,met,outstretched,hands,pleading,eyes
the,sight,of,them,drove,her,almost,to,madness,for,she,was,as,hungry,as,they
she,ordered,the,calf,killed,because,he,drank,so,much,of,the,precious,milk,and,that,night,everyone,ate,so,much,fresh,veal,all,of,them,were,ill,she,knew,that,she,should,kill,one,of,the,shoats,but,she,put,it,off,from,day,to,day,hoping,to,raise,them,to,maturity
they,were,so,small
there,would,be,so,little,of,them,to,eat,if,they,were,killed,now,and,so,much,more,if,they,could,be,saved,a,little,longer
nightly,she,debated,with,melanie,the,advisability,of,sending,pork,abroad,on,the,horse,with,some,greenbacks,to,try,to,buy,food
but,the,fear,that,the,horse,might,be,captured,and,the,money,taken,from,pork,deterred,them
they,did,not,know,where,the,yankees,were
they,might,be,a,thousand,miles,away,or,only,across,the,river
once,scarlett,in,desperation,started,to,ride,out,herself,to,search,for,food,but,the,hysterical,outbursts,of,the,whole,family,fearful,of,the,yankees,made,her,abandon,the,plan
pork,foraged,far,at,times,not,coming,home,all,night,and,scarlett,did,not,ask,him,where,he,went
sometimes,he,returned,with,game,sometimes,with,a,few,ears,of,corn,a,bag,of,dried,peas
once,he,brought,home,a,rooster,which,he,said,he,found,in,the,woods
the,family,ate,it,with,relish,but,a,sense,of,guilt,knowing,very,well,pork,had,stolen,it,as,he,had,stolen,the,peas,and,corn
one,night,soon,after,this,he,tapped,on,scarlett's,door,long,after,the,house,was,asleep,and,sheepishly,exhibited,a,leg,peppered,with,small,shot
as,she,bandaged,it,for,him,he,explained,awkwardly,that,when,attempting,to,get,into,a,hen,coop,at,fayetteville,he,had,been,discovered
scarlett,did,not,ask,whose,hen,coop,but,patted,pork's,shoulder,gently,tears,in,her,eyes
negroes,were,provoking,sometimes,and,stupid,and,lazy,but,there,was,loyalty,in,them,that,money,couldn't,buy,a,feeling,of,oneness,with,their,white,folks,which,made,them,risk,their,lives,to,keep,food,on,the,table
in,other,days,pork's,pilferings,would,have,been,a,serious,matter,probably,calling,for,a,whipping
in,other,days,she,would,have,been,forced,at,least,to,reprimand,him,severely
always,remember,dear,ellen,had,said,you,are,responsible,for,the,moral,as,well,as,the,physical,welfare,of,the,darkies,god,has,intrusted,to,your,care
you,must,realize,that,they,are,like,children,and,must,be,guarded,from,themselves,like,children,and,you,must,always,set,them,a,good,example
but,now,scarlett,pushed,that,admonition,into,the,back,of,her,mind
that,she,was,encouraging,theft,and,perhaps,theft,from,people,worse,off,than,she,was,no,longer,a,matter,for,conscience
in,fact,the,morals,of,the,affair,weighed,lightly,upon,her
instead,of,punishment,or,reproof,she,only,regretted,he,had,been,shot
you,must,be,more,careful,pork
we,don't,want,to,lose,you
what,would,we,do,without,you
you've,been,mighty,good,and,faithful,and,when,we,get,some,money,again,i'm,going,to,buy,you,a,big,gold,watch,and,engrave,on,it,something,out,of,the,bible
'well,done,good,and,faithful,servant,'
pork,beamed,under,the,praise,and,gingerly,rubbed,his,bandaged,leg
dat,soun',mighty,fine,miss,scarlett
w'en,you,speckin',ter,git,dat,money
i,don't,know,pork,but,i'm,going,to,get,it,some,time,somehow
she,bent,on,him,an,unseeing,glance,that,was,so,passionately,bitter,he,stirred,uneasily,some,day,when,this,war,is,over,i'm,going,to,have,lots,of,money,and,when,i,do,i'll,never,be,hungry,or,cold,again
none,of,us,will,ever,be,hungry,or,cold
we'll,all,wear,fine,clothes,and,have,fried,chicken,every,day,and
then,she,stopped
the,strictest,rule,at,tara,one,which,she,herself,had,made,and,which,she,rigidly,enforced,was,that,no,one,should,ever,talk,of,the,fine,meals,they,had,eaten,in,the,past,or,what,they,would,eat,now,if,they,had,the,opportunity
pork,slipped,from,the,room,as,she,remained,staring,moodily,into,the,distance
in,the,old,days,now,dead,and,gone,life,had,been,so,complex,so,full,of,intricate,and,complicated,problems
there,had,been,the,problem,of,trying,to,win,ashley's,love,and,trying,to,keep,a,dozen,other,beaux,dangling,and,unhappy
there,had,been,small,breaches,of,conduct,to,be,concealed,from,her,elders,jealous,girls,to,be,flouted,or,placated,styles,of,dresses,and,materials,to,be,chosen,different,coiffures,to,be,tried,and,oh,so,many,many,other,matters,to,be,decided
now,life,was,so,amazingly,simple
now,all,that,mattered,was,food,enough,to,keep,off,starvation,clothing,enough,to,prevent,freezing,and,a,roof,overhead,which,did,not,leak,too,much
it,was,during,these,days,that,scarlett,dreamed,and,dreamed,again,the,nightmare,which,was,to,haunt,her,for,years
it,was,always,the,same,dream,the,details,never,varied,but,the,terror,of,it,mounted,each,time,it,came,to,her,and,the,fear,of,experiencing,it,again,troubled,even,her,waking,hours
she,remembered,so,well,the,incidents,of,the,day,when,she,had,first,dreamed,it
cold,rain,had,fallen,for,days,and,the,house,was,chill,with,drafts,and,dampness
the,logs,in,the,fireplace,were,wet,and,smoky,and,gave,little,heat
there,had,been,nothing,to,eat,except,milk,since,breakfast,for,the,yams,were,exhausted,and,pork's,snares,and,fishlines,had,yielded,nothing
one,of,the,shoats,would,have,to,be,killed,the,next,day,if,they,were,to,eat,at,all
strained,and,hungry,faces,black,and,white,were,staring,at,her,mutely,asking,her,to,provide,food
she,would,have,to,risk,losing,the,horse,and,send,pork,out,to,buy,something
and,to,make,matters,worse,wade,was,ill,with,a,sore,throat,and,a,raging,fever,and,there,was,neither,doctor,nor,medicine,for,him
hungry,weary,with,watching,her,child,scarlett,left,him,to,melanie's,care,for,a,while,and,lay,down,on,her,bed,to,nap
her,feet,icy,she,twisted,and,turned,unable,to,sleep,weighed,down,with,fear,and,despair
again,and,again,she,thought,what,shall,i,do
where,shall,i,turn
isn't,there,anybody,in,the,world,who,can,help,me
where,had,all,the,security,of,the,world,gone
why,wasn't,there,someone,some,strong,wise,person,to,take,the,burdens,from,her
she,wasn't,made,to,carry,them
she,did,not,know,how,to,carry,them
and,then,she,fell,into,an,uneasy,doze
she,was,in,a,wild,strange,country,so,thick,with,swirling,mist,she,could,not,see,her,hand,before,her,face
the,earth,beneath,her,feet,was,uneasy
it,was,a,haunted,land,still,with,a,terrible,stillness,and,she,was,lost,in,it,lost,and,terrified,as,a,child,in,the,night
she,was,bitterly,cold,and,hungry,and,so,fearful,of,what,lurked,in,the,mists,about,her,that,she,tried,to,scream,and,could,not
there,were,things,in,the,fog,reaching,out,fingers,to,pluck,at,her,skirt,to,drag,her,down,into,the,uneasy,quaking,earth,on,which,she,stood,silent,relentless,spectral,hands
then,she,knew,that,somewhere,in,the,opaque,gloom,about,her,there,was,shelter,help,a,haven,of,refuge,and,warmth
but,where,was,it
could,she,reach,it,before,the,hands,clutched,her,and,dragged,her,down,into,the,quicksands
suddenly,she,was,running,running,through,the,mist,like,a,mad,thing,crying,and,screaming,throwing,out,her,arms,to,clutch,only,empty,air,and,wet,mist
where,was,the,haven
it,eluded,her,but,it,was,there,hidden,somewhere
if,she,could,only,reach,it
if,she,could,only,reach,it,she,would,be,safe
but,terror,was,weakening,her,legs,hunger,making,her,faint
she,gave,one,despairing,cry,and,awoke,to,find,melanie's,worried,face,above,her,and,melanie's,hand,shaking,her,to,wakefulness
the,dream,returned,again,and,again,whenever,she,went,to,sleep,with,an,empty,stomach
and,that,was,frequently,enough
it,so,frightened,her,that,she,feared,to,sleep,although,she,feverishly,told,herself,there,was,nothing,in,such,a,dream,to,be,afraid,of
there,was,nothing,in,a,dream,about,fog,to,scare,her,so
nothing,at,all,yet,the,thought,of,dropping,off,into,that,mist-filled,country,so,terrified,her,she,began,sleeping,with,melanie,who,would,wake,her,up,when,her,moaning,and,twitching,revealed,that,she,was,again,in,the,clutch,of,the,dream
under,the,strain,she,grew,white,and,thin
the,pretty,roundness,left,her,face,throwing,her,cheek,bones,into,prominence,emphasizing,her,slanting,green,eyes,and,giving,her,the,look,of,a,prowling,hungry,cat
daytime,is,enough,like,a,nightmare,without,my,dreaming,things,she,thought,desperately,and,began,hoarding,her,daily,ration,to,eat,it,just,before,she,went,to,sleep
at,christmas,time,frank,kennedy,and,a,small,troop,from,the,commissary,department,jogged,up,to,tara,on,a,futile,hunt,for,grain,and,animals,for,the,army
they,were,a,ragged,and,ruffianly,appearing,crew,mounted,on,lame,and,heaving,horses,which,obviously,were,in,too,bad,condition,to,be,used,for,more,active,service
like,their,animals,the,men,had,been,invalided,out,of,the,front-line,forces,and,except,for,frank,all,of,them,had,an,arm,missing,or,an,eye,gone,or,stiffened,joints
most,of,them,wore,blue,overcoats,of,captured,yankees,and,for,a,brief,instant,of,horror,those,at,tara,thought,sherman's,men,had,returned
they,stayed,the,night,on,the,plantation,sleeping,on,the,floor,in,the,parlor,luxuriating,as,they,stretched,themselves,on,the,velvet,rug,for,it,had,been,weeks,since,they,had,slept,under,a,roof,or,on,anything,softer,than,pine,needles,and,hard,earth
for,all,their,dirty,beards,and,tatters,they,were,a,well-bred,crowd,full,of,pleasant,small,talk,jokes,and,compliments,and,very,glad,to,be,spending,christmas,eve,in,a,big,house,surrounded,by,pretty,women,as,they,had,been,accustomed,to,do,in,days,long,past
they,refused,to,be,serious,about,the,war,told,outrageous,lies,to,make,the,girls,laugh,and,brought,to,the,bare,and,looted,house,the,first,lightness,the,first,hint,of,festivity,it,had,known,in,many,a,day
it's,almost,like,the,old,days,when,we,had,house,parties,isn't,it
whispered,suellen,happily,to,scarlett
suellen,was,raised,to,the,skies,by,having,a,beau,of,her,own,in,the,house,again,and,she,could,hardly,take,her,eyes,off,frank,kennedy
scarlett,was,surprised,to,see,that,suellen,could,be,almost,pretty,despite,the,thinness,which,had,persisted,since,her,illness
her,cheeks,were,flushed,and,there,was,a,soft,luminous,look,in,her,eyes
she,really,must,care,about,him,thought,scarlett,in,contempt
and,i,guess,she'd,be,almost,human,if,she,ever,had,a,husband,of,her,own,even,if,her,husband,was,old,fuss-budget,frank
carreen,had,brightened,a,little,too,and,some,of,the,sleep-walking,look,left,her,eyes,that,night
she,had,found,that,one,of,the,men,had,known,brent,tarleton,and,had,been,with,him,the,day,he,was,killed,and,she,promised,herself,a,long,private,talk,with,him,after,supper
at,supper,melanie,surprised,them,all,by,forcing,herself,out,of,her,timidity,and,being,almost,vivacious
she,laughed,and,joked,and,almost,but,not,quite,coquetted,with,a,one-eyed,soldier,who,gladly,repaid,her,efforts,with,extravagant,gallantries
scarlett,knew,the,effort,this,involved,both,mentally,and,physically,for,melanie,suffered,torments,of,shyness,in,the,presence,of,anything,male
moreover,she,was,far,from,well
she,insisted,she,was,strong,and,did,more,work,even,than,dilcey,but,scarlett,knew,she,was,sick
when,she,lifted,things,her,face,went,white,and,she,had,a,way,of,sitting,down,suddenly,after,exertions,as,if,her,legs,would,no,longer,support,her
but,tonight,she,like,suellen,and,carreen,was,doing,everything,possible,to,make,the,soldiers,enjoy,their,christmas,eve
scarlett,alone,took,no,pleasure,in,the,guests
the,troop,had,added,their,ration,of,parched,corn,and,side,meat,to,the,supper,of,dried,peas,stewed,dried,apples,and,peanuts,which,mammy,set,before,them,and,they,declared,it,was,the,best,meal,they,had,had,in,months
scarlett,watched,them,eat,and,she,was,uneasy
she,not,only,begrudged,them,every,mouthful,they,ate,but,she,was,on,tenterhooks,lest,they,discover,somehow,that,pork,had,slaughtered,one,of,the,shoats,the,day,before
it,now,hung,in,the,pantry,and,she,had,grimly,promised,her,household,that,she,would,scratch,out,the,eyes,of,anyone,who,mentioned,the,shoat,to,their,guests,or,the,presence,of,the,dead,pig's,sisters,and,brothers,safe,in,their,pen,in,the,swamp
these,hungry,men,could,devour,the,whole,shoat,at,one,meal,and,if,they,knew,of,the,live,hogs,they,could,commandeer,them,for,the,army
she,was,alarmed,too,for,the,cow,and,the,horse,and,wished,they,were,hidden,in,the,swamp,instead,of,tied,in,the,woods,at,the,bottom,of,the,pasture
if,the,commissary,took,her,stock,tara,could,not,possibly,live,through,the,winter
there,would,be,no,way,of,replacing,them
as,to,what,the,army,would,eat,she,did,not,care
let,the,army,feed,the,army,if,it,could
it,was,hard,enough,for,her,to,feed,her,own
the,men,added,as,dessert,some,ramrod,rolls,from,their,knapsacks,and,this,was,the,first,time,scarlett,had,ever,seen,this,confederate,article,of,diet,about,which,there,were,almost,as,many,jokes,as,about,lice
they,were,charred,spirals,of,what,appeared,to,be,wood
the,men,dared,her,to,take,a,bite,and,when,she,did,she,discovered,that,beneath,the,smoke-blackened,surface,was,unsalted,corn,bread
the,soldiers,mixed,their,ration,of,corn,meal,with,water,and,salt,too,when,they,could,get,it,wrapped,the,thick,paste,about,their,ramrods,and,roasted,the,mess,over,camp,fires
it,was,as,hard,as,rock,candy,and,as,tasteless,as,sawdust,and,after,one,bite,scarlett,hastily,handed,it,back,amid,roars,of,laughter
she,met,melanie's,eyes,and,the,same,thought,was,plain,in,both,faces
how,can,they,go,on,fighting,if,they,have,only,this,stuff,to,eat
the,meal,was,gay,enough,and,even,gerald,presiding,absently,at,the,head,of,the,table,managed,to,evoke,from,the,back,of,his,dim,mind,some,of,the,manner,of,a,host,and,an,uncertain,smile
the,men,talked,the,women,smiled,and,flattered,but,scarlett,turning,suddenly,to,frank,kennedy,to,ask,him,news,of,miss,pittypat,caught,an,expression,on,his,face,which,made,her,forget,what,she,intended,to,say
his,eyes,had,left,suellen's,and,were,wandering,about,the,room,to,gerald's,childlike,puzzled,eyes,to,the,floor,bare,of,rugs,to,the,mantelpiece,denuded,of,its,ornaments,the,sagging,springs,and,torn,upholstery,into,which,yankee,bayonets,had,ripped,the,cracked,mirror,above,the,sideboard,the,unfaded,squares,on,the,wall,where,pictures,had,hung,before,the,looters,came,the,scant,table,service,the,decently,mended,but,old,dresses,of,the,girls,the,flour,sack,which,had,been,made,into,a,kilt,for,wade
frank,was,remembering,the,tara,he,had,known,before,the,war,and,on,his,face,was,a,hurt,look,a,look,of,tired,impotent,anger
he,loved,suellen,liked,her,sisters,respected,gerald,and,had,a,genuine,fondness,for,the,plantation
since,sherman,had,swept,through,georgia,frank,had,seen,many,appalling,sights,as,he,rode,about,the,state,trying,to,collect,supplies,but,nothing,had,gone,to,his,heart,as,tara,did,now
he,wanted,to,do,something,for,the,o'haras,especially,suellen,and,there,was,nothing,he,could,do
he,was,unconsciously,wagging,his,whiskered,head,in,pity,and,clicking,his,tongue,against,his,teeth,when,scarlett,caught,his,eye
he,saw,the,flame,of,indignant,pride,in,them,and,he,dropped,his,gaze,quickly,to,his,plate,in,embarrassment
the,girls,were,hungry,for,news
there,had,been,no,mail,service,since,atlanta,fell,now,four,months,past,and,they,were,in,complete,ignorance,as,to,where,the,yankees,were,how,the,confederate,army,was,faring,what,had,happened,to,atlanta,and,to,old,friends
frank,whose,work,took,him,all,over,the,section,was,as,good,as,a,newspaper,better,even,for,he,was,kin,to,or,knew,almost,everyone,from,macon,north,to,atlanta,and,he,could,supply,bits,of,interesting,personal,gossip,which,the,papers,always,omitted
to,cover,his,embarrassment,at,being,caught,by,scarlett,he,plunged,hastily,into,a,recital,of,news
the,confederates,he,told,them,had,retaken,atlanta,after,sherman,marched,out,but,it,was,a,valueless,prize,as,sherman,had,burned,it,completely
but,i,thought,atlanta,burned,the,night,i,left,cried,scarlett,bewildered
i,thought,our,boys,burned,it
oh,no,miss,scarlett
cried,frank,shocked
we'd,never,burn,one,of,our,own,towns,with,our,own,folks,in,it
what,you,saw,burning,was,the,warehouses,and,the,supplies,we,didn't,want,the,yankees,to,capture,and,the,foundries,and,the,ammunition
but,that,was,all
when,sherman,took,the,town,the,houses,and,stores,were,standing,there,as,pretty,as,you,please
and,he,quartered,his,men,in,them
but,what,happened,to,the,people
did,he,did,he,kill,them
he,killed,some,but,not,with,bullets,said,the,one-eyed,soldier,grimly
soon's,he,marched,into,atlanta,he,told,the,mayor,that,all,the,people,in,town,would,have,to,move,out,every,living,soul
and,there,were,plenty,of,old,folks,that,couldn't,stand,the,trip,and,sick,folks,that,ought,not,to,have,been,moved,and,ladies,who,were,well,ladies,who,hadn't,ought,to,be,moved,either
and,he,moved,them,out,in,the,biggest,rainstorm,you,ever,saw,hundreds,and,hundreds,of,them,and,dumped,them,in,the,woods,near,rough,and,ready,and,sent,word,to,general,hood,to,come,and,get,them
and,a,plenty,of,the,folks,died,of,pneumonia,and,not,being,able,to,stand,that,sort,of,treatment
oh,but,why,did,he,do,that
they,couldn't,have,done,him,any,harm,cried,melanie
he,said,he,wanted,the,town,to,rest,his,men,and,horses,in,said,frank
and,he,rested,them,there,till,the,middle,of,november,and,then,he,lit,out
and,he,set,fire,to,the,whole,town,when,he,left,and,burned,everything
oh,surely,not,everything
cried,the,girls,in,dismay
it,was,inconceivable,that,the,bustling,town,they,knew,so,full,of,people,so,crowded,with,soldiers,was,gone
all,the,lovely,homes,beneath,shady,trees,all,the,big,stores,and,the,fine,hotels,surely,they,couldn't,be,gone
melanie,seemed,ready,to,burst,into,tears,for,she,had,been,born,there,and,knew,no,other,home
scarlett's,heart,sank,because,she,had,come,to,love,the,place,second,only,to,tara
well,almost,everything,frank,amended,hastily,disturbed,by,the,expressions,on,their,faces
he,tried,to,look,cheerful,for,he,did,not,believe,in,upsetting,ladies
upset,ladies,always,upset,him,and,made,him,feel,helpless
he,could,not,bring,himself,to,tell,them,the,worst
let,them,find,out,from,some,one,else
he,could,not,tell,them,what,the,army,saw,when,it,marched,back,into,atlanta,the,acres,and,acres,of,chimneys,standing,blackly,above,ashes,piles,of,half-burned,rubbish,and,tumbled,heaps,of,brick,clogging,the,streets,old,trees,dying,from,fire,their,charred,limbs,tumbling,to,the,ground,in,the,cold,wind
he,remembered,how,the,sight,had,turned,him,sick,remembered,the,bitter,curses,of,the,confederates,when,they,saw,the,remains,of,the,town
he,hoped,the,ladies,would,never,hear,of,the,horrors,of,the,looted,cemetery,for,they'd,never,get,over,that
charlie,hamilton,and,melanie's,mother,and,father,were,buried,there
the,sight,of,that,cemetery,still,gave,frank,nightmares
hoping,to,find,jewelry,buried,with,the,dead,the,yankee,soldiers,had,broken,open,vaults,dug,up,graves
they,had,robbed,the,bodies,stripped,from,the,coffins,gold,and,silver,name,plates,silver,trimmings,and,silver,handles
the,skeletons,and,corpses,flung,helterskelter,among,their,splintered,caskets,lay,exposed,and,so,pitiful
and,frank,couldn't,tell,them,about,the,dogs,and,the,cats
ladies,set,such,a,store,by,pets
but,the,thousands,of,starving,animals,left,homeless,when,their,masters,had,been,so,rudely,evacuated,had,shocked,him,almost,as,much,as,the,cemetery,for,frank,loved,cats,and,dogs
the,animals,had,been,frightened,cold,ravenous,wild,as,forest,creatures,the,strong,attacking,the,weak,the,weak,waiting,for,the,weaker,to,die,so,they,could,eat,them
and,above,the,ruined,town,the,buzzards,splotched,the,wintry,sky,with,graceful,sinister,bodies
frank,cast,about,in,his,mind,for,some,mitigating,information,that,would,make,the,ladies,feel,better
there's,some,houses,still,standing,he,said,houses,that,set,on,big,lots,away,from,other,houses,and,didn't,catch,fire
and,the,churches,and,the,masonic,hall,are,left
and,a,few,stores,too
but,the,business,section,and,all,along,the,railroad,tracks,and,at,five,points,well,ladies,that,part,of,town,is,flat,on,the,ground
then,cried,scarlett,bitterly,that,warehouse,charlie,left,me,down,on,the,tracks,it's,gone,too
if,it,was,near,the,tracks,it's,gone,but,suddenly,he,smiled
why,hadn't,he,thought,of,it,before
cheer,up,ladies
your,aunt,pitty's,house,is,still,standing
it's,kind,of,damaged,but,there,it,is
oh,how,did,it,escape
well,it's,made,of,brick,and,it's,got,about,the,only,slate,roof,in,atlanta,and,that,kept,the,sparks,from,setting,it,afire,i,guess
and,then,it's,about,the,last,house,on,the,north,end,of,town,and,the,fire,wasn't,so,bad,over,that,way
of,course,the,yankees,quartered,there,tore,it,up,aplenty
they,even,burned,the,baseboard,and,the,mahogany,stair,rail,for,firewood,but,shucks
it's,in,good,shape
when,i,saw,miss,pitty,last,week,in,macon
you,saw,her
how,is,she
just,fine
just,fine
when,i,told,her,her,house,was,still,standing,she,made,up,her,mind,to,come,home,right,away
that,is,if,that,old,darky,peter,will,let,her,come
lots,of,the,atlanta,people,have,already,come,back,because,they,got,nervous,about,macon
sherman,didn't,take,macon,but,everybody,is,afraid,wilson's,raiders,will,get,there,soon,and,he's,worse,than,sherman
but,how,silly,of,them,to,come,back,if,there,aren't,any,houses
where,do,they,live
miss,scarlett,they're,living,in,tents,and,shacks,and,log,cabins,and,doubling,up,six,and,seven,families,in,the,few,houses,still,standing
and,they're,trying,to,rebuild
now,miss,scarlett,don't,say,they,are,silly
you,know,atlanta,folks,as,well,as,i,do
they,are,plumb,set,on,that,town,most,as,bad,as,charlestonians,are,about,charleston,and,it'll,take,more,than,yankees,and,a,burning,to,keep,them,away
atlanta,folks,are,begging,your,pardon,miss,melly,as,stubborn,as,mules,about,atlanta
i,don't,know,why,for,i,always,thought,that,town,a,mighty,pushy,impudent,sort,of,place
but,then,i'm,a,countryman,born,and,i,don't,like,any,town
and,let,me,tell,you,the,ones,who,are,getting,back,first,are,the,smart,ones
the,ones,who,come,back,last,won't,find,a,stick,or,stone,or,brick,of,their,houses,because,everybody's,out,salvaging,things,all,over,town,to,rebuild,their,houses
just,day,before,yesterday,i,saw,mrs,merriwether,and,miss,maybelle,and,their,old,darky,woman,out,collecting,brick,in,a,wheelbarrow
and,mrs,meade,told,me,she,was,thinking,about,building,a,log,cabin,when,the,doctor,comes,back,to,help,her
she,said,she,lived,in,a,log,cabin,when,she,first,came,to,atlanta,when,it,was,marthasville,and,it,wouldn't,bother,her,none,to,do,it,again
'course,she,was,only,joking,but,that,shows,you,how,they,feel,about,it
i,think,they've,got,a,lot,of,spirit,said,melanie,proudly
don't,you,scarlett
scarlett,nodded,a,grim,pleasure,and,pride,in,her,adopted,town,filling,her
as,frank,said,it,was,a,pushy,impudent,place,and,that,was,why,she,liked,it
it,wasn't,hide-bound,and,stick-in-the-,muddish,like,the,older,towns,and,it,had,a,brash,exuberance,that,matched,her,own
i'm,like,atlanta,she,thought
it,takes,more,than,yankees,or,a,burning,to,keep,me,down
if,aunt,pitty,is,going,back,to,atlanta,we'd,better,go,back,and,stay,with,her,scarlett,said,melanie,interrupting,her,train,of,thought
she'll,die,of,fright,alone
now,how,can,i,leave,here,melly
scarlett,asked,crossly
if,you,are,so,anxious,to,go,go
i,won't,stop,you
oh,i,didn't,mean,it,that,way,darling,cried,melanie,flushing,with,distress
how,thoughtless,of,me
of,course,you,can't,leave,tara,and,and,i,guess,uncle,peter,and,cookie,can,take,care,of,auntie
there's,nothing,to,keep,you,from,going,scarlett,pointed,out,shortly
you,know,i,wouldn't,leave,you,answered,melanie
and,i,i,would,be,just,frightened,to,death,without,you
suit,yourself
besides,you,wouldn't,catch,me,going,back,to,atlanta
just,as,soon,as,they,get,a,few,houses,up,sherman,will,come,back,and,burn,it,again
he,won't,be,back,said,frank,and,despite,his,efforts,his,face,drooped
he's,gone,on,through,the,state,to,the,coast
savannah,was,captured,this,week,and,they,say,the,yankees,are,going,on,up,into,south,carolina
savannah,taken
yes
why,ladies,savannah,couldn't,help,but,fall
they,didn't,have,enough,men,to,hold,it,though,they,used,every,man,they,could,get,every,man,who,could,drag,one,foot,after,another
do,you,know,that,when,the,yankees,were,marching,on,milledgeville,they,called,out,all,the,cadets,from,the,military,academies,no,matter,how,young,they,were,and,even,opened,the,state,penitentiary,to,get,fresh,troops
yes,sir,they,turned,loose,every,convict,who,was,willing,to,fight,and,promised,him,a,pardon,if,he,lived,through,the,war
it,kind,of,gave,me,the,creeps,to,see,those,little,cadets,in,the,ranks,with,thieves,and,cutthroats
they,turned,loose,the,convicts,on,us
now,miss,scarlett,don't,you,get,upset
they're,a,long,way,off,from,here,and,furthermore,they're,making,good,soldiers
i,guess,being,a,thief,don't,keep,a,man,from,being,a,good,soldier,does,it
i,think,it's,wonderful,said,melanie,softly
well,i,don't,said,scarlett,flatly
there's,thieves,enough,running,around,the,country,anyway,what,with,the,yankees,and,she,caught,herself,in,time,but,the,men,laughed
what,with,yankees,and,our,commissary,department,they,finished,and,she,flushed
but,where's,general,hood's,army
interposed,melanie,hastily
surely,he,could,have,held,savannah
why,miss,melanie,frank,was,startled,and,reproachful,general,hood,hasn't,been,down,in,that,section,at,all
he's,been,fighting,up,in,tennessee,trying,to,draw,the,yankees,out,of,georgia
and,didn't,his,little,scheme,work,well
cried,scarlett,sarcastically
he,left,the,damn,yankees,to,go,through,us,with,nothing,but,schoolboys,and,convicts,and,home,guards,to,protect,us
daughter,said,gerald,rousing,himself,you,are,profane
your,mother,will,be,grieved
they,are,damn,yankees
cried,scarlett,passionately
and,i,never,expect,to,call,them,anything,else
at,the,mention,of,ellen,everyone,felt,queer,and,conversation,suddenly,ceased
melanie,again,interposed
when,you,were,in,macon,did,you,see,india,and,honey,wilkes
did,they,had,they,heard,anything,of,ashley
now,miss,melly,you,know,if,i'd,had,news,of,ashley,i'd,have,ridden,up,here,from,macon,right,away,to,tell,you,said,frank,reproachfully
no,they,didn't,have,any,news,but,now,don't,you,fret,about,ashley,miss,melly
i,know,it's,been,a,long,time,since,you,heard,from,him,but,you,can't,expect,to,hear,from,a,fellow,when,he's,in,prison,can,you
and,things,aren't,as,bad,in,yankee,prisons,as,they,are,in,ours
after,all,the,yankees,have,plenty,to,eat,and,enough,medicines,and,blankets
they,aren't,like,we,are,not,having,enough,to,feed,ourselves,much,less,our,prisoners
oh,the,yankees,have,got,plenty,cried,melanie,passionately,bitter
but,they,don't,give,things,to,the,prisoners
you,know,they,don't,mr,kennedy
you,are,just,saying,that,to,make,me,feel,better
you,know,that,our,boys,freeze,to,death,up,there,and,starve,too,and,die,without,doctors,and,medicine,simply,because,the,yankees,hate,us,so,much
oh,if,we,could,just,wipe,every,yankee,off,the,face,of,the,earth
oh,i,know,that,ashley,is
don't,say,it
cried,scarlett,her,heart,in,her,throat
as,long,as,no,one,said,ashley,was,dead,there,persisted,in,her,heart,a,faint,hope,that,he,lived,but,she,felt,that,if,she,heard,the,words,pronounced,in,that,moment,he,would,die
now,mrs,wilkes,don't,you,bother,about,your,husband,said,the,one-eyed,man,soothingly
i,was,captured,after,first,manassas,and,exchanged,later,and,when,i,was,in,prison,they,fed,me,off,the,fat,of,the,land,fried,chicken,and,hot,biscuits
i,think,you,are,a,liar,said,melanie,with,a,faint,smile,and,the,first,sign,of,spirit,scarlett,had,ever,seen,her,display,with,a,man
what,do,you,think
i,think,so,too,said,the,one-eyed,man,and,slapped,his,leg,with,a,laugh
if,you'll,all,come,into,the,parlor,i'll,sing,you,some,christmas,carols,said,melanie,glad,to,change,the,subject
the,piano,was,one,thing,the,yankees,couldn't,carry,away
is,it,terribly,out,of,tune,suellen
dreadfully,answered,suellen,happily,beckoning,with,a,smile,to,frank
but,as,they,all,passed,from,the,room,frank,hung,back,tugging,at,scarlett's,sleeve
may,i,speak,to,you,alone
for,an,awful,moment,she,feared,he,was,going,to,ask,about,her,livestock,and,she,braced,herself,for,a,good,lie
when,the,room,was,cleared,and,they,stood,by,the,fire,all,the,false,cheerfulness,which,had,colored,frank's,face,in,front,of,the,others,passed,and,she,saw,that,he,looked,like,an,old,man
his,face,was,as,dried,and,brown,as,the,leaves,that,were,blowing,about,the,lawn,of,tara,and,his,ginger-colored,whiskers,were,thin,and,scraggly,and,streaked,with,gray
he,clawed,at,them,absently,and,cleared,his,throat,in,an,annoying,way,before,he,spoke
i'm,sorry,about,your,ma,miss,scarlett
please,don't,talk,about,it
and,your,pa,has,he,been,this,way,since
yes,he's,he's,not,himself,as,you,can,see
he,sure,set,a,store,by,her
oh,mr,kennedy,please,don't,let's,talk
i'm,sorry,miss,scarlett,and,he,shuffled,his,feet,nervously
the,truth,is,i,wanted,to,take,up,something,with,your,pa,and,now,i,see,it,won't,do,any,good
perhaps,i,can,help,you,mr,kennedy
you,see,i'm,the,head,of,the,house,now
well,i,began,frank,and,again,clawed,nervously,at,his,beard
the,truth,is,well,miss,scarlett,i,was,aiming,to,ask,him,for,miss,suellen
do,you,mean,to,tell,me,cried,scarlett,in,amused,amazement,that,you,haven't,yet,asked,pa,for,suellen
and,you've,been,courting,her,for,years
he,flushed,and,grinned,embarrassedly,and,in,general,looked,like,a,shy,and,sheepish,boy
well,i,i,didn't,know,if,she'd,have,me
i'm,so,much,older,than,she,is,and,there,were,so,many,good-looking,young,bucks,hanging,around,tara
hump
thought,scarlett,they,were,hanging,around,me,not,her
and,i,don't,know,yet,if,she'll,have,me
i've,never,asked,her,but,she,must,know,how,i,feel
i,i,thought,i'd,ask,mr,o'hara's,permission,and,tell,him,the,truth
miss,scarlett,i,haven't,got,a,cent,now
i,used,to,have,a,lot,of,money,if,you'll,forgive,me,mentioning,it,but,right,now,all,i,own,is,my,horse,and,the,clothes,i've,got,on
you,see,when,i,enlisted,i,sold,most,of,my,land,and,i,put,all,my,money,in,confederate,bonds,and,you,know,what,they're,worth,now
less,than,the,paper,they're,printed,on
and,anyway,i,haven't,got,them,now,because,they,burned,up,when,the,yankees,burned,my,sister's,house
i,know,i've,got,gall,asking,for,miss,suellen,now,when,i,haven't,a,cent,but,well,it's,this,way
i,got,to,thinking,that,we,don't,know,how,things,are,going,to,turn,out,about,this,war
it,sure,looks,like,the,end,of,the,world,for,me
there's,nothing,we,can,be,sure,of,and,and,i,thought,it,would,be,a,heap,of,comfort,to,me,and,maybe,to,her,if,we,were,engaged
that,would,be,something,sure
i,wouldn't,ask,to,marry,her,till,i,could,take,care,of,her,miss,scarlett,and,i,don't,know,when,that,will,be
but,if,true,love,carries,any,weight,with,you,you,can,be,certain,miss,suellen,will,be,rich,in,that,if,nothing,else
he,spoke,the,last,words,with,a,simple,dignity,that,touched,scarlett,even,in,her,amusement
it,was,beyond,her,comprehension,that,anyone,could,love,suellen
her,sister,seemed,to,her,a,monster,of,selfishness,of,complaints,and,of,what,she,could,only,describe,as,pure,cussedness
why,mr,kennedy,she,said,kindly,it's,quite,all,right
i'm,sure,i,can,speak,for,pa,he,always,set,a,store,by,you,and,he,always,expected,suellen,to,marry,you
did,he,now
cried,frank,happiness,in,his,face
indeed,yes,answered,scarlett,concealing,a,grin,as,she,remembered,how,frequently,gerald,had,rudely,bellowed,across,the,supper,table,to,suellen,how,now,missy
hasn't,your,ardent,beau,popped,the,question,yet
shall,i,be,asking,him,his,intentions
i,shall,ask,her,tonight,he,said,his,face,quivering,and,he,clutched,her,hand,and,shook,it
you're,so,kind,miss,scarlett
i'll,send,her,to,you,smiled,scarlett,starting,for,the,parlor
melanie,was,beginning,to,play
the,piano,was,sadly,out,of,tune,but,some,of,the,chords,were,musical,and,melanie,was,raising,her,voice,to,lead,the,others,in,hark,the,herald,angels,sing
scarlett,paused
it,did,not,seem,possible,that,war,had,swept,over,them,twice,that,they,were,living,in,a,ravaged,country,close,to,the,border,of,starvation,when,this,old,sweet,christmas,hymn,was,being,sung
abruptly,she,turned,to,frank
what,did,you,mean,when,you,said,it,looked,like,the,end,of,the,world,to,you
i'll,talk,frankly,he,said,slowly,but,i,wouldn't,want,you,to,be,alarming,the,other,ladies,with,what,i,say
the,war,can't,go,on,much,longer
there,aren't,any,fresh,men,to,fill,the,ranks,and,the,desertions,are,running,high,higher,than,the,army,likes,to,admit
you,see,the,men,can't,stand,to,be,away,from,their,families,when,they,know,they're,starving,so,they,go,home,to,try,to,provide,for,them
i,can't,blame,them,but,it,weakens,the,army
and,the,army,can't,fight,without,food,and,there,isn't,any,food
i,know,because,you,see,getting,food,is,my,business
i've,been,all,up,and,down,this,section,since,we,retook,atlanta,and,there,isn't,enough,to,feed,a,jaybird
it's,the,same,way,for,three,hundred,miles,south,to,savannah
the,folks,are,starving,and,the,railroads,are,torn,up,and,there,aren't,any,new,rifles,and,the,ammunition,is,giving,out,and,there's,no,leather,at,all,for,shoes
so,you,see,the,end,is,almost,here
but,the,fading,hopes,of,the,confederacy,weighed,less,heavily,on,scarlett,than,his,remark,about,the,scarcity,of,food
it,had,been,her,intention,to,send,pork,out,with,the,horse,and,wagon,the,gold,pieces,and,the,united,states,money,to,scour,the,countryside,for,provisions,and,material,for,clothes
but,if,what,frank,said,was,true
but,macon,hadn't,fallen
there,must,be,food,in,macon
just,as,soon,as,the,commissary,department,was,safely,on,its,way,she'd,start,pork,for,macon,and,take,the,chance,of,having,the,precious,horse,picked,up,by,the,army
she'd,have,to,risk,it
well,let's,don't,talk,about,unpleasant,things,tonight,mr,kennedy,she,said
you,go,and,sit,in,mother's,little,office,and,i'll,send,suellen,to,you,so,you,can,well,so,you'll,have,a,little,privacy
blushing,smiling,frank,slipped,out,of,the,room,and,scarlett,watched,him,go
what,a,pity,he,can't,marry,her,now,she,thought
that,would,be,one,less,mouth,to,feed
chapter,xxix
the,following,april,general,johnston,who,had,been,given,back,the,shattered,remnants,of,his,old,command,surrendered,them,in,north,carolina,and,the,war,was,over
but,not,until,two,weeks,later,did,the,news,reach,tara
there,was,too,much,to,do,at,tara,for,anyone,to,waste,time,traveling,abroad,and,hearing,gossip,and,as,the,neighbors,were,just,as,busy,as,they,there,was,little,visiting,and,news,spread,slowly
spring,plowing,was,at,its,height,and,the,cotton,and,garden,seed,pork,had,brought,from,macon,was,being,put,into,the,ground
pork,had,been,almost,worthless,since,the,trip,so,proud,was,he,of,returning,safely,with,his,wagon-load,of,dress,goods,seed,fowls,hams,side,meat,and,meal
over,and,over,he,told,the,story,of,his,many,narrow,escapes,of,the,bypaths,and,country,lanes,he,had,taken,on,his,return,to,tara,the,unfrequented,roads,the,old,trails,the,bridle,paths
he,had,been,five,weeks,on,the,road,agonizing,weeks,for,scarlett
but,she,did,not,upbraid,him,on,his,return,for,she,was,happy,that,he,had,made,the,trip,successfully,and,pleased,that,he,brought,back,so,much,of,the,money,she,had,given,him
she,had,a,shrewd,suspicion,that,the,reason,he,had,so,much,money,left,over,was,that,he,had,not,bought,the,fowls,or,most,of,the,food
pork,would,have,taken,shame,to,himself,had,he,spent,her,money,when,there,were,unguarded,hen,coops,along,the,road,and,smokehouses,handy
now,that,they,had,a,little,food,everyone,at,tara,was,busy,trying,to,restore,some,semblance,of,naturalness,to,life
there,was,work,for,every,pair,of,hands,too,much,work,never-ending,work
the,withered,stalks,of,last,year's,cotton,had,to,be,removed,to,make,way,for,this,year's,seeds,and,the,balky,horse,unaccustomed,to,the,plow,dragged,unwillingly,through,the,fields
weeds,had,to,be,pulled,from,the,garden,and,the,seeds,planted,firewood,had,to,be,cut,a,beginning,had,to,be,made,toward,replacing,the,pens,and,the,miles,and,miles,of,fences,so,casually,burned,by,the,yankees
the,snares,pork,set,for,rabbits,had,to,be,visited,twice,a,day,and,the,fishlines,in,the,river,rebaited
there,were,beds,to,be,made,and,floors,to,be,swept,food,to,be,cooked,and,dishes,washed,hogs,and,chickens,to,be,fed,and,eggs,gathered
the,cow,had,to,be,milked,and,pastured,near,the,swamp,and,someone,had,to,watch,her,all,day,for,fear,the,yankees,or,frank,kennedy's,men,would,return,and,take,her
even,little,wade,had,his,duties
every,morning,he,went,out,importantly,with,a,basket,to,pick,up,twigs,and,chips,to,start,the,fires,with
it,was,the,fontaine,boys,the,first,of,the,county,men,home,from,the,war,who,brought,the,news,of,the,surrender
alex,who,still,had,boots,was,walking,and,tony,barefooted,was,riding,on,the,bare,back,of,a,mule
tony,always,managed,to,get,the,best,of,things,in,that,family
they,were,swarthier,than,ever,from,four,years',exposure,to,sun,and,storm,thinner,more,wiry,and,the,wild,black,beards,they,brought,back,from,the,war,made,them,seem,like,strangers
on,their,way,to,mimosa,and,eager,for,home,they,only,stopped,a,moment,at,tara,to,kiss,the,girls,and,give,them,news,of,the,surrender
it,was,all,over,they,said,all,finished,and,they,did,not,seem,to,care,much,or,want,to,talk,about,it
all,they,wanted,to,know,was,whether,mimosa,had,been,burned
on,the,way,south,from,atlanta,they,had,passed,chimney,after,chimney,where,the,homes,of,friends,had,stood,and,it,seemed,almost,too,much,to,hope,that,their,own,house,had,been,spared
they,sighed,with,relief,at,the,welcome,news,and,laughed,slapping,their,thighs,when,scarlett,told,them,of,sally's,wild,ride,and,how,neatly,she,had,cleared,their,hedge
she's,a,spunky,girl,said,tony,and,it's,rotten,luck,for,her,joe,getting,killed
you,all,got,any,chewing,tobacco,scarlett
nothing,but,rabbit,tobacco
pa,smokes,it,in,a,corn,cob
i,haven't,fallen,that,low,yet,said,tony,but,i'll,probably,come,to,it
is,dimity,munroe,all,right
asked,alex,eagerly,but,a,little,embarrassed,and,scarlett,recalled,vaguely,that,he,had,been,sweet,on,sally's,younger,sister
oh,yes
she's,living,with,her,aunt,over,in,fayetteville,now
you,know,their,house,in,lovejoy,was,burned
and,the,rest,of,her,folks,are,in,macon
what,he,means,is,has,dimity,married,some,brave,colonel,in,the,home,guard
jeered,tony,and,alex,turned,furious,eyes,upon,him
of,course,she,isn't,married,said,scarlett,amused
maybe,it,would,be,better,if,she,had,said,alex,gloomily
how,the,hell,i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett
but,how,can,a,man,ask,a,girl,to,marry,him,when,his,darkies,are,all,freed,and,his,stock,gone,and,he,hasn't,got,a,cent,in,his,pockets
you,know,that,wouldn't,bother,dimity,said,scarlett
she,could,afford,to,be,loyal,to,dimity,and,say,nice,things,about,her,for,alex,fontaine,had,never,been,one,of,her,own,beaux
hell's,afire,well,i,beg,your,pardon,again
i'll,have,to,quit,swearing,or,grandma,will,sure,tan,my,hide
i'm,not,asking,any,girl,to,marry,a,pauper
it,mightn't,bother,her,but,it,would,bother,me
while,scarlett,talked,to,the,boys,on,the,front,porch,melanie,suellen,and,carreen,slipped,silently,into,the,house,as,soon,as,they,heard,the,news,of,the,surrender
after,the,boys,had,gone,cutting,across,the,back,fields,of,tara,toward,home,scarlett,went,inside,and,heard,the,girls,sobbing,together,on,the,sofa,in,ellen's,little,office
it,was,all,over,the,bright,beautiful,dream,they,had,loved,and,hoped,for,the,cause,which,had,taken,their,friends,lovers,husbands,and,beggared,their,families
the,cause,they,had,thought,could,never,fall,had,fallen,forever
but,for,scarlett,there,were,no,tears
in,the,first,moment,when,she,heard,the,news,she,thought,thank,god
now,the,cow,won't,be,stolen
now,the,horse,is,safe
now,we,can,take,the,silver,out,of,the,well,and,everybody,can,have,a,knife,and,fork
now,i,won't,be,afraid,to,drive,round,the,country,looking,for,something,to,eat
what,a,relief
never,again,would,she,start,in,fear,at,the,sound,of,hooves
never,again,would,she,wake,in,the,dark,nights,holding,her,breath,to,listen,wondering,if,it,were,reality,or,only,a,dream,that,she,heard,in,the,yard,the,rattle,of,bits,the,stamping,of,hooves,and,the,harsh,crying,of,orders,by,the,yankees
and,best,of,all,tara,was,safe
now,her,worst,nightmare,would,never,come,true
now,she,would,never,have,to,stand,on,the,lawn,and,see,smoke,billowing,from,the,beloved,house,and,hear,the,roar,of,flames,as,the,roof,fell,in
yes,the,cause,was,dead,but,war,had,always,seemed,foolish,to,her,and,peace,was,better
she,had,never,stood,starry,eyed,when,the,stars,and,bars,ran,up,a,pole,or,felt,cold,chills,when,dixie,sounded
she,had,not,been,sustained,through,privations,the,sickening,duties,of,nursing,the,fears,of,the,siege,and,the,hunger,of,the,last,few,months,by,the,fanatic,glow,which,made,all,these,things,endurable,to,others,if,only,the,cause,prospered
it,was,all,over,and,done,with,and,she,was,not,going,to,cry,about,it
all,over
the,war,which,had,seemed,so,endless,the,war,which,unbidden,and,unwanted,had,cut,her,life,in,two,had,made,so,clean,a,cleavage,that,it,was,difficult,to,remember,those,other,care-free,days
she,could,look,back,unmoved,at,the,pretty,scarlett,with,her,fragile,green,morocco,slippers,and,her,flounces,fragrant,with,lavender,but,she,wondered,if,she,could,be,that,same,girl
scarlett,o'hara,with,the,county,at,her,feet,a,hundred,slaves,to,do,her,bidding,the,wealth,of,tara,like,a,wall,behind,her,and,doting,parents,anxious,to,grant,any,desire,of,her,heart
spoiled,careless,scarlett,who,had,never,known,an,ungratified,wish,except,where,ashley,was,concerned
somewhere,on,the,long,road,that,wound,through,those,four,years,the,girl,with,her,sachet,and,dancing,slippers,had,slipped,away,and,there,was,left,a,woman,with,sharp,green,eyes,who,counted,pennies,and,turned,her,hands,to,many,menial,tasks,a,woman,to,whom,nothing,was,left,from,the,wreckage,except,the,indestructible,red,earth,on,which,she,stood
as,she,stood,in,the,hall,listening,to,the,girls,sobbing,her,mind,was,busy
we'll,plant,more,cotton,lots,more
i'll,send,pork,to,macon,tomorrow,to,buy,more,seed
now,the,yankees,won't,burn,it,and,our,troops,won't,need,it
good,lord
cotton,ought,to,go,sky,high,this,fall
she,went,into,the,little,office,and,disregarding,the,weeping,girls,on,the,sofa,seated,herself,at,the,secretary,and,picked,up,a,quill,to,balance,the,cost,of,more,cotton,seed,against,her,remaining,cash
the,war,is,over,she,thought,and,suddenly,she,dropped,the,quill,as,a,wild,happiness,flooded,her
the,war,was,over,and,ashley,if,ashley,was,alive,he'd,be,coming,home
she,wondered,if,melanie,in,the,midst,of,mourning,for,the,lost,cause,had,thought,of,this
soon,we'll,get,a,letter,no,not,a,letter
we,can't,get,letters
but,soon,oh,somehow,he'll,let,us,know
but,the,days,passed,into,weeks,and,there,was,no,news,from,ashley
the,mail,service,in,the,south,was,uncertain,and,in,the,rural,districts,there,was,none,at,all
occasionally,a,passing,traveler,from,atlanta,brought,a,note,from,aunt,pitty,tearfully,begging,the,girls,to,come,back
but,never,news,of,ashley
after,the,surrender,an,ever-present,feud,over,the,horse,smoldered,between,scarlett,and,suellen
now,that,there,was,no,danger,of,yankees,suellen,wanted,to,go,calling,on,the,neighbors
lonely,and,missing,the,happy,sociability,of,the,old,days,suellen,longed,to,visit,friends,if,for,no,other,reason,than,to,assure,herself,that,the,rest,of,the,county,was,as,bad,off,as,tara
but,scarlett,was,adamant
the,horse,was,for,work,to,drag,logs,from,the,woods,to,plow,and,for,pork,to,ride,in,search,of,food
on,sundays,he,had,earned,the,right,to,graze,in,the,pasture,and,rest
if,suellen,wanted,to,go,visiting,she,could,go,afoot
before,the,last,year,suellen,had,never,walked,a,hundred,yards,in,her,life,and,this,prospect,was,anything,but,pleasing
so,she,stayed,at,home,and,nagged,and,cried,and,said,once,too,often,oh,if,only,mother,was,here
at,that,scarlett,gave,her,the,long-,promised,slap,hitting,her,so,hard,it,knocked,her,screaming,to,the,bed,and,caused,great,consternation,throughout,the,house
thereafter,suellen,whined,the,less,at,least,in,scarlett's,presence
scarlett,spoke,truthfully,when,she,said,she,wanted,the,horse,to,rest,but,that,was,only,half,of,the,truth
the,other,half,was,that,she,had,paid,one,round,of,calls,on,the,county,in,the,first,month,after,the,surrender,and,the,sight,of,old,friends,and,old,plantations,had,shaken,her,courage,more,than,she,liked,to,admit
the,fontaines,had,fared,best,of,any,thanks,to,sally's,hard,ride,but,it,was,flourishing,only,by,comparison,with,the,desperate,situation,of,the,other,neighbors
grandma,fontaine,had,never,completely,recovered,from,the,heart,attack,she,had,the,day,she,led,the,others,in,beating,out,the,flames,and,saving,the,house
old,dr,fontaine,was,convalescing,slowly,from,an,amputated,arm
alex,and,tony,were,turning,awkward,hands,to,plows,and,hoe,handles
they,leaned,over,the,fence,rail,to,shake,hands,with,scarlett,when,she,called,and,they,laughed,at,her,rickety,wagon,their,black,eyes,bitter,for,they,were,laughing,at,themselves,as,well,as,her
she,asked,to,buy,seed,corn,from,them,and,they,promised,it,and,fell,to,discussing,farm,problems
they,had,twelve,chickens,two,cows,five,hogs,and,the,mule,they,brought,home,from,the,war
one,of,the,hogs,had,just,died,and,they,were,worried,about,losing,the,others
at,hearing,such,serious,words,about,hogs,from,these,ex-dandies,who,had,never,given,life,a,more,serious,thought,than,which,cravat,was,most,fashionable,scarlett,laughed,and,this,time,her,laugh,was,bitter,too
they,had,all,made,her,welcome,at,mimosa,and,had,insisted,on,giving,not,selling,her,the,seed,corn
the,quick,fontaine,tempers,flared,when,she,put,a,greenback,on,the,table,and,they,flatly,refused,payment
scarlett,took,the,corn,and,privately,slipped,a,dollar,bill,into,sally's,hand
sally,looked,like,a,different,person,from,the,girl,who,had,greeted,her,eight,months,before,when,scarlett,first,came,home,to,tara
then,she,had,been,pale,and,sad,but,there,had,been,a,buoyancy,about,her
now,that,buoyancy,had,gone,as,if,the,surrender,had,taken,all,hope,from,her
scarlett,she,whispered,as,she,clutched,the,bill,what,was,the,good,of,it,all
why,did,we,ever,fight
oh,my,poor,joe
oh,my,poor,baby
i,don't,know,why,we,fought,and,i,don't,care,said,scarlett
and,i'm,not,interested
i,never,was,interested
war,is,a,man's,business,not,a,woman's
all,i'm,interested,in,now,is,a,good,cotton,crop
now,take,this,dollar,and,buy,little,joe,a,dress
god,knows,he,needs,it
i'm,not,going,to,rob,you,of,your,corn,for,all,alex,and,tony's,politeness
the,boys,followed,her,to,the,wagon,and,assisted,her,in,courtly,for,all,their,rags,gay,with,the,volatile,fontaine,gaiety,but,with,the,picture,of,their,destitution,in,her,eyes,she,shivered,as,she,drove,away,from,mimosa
she,was,so,tired,of,poverty,and,pinching
what,a,pleasure,it,would,be,to,know,people,who,were,rich,and,not,worried,as,to,where,the,next,meal,was,coming,from
cade,calvert,was,at,home,at,pine,bloom,and,as,scarlett,came,up,the,steps,of,the,old,house,in,which,she,had,danced,so,often,in,happier,days,she,saw,that,death,was,in,his,face
he,was,emaciated,and,he,coughed,as,he,lay,in,an,easy,chair,in,the,sunshine,with,a,shawl,across,his,knees,but,his,face,lit,up,when,he,saw,her
just,a,little,cold,which,had,settled,in,his,chest,he,said,trying,to,rise,to,greet,her
got,it,from,sleeping,so,much,in,the,rain
but,it,would,be,gone,soon,and,then,he'd,lend,a,hand,in,the,work
cathleen,calvert,who,came,out,of,the,house,at,the,sound,of,voices,met,scarlett's,eyes,above,her,brother's,head,and,in,them,scarlett,read,knowledge,and,bitter,despair
cade,might,not,know,but,cathleen,knew
pine,bloom,looked,straggly,and,overgrown,with,weeds,seedling,pines,were,beginning,to,show,in,the,fields,and,the,house,was,sagging,and,untidy
cathleen,was,thin,and,taut
the,two,of,them,with,their,yankee,stepmother,their,four,little,half-sisters,and,hilton,the,yankee,overseer,remained,in,the,silent,oddly,echoing,house
scarlett,had,never,liked,hilton,any,more,than,she,liked,their,own,overseer,jonas,wilkerson,and,she,liked,him,even,less,now,as,he,sauntered,forward,and,greeted,her,like,an,equal
formerly,he,had,the,same,combination,of,servility,and,impertinence,which,wilkerson,possessed,but,now,with,mr,calvert,and,raiford,dead,in,the,war,and,cade,sick,he,had,dropped,all,servility
the,second,mrs,calvert,had,never,known,how,to,compel,respect,from,negro,servants,and,it,was,not,to,be,expected,that,she,could,get,it,from,a,white,man
mr,hilton,has,been,so,kind,about,staying,with,us,through,these,difficult,times,said,mrs,calvert,nervously,casting,quick,glances,at,her,silent,stepdaughter
very,kind
i,suppose,you,heard,how,he,saved,our,house,twice,when,sherman,was,here
i'm,sure,i,don't,know,how,we,would,have,managed,without,him,with,no,money,and,cade
a,flush,went,over,cade's,white,face,and,cathleen's,long,lashes,veiled,her,eyes,as,her,mouth,hardened
scarlett,knew,their,souls,were,writhing,in,helpless,rage,at,being,under,obligations,to,their,yankee,overseer
mrs,calvert,seemed,ready,to,weep
she,had,somehow,made,a,blunder
she,was,always,blundering
she,just,couldn't,understand,southerners,for,all,that,she,had,lived,in,georgia,twenty,years
she,never,knew,what,not,to,say,to,her,stepchildren,and,no,matter,what,she,said,or,did,they,were,always,so,exquisitely,polite,to,her
silently,she,vowed,she,would,go,north,to,her,own,people,taking,her,children,with,her,and,leave,these,puzzling,stiff-necked,strangers
after,these,visits,scarlett,had,no,desire,to,see,the,tarletons
now,that,the,four,boys,were,gone,the,house,burned,and,the,family,cramped,in,the,overseer's,cottage,she,could,not,bring,herself,to,go
but,suellen,and,carreen,begged,and,melanie,said,it,would,be,unneighborly,not,to,call,and,welcome,mr,tarleton,back,from,the,war,so,one,sunday,they,went
this,was,the,worst,of,all
as,they,drove,up,by,the,ruins,of,the,house,they,saw,beatrice,tarleton,dressed,in,a,worn,riding,habit,a,crop,under,her,arm,sitting,on,the,top,rail,of,the,fence,about,the,paddock,staring,moodily,at,nothing
beside,her,perched,the,bow-legged,little,negro,who,had,trained,her,horses,and,he,looked,as,glum,as,his,mistress
the,paddock,once,full,of,frolicking,colts,and,placid,brood,mares,was,empty,now,except,for,one,mule,the,mule,mr,tarleton,had,ridden,home,from,the,surrender
i,swear,i,don't,know,what,to,do,with,myself,now,that,my,darlings,are,gone,said,mrs,tarleton,climbing,down,from,the,fence
a,stranger,might,have,thought,she,spoke,of,her,four,dead,sons,but,the,girls,from,tara,knew,her,horses,were,in,her,mind
all,my,beautiful,horses,dead
and,oh,my,poor,nellie
if,i,just,had,nellie
and,nothing,but,a,damned,mule,on,the,place
a,damned,mule,she,repeated,looking,indignantly,at,the,scrawny,beast
it's,an,insult,to,the,memory,of,my,blooded,darlings,to,have,a,mule,in,their,paddock
mules,are,misbegotten,unnatural,critters,and,it,ought,to,be,illegal,to,breed,them
jim,tarleton,completely,disguised,by,a,bushy,beard,came,out,of,the,overseer's,house,to,welcome,and,kiss,the,girls,and,his,four,red-haired,daughters,in,mended,dresses,streamed,out,behind,him,tripping,over,the,dozen,black,and,tan,hounds,which,ran,barking,to,the,door,at,the,sound,of,strange,voices
there,was,an,air,of,studied,and,determined,cheerfulness,about,the,whole,family,which,brought,a,colder,chill,to,scarlett's,bones,than,the,bitterness,of,mimosa,or,the,deathly,brooding,of,pine,bloom
the,tarletons,insisted,that,the,girls,stay,for,dinner,saying,they,had,so,few,guests,these,days,and,wanted,to,hear,all,the,news
scarlett,did,not,want,to,linger,for,the,atmosphere,oppressed,her,but,melanie,and,her,two,sisters,were,anxious,for,a,longer,visit,so,the,four,stayed,for,dinner,and,ate,sparingly,of,the,side,meat,and,dried,peas,which,were,served,them
there,was,laughter,about,the,skimpy,fare,and,the,tarleton,girls,giggled,as,they,told,of,makeshifts,for,clothes,as,if,they,were,telling,the,most,amusing,of,jokes
melanie,met,them,halfway,surprising,scarlett,with,her,unexpected,vivacity,as,she,told,of,trials,at,tara,making,light,of,hardships
scarlett,could,hardly,speak,at,all
the,room,seemed,so,empty,without,the,four,great,tarleton,boys,lounging,and,smoking,and,teasing
and,if,it,seemed,empty,to,her,what,must,it,seem,to,the,tarletons,who,were,offering,a,smiling,front,to,their,neighbors
carreen,had,said,little,during,the,meal,but,when,it,was,over,she,slipped,over,to,mrs,tarleton's,side,and,whispered,something
mrs,tarleton's,face,changed,and,the,brittle,smile,left,her,lips,as,she,put,her,arm,around,carreen's,slender,waist
they,left,the,room,and,scarlett,who,felt,she,could,not,endure,the,house,another,minute,followed,them
they,went,down,the,path,through,the,garden,and,scarlett,saw,they,were,going,toward,the,burying,ground
well,she,couldn't,go,back,to,the,house,now
it,would,seem,too,rude
but,what,on,earth,did,carreen,mean,dragging,mrs,tarleton,out,to,the,boys',graves,when,beatrice,was,trying,so,hard,to,be,brave
there,were,two,new,marble,markers,in,the,brick-inclosed,lot,under,the,funereal,cedars,so,new,that,no,rain,had,splashed,them,with,red,dust
we,got,them,last,week,said,mrs,tarleton,proudly
mr,tarleton,went,to,macon,and,brought,them,home,in,the,wagon
tombstones
and,what,they,must,have,cost
suddenly,scarlett,did,not,feel,as,sorry,for,the,tarletons,as,she,had,at,first
anybody,who,would,waste,precious,money,on,tombstones,when,food,was,so,dear,so,almost,unattainable,didn't,deserve,sympathy
and,there,were,several,lines,carved,on,each,of,the,stones
the,more,carving,the,more,money
the,whole,family,must,be,crazy
and,it,had,cost,money,too,to,bring,the,three,boys',bodies,home
they,had,never,found,boyd,or,any,trace,of,him
between,the,graves,of,brent,and,stuart,was,a,stone,which,read,they,were,lovely,and,pleasant,in,their,lives,and,in,their,death,they,were,not,divided
on,the,other,stone,were,the,names,of,boyd,and,tom,with,something,in,latin,which,began,dulce,et,but,it,meant,nothing,to,scarlett,who,had,managed,to,evade,latin,at,the,fayetteville,academy
all,that,money,for,tombstones
why,they,were,fools
she,felt,as,indignant,as,if,her,own,money,had,been,squandered
carreen's,eyes,were,shining,oddly
i,think,it's,lovely,she,whispered,pointing,to,the,first,stone
carreen,would,think,it,lovely
anything,sentimental,stirred,her
yes,said,mrs,tarleton,and,her,voice,was,soft,we,thought,it,very,fitting,they,died,almost,at,the,same,time
stuart,first,and,then,brent,who,caught,up,the,flag,he,dropped
as,the,girls,drove,back,to,tara,scarlett,was,silent,for,a,while,thinking,of,what,she,had,seen,in,the,various,homes,remembering,against,her,will,the,county,in,its,glory,with,visitors,at,all,the,big,houses,and,money,plentiful,negroes,crowding,the,quarters,and,the,well-tended,fields,glorious,with,cotton
in,another,year,there'll,be,little,pines,all,over,these,fields,she,thought,and,looking,toward,the,encircling,forest,she,shuddered
without,the,darkies,it,will,be,all,we,can,do,to,keep,body,and,soul,together
nobody,can,run,a,big,plantation,without,the,darkies,and,lots,of,the,fields,won't,be,cultivated,at,all,and,the,woods,will,take,over,the,fields,again
nobody,can,plant,much,cotton,and,what,will,we,do,then
what'll,become,of,country,folks
town,folks,can,manage,somehow
they've,always,managed
but,we,country,folks,will,go,back,a,hundred,years,like,the,pioneers,who,had,little,cabins,and,just,scratched,a,few,acres,and,barely,existed
no,she,thought,grimly,tara,isn't,going,to,be,like,that
not,even,if,i,have,to,plow,myself
this,whole,section,this,whole,state,can,go,back,to,woods,if,it,wants,to,but,i,won't,let,tara,go
and,i,don't,intend,to,waste,my,money,on,tombstones,or,my,time,crying,about,the,war
we,can,make,out,somehow
i,know,we,could,make,out,somehow,if,the,men,weren't,all,dead
losing,the,darkies,isn't,the,worst,part,about,this
it's,the,loss,of,the,men,the,young,men
she,thought,again,of,the,four,tarletons,and,joe,fontaine,of,raiford,calvert,and,the,munroe,brothers,and,all,the,boys,from,fayetteville,and,jonesboro,whose,names,she,had,read,on,the,casualty,lists
if,there,were,just,enough,men,left,we,could,manage,somehow,but
another,thought,struck,her,suppose,she,wanted,to,marry,again
of,course,she,didn't,want,to,marry,again
once,was,certainly,enough
besides,the,only,man,she'd,ever,wanted,was,ashley,and,he,was,married,if,he,was,still,living
but,suppose,she,would,want,to,marry
who,would,there,be,to,marry,her
the,thought,was,appalling
melly,she,said,what's,going,to,happen,to,southern,girls
what,do,you,mean
just,what,i,say
what's,going,to,happen,to,them
there's,no,one,to,marry,them
why,melly,with,all,the,boys,dead,there'll,be,thousands,of,girls,all,over,the,south,who'll,die,old,maids
and,never,have,any,children,added,melanie,to,whom,this,was,the,most,important,thing
evidently,the,thought,was,not,new,to,suellen,who,sat,in,the,back,of,the,wagon,for,she,suddenly,began,to,cry
she,had,not,heard,from,frank,kennedy,since,christmas
she,did,not,know,if,the,lack,of,mail,service,was,the,cause,or,if,he,had,merely,trifled,with,her,affections,and,then,forgotten,her
or,maybe,he,had,been,killed,in,the,last,days,of,the,war
the,latter,would,have,been,infinitely,preferable,to,his,forgetting,her,for,at,least,there,was,some,dignity,about,a,dead,love,such,as,carreen,and,india,wilkes,had,but,none,about,a,deserted,fiancee
oh,in,the,name,of,god,hush
said,scarlett
oh,you,can,talk,sobbed,suellen,because,you've,been,married,and,had,a,baby,and,everybody,knows,some,man,wanted,you
but,look,at,me
and,you've,got,to,be,mean,and,throw,it,up,to,me,that,i'm,an,old,maid,when,i,can't,help,myself
i,think,you're,hateful
oh,hush
you,know,how,i,hate,people,who,bawl,all,the,time
you,know,perfectly,well,old,ginger,whiskers,isn't,dead,and,that,he'll,come,back,and,marry,you
he,hasn't,any,better,sense
but,personally,i'd,rather,be,an,old,maid,than,marry,him
there,was,silence,from,the,back,of,the,wagon,for,a,while,and,carreen,comforted,her,sister,with,absent-minded,pats,for,her,mind,was,a,long,way,off,riding,paths,three,years,old,with,brent,tarleton,beside,her
there,was,a,glow,an,exaltation,in,her,eyes
ah,said,melanie,sadly,what,will,the,south,be,like,without,all,our,fine,boys
what,would,the,south,have,been,if,they,had,lived
we,could,use,their,courage,and,their,energy,and,their,brains
scarlett,all,of,us,with,little,boys,must,raise,them,to,take,the,places,of,the,men,who,are,gone,to,be,brave,men,like,them
there,will,never,again,be,men,like,them,said,carreen,softly
no,one,can,take,their,places
they,drove,home,the,rest,of,the,way,in,silence
one,day,not,long,after,this,cathleen,calvert,rode,up,to,tara,at,sunset
her,sidesaddle,was,strapped,on,as,sorry,a,mule,as,scarlett,had,ever,seen,a,flop-eared,lame,brute,and,cathleen,was,almost,as,sorry,looking,as,the,animal,she,rode
her,dress,was,of,faded,gingham,of,the,type,once,worn,only,by,house,servants,and,her,sunbonnet,was,secured,under,her,chin,by,a,piece,of,twine
she,rode,up,to,the,front,porch,but,did,not,dismount,and,scarlett,and,melanie,who,had,been,watching,the,sunset,went,down,the,steps,to,meet,her
cathleen,was,as,white,as,cade,had,been,the,day,scarlett,called,white,and,hard,and,brittle,as,if,her,face,would,shatter,if,she,spoke
but,her,back,was,erect,and,her,head,was,high,as,she,nodded,to,them
scarlett,suddenly,remembered,the,day,of,the,wilkes,barbecue,when,she,and,cathleen,had,whispered,together,about,rhett,butler
how,pretty,and,fresh,cathleen,had,been,that,day,in,a,swirl,of,blue,organdie,with,fragrant,roses,at,her,sash,and,little,black,velvet,slippers,laced,about,her,small,ankles
and,now,there,was,not,a,trace,of,that,girl,in,the,stiff,figure,sitting,on,the,mule
i,won't,get,down,thank,you,she,said
i,just,came,to,tell,you,that,i'm,going,to,be,married
what
who,to
cathy,how,grand
when
tomorrow,said,cathleen,quietly,and,there,was,something,in,her,voice,which,took,the,eager,smiles,from,their,faces
i,came,to,tell,you,that,i'm,going,to,be,married,tomorrow,in,jonesboro,and,i'm,not,inviting,you,all,to,come
they,digested,this,in,silence,looking,up,at,her,puzzled
then,melanie,spoke
is,it,someone,we,know,dear
yes,said,cathleen,shortly
it's,mr
hilton
mr
hilton
yes,mr,hilton,our,overseer
scarlett,could,not,even,find,voice,to,say,oh
but,cathleen,peering,down,suddenly,at,melanie,said,in,a,low,savage,voice,if,you,cry,melly,i,can't,stand,it
i,shall,die
melanie,said,nothing,but,patted,the,foot,in,its,awkward,home-made,shoe,which,hung,from,the,stirrup
her,head,was,low
and,don't,pat,me
i,can't,stand,that,either
melanie,dropped,her,hand,but,still,did,not,look,up
well,i,must,go
i,only,came,to,tell,you
the,white,brittle,mask,was,back,again,and,she,picked,up,the,reins
how,is,cade
asked,scarlett,utterly,at,a,loss,but,fumbling,for,some,words,to,break,the,awkward,silence
he,is,dying,said,cathleen,shortly
there,seemed,to,be,no,feeling,in,her,voice
and,he,is,going,to,die,in,some,comfort,and,peace,if,i,can,manage,it,without,worry,about,who,will,take,care,of,me,when,he's,gone
you,see,my,stepmother,and,the,children,are,going,north,for,good,tomorrow
well,i,must,be,going
melanie,looked,up,and,met,cathleen's,hard,eyes
there,were,bright,tears,on,melanie's,lashes,and,understanding,in,her,eyes,and,before,them,cathleen's,lips,curved,into,the,crooked,smile,of,a,brave,child,who,tries,not,to,cry
it,was,all,very,bewildering,to,scarlett,who,was,still,trying,to,grasp,the,idea,that,cathleen,calvert,was,going,to,marry,an,overseer,cathleen,daughter,of,a,rich,planter,cathleen,who,next,to,scarlett,had,had,more,beaux,than,any,girl,in,the,county
cathleen,bent,down,and,melanie,tiptoed
they,kissed
then,cathleen,flapped,the,bridle,reins,sharply,and,the,old,mule,moved,off
melanie,looked,after,her,the,tears,streaming,down,her,face
scarlett,stared,still,dazed
melly,is,she,crazy
you,know,she,can't,be,in,love,with,him
in,love
oh,scarlett,don't,even,suggest,such,a,horrid,thing
oh,poor,cathleen
poor,cade
fiddle-dee-dee
cried,scarlett,beginning,to,be,irritated
it,was,annoying,that,melanie,always,seemed,to,grasp,more,of,situations,than,she,herself,did
cathleen's,plight,seemed,to,her,more,startling,than,catastrophic
of,course,it,was,no,pleasant,thought,marrying,yankee,white,trash,but,after,all,a,girl,couldn't,live,alone,on,a,plantation,she,had,to,have,a,husband,to,help,her,run,it
melly,it's,like,i,said,the,other,day
there,isn't,anybody,for,girls,to,marry,and,they've,got,to,marry,someone
oh,they,don't,have,to,marry
there's,nothing,shameful,in,being,a,spinster
look,at,aunt,pitty
oh,i'd,rather,see,cathleen,dead
i,know,cade,would,rather,see,her,dead
it's,the,end,of,the,calverts
just,think,what,her,what,their,children,will,be
oh,scarlett,have,pork,saddle,the,horse,quickly,and,you,ride,after,her,and,tell,her,to,come,live,with,us
good,lord
cried,scarlett,shocked,at,the,matter-of-fact,way,in,which,melanie,was,offering,tara
scarlett,certainly,had,no,intention,of,feeding,another,mouth
she,started,to,say,this,but,something,in,melanie's,stricken,face,halted,the,words
she,wouldn't,come,melly,she,amended
you,know,she,wouldn't
she's,so,proud,and,she'd,think,it,was,charity
that's,true,that's,true
said,melanie,distractedly,watching,the,small,cloud,of,red,dust,disappear,down,the,road
you've,been,with,me,for,months,thought,scarlett,grimly,looking,at,her,sister-in-law,and,it's,never,occurred,to,you,that,it's,charity,you're,living,on
and,i,guess,it,never,will
you're,one,of,those,people,the,war,didn't,change,and,you,go,right,on,thinking,and,acting,just,like,nothing,had,happened,like,we,were,still,rich,as,croesus,and,had,more,food,than,we,know,what,to,do,with,and,guests,didn't,matter
i,guess,i've,got,you,on,my,neck,for,the,rest,of,my,life
but,i,won't,have,cathleen,too
chapter,xxx
in,that,warm,summer,after,peace,came,tara,suddenly,lost,its,isolation
and,for,months,thereafter,a,stream,of,scarecrows,bearded,ragged,footsore,and,always,hungry,toiled,up,the,red,hill,to,tara,and,came,to,rest,on,the,shady,front,steps,wanting,food,and,a,night's,lodging
they,were,confederate,soldiers,walking,home
the,railroad,had,carried,the,remains,of,johnston's,army,from,north,carolina,to,atlanta,and,dumped,them,there,and,from,atlanta,they,began,their,pilgrimages,afoot
when,the,wave,of,johnston's,men,had,passed,the,weary,veterans,from,the,army,of,virginia,arrived,and,then,men,from,the,western,troops,beating,their,way,south,toward,homes,which,might,not,exist,and,families,which,might,be,scattered,or,dead
most,of,them,were,walking,a,few,fortunate,ones,rode,bony,horses,and,mules,which,the,terms,of,the,surrender,had,permitted,them,to,keep,gaunt,animals,which,even,an,untrained,eye,could,tell,would,never,reach,far-away,florida,and,south,georgia
going,home
going,home
that,was,the,only,thought,in,the,soldiers',minds
some,were,sad,and,silent,others,gay,and,contemptuous,of,hardships,but,the,thought,that,it,was,all,over,and,they,were,going,home,was,the,one,thing,that,sustained,them
few,of,them,were,bitter
they,left,bitterness,to,their,women,and,their,old,people
they,had,fought,a,good,fight,had,been,licked,and,were,willing,to,settle,down,peaceably,to,plowing,beneath,the,flag,they,had,fought
going,home
going,home
they,could,talk,of,nothing,else,neither,battles,nor,wounds,nor,imprisonment,nor,the,future
later,they,would,refight,battles,and,tell,children,and,grandchildren,of,pranks,and,forays,and,charges,of,hunger,forced,marches,and,wounds,but,not,now
some,of,them,lacked,an,arm,or,a,leg,or,an,eye,many,had,scars,which,would,ache,in,rainy,weather,if,they,lived,for,seventy,years,but,these,seemed,small,matters,now
later,it,would,be,different
old,and,young,talkative,and,taciturn,rich,planter,and,sallow,cracker,they,all,had,two,things,in,common,lice,and,dysentery
the,confederate,soldier,was,so,accustomed,to,his,verminous,state,he,did,not,give,it,a,thought,and,scratched,unconcernedly,even,in,the,presence,of,ladies
as,for,dysentery,the,bloody,flux,as,the,ladies,delicately,called,it,it,seemed,to,have,spared,no,one,from,private,to,general
four,years,of,half-starvation,four,years,of,rations,which,were,coarse,or,green,or,half-putrefied,had,done,its,work,with,them,and,every,soldier,who,stopped,at,tara,was,either,just,recovering,or,was,actively,suffering,from,it
dey,ain',a,soun',set,of,bowels,in,de,whole,confedrut,ahmy,observed,mammy,darkly,as,she,sweated,over,the,fire,brewing,a,bitter,concoction,of,blackberry,roots,which,had,been,ellen's,sovereign,remedy,for,such,afflictions
it's,mah,notion,dat,'twarn't,de,yankees,whut,beat,our,gempmum

one,and,all,mammy,dosed,them,never,waiting,to,ask,foolish,questions,about,the,state,of,their,organs,and,one,and,all,they,drank,her,doses,meekly,and,with,wry,faces,remembering,perhaps,other,stern,black,faces,in,far-off,places,and,other,inexorable,black,hands,holding,medicine,spoons
in,the,matter,of,comp'ny,mammy,was,equally,adamant
no,lice-,ridden,soldier,should,come,into,tara
she,marched,them,behind,a,clump,of,thick,bushes,relieved,them,of,their,uniforms,gave,them,a,basin,of,water,and,strong,lye,soap,to,wash,with,and,provided,them,with,quilts,and,blankets,to,cover,their,nakedness,while,she,boiled,their,clothing,in,her,huge,wash,pot
it,was,useless,for,the,girls,to,argue,hotly,that,such,conduct,humiliated,the,soldiers
mammy,replied,that,the,girls,would,be,a,sight,more,humiliated,if,they,found,lice,upon,themselves
when,the,soldiers,began,arriving,almost,daily,mammy,protested,against,their,being,allowed,to,use,the,bedrooms
always,she,feared,lest,some,louse,had,escaped,her
rather,than,argue,the,matter,scarlett,turned,the,parlor,with,its,deep,velvet,rug,into,a,dormitory
mammy,cried,out,equally,loudly,at,the,sacrilege,of,soldiers,being,permitted,to,sleep,on,miss,ellen's,rug,but,scarlett,was,firm
they,had,to,sleep,somewhere
and,in,the,months,after,the,surrender,the,deep,soft,nap,began,to,show,signs,of,wear,and,finally,the,heavy,warp,and,woof,showed,through,in,spots,where,heels,had,worn,it,and,spurs,dug,carelessly
of,each,soldier,they,asked,eagerly,of,ashley
suellen,bridling,always,asked,news,of,mr,kennedy
but,none,of,the,soldiers,had,ever,heard,of,them,nor,were,they,inclined,to,talk,about,the,missing
it,was,enough,that,they,themselves,were,alive,and,they,did,not,care,to,think,of,the,thousands,in,unmarked,graves,who,would,never,come,home
the,family,tried,to,bolster,melanie's,courage,after,each,of,these,disappointments
of,course,ashley,hadn't,died,in,prison
some,yankee,chaplain,would,have,written,if,this,were,true
of,course,he,was,coming,home,but,his,prison,was,so,far,away
why,goodness,it,took,days,riding,on,a,train,to,make,the,trip,and,if,ashley,was,walking,like,these,men
why,hadn't,he,written
well,darling,you,know,what,the,mails,are,now,so,uncertain,and,slipshod,even,where,mail,routes,are,re-established
but,suppose,suppose,he,had,died,on,the,way,home
now,melanie,some,yankee,woman,would,have,surely,written,us,about,it
yankee,women
bah
melly,there,are,some,nice,yankee,women
oh,yes,there,are
god,couldn't,make,a,whole,nation,without,having,some,nice,women,in,it
scarlett,you,remember,we,did,meet,a,nice,yankee,woman,at,saratoga,that,time,scarlett,tell,melly,about,her
nice,my,foot
replied,scarlert
she,asked,me,how,many,bloodhounds,we,kept,to,chase,our,darkies,with
i,agree,with,melly
i,never,saw,a,nice,yankee,male,or,female
but,don't,cry,melly
ashley'll,come,home
it's,a,long,walk,and,maybe,maybe,he,hasn't,got,any,boots
then,at,the,thought,of,ashley,barefooted,scarlett,could,have,cried
let,other,soldiers,limp,by,in,rags,with,their,feet,tied,up,in,sacks,and,strips,of,carpet,but,not,ashley
he,should,come,home,on,a,prancing,horse,dressed,in,fine,clothes,and,shining,boots,a,plume,in,his,hat
it,was,the,final,degradation,for,her,to,think,of,ashley,reduced,to,the,state,of,these,other,soldiers
one,afternoon,in,june,when,everyone,at,tara,was,assembled,on,the,back,porch,eagerly,watching,pork,cut,the,first,half-ripe,watermelon,of,the,season,they,heard,hooves,on,the,gravel,of,the,front,drive
prissy,started,languidly,toward,the,front,door,while,those,left,behind,argued,hotly,as,to,whether,they,should,hide,the,melon,or,keep,it,for,supper,should,the,caller,at,the,door,prove,to,be,a,soldier
melly,and,carreen,whispered,that,the,soldier,guest,should,have,a,share,and,scarlett,backed,by,suellen,and,mammy,hissed,to,pork,to,hide,it,quickly
don't,be,a,goose,girls
there's,not,enough,for,us,as,it,is,and,if,there,are,two,or,three,famished,soldiers,out,there,none,of,us,will,even,get,a,taste,said,scarlett
while,pork,stood,with,the,little,melon,clutched,to,him,uncertain,as,to,the,final,decision,they,heard,prissy,cry,out
gawdlmighty

cried,scarlett,leaping,up,from,the,steps,and,racing,through,the,hall,with,melly,at,her,shoulder,and,the,others,streaming,after,her
ashley
she,thought
oh,perhaps
it's,uncle,peter
miss,pittypat's,uncle,peter
they,all,ran,out,to,the,front,porch,and,saw,the,tall,grizzled,old,despot,of,aunt,pitty's,house,climbing,down,from,a,rat-tailed,nag,on,which,a,section,of,quilting,had,been,strapped
on,his,wide,black,face,accustomed,dignity,strove,with,delight,at,seeing,old,friends,with,the,result,that,his,brow,was,furrowed,in,a,frown,but,his,mouth,was,hanging,open,like,a,happy,toothless,old,hound's
everyone,ran,down,the,steps,to,greet,him,black,and,white,shaking,his,hand,and,asking,questions,but,melly's,voice,rose,above,them,all
auntie,isn't,sick,is,she
no'm
she's,po'ly,thank,god,answered,peter,fastening,a,severe,look,first,on,melly,and,then,on,scarlett,so,that,they,suddenly,felt,guilty,but,could,think,of,no,reason,why

she,stood,rooted,unable,to,move,from,the,position,to,which,she,had,leaped,when,she,heard,his,words,staring,at,the,old,man,who,stood,feebly,waving,a,letter
his,old,black,face,was,as,pitiful,as,a,child's,under,its,mother's,disapproval,his,dignity,collapsed
for,a,moment,she,could,not,speak,or,move,and,though,her,mind,shouted,he,isn't,dead
he's,coming,home
the,knowledge,brought,neither,joy,nor,excitement,only,a,stunned,immobility
uncle,peter's,voice,came,as,from,a,far,distance,plaintive,placating

scarlett,snatched,the,letter,from,his,hand
it,was,addressed,to,melly,in,miss,pitty's,writing,but,that,did,not,make,her,hesitate,a,moment
she,ripped,it,open,and,miss,pitty's,inclosed,note,fell,to,the,ground
within,the,envelope,there,was,a,piece,of,folded,paper,grimy,from,the,dirty,pocket,in,which,it,had,been,carried,creased,and,ragged,about,the,edges
it,bore,the,inscription,in,ashley's,hand,mrs,george,ashley,wilkes,care,miss,sarah,jane,hamilton,atlanta,or,twelve,oaks,jonesboro,ga
with,fingers,that,shook,she,opened,it,and,read
beloved,i,am,coming,home,to,you
tears,began,to,stream,down,her,face,so,that,she,could,not,read,and,her,heart,swelled,up,until,she,felt,she,could,not,bear,the,joy,of,it
clutching,the,letter,to,her,she,raced,up,the,porch,steps,and,down,the,hall,past,the,parlor,where,all,the,inhabitants,of,tara,were,getting,in,one,another's,way,as,they,worked,over,the,unconscious,melanie,and,into,ellen's,office
she,shut,the,door,and,locked,it,and,flung,herself,down,on,the,sagging,old,sofa,crying,laughing,kissing,the,letter
beloved,she,whispered,i,am,coming,home,to,you
common,sense,told,them,that,unless,ashley,developed,wings,it,would,be,weeks,or,even,months,before,he,could,travel,from,illinois,to,georgia,but,hearts,nevertheless,beat,wildly,whenever,a,soldier,turned,into,the,avenue,at,tara
each,bearded,scarecrow,might,be,ashley
and,if,it,were,not,ashley,perhaps,the,soldier,would,have,news,of,him,or,a,letter,from,aunt,pitty,about,him
black,and,white,they,rushed,to,the,front,porch,every,time,they,heard,footsteps
the,sight,of,a,uniform,was,enough,to,bring,everyone,flying,from,the,woodpile,the,pasture,and,the,cotton,patch
for,a,month,after,the,letter,came,work,was,almost,at,a,standstill
no,one,wanted,to,be,out,of,the,house,when,he,arrived
scarlett,least,of,all
and,she,could,not,insist,on,the,others,attending,to,their,duties,when,she,so,neglected,hers
but,when,the,weeks,crawled,by,and,ashley,did,not,come,or,any,news,of,him,tara,settled,back,into,its,old,routine
longing,hearts,could,only,stand,so,much,of,longing
an,uneasy,fear,crept,into,scarlett's,mind,that,something,had,happened,to,him,along,the,way
rock,island,was,so,far,away,and,he,might,have,been,weak,or,sick,when,released,from,prison
and,he,had,no,money,and,was,tramping,through,a,country,where,confederates,were,hated
if,only,she,knew,where,he,was,she,would,send,money,to,him,send,every,penny,she,had,and,let,the,family,go,hungry,so,he,could,come,home,swiftly,on,the,train
beloved,i,am,coming,home,to,you
in,the,first,rush,of,joy,when,her,eyes,met,those,words,they,had,meant,only,that,ashley,was,coming,home,to,her
now,in,the,light,of,cooler,reason,it,was,melanie,to,whom,he,was,returning,melanie,who,went,about,the,house,these,days,singing,with,joy
occasionally,scarlett,wondered,bitterly,why,melanie,could,not,have,died,in,childbirth,in,atlanta
that,would,have,made,things,perfect
then,she,could,have,married,ashley,after,a,decent,interval,and,made,little,beau,a,good,stepmother,too
when,such,thoughts,came,she,did,not,pray,hastily,to,god,telling,him,she,did,not,mean,it
god,did,not,frighten,her,any,more
soldiers,came,singly,and,in,pairs,and,dozens,and,they,were,always,hungry
scarlett,thought,despairingly,that,a,plague,of,locusts,would,be,more,welcome
she,cursed,again,the,old,custom,of,hospitality,which,had,flowered,in,the,era,of,plenty,the,custom,which,would,not,permit,any,traveler,great,or,humble,to,go,on,his,journey,without,a,night's,lodging,food,for,himself,and,his,horse,and,the,utmost,courtesy,the,house,could,give
she,knew,that,era,had,passed,forever,but,the,rest,of,the,household,did,not,nor,did,the,soldiers,and,each,soldier,was,welcomed,as,if,he,were,a,long-,awaited,guest
as,the,never-ending,line,went,by,her,heart,hardened
they,were,eating,the,food,meant,for,the,mouths,of,tara,vegetables,over,whose,long,rows,she,had,wearied,her,back,food,she,had,driven,endless,miles,to,buy
food,was,so,hard,to,get,and,the,money,in,the,yankee's,wallet,would,not,last,forever
only,a,few,greenbacks,and,the,two,gold,pieces,were,left,now
why,should,she,feed,this,horde,of,hungry,men
the,war,was,over
they,would,never,again,stand,between,her,and,danger
so,she,gave,orders,to,pork,that,when,soldiers,were,in,the,house,the,table,should,be,set,sparely
this,order,prevailed,until,she,noticed,that,melanie,who,had,never,been,strong,since,beau,was,born,was,inducing,pork,to,put,only,dabs,of,food,on,her,plate,and,giving,her,share,to,the,soldiers
you'll,have,to,stop,it,melanie,she,scolded
you're,half,sick,yourself,and,if,you,don't,eat,more,you'll,be,sick,in,bed,and,we'll,have,to,nurse,you
let,these,men,go,hungry
they,can,stand,it
they've,stood,it,for,four,years,and,it,won't,hurt,them,to,stand,it,a,little,while,longer
melanie,turned,to,her,and,on,her,face,was,the,first,expression,of,naked,emotion,scarlett,had,ever,seen,in,those,serene,eyes
oh,scarlett,don't,scold,me
let,me,do,it
you,don't,know,how,it,helps,me
every,time,i,give,some,poor,man,my,share,i,think,that,maybe,somewhere,on,the,road,up,north,some,woman,is,giving,my,ashley,a,share,of,her,dinner,and,it's,helping,him,to,get,home,to,me
my,ashley
beloved,i,am,coming,home,to,you
scarlett,turned,away,wordless
after,that,melanie,noticed,there,was,more,food,on,the,table,when,guests,were,present,even,though,scarlett,might,grudge,them,every,mouthful
when,the,soldiers,were,too,ill,to,go,on,and,there,were,many,such,scarlett,put,them,to,bed,with,none,too,good,grace
each,sick,man,meant,another,mouth,to,feed
someone,had,to,nurse,him,and,that,meant,one,less,worker,at,the,business,of,fence,building,hoeing,weeding,and,plowing
one,boy,on,whose,face,a,blond,fuzz,had,just,begun,to,sprout,was,dumped,on,the,front,porch,by,a,mounted,soldier,bound,for,fayetteville
he,had,found,him,unconscious,by,the,roadside,and,had,brought,him,across,his,saddle,to,tara,the,nearest,house
the,girls,thought,he,must,be,one,of,the,little,cadets,who,had,been,called,out,of,military,school,when,sherman,approached,milledgeville,but,they,never,knew,for,he,died,without,regaining,consciousness,and,a,search,of,his,pockets,yielded,no,information
a,nice-looking,boy,obviously,a,gentleman,and,somewhere,to,the,south,some,woman,was,watching,the,roads,wondering,where,he,was,and,when,he,was,coming,home,just,as,she,and,melanie,with,a,wild,hope,in,their,hearts,watched,every,bearded,figure,that,came,up,their,walk
they,buried,the,cadet,in,the,family,burying,ground,next,to,the,three,little,o'hara,boys,and,melanie,cried,sharply,as,pork,filled,in,the,grave,wondering,in,her,heart,if,strangers,were,doing,this,same,thing,to,the,tall,body,of,ashley
will,benteen,was,another,soldier,like,the,nameless,boy,who,arrived,unconscious,across,the,saddle,of,a,comrade
will,was,acutely,ill,with,pneumonia,and,when,the,girls,put,him,to,bed,they,feared,he,would,soon,join,the,boy,in,the,burying,ground
he,had,the,sallow,malarial,face,of,the,south,georgia,cracker,pale,pinkish,hair,and,washed-out,blue,eyes,which,even,in,delirium,were,patient,and,mild
one,of,his,legs,was,gone,at,the,knee,and,to,the,stump,was,fitted,a,roughly,whittled,wooden,peg
he,was,obviously,a,cracker,just,as,the,boy,they,had,buried,so,short,a,while,ago,was,obviously,a,planter's,son
just,how,the,girls,knew,this,they,could,not,say
certainly,will,was,no,dirtier,no,more,hairy,no,more,lice,infested,than,many,fine,gentlemen,who,came,to,tara
certainly,the,language,he,used,in,his,delirium,was,no,less,grammatical,than,that,of,the,tarleton,twins
but,they,knew,instinctively,as,they,knew,thoroughbred,horses,from,scrubs,that,he,was,not,of,their,class
but,this,knowledge,did,not,keep,them,from,laboring,to,save,him
emaciated,from,a,year,in,a,yankee,prison,exhausted,by,his,long,tramp,on,his,ill-fitting,wooden,peg,he,had,little,strength,to,combat,pneumonia,and,for,days,he,lay,in,the,bed,moaning,trying,to,get,up,fighting,battles,over,again
never,once,did,he,call,for,mother,wife,sister,or,sweetheart,and,this,omission,worried,carreen
a,man,ought,to,have,some,folks,she,said
and,he,sounds,like,he,didn't,have,a,soul,in,the,world
for,all,his,lankiness,he,was,tough,and,good,nursing,pulled,him,through
the,day,came,when,his,pale,blue,eyes,perfectly,cognizant,of,his,surroundings,fell,upon,carreen,sitting,beside,him,telling,her,rosary,beads,the,morning,sun,shining,through,her,fair,hair
then,you,warn't,a,dream,after,all,he,said,in,his,flat,toneless,voice
i,hope,i,ain't,troubled,you,too,much,ma'm
his,convalescence,was,a,long,one,and,he,lay,quietly,looking,out,of,the,window,at,the,magnolias,and,causing,very,little,trouble,to,anyone
carreen,liked,him,because,of,his,placid,and,unembarrassed,silences
she,would,sit,beside,him,through,the,long,hot,afternoons,fanning,him,and,saying,nothing
carreen,had,very,little,to,say,these,days,as,she,moved,delicate,and,wraithlike,about,the,tasks,which,were,within,her,strength
she,prayed,a,good,deal,for,when,scarlett,came,into,her,room,without,knocking,she,always,found,her,on,her,knees,by,her,bed
the,sight,never,failed,to,annoy,her,for,scarlett,felt,that,the,time,for,prayer,had,passed
if,god,had,seen,fit,to,punish,them,so,then,god,could,very,well,do,without,prayers
religion,had,always,been,a,bargaining,process,with,scarlett
she,promised,god,good,behavior,in,exchange,for,favors
god,had,broken,the,bargain,time,and,again,to,her,way,of,thinking,and,she,felt,that,she,owed,him,nothing,at,all,now
and,whenever,she,found,carreen,on,her,knees,when,she,should,have,been,taking,an,afternoon,nap,or,doing,the,mending,she,felt,that,carreen,was,shirking,her,share,of,the,burdens
she,said,as,much,to,will,benteen,one,afternoon,when,he,was,able,to,sit,up,in,a,chair,and,was,startled,when,he,said,in,his,flat,voice,let,her,be,miss,scarlett
it,comforts,her
comforts,her
yes,she's,prayin',for,your,ma,and,him
who,is,'him'
his,faded,blue,eyes,looked,at,her,from,under,sandy,lashes,without,surprise
nothing,seemed,to,surprise,or,excite,him
perhaps,he,had,seen,too,much,of,the,unexpected,ever,to,be,startled,again
that,scarlett,did,not,know,what,was,in,her,sister's,heart,did,not,seem,odd,to,him
he,took,it,as,naturally,as,he,did,the,fact,that,carreen,had,found,comfort,in,talking,to,him,a,stranger
her,beau,that,boy,brent,something-or-other,who,was,killed,at,gettysburg
her,beau
said,scarlett,shortly
her,beau,nothing
he,and,his,brother,were,my,beaux
yes,so,she,told,me
looks,like,most,of,the,county,was,your,beaux
but,all,the,same,he,was,her,beau,after,you,turned,him,down,because,when,he,come,home,on,his,last,furlough,they,got,engaged
she,said,he,was,the,only,boy,she'd,ever,cared,about,and,so,it,kind,of,comforts,her,to,pray,for,him
well,fiddle-dee-dee
said,scarlett,a,very,small,dart,of,jealousy,entering,her
she,looked,curiously,at,this,lanky,man,with,his,bony,stooped,shoulders,his,pinkish,hair,and,calm,unwavering,eyes
so,he,knew,things,about,her,own,family,which,she,had,not,troubled,to,discover
so,that,was,why,carreen,mooned,about,praying,all,the,time
well,she'd,get,over,it
lots,of,girls,got,over,dead,sweethearts,yes,dead,husbands,too
she'd,certainly,gotten,over,charles
and,she,knew,one,girl,in,atlanta,who,had,been,widowed,three,times,by,the,war,and,was,still,able,to,take,notice,of,men
she,said,as,much,to,will,but,he,shook,his,head
not,miss,carreen,he,said,with,finality
will,was,pleasant,to,talk,to,because,he,had,so,little,to,say,and,yet,was,so,understanding,a,listener
she,told,him,about,her,problems,of,weeding,and,hoeing,and,planting,of,fattening,the,hogs,and,breeding,the,cow,and,he,gave,good,advice,for,he,had,owned,a,small,farm,in,south,georgia,and,two,negroes
he,knew,his,slaves,were,free,now,and,the,farm,gone,to,weeds,and,seedling,pines
his,sister,his,only,relative,had,moved,to,texas,with,her,husband,years,ago,and,he,was,alone,in,the,world
yet,none,of,these,things,seemed,to,bother,him,any,more,than,the,leg,he,had,left,in,virginia
yes,will,was,a,comfort,to,scarlett,after,hard,days,when,the,negroes,muttered,and,suellen,nagged,and,cried,and,gerald,asked,too,frequently,where,ellen,was
she,could,tell,will,anything
she,even,told,him,of,killing,the,yankee,and,glowed,with,pride,when,he,commented,briefly,good,work
eventually,all,the,family,found,their,way,to,will's,room,to,air,their,troubles,even,mammy,who,had,at,first,been,distant,with,him,because,he,was,not,quality,and,had,owned,only,two,slaves
when,he,was,able,to,totter,about,the,house,he,turned,his,hands,to,weaving,baskets,of,split,oak,and,mending,the,furniture,ruined,by,the,yankees
he,was,clever,at,whittling,and,wade,was,constantly,by,his,side,for,he,whittled,out,toys,for,him,the,only,toys,the,little,boy,had
with,will,in,the,house,everyone,felt,safe,in,leaving,wade,and,the,two,babies,while,they,went,about,their,tasks,for,he,could,care,for,them,as,deftly,as,mammy,and,only,melly,surpassed,him,at,soothing,the,screaming,black,and,white,babies
you've,been,mighty,good,to,me,miss,scarlett,he,said,and,me,a,stranger,and,nothin',to,you,all
i've,caused,you,a,heap,of,trouble,and,worry,and,if,it's,all,the,same,to,you,i'm,goin',to,stay,here,and,help,you,all,with,the,work,till,i've,paid,you,back,some,for,your,trouble
i,can't,ever,pay,it,all,'cause,there,ain't,no,payment,a,man,can,give,for,his,life
so,he,stayed,and,gradually,unobtrusively,a,large,part,of,the,burden,of,tara,shifted,from,scarlett's,shoulders,to,the,bony,shoulders,of,will,benteen
it,was,september,and,time,to,pick,the,cotton
will,benteen,sat,on,the,front,steps,at,scarlett's,feet,in,the,pleasant,sunshine,of,the,early,autumn,afternoon,and,his,flat,voice,went,on,and,on,languidly,about,the,exorbitant,costs,of,ginning,the,cotton,at,the,new,gin,near,fayetteville
however,he,had,learned,that,day,in,fayetteville,that,he,could,cut,this,expense,a,fourth,by,lending,the,horse,and,wagon,for,two,weeks,to,the,gin,owner
he,had,delayed,closing,the,bargain,until,he,discussed,it,with,scarlett
she,looked,at,the,lank,figure,leaning,against,the,porch,column,chewing,a,straw
undoubtedly,as,mammy,frequently,declared,will,was,something,the,lord,had,provided,and,scarlett,often,wondered,how,tara,could,have,lived,through,the,last,few,months,without,him
he,never,had,much,to,say,never,displayed,any,energy,never,seemed,to,take,much,interest,in,anything,that,went,on,about,him,but,he,knew,everything,about,everybody,at,tara
and,he,did,things
he,did,them,silently,patiently,and,competently
though,he,had,only,one,leg,he,could,work,faster,than,pork
and,he,could,get,work,out,of,pork,which,was,to,scarlett,a,marvelous,thing
when,the,cow,had,the,colic,and,the,horse,fell,ill,with,a,mysterious,ailment,which,threatened,to,remove,him,permanently,from,them,will,sat,up,nights,with,them,and,saved,them
that,he,was,a,shrewd,trader,brought,him,scarlett's,respect,for,he,could,ride,out,in,the,mornings,with,a,bushel,or,two,of,apples,sweet,potatoes,and,other,vegetables,and,return,with,seeds,lengths,of,cloth,flour,and,other,necessities,which,she,knew,she,could,never,have,acquired,good,trader,though,she,was
he,had,gradually,slipped,into,the,status,of,a,member,of,the,family,and,slept,on,a,cot,in,the,little,dressing,room,off,gerald's,room
he,said,nothing,of,leaving,tara,and,scarlett,was,careful,not,to,question,him,fearful,that,he,might,leave,them
sometimes,she,thought,that,if,he,were,anybody,and,had,any,gumption,he,would,go,home,even,if,he,no,longer,had,a,home
but,even,with,this,thought,she,would,pray,fervently,that,he,would,remain,indefinitely
it,was,so,convenient,to,have,a,man,about,the,house
she,thought,too,that,if,carreen,had,the,sense,of,a,mouse,she,would,see,that,will,cared,for,her
scarlett,would,have,been,eternally,grateful,to,will,had,he,asked,her,for,carreen's,hand
of,course,before,the,war,will,would,certainly,not,have,been,an,eligible,suitor
he,was,not,of,the,planter,class,at,all,though,he,was,not,poor,white
he,was,just,plain,cracker,a,small,farmer,half-educated,prone,to,grammatical,errors,and,ignorant,of,some,of,the,finer,manners,the,o'haras,were,accustomed,to,in,gentlemen
in,fact,scarlett,wondered,if,he,could,be,called,a,gentleman,at,all,and,decided,that,he,couldn't
melanie,hotly,defended,him,saying,that,anyone,who,had,will's,kind,heart,and,thoughtfulness,of,others,was,of,gentle,birth
scarlett,knew,that,ellen,would,have,fainted,at,the,thought,of,a,daughter,of,hers,marrying,such,a,man,but,now,scarlett,had,been,by,necessity,forced,too,far,away,from,ellen's,teachings,to,let,that,worry,her
men,were,scarce,girls,had,to,marry,someone,and,tara,had,to,have,a,man
but,carreen,deeper,and,deeper,immersed,in,her,prayer,book,and,every,day,losing,more,of,her,touch,with,the,world,of,realities,treated,will,as,gently,as,a,brother,and,took,him,as,much,for,granted,as,she,did,pork
if,carreen,had,any,sense,of,gratitude,to,me,for,what,i've,done,for,her,she'd,marry,him,and,not,let,him,get,away,from,here,scarlett,thought,indignantly
but,no,she,must,spend,her,time,mooning,about,a,silly,boy,who,probably,never,gave,her,a,serious,thought
so,will,remained,at,tara,for,what,reason,she,did,not,know,and,she,found,his,businesslike,man-to-man,attitude,with,her,both,pleasant,and,helpful
he,was,gravely,deferential,to,the,vague,gerald,but,it,was,to,scarlett,that,he,turned,as,the,real,head,of,the,house
she,gave,her,approval,to,the,plan,of,hiring,out,the,horse,even,though,it,meant,the,family,would,be,without,any,means,of,transportation,temporarily
suellen,would,be,especially,grieved,at,this
her,greatest,joy,lay,in,going,to,jonesboro,or,fayetteville,with,will,when,he,drove,over,on,business
adorned,in,the,assembled,best,of,the,family,she,called,on,old,friends,heard,all,the,gossip,of,the,county,and,felt,herself,again,miss,o'hara,of,tara
suellen,never,missed,the,opportunity,to,leave,the,plantation,and,give,herself,airs,among,people,who,did,not,know,she,weeded,the,garden,and,made,beds
miss,fine,airs,will,just,have,to,do,without,gadding,for,two,weeks,thought,scarlett,and,we'll,have,to,put,up,with,her,nagging,and,her,bawling
melanie,joined,them,on,the,veranda,the,baby,in,her,arms,and,spreading,an,old,blanket,on,the,floor,set,little,beau,down,to,crawl
since,ashley's,letter,melanie,had,divided,her,time,between,glowing,singing,happiness,and,anxious,longing
but,happy,or,depressed,she,was,too,thin,too,white
she,did,her,share,of,the,work,uncomplainingly,but,she,was,always,ailing
old,dr,fontaine,diagnosed,her,trouble,as,female,complaint,and,concurred,with,dr,meade,in,saying,she,should,never,have,had,beau
and,he,said,frankly,that,another,baby,would,kill,her
when,i,was,over,to,fayetteville,today,said,will,i,found,somethin',right,cute,that,i,thought,would,interest,you,ladies,and,i,brought,it,home
he,fumbled,in,his,back,pants,pocket,and,brought,out,the,wallet,of,calico,stiffened,with,bark,which,carreen,had,made,him
from,it,he,drew,a,confederate,bill
if,you,think,confederate,money,is,cute,will,i,certainly,don't,said,scarlett,shortly,for,the,very,sight,of,confederate,money,made,her,mad
we've,got,three,thousand,dollars,of,it,in,pa's,trunk,this,minute,and,mammy's,after,me,to,let,her,paste,it,over,the,holes,in,the,attic,walls,so,the,draft,won't,get,her
and,i,think,i'll,do,it
then,it'll,be,good,for,something
'imperious,caesar,dead,and,turned,to,clay,',said,melanie,with,a,sad,smile
don't,do,that,scarlett
keep,it,for,wade
he'll,be,proud,of,it,some,day
well,i,don't,know,nothin',about,imperious,caesar,said,will,patiently,but,what,i've,got,is,in,line,with,what,you've,just,said,about,wade,miss,melly
it's,a,poem,pasted,on,the,back,of,this,bill
i,know,miss,scarlett,ain't,much,on,poems,but,i,thought,this,might,interest,her
he,turned,the,bill,over
on,its,back,was,pasted,a,strip,of,coarse,brown,wrapping,paper,inscribed,in,pale,homemade,ink
will,cleared,his,throat,and,read,slowly,and,with,difficulty
the,name,is,'lines,on,the,back,of,a,confederate,note,',he,said
representing,nothing,on,god's,earth,now,and,naught,in,the,waters,below,it,as,the,pledge,of,nation,that's,passed,away,keep,it,dear,friend,and,show,it
show,it,to,those,who,will,lend,an,ear,to,the,tale,this,trifle,will,tell,of,liberty,born,of,patriots',dream,of,a,storm-cradled,nation,that,fell
oh,how,beautiful
how,touching
cried,melanie
scarlett,you,mustn't,give,the,money,to,mammy,to,paste,in,the,attic
it's,more,than,paper,just,like,this,poem,said,'the,pledge,of,a,nation,that's,passed,away,'
oh,melly,don't,be,sentimental
paper,is,paper,and,we've,got,little,enough,of,it,and,i'm,tired,of,hearing,mammy,grumble,about,the,cracks,in,the,attic
i,hope,when,wade,grows,up,i'll,have,plenty,of,greenbacks,to,give,him,instead,of,confederate,trash
will,who,had,been,enticing,little,beau,across,the,blanket,with,the,bill,during,this,argument,looked,up,and,shading,his,eyes,glanced,down,the,driveway
more,company,he,said,squinting,in,the,sun
another,soldier
scarlett,followed,his,gaze,and,saw,a,familiar,sight,a,bearded,man,coming,slowly,up,the,avenue,under,the,cedars,a,man,clad,in,a,ragged,mixture,of,blue,and,gray,uniforms,head,bowed,tiredly,feet,dragging,slowly
i,thought,we,were,about,through,with,soldiers,she,said
i,hope,this,one,isn't,very,hungry
he'll,be,hungry,said,will,briefly
melanie,rose
i'd,better,tell,dilcey,to,set,an,extra,plate,she,said,and,warn,mammy,not,to,get,the,poor,thing's,clothes,off,his,back,too,abruptly,and
she,stopped,so,suddenly,that,scarlett,turned,to,look,at,her
melanie's,thin,hand,was,at,her,throat,clutching,it,as,if,it,was,torn,with,pain,and,scarlett,could,see,the,veins,beneath,the,white,skin,throbbing,swiftly
her,face,went,whiter,and,her,brown,eyes,dilated,enormously
she's,going,to,faint,thought,scarlett,leaping,to,her,feet,and,catching,her,arm
but,in,an,instant,melanie,threw,off,her,hand,and,was,down,the,steps
down,the,graveled,path,she,flew,skimming,lightly,as,a,bird,her,faded,skirts,streaming,behind,her,her,arms,outstretched
then,scarlett,knew,the,truth,with,the,impact,of,a,blow
she,reeled,back,against,an,upright,of,the,porch,as,the,man,lifted,a,face,covered,with,a,dirty,blond,beard,and,stopped,still,looking,toward,the,house,as,if,he,was,too,weary,to,take,another,step
her,heart,leaped,and,stopped,and,then,began,racing,as,melly,with,incoherent,cries,threw,herself,into,the,dirty,soldier's,arms,and,his,head,bent,down,toward,hers
with,rapture,scarlett,took,two,running,steps,forward,but,was,checked,when,will's,hand,closed,upon,her,skirt
don't,spoil,it,he,said,quietly
turn,me,loose,you,fool
turn,me,loose
it's,ashley
he,did,not,relax,his,grip
after,all,he's,her,husband,ain't,he
will,asked,calmly,and,looking,down,at,him,in,a,confusion,of,joy,and,impotent,fury,scarlett,saw,in,the,quiet,depths,of,his,eyes,understanding,and,pity
part,four
chapter,xxxi
on,a,cold,january,afternoon,in,1866,scarlett,sat,in,the,office,writing,a,letter,to,aunt,pitty,explaining,in,detail,for,the,tenth,time,why,neither,she,melanie,nor,ashley,could,come,back,to,atlanta,to,live,with,her
she,wrote,impatiently,because,she,knew,aunt,pitty,would,read,no,farther,than,the,opening,lines,and,then,write,her,again,wailing,but,i'm,afraid,to,live,by,myself
her,hands,were,chilled,and,she,paused,to,rub,them,together,and,to,scuff,her,feet,deeper,into,the,strip,of,old,quilting,wrapped,about,them
the,soles,of,her,slippers,were,practically,gone,and,were,reinforced,with,pieces,of,carpet
the,carpet,kept,her,feet,off,the,floor,but,did,little,to,keep,them,warm
that,morning,will,had,taken,the,horse,to,jonesboro,to,get,him,shod
scarlett,thought,grimly,that,things,were,indeed,at,a,pretty,pass,when,horses,had,shoes,and,people's,feet,were,as,bare,as,yard,dogs'
she,picked,up,her,quill,to,resume,her,writing,but,laid,it,down,when,she,heard,will,coming,in,at,the,back,door
she,heard,the,thump-,thump,of,his,wooden,leg,in,the,hall,outside,the,office,and,then,he,stopped
she,waited,for,a,moment,for,him,to,enter,and,when,he,made,no,move,she,called,to,him
he,came,in,his,ears,red,from,the,cold,his,pinkish,hair,awry,and,stood,looking,down,at,her,a,faintly,humorous,smile,on,his,lips
miss,scarlett,he,questioned,just,how,much,cash,money,have,you,got
are,you,going,to,try,to,marry,me,for,my,money,will
she,asked,somewhat,crossly
no,ma'm
but,i,just,wanted,to,know
she,stared,at,him,inquiringly
will,didn't,look,serious,but,then,he,never,looked,serious
however,she,felt,that,something,was,wrong
i've,got,ten,dollars,in,gold,she,said
the,last,of,that,yankee's,money
well,ma'm,that,won't,be,enough
enough,for,what
enough,for,the,taxes,he,answered,and,stumping,over,to,the,fireplace,he,leaned,down,and,held,his,red,hands,to,the,blaze
taxes
she,repeated
name,of,god,will
we've,already,paid,the,taxes
yes'm
but,they,say,you,didn't,pay,enough
i,heard,about,it,today,over,to,jonesboro
but,will,i,can't,understand
what,do,you,mean
miss,scarlett,i,sure,hate,to,bother,you,with,more,trouble,when,you've,had,your,share,but,i've,got,to,tell,you
they,say,you,ought,to,paid,lots,more,taxes,than,you,did
they're,runnin',the,assessment,up,on,tara,sky,high,higher,than,any,in,the,county,i'll,be,bound
but,they,can't,make,us,pay,more,taxes,when,we've,already,paid,them,once
miss,scarlett,you,don't,never,go,to,jonesboro,often,and,i'm,glad,you,don't
it,ain't,no,place,for,a,lady,these,days
but,if,you'd,been,there,much,you'd,know,there's,a,mighty,rough,bunch,of,scallawags,and,republicans,and,carpetbaggers,been,runnin',things,recently
they'd,make,you,mad,enough,to,pop
and,then,too,niggers,pushin',white,folks,off,the,sidewalks,and
but,what's,that,got,to,do,with,our,taxes
i'm,gettin',to,it,miss,scarlett
for,some,reason,the,rascals,have,histed,the,taxes,on,tara,till,you'd,think,it,was,a,thousand-,bale,place
after,i,heard,about,it,i,sorter,oozed,around,the,barrooms,pickin',up,gossip,and,i,found,out,that,somebody,wants,to,buy,in,tara,cheap,at,the,sheriff's,sale,if,you,can't,pay,the,extra,taxes
and,everybody,knows,pretty,well,that,you,can't,pay,them
i,don't,know,yet,who,it,is,wants,this,place
i,couldn't,find,out
but,i,think,that,pusillanimous,feller,hilton,that,married,miss,cathleen,knows,because,he,laughed,kind,of,nasty,when,i,tried,to,sound,him,out
will,sat,down,on,the,sofa,and,rubbed,the,stump,of,his,leg
it,ached,in,cold,weather,and,the,wooden,peg,was,neither,well,padded,nor,comfortable
scarlett,looked,at,him,wildly
his,manner,was,so,casual,when,he,was,sounding,the,death,knell,of,tara
sold,out,at,the,sheriff's,sale
where,would,they,all,go
and,tara,belonging,to,some,one,else
no,that,was,unthinkable
she,had,been,so,engrossed,with,the,job,of,making,tara,produce,she,had,paid,little,heed,to,what,was,going,on,in,the,world,outside
now,that,she,had,will,and,ashley,to,attend,to,whatever,business,she,might,have,in,jonesboro,and,fayetteville,she,seldom,left,the,plantation
and,even,as,she,had,listened,with,deaf,ears,to,her,father's,war,talk,in,the,days,before,the,war,came,so,she,had,paid,little,heed,to,will,and,ashley's,discussions,around,the,table,after,supper,about,the,beginnings,of,reconstruction
oh,of,course,she,knew,about,the,scallawags,southerners,who,had,turned,republican,very,profitably,and,the,carpetbaggers,those,yankees,who,came,south,like,buzzards,after,the,surrender,with,all,their,worldly,possessions,in,one,carpetbag
and,she,had,had,a,few,unpleasant,experiences,with,the,freedmen's,bureau
she,had,gathered,also,that,some,of,the,free,negroes,were,getting,quite,insolent
this,last,she,could,hardly,believe,for,she,had,never,seen,an,insolent,negro,in,her,life
but,there,were,many,things,which,will,and,ashley,had,conspired,to,keep,from,her
the,scourge,of,war,had,been,followed,by,the,worse,scourge,of,reconstruction,but,the,two,men,had,agreed,not,to,mention,the,more,alarming,details,when,they,discussed,the,situation,at,home
and,when,scarlett,took,the,trouble,to,listen,to,them,at,all,most,of,what,they,said,went,in,one,ear,and,out,the,other
she,had,heard,ashley,say,that,the,south,was,being,treated,as,a,conquered,province,and,that,vindictiveness,was,the,dominant,policy,of,the,conquerors
but,that,was,the,kind,of,statement,which,meant,less,than,nothing,at,all,to,scarlett
politics,was,men's,business
she,had,heard,will,say,it,looked,to,him,like,the,north,just,wasn't,aiming,to,let,the,south,get,on,its,feet,again
well,thought,scarlett,men,always,had,to,have,something,foolish,to,worry,about
as,far,as,she,was,concerned,the,yankees,hadn't,whipped,her,once,and,they,wouldn't,do,it,this,time
the,thing,to,do,was,to,work,like,the,devil,and,stop,worrying,about,the,yankee,government
after,all,the,war,was,over
scarlett,did,not,realize,that,all,the,rules,of,the,game,had,been,changed,and,that,honest,labor,could,no,longer,earn,its,just,reward
georgia,was,virtually,under,martial,law,now
the,yankee,soldiers,garrisoned,throughout,the,section,and,the,freedmen's,bureau,were,in,complete,command,of,everything,and,they,were,fixing,the,rules,to,suit,themselves
this,bureau,organized,by,the,federal,government,to,take,care,of,the,idle,and,excited,ex-slaves,was,drawing,them,from,the,plantations,into,the,villages,and,cities,by,the,thousands
the,bureau,fed,them,while,they,loafed,and,poisoned,their,minds,against,their,former,owners
gerald's,old,overseer,jonas,wilkerson,was,in,charge,of,the,local,bureau,and,his,assistant,was,hilton,cathleen,calvert's,husband
these,two,industriously,spread,the,rumor,that,the,southerners,and,democrats,were,just,waiting,for,a,good,chance,to,put,the,negroes,back,into,slavery,and,that,the,negroes',only,hope,of,escaping,this,fate,was,the,protection,given,them,by,the,bureau,and,the,republican,party
wilkerson,and,hilton,furthermore,told,the,negroes,they,were,as,good,as,the,whites,in,every,way,and,soon,white,and,negro,marriages,would,be,permitted,soon,the,estates,of,their,former,owners,would,be,divided,and,every,negro,would,be,given,forty,acres,and,a,mule,for,his,own
they,kept,the,negroes,stirred,up,with,tales,of,cruelty,perpetrated,by,the,whites,and,in,a,section,long,famed,for,the,affectionate,relations,between,slaves,and,slave,owners,hate,and,suspicion,began,to,grow
the,bureau,was,backed,up,by,the,soldiers,and,the,military,had,issued,many,and,conflicting,orders,governing,the,conduct,of,the,conquered
it,was,easy,to,get,arrested,even,for,snubbing,the,officials,of,the,bureau
military,orders,had,been,promulgated,concerning,the,schools,sanitation,the,kind,of,buttons,one,wore,on,one's,suit,the,sale,of,commodities,and,nearly,everything,else
wilkerson,and,hilton,had,the,power,to,interfere,in,any,trade,scarlett,might,make,and,to,fix,their,own,prices,on,anything,she,sold,or,swapped
fortunately,scarlett,had,come,into,contact,with,the,two,men,very,little,for,will,had,persuaded,her,to,let,him,handle,the,trading,while,she,managed,the,plantation
in,his,mild-tempered,way,will,had,straightened,out,several,difficulties,of,this,kind,and,said,nothing,to,her,about,them
will,could,get,along,with,carpetbaggers,and,yankees,if,he,had,to
but,now,a,problem,had,arisen,which,was,too,big,for,him,to,handle
the,extra,tax,assessment,and,the,danger,of,losing,tara,were,matters,scarlett,had,to,know,about,and,right,away
she,looked,at,him,with,flashing,eyes
oh,damn,the,yankees
she,cried
isn't,it,enough,that,they've,licked,us,and,beggared,us,without,turning,loose,scoundrels,on,us
the,war,was,over,peace,had,been,declared,but,the,yankees,could,still,rob,her,they,could,still,starve,her,they,could,still,drive,her,from,her,house
and,fool,that,she,was,she,had,thought,through,weary,months,that,if,she,could,just,hold,out,until,spring,everything,would,be,all,right
this,crushing,news,brought,by,will,coming,on,top,of,a,year,of,back-breaking,work,and,hope,deferred,was,the,last,straw
oh,will,and,i,thought,our,troubles,were,all,over,when,the,war,ended
no'm
will,raised,his,lantern-jawed,country-looking,face,and,gave,her,a,long,steady,look
our,troubles,are,just,gettin',started
how,much,extra,taxes,do,they,want,us,to,pay
three,hundred,dollars
she,was,struck,dumb,for,a,moment
three,hundred,dollars
it,might,just,as,well,be,three,million,dollars
why,she,floundered,why,why,then,we've,got,to,raise,three,hundred,somehow
yes'm,and,a,rainbow,and,a,moon,or,two
oh,but,will
they,couldn't,sell,out,tara
why
his,mild,pale,eyes,showed,more,hate,and,bitterness,than,she,thought,possible
oh,couldn't,they
well,they,could,and,they,will,and,they'll,like,doin',it
miss,scarlett,the,country's,gone,plumb,to,hell,if,you'll,pardon,me
those,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,can,vote,and,most,of,us,democrats,can't
can't,no,democrat,in,this,state,vote,if,he,was,on,the,tax,books,for,more,than,two,thousand,dollars,in,'sixty-five
that,lets,out,folks,like,your,pa,and,mr,tarleton,and,the,mcraes,and,the,fontaine,boys
can't,nobody,vote,who,was,a,colonel,and,over,in,the,war,and,miss,scarlett,i,bet,this,state's,got,more,colonels,than,any,state,in,the,confederacy
and,can't,nobody,vote,who,held,office,under,the,confederate,government,and,that,lets,out,everybody,from,the,notaries,to,the,judges,and,the,woods,are,full,of,folks,like,that
fact,is,the,way,the,yankees,have,framed,up,that,amnesty,oath,can't,nobody,who,was,somebody,before,the,war,vote,at,all
not,the,smart,folks,nor,the,quality,folks,nor,the,rich,folks
huh
i,could,vote,if,i,took,their,damned,oath
i,didn't,have,any,money,in,'sixty-five,and,i,certainly,warn't,a,colonel,or,nothin',remarkable
but,i,ain't,goin',to,take,their,oath
not,by,a,dinged,sight
if,the,yankees,had,acted,right,i'd,have,taken,their,oath,of,allegiance,but,i,ain't,now
i,can,be,restored,to,the,union,but,i,can't,be,reconstructed,into,it
i,ain't,goin',to,take,their,oath,even,if,i,don't,never,vote,again,but,scum,like,that,hilton,feller,he,can,vote,and,scoundrels,like,jonas,wilkerson,and,pore,whites,like,the,slatterys,and,no-counts,like,the,macintoshes,they,can,vote
and,they're,runnin',things,now
and,if,they,want,to,come,down,on,you,for,extra,taxes,a,dozen,times,they,can,do,it
just,like,a,nigger,can,kill,a,white,man,and,not,get,hung,or,he,paused,embarrassed,and,the,memory,of,what,had,happened,to,a,lone,white,woman,on,an,isolated,farm,near,lovejoy,was,in,both,their,minds
those,niggers,can,do,anything,against,us,and,the,freedmen's,bureau,and,the,soldiers,will,back,them,up,with,guns,and,we,can't,vote,or,do,nothin',about,it
vote
she,cried

what,on,earth,has,voting,got,to,do,with,all,this,will
it's,taxes,we're,talking,about
will,everybody,knows,what,a,good,plantation,tara,is
we,could,mortgage,it,for,enough,to,pay,the,taxes,if,we,had,to
miss,scarlett,you,ain't,any,fool,but,sometimes,you,talk,like,one
who's,got,any,money,to,lend,you,on,this,property
who,except,the,carpetbaggers,who,are,tryin',to,take,tara,away,from,you
why,everybody's,got,land
everybody's,land,pore
you,can't,give,away,land
i've,got,those,diamond,earbobs,i,got,off,that,yankee
we,could,sell,them
miss,scarlett,who,'round,here,has,got,money,for,earbobs
folks,ain't,got,money,to,buy,side,meat,let,alone,gewgaws
if,you've,got,ten,dollars,in,gold,i,take,oath,that's,more,than,most,folks,have,got
they,were,silent,again,and,scarlett,felt,as,if,she,were,butting,her,head,against,a,stone,wall
there,had,been,so,many,stone,walls,to,butt,against,this,last,year
what,are,we,goin',to,do,miss,scarlett
i,don't,know,she,said,dully,and,felt,that,she,didn't,care
this,was,one,stone,wall,too,many,and,she,suddenly,felt,so,tired,that,her,bones,ached
why,should,she,work,and,struggle,and,wear,herself,out
at,the,end,of,every,struggle,it,seemed,that,defeat,was,waiting,to,mock,her
i,don't,know,she,said
but,don't,let,pa,know
it,might,worry,him
i,won't
have,you,told,anyone
no,i,came,right,to,you
yes,she,thought,everyone,always,came,right,to,her,with,bad,news,and,she,was,tired,of,it
where,is,mr,wilkes
perhaps,he'll,have,some,suggestion
will,turned,his,mild,gaze,on,her,and,she,felt,as,from,the,first,day,when,ashley,came,home,that,he,knew,everything
he's,down,in,the,orchard,splittin',rails
i,heard,his,axe,when,i,was,puttin',up,the,horse
but,he,ain't,got,any,money,any,more,than,we,have
if,i,want,to,talk,to,him,about,it,i,can,can't,i
she,snapped,rising,to,her,feet,and,kicking,the,fragment,of,quilting,from,her,ankles
will,did,not,take,offense,but,continued,rubbing,his,hands,before,the,flame
better,get,your,shawl,miss,scarlett
it's,raw,outside
but,she,went,without,the,shawl,for,it,was,upstairs,and,her,need,to,see,ashley,and,lay,her,troubles,before,him,was,too,urgent,to,wait
how,lucky,for,her,if,she,could,find,him,alone
never,once,since,his,return,had,she,had,a,private,word,with,him
always,the,family,clustered,about,him,always,melanie,was,by,his,side,touching,his,sleeve,now,and,again,to,reassure,herself,he,was,really,there
the,sight,of,that,happy,possessive,gesture,had,aroused,in,scarlett,all,the,jealous,animosity,which,had,slumbered,during,the,months,when,she,had,thought,ashley,probably,dead
now,she,was,determined,to,see,him,alone
this,time,no,one,was,going,to,prevent,her,from,talking,with,him,alone
she,went,through,the,orchard,under,the,bare,boughs,and,the,damp,weeds,beneath,them,wet,her,feet
she,could,hear,the,sound,of,the,axe,ringing,as,ashley,split,into,rails,the,logs,hauled,from,the,swamp
replacing,the,fences,the,yankees,had,so,blithely,burned,was,a,long,hard,task
everything,was,a,long,hard,task,she,thought,wearily,and,she,was,tired,of,it,tired,and,mad,and,sick,of,it,all
if,only,ashley,were,her,husband,instead,of,melanie's,how,sweet,it,would,be,to,go,to,him,and,lay,her,head,upon,his,shoulder,and,cry,and,shove,her,burdens,onto,him,to,work,out,as,best,he,might
she,rounded,a,thicket,of,pomegranate,trees,which,were,shaking,bare,limbs,in,the,cold,wind,and,saw,him,leaning,on,his,axe,wiping,his,forehead,with,the,back,of,his,hand
he,was,wearing,the,remains,of,his,butternut,trousers,and,one,of,gerald's,shirts,a,shirt,which,in,better,times,went,only,to,court,days,and,barbecues,a,ruffled,shirt,which,was,far,too,short,for,its,present,owner
he,had,hung,his,coat,on,a,tree,limb,for,the,work,was,hot,and,he,stood,resting,as,she,came,up,to,him
at,the,sight,of,ashley,in,rags,with,an,axe,in,his,hand,her,heart,went,out,in,a,surge,of,love,and,of,fury,at,fate
she,could,not,bear,to,see,him,in,tatters,working,her,debonaire,immaculate,ashley
his,hands,were,not,made,for,work,or,his,body,for,anything,but,broadcloth,and,fine,linen
god,intended,him,to,sit,in,a,great,house,talking,with,pleasant,people,playing,the,piano,and,writing,things,which,sounded,beautiful,and,made,no,sense,whatsoever
she,could,endure,the,sight,of,her,own,child,in,aprons,made,of,sacking,and,the,girls,in,dingy,old,gingham,could,bear,it,that,will,worked,harder,than,any,field,hand,but,not,ashley
he,was,too,fine,for,all,this,too,infinitely,dear,to,her
she,would,rather,split,logs,herself,than,suffer,while,he,did,it
they,say,abe,lincoln,got,his,start,splitting,rails,he,said,as,she,came,up,to,him
just,think,to,what,heights,i,may,climb
she,frowned
he,was,always,saying,light,things,like,this,about,their,hardships
they,were,deadly,serious,matters,to,her,and,sometimes,she,was,almost,irritated,at,his,remarks
abruptly,she,told,him,will's,news,tersely,and,in,short,words,feeling,a,sense,of,relief,as,she,spoke
surely,he'd,have,something,helpful,to,offer
he,said,nothing,but,seeing,her,shiver,he,took,his,coat,and,placed,it,about,her,shoulders
well,she,said,finally,doesn't,it,occur,to,you,that,we'll,have,to,get,the,money,somewhere
yes,he,said,but,where
i'm,asking,you,she,replied,annoyed
the,sense,of,relief,at,unburdening,herself,had,disappeared
even,if,he,couldn't,help,why,didn't,he,say,something,comforting,even,if,it,was,only,oh,i'm,so,sorry
he,smiled
in,all,these,months,since,i've,been,home,i've,only,heard,of,one,person,rhett,butler,who,actually,has,money,he,said
aunt,pittypat,had,written,melanie,the,week,before,that,rhett,was,back,in,atlanta,with,a,carriage,and,two,fine,horses,and,pocketfuls,of,greenbacks
she,had,intimated,however,that,he,didn't,come,by,them,honestly
aunt,pitty,had,a,theory,largely,shared,by,atlanta,that,rhett,had,managed,to,get,away,with,the,mythical,millions,of,the,confederate,treasury
don't,let's,talk,about,him,said,scarlett,shortly
he's,a,skunk,if,ever,there,was,one
what's,to,become,of,us,all
ashley,put,down,the,axe,and,looked,away,and,his,eyes,seemed,to,be,journeying,to,some,far-off,country,where,she,could,not,follow
i,wonder,he,said
i,wonder,not,only,what,will,become,of,us,at,tara,but,what,will,become,of,everybody,in,the,south
she,felt,like,snapping,out,abruptly,to,hell,with,everybody,in,the,south
what,about,us
but,she,remained,silent,because,the,tired,feeling,was,back,on,her,more,strongly,than,ever
ashley,wasn't,being,any,help,at,all
in,the,end,what,will,happen,will,be,what,has,happened,whenever,a,civilization,breaks,up
the,people,who,have,brains,and,courage,come,through,and,the,ones,who,haven't,are,winnowed,out
at,least,it,has,been,interesting,if,not,comfortable,to,witness,a,gotterdammerung
a,what
a,dusk,of,the,gods
unfortunately,we,southerners,did,think,we,were,gods
for,heaven's,sake,ashley,wilkes
don't,stand,there,and,talk,nonsense,at,me,when,it's,us,who,are,going,to,be,winnowed,out
something,of,her,exasperated,weariness,seemed,to,penetrate,his,mind,calling,it,back,from,its,wanderings,for,he,raised,her,hands,with,tenderness,and,turning,them,palm,up,looked,at,the,calluses
these,are,the,most,beautiful,hands,i,know,he,said,and,kissed,each,palm,lightly
they,are,beautiful,because,they,are,strong,and,every,callus,is,a,medal,scarlett,every,blister,an,award,for,bravery,and,unselfishness
they've,been,roughened,for,all,of,us,your,father,the,girls,melanie,the,baby,the,negroes,and,for,me
my,dear,i,know,what,you,are,thinking
you're,thinking,'here,stands,an,impractical,fool,talking,tommyrot,about,dead,gods,when,living,people,are,in,danger,'
isn't,that,true
she,nodded,wishing,he,would,keep,on,holding,her,hands,forever,but,he,dropped,them
and,you,came,to,me,hoping,i,could,help,you
well,i,can't
his,eyes,were,bitter,as,he,looked,toward,the,axe,and,the,pile,of,logs
my,home,is,gone,and,all,the,money,that,i,so,took,for,granted,i,never,realized,i,had,it
and,i,am,fitted,for,nothing,in,this,world,for,the,world,i,belonged,in,has,gone
i,can't,help,you,scarlett,except,by,learning,with,as,good,grace,as,possible,to,be,a,clumsy,farmer
and,that,won't,keep,tara,for,you
don't,you,think,i,realize,the,bitterness,of,our,situation,living,here,on,your,charity,oh,yes,scarlett,your,charity
i,can,never,repay,you,what,you've,done,for,me,and,for,mine,out,of,the,kindness,of,your,heart
i,realize,it,more,acutely,every,day
and,every,day,i,see,more,clearly,how,helpless,i,am,to,cope,with,what,has,come,on,us,all,every,day,my,accursed,shrinking,from,realities,makes,it,harder,for,me,to,face,the,new,realities
do,you,know,what,i,mean
she,nodded
she,had,no,very,clear,idea,what,he,meant,but,she,clung,breathlessly,on,his,words
this,was,the,first,time,he,had,ever,spoken,to,her,of,the,things,he,was,thinking,when,he,seemed,so,remote,from,her
it,excited,her,as,if,she,were,on,the,brink,of,a,discovery
it's,a,curse,this,not,wanting,to,look,on,naked,realities
until,the,war,life,was,never,more,real,to,me,than,a,shadow,show,on,a,curtain
and,i,preferred,it,so
i,do,not,like,the,outlines,of,things,to,be,too,sharp
i,like,them,gently,blurred,a,little,hazy
he,stopped,and,smiled,faintly,shivering,a,little,as,the,cold,wind,went,through,his,thin,shirt
in,other,words,scarlett,i,am,a,coward
his,talk,of,shadow,shows,and,hazy,outlines,conveyed,no,meaning,to,her,but,his,last,words,were,in,language,she,could,understand
she,knew,they,were,untrue
cowardice,was,not,in,him
every,line,of,his,slender,body,spoke,of,generations,of,brave,and,gallant,men,and,scarlett,knew,his,war,record,by,heart
why,that's,not,so
would,a,coward,have,climbed,on,the,cannon,at,gettysburg,and,rallied,the,men
would,the,general,himself,have,written,melanie,a,letter,about,a,coward
and
that's,not,courage,he,said,tiredly
fighting,is,like,champagne
it,goes,to,the,heads,of,cowards,as,quickly,as,of,heroes
any,fool,can,be,brave,on,a,battle,field,when,it's,be,brave,or,else,be,killed
i'm,talking,of,something,else
and,my,kind,of,cowardice,is,infinitely,worse,than,if,i,had,run,the,first,time,i,heard,a,cannon,fired
his,words,came,slowly,and,with,difficulty,as,if,it,hurt,to,speak,them,and,he,seemed,to,stand,off,and,look,with,a,sad,heart,at,what,he,had,said
had,any,other,man,spoken,so,scarlett,would,have,dismissed,such,protestations,contemptuously,as,mock,modesty,and,a,bid,for,praise
but,ashley,seemed,to,mean,them,and,there,was,a,look,in,his,eyes,which,eluded,her,not,fear,not,apology,but,the,bracing,to,a,strain,which,was,inevitable,and,overwhelming
the,wintry,wind,swept,her,damp,ankles,and,she,shivered,again,but,her,shiver,was,less,from,the,wind,than,from,the,dread,his,words,evoked,in,her,heart
but,ashley,what,are,you,afraid,of
oh,nameless,things
things,which,sound,very,silly,when,they,are,put,into,words
mostly,of,having,life,suddenly,become,too,real,of,being,brought,into,personal,too,personal,contact,with,some,of,the,simple,facts,of,life
it,isn't,that,i,mind,splitting,logs,here,in,the,mud,but,i,do,mind,what,it,stands,for
i,do,mind,very,much,the,loss,of,the,beauty,of,the,old,life,i,loved
scarlett,before,the,war,life,was,beautiful
there,was,a,glamor,to,it,a,perfection,and,a,completeness,and,a,symmetry,to,it,like,grecian,art
maybe,it,wasn't,so,to,everyone
i,know,that,now
but,to,me,living,at,twelve,oaks,there,was,a,real,beauty,to,living
i,belonged,in,that,life
i,was,a,part,of,it
and,now,it,is,gone,and,i,am,out,of,place,in,this,new,life,and,i,am,afraid
now,i,know,that,in,the,old,days,it,was,a,shadow,show,i,watched
i,avoided,everything,which,was,not,shadowy,people,and,situations,which,were,too,real,too,vital
i,resented,their,intrusion
i,tried,to,avoid,you,too,scarlett
you,were,too,full,of,living,and,too,real,and,i,was,cowardly,enough,to,prefer,shadows,and,dreams
but,but,melly
melanie,is,the,gentlest,of,dreams,and,a,part,of,my,dreaming
and,if,the,war,had,not,come,i,would,have,lived,out,my,life,happily,buried,at,twelve,oaks,contentedly,watching,life,go,by,and,never,being,a,part,of,it
but,when,the,war,came,life,as,it,really,is,thrust,itself,against,me
the,first,time,i,went,into,action,it,was,at,bull,run,you,remember,i,saw,my,boyhood,friends,blown,to,bits,and,heard,dying,horses,scream,and,learned,the,sickeningly,horrible,feeling,of,seeing,men,crumple,up,and,spit,blood,when,i,shot,them
but,those,weren't,the,worst,things,about,the,war,scarlett
the,worst,thing,about,the,war,was,the,people,i,had,to,live,with
i,had,sheltered,myself,from,people,all,my,life,i,had,carefully,selected,my,few,friends
but,the,war,taught,me,i,had,created,a,world,of,my,own,with,dream,people,in,it
it,taught,me,what,people,really,are,but,it,didn't,teach,me,how,to,live,with,them
and,i'm,afraid,i'll,never,learn
now,i,know,that,in,order,to,support,my,wife,and,child,i,will,have,to,make,my,way,among,a,world,of,people,with,whom,i,have,nothing,in,common
you,scarlett,are,taking,life,by,the,horns,and,twisting,it,to,your,will
but,where,do,i,fit,in,the,world,any,more
i,tell,you,i,am,afraid
while,his,low,resonant,voice,went,on,desolate,with,a,feeling,she,could,not,understand,scarlett,clutched,at,words,here,and,there,trying,to,make,sense,of,them
but,the,words,swooped,from,her,hands,like,wild,birds
something,was,driving,him,driving,him,with,a,cruel,goad,but,she,did,not,understand,what,it,was
scarlett,i,don't,know,just,when,it,was,that,the,bleak,realization,came,over,me,that,my,own,private,shadow,show,was,over
perhaps,in,the,first,five,minutes,at,bull,run,when,i,saw,the,first,man,i,killed,drop,to,the,ground
but,i,knew,it,was,over,and,i,could,no,longer,be,a,spectator
no,i,suddenly,found,myself,on,the,curtain,an,actor,posturing,and,making,futile,gestures
my,little,inner,world,was,gone,invaded,by,people,whose,thoughts,were,not,my,thoughts,whose,actions,were,as,alien,as,a,hottentot's
they'd,tramped,through,my,world,with,slimy,feet,and,there,was,no,place,left,where,i,could,take,refuge,when,things,became,too,bad,to,stand
when,i,was,in,prison,i,thought,when,the,war,is,over,i,can,go,back,to,the,old,life,and,the,old,dreams,and,watch,the,shadow,show,again
but,scarlett,there's,no,going,back
and,this,which,is,facing,all,of,us,now,is,worse,than,war,and,worse,than,prison,and,to,me,worse,than,death
so,you,see,scarlett,i'm,being,punished,for,being,afraid
but,ashley,she,began,floundering,in,a,quagmire,of,bewilderment,if,you're,afraid,we'll,starve,why,why,oh,ashley,we'll,manage,somehow
i,know,we,will
for,a,moment,his,eyes,came,back,to,her,wide,and,crystal,gray,and,there,was,admiration,in,them
then,suddenly,they,were,remote,again,and,she,knew,with,a,sinking,heart,that,he,had,not,been,thinking,about,starving
they,were,always,like,two,people,talking,to,each,other,in,different,languages
but,she,loved,him,so,much,that,when,he,withdrew,as,he,had,now,done,it,was,like,the,warm,sun,going,down,and,leaving,her,in,chilly,twilight,dews
she,wanted,to,catch,him,by,the,shoulders,and,hug,him,to,her,make,him,realize,that,she,was,flesh,and,blood,and,not,something,he,had,read,or,dreamed
if,she,could,only,feel,that,sense,of,oneness,with,him,for,which,she,had,yearned,since,that,day,so,long,ago,when,he,had,come,home,from,europe,and,stood,on,the,steps,of,tara,and,smiled,up,at,her
starving's,not,pleasant,he,said
i,know,for,i've,starved,but,i'm,not,afraid,of,that
i,am,afraid,of,facing,life,without,the,slow,beauty,of,our,old,world,that,is,gone
scarlett,thought,despairingly,that,melanie,would,know,what,he,meant
melly,and,he,were,always,talking,such,foolishness,poetry,and,books,and,dreams,and,moonrays,and,star,dust
he,was,not,fearing,the,things,she,feared,not,the,gnawing,of,an,empty,stomach,nor,the,keenness,of,the,winter,wind,nor,eviction,from,tara
he,was,shrinking,before,some,fear,she,had,never,known,and,could,not,imagine
for,in,god's,name,what,was,there,to,fear,in,this,wreck,of,a,world,but,hunger,and,cold,and,the,loss,of,home
and,she,had,thought,that,if,she,listened,closely,she,would,know,the,answer,to,ashley
oh
she,said,and,the,disappointment,in,her,voice,was,that,of,a,child,who,opens,a,beautifully,wrapped,package,to,find,it,empty
at,her,tone,he,smiled,ruefully,as,though,apologizing
forgive,me,scarlett,for,talking,so
i,can't,make,you,understand,because,you,don't,know,the,meaning,of,fear
you,have,the,heart,of,a,lion,and,an,utter,lack,of,imagination,and,i,envy,you,both,of,those,qualities
you'll,never,mind,facing,realities,and,you'll,never,want,to,escape,from,them,as,i,do
escape
it,was,as,if,that,were,the,only,understandable,word,he,had,spoken
ashley,like,her,was,tired,of,the,struggle,and,he,wanted,to,escape
her,breath,came,fast
oh,ashley,she,cried,you're,wrong
i,do,want,to,escape,too
i,am,so,very,tired,of,it,all
his,eyebrows,went,up,in,disbelief,and,she,laid,a,hand,feverish,and,urgent,on,his,arm
listen,to,me,she,began,swiftly,the,words,tumbling,out,one,over,the,other
i'm,tired,of,it,all,i,tell,you
bone,tired,and,i'm,not,going,to,stand,it,any,longer
i've,struggled,for,food,and,for,money,and,i've,weeded,and,hoed,and,picked,cotton,and,i've,even,plowed,until,i,can't,stand,it,another,minute
i,tell,you,ashley,the,south,is,dead
it's,dead
the,yankees,and,the,free,niggers,and,the,carpetbaggers,have,got,it,and,there's,nothing,left,for,us
ashley,let's,run,away
he,peered,at,her,sharply,lowering,his,head,to,look,into,her,face,now,flaming,with,color
yes,let's,run,away,leave,them,all
i'm,tired,of,working,for,the,folks
somebody,will,take,care,of,them
there's,always,somebody,who,takes,care,of,people,who,can't,take,care,of,themselves
oh,ashley,let's,run,away,you,and,i,we,could,go,to,mexico,they,want,officers,in,the,mexican,army,and,we,could,be,so,happy,there
i'd,work,for,you,ashley
i'd,do,anything,for,you
you,know,you,don't,love,melanie
he,started,to,speak,a,stricken,look,on,his,face,but,she,stemmed,his,words,with,a,torrent,of,her,own
you,told,me,you,loved,me,better,than,her,that,day,oh,you,remember,that,day
and,i,know,you,haven't,changed
i,can,tell,you,haven't,changed
and,you've,just,said,she,was,nothing,but,a,dream,oh,ashley,let's,go,away
i,could,make,you,so,happy
and,anyway,she,added,venomously,melanie,can't,dr,fontaine,said,she,couldn't,ever,have,any,more,children,and,i,could,give,you
his,hands,were,on,her,shoulders,so,tightly,that,they,hurt,and,she,stopped,breathless
we,were,to,forget,that,day,at,twelve,oaks
do,you,think,i,could,ever,forget,it
have,you,forgotten,it
can,you,honestly,say,you,don't,love,me
he,drew,a,deep,breath,and,answered,quickly
no
i,don't,love,you
that's,a,lie
even,if,it,is,a,lie,said,ashley,and,his,voice,was,deadly,quiet,it,is,not,something,which,can,be,discussed
you,mean
do,you,think,i,could,go,off,and,leave,melanie,and,the,baby,even,if,i,hated,them,both
break,melanie's,heart
leave,them,both,to,the,charity,of,friends
scarlett,are,you,mad
isn't,there,any,sense,of,loyalty,in,you
you,couldn't,leave,your,father,and,the,girls
they're,your,responsibility,just,as,melanie,and,beau,are,mine,and,whether,you,are,tired,or,not,they,are,here,and,you've,got,to,bear,them
i,could,leave,them,i'm,sick,of,them,tired,of,them
he,leaned,toward,her,and,for,a,moment,she,thought,with,a,catch,at,her,heart,that,he,was,going,to,take,her,in,his,arms
but,instead,he,patted,her,arm,and,spoke,as,one,comforting,a,child
i,know,you're,sick,and,tired
that's,why,you,are,talking,this,way
you've,carried,the,load,of,three,men
but,i'm,going,to,help,you,i,won't,always,be,so,awkward
there's,only,one,way,you,can,help,me,she,said,dully,and,that's,to,take,me,away,from,here,and,give,us,a,new,start,somewhere,with,a,chance,for,happiness
there's,nothing,to,keep,us,here
nothing,he,said,quietly,nothing,except,honor
she,looked,at,him,with,baffled,longing,and,saw,as,if,for,the,first,time,how,the,crescents,of,his,lashes,were,the,thick,rich,gold,of,ripe,wheat,how,proudly,his,head,sat,upon,his,bared,neck,and,how,the,look,of,race,and,dignity,persisted,in,his,slim,erect,body,even,through,its,grotesque,rags
her,eyes,met,his,hers,naked,with,pleading,his,remote,as,mountain,lakes,under,gray,skies
she,saw,in,them,defeat,of,her,wild,dream,her,mad,desires
heartbreak,and,weariness,sweeping,over,her,she,dropped,her,head,in,her,hands,and,cried
he,had,never,seen,her,cry
he,had,never,thought,that,women,of,her,strong,mettle,had,tears,and,a,flood,of,tenderness,and,remorse,swept,him
he,came,to,her,swiftly,and,in,a,moment,had,her,in,his,arms,cradling,her,comfortingly,pressing,her,black,head,to,his,heart,whispering,dear
my,brave,dear,don't
you,mustn't,cry
at,his,touch,he,felt,her,change,within,his,grip,and,there,was,madness,and,magic,in,the,slim,body,he,held,and,a,hot,soft,glow,in,the,green,eyes,which,looked,up,at,him
of,a,sudden,it,was,no,longer,bleak,winter
for,ashley,spring,was,back,again,that,half-,forgotten,balmy,spring,of,green,rustlings,and,murmurings,a,spring,of,ease,and,indolence,careless,days,when,the,desires,of,youth,were,warm,in,his,body
the,bitter,years,since,then,fell,away,and,he,saw,that,the,lips,turned,up,to,his,were,red,and,trembling,and,he,kissed,her
there,was,a,curious,low,roaring,sound,in,her,ears,as,of,sea,shells,held,against,them,and,through,the,sound,she,dimly,heard,the,swift,thudding,of,her,heart
her,body,seemed,to,melt,into,his,and,for,a,timeless,time,they,stood,fused,together,as,his,lips,took,hers,hungrily,as,if,he,could,never,have,enough
when,he,suddenly,released,her,she,felt,that,she,could,not,stand,alone,and,gripped,the,fence,for,support
she,raised,eyes,blazing,with,love,and,triumph,to,him
you,do,love,me
you,do,love,me
say,it,say,it
his,hands,still,rested,on,her,shoulders,and,she,felt,them,tremble,and,loved,their,trembling
she,leaned,toward,him,ardently,but,he,held,her,away,from,him,looking,at,her,with,eyes,from,which,all,remoteness,had,fled,eyes,tormented,with,struggle,and,despair
don't
he,said
don't
if,you,do,i,shall,take,you,now,here
she,smiled,a,bright,hot,smile,which,was,forgetful,of,time,or,place,or,anything,but,the,memory,of,his,mouth,on,hers
suddenly,he,shook,her,shook,her,until,her,black,hair,tumbled,down,about,her,shoulders,shook,her,as,if,in,a,mad,rage,at,her,and,at,himself
we,won't,do,this
he,said
i,tell,you,we,won't,do,it
it,seemed,as,if,her,neck,would,snap,if,he,shook,her,again
she,was,blinded,by,her,hair,and,stunned,by,his,action
she,wrenched,herself,away,and,stared,at,him
there,were,small,beads,of,moisture,on,his,forehead,and,his,fists,were,curled,into,claws,as,if,in,pain
he,looked,at,her,directly,his,gray,eyes,piercing
it's,all,my,fault,none,of,yours,and,it,will,never,happen,again,because,i,am,going,to,take,melanie,and,the,baby,and,go
go
she,cried,in,anguish
oh,no
yes,by,god
do,you,think,i'll,stay,here,after,this
when,this,might,happen,again
but,ashley,you,can't,go
why,should,you,go
you,love,me
you,want,me,to,say,it
all,right,i'll,say,it
i,love,you
he,leaned,over,her,with,a,sudden,savagery,which,made,her,shrink,back,against,the,fence
i,love,you,your,courage,and,your,stubbornness,and,your,fire,and,your,utter,ruthlessness
how,much,do,i,love,you
so,much,that,a,moment,ago,i,would,have,outraged,the,hospitality,of,the,house,which,has,sheltered,me,and,my,family,forgotten,the,best,wife,any,man,ever,had,enough,to,take,you,here,in,the,mud,like,a
she,struggled,with,a,chaos,of,thoughts,and,there,was,a,cold,pain,in,her,heart,as,if,an,icicle,had,pierced,it
she,said,haltingly,if,you,felt,like,that,and,didn't,take,me,then,you,don't,love,me
i,can,never,make,you,understand
they,fell,silent,and,looked,at,each,other
suddenly,scarlett,shivered,and,saw,as,if,coming,back,from,a,long,journey,that,it,was,winter,and,the,fields,were,bare,and,harsh,with,stubble,and,she,was,very,cold
she,saw,too,that,the,old,aloof,face,of,ashley,the,one,she,knew,so,well,had,come,back,and,it,was,wintry,too,and,harsh,with,hurt,and,remorse
she,would,have,turned,and,left,him,then,seeking,the,shelter,of,the,house,to,hide,herself,but,she,was,too,tired,to,move
even,speech,was,a,labor,and,a,weariness
there,is,nothing,left,she,said,at,last
nothing,left,for,me
nothing,to,love
nothing,to,fight,for
you,are,gone,and,tara,is,going
he,looked,at,her,for,a,long,space,and,then,leaning,scooped,up,a,small,wad,of,red,clay,from,the,ground
yes,there,is,something,left,he,said,and,the,ghost,of,his,old,smile,came,back,the,smile,which,mocked,himself,as,well,as,her
something,you,love,better,than,me,though,you,may,not,know,it
you've,still,got,tara
he,took,her,limp,hand,and,pressed,the,damp,clay,into,it,and,closed,her,fingers,about,it
there,was,no,fever,in,his,hands,now,nor,in,hers
she,looked,at,the,red,soil,for,a,moment,and,it,meant,nothing,to,her
she,looked,at,him,and,realized,dimly,that,there,was,an,integrity,of,spirit,in,him,which,was,not,to,be,torn,apart,by,her,passionate,hands,nor,by,any,hands
if,it,killed,him,he,would,never,leave,melanie
if,he,burned,for,scarlett,until,the,end,of,his,days,he,would,never,take,her,and,he,would,fight,to,keep,her,at,a,distance
she,would,never,again,get,through,that,armor
the,words,hospitality,and,loyalty,and,honor,meant,more,to,him,than,she,did
the,clay,was,cold,in,her,hand,and,she,looked,at,it,again
yes,she,said,i've,still,got,this
at,first,the,words,meant,nothing,and,the,clay,was,only,red,clay
but,unbidden,came,the,thought,of,the,sea,of,red,dirt,which,surrounded,tara,and,how,very,dear,it,was,and,how,hard,she,had,fought,to,keep,it,how,hard,she,was,going,to,have,to,fight,if,she,wished,to,keep,it,hereafter
she,looked,at,him,again,and,wondered,where,the,hot,flood,of,feeling,had,gone
she,could,think,but,could,not,feel,not,about,him,nor,tara,either,for,she,was,drained,of,all,emotion
you,need,not,go,she,said,clearly
i,won't,have,you,all,starve,simply,because,i've,thrown,myself,at,your,head
it,will,never,happen,again
she,turned,away,and,started,back,toward,the,house,across,the,rough,fields,twisting,her,hair,into,a,knot,upon,her,neck
ashley,watched,her,go,and,saw,her,square,her,small,thin,shoulders,as,she,went
and,that,gesture,went,to,his,heart,more,than,any,words,she,had,spoken
chapter,xxxii
she,was,still,clutching,the,ball,of,red,clay,when,she,went,up,the,front,steps
she,had,carefully,avoided,the,back,entrance,for,mammy's,sharp,eyes,would,certainly,have,seen,that,something,was,greatly,amiss
scarlett,did,not,want,to,see,mammy,or,anyone,else
she,did,not,feel,that,she,could,endure,seeing,anyone,or,talking,to,anyone,again
she,had,no,feeling,of,shame,or,disappointment,or,bitterness,now,only,a,weakness,of,the,knees,and,a,great,emptiness,of,heart
she,squeezed,the,clay,so,tightly,it,ran,out,from,her,clenched,fist,and,she,said,over,and,over,parrot-like,i've,still,got,this
yes,i've,still,got,this
there,was,nothing,else,she,did,have,nothing,but,this,red,land,this,land,she,had,been,willing,to,throw,away,like,a,torn,handkerchief,only,a,few,minutes,before
now,it,was,dear,to,her,again,and,she,wondered,dully,what,madness,had,possessed,her,to,hold,it,so,lightly
had,ashley,yielded,she,could,have,gone,away,with,him,and,left,family,and,friends,without,a,backward,look,but,even,in,her,emptiness,she,knew,it,would,have,torn,her,heart,to,leave,these,dear,red,hills,and,long,washed,gullies,and,gaunt,black,pines
her,thoughts,would,have,turned,back,to,them,hungrily,until,the,day,she,died
not,even,ashley,could,have,filled,the,empty,spaces,in,her,heart,where,tara,had,been,uprooted
how,wise,ashley,was,and,how,well,he,knew,her
he,had,only,to,press,the,damp,earth,into,her,hand,to,bring,her,to,her,senses
she,was,in,the,hall,preparing,to,close,the,door,when,she,heard,the,sound,of,horse's,hooves,and,turned,to,look,down,the,driveway
to,have,visitors,at,this,of,all,times,was,too,much
she'd,hurry,to,her,room,and,plead,a,headache
but,when,the,carriage,came,nearer,her,flight,was,checked,by,her,amazement
it,was,a,new,carriage,shiny,with,varnish,and,the,harness,was,new,too,with,bits,of,polished,brass,here,and,there
strangers,certainly
no,one,she,knew,had,the,money,for,such,a,grand,new,turn-out,as,this
she,stood,in,the,doorway,watching,the,cold,draft,blowing,her,skirts,about,her,damp,ankles
then,the,carriage,stopped,in,front,of,the,house,and,jonas,wilkerson,alighted
scarlett,was,so,surprised,at,the,sight,of,their,former,overseer,driving,so,fine,a,rig,and,in,so,splendid,a,greatcoat,she,could,not,for,a,moment,believe,her,eyes
will,had,told,her,he,looked,quite,prosperous,since,he,got,his,new,job,with,the,freedmen's,bureau
made,a,lot,of,money,will,said,swindling,the,niggers,or,the,government,one,or,tuther,or,confiscating,folks',cotton,and,swearing,it,was,confederate,government,cotton
certainly,he,never,came,by,all,that,money,honestly,in,these,hard,times
and,here,he,was,now,stepping,out,of,an,elegant,carriage,and,handing,down,a,woman,dressed,within,an,inch,of,her,life
scarlett,saw,in,a,glance,that,the,dress,was,bright,in,color,to,the,point,of,vulgarity,but,nevertheless,her,eyes,went,over,the,outfit,hungrily
it,had,been,so,long,since,she,had,even,seen,stylish,new,clothes
well
so,hoops,aren't,so,wide,this,year,she,thought,scanning,the,red,plaid,gown
and,as,she,took,in,the,black,velvet,paletot,how,short,jackets,are
and,what,a,cunning,hat
bonnets,must,be,out,of,style,for,this,hat,was,only,an,absurd,flat,red,velvet,affair,perched,on,the,top,of,the,woman's,head,like,a,stiffened,pancake
the,ribbons,did,not,tie,under,the,chin,as,bonnet,ribbons,tied,but,in,the,back,under,the,massive,bunch,of,curls,which,fell,from,the,rear,of,the,hat,curls,which,scarlett,could,not,help,noticing,did,not,match,the,woman's,hair,in,either,color,or,texture
as,the,woman,stepped,to,the,ground,and,looked,toward,the,house,scarlett,saw,there,was,something,familiar,about,the,rabbity,face,caked,with,white,powder
why,it's,emmie,slattery
she,cried,so,surprised,she,spoke,the,words,aloud
yes'm,it's,me,said,emmie,tossing,her,head,with,an,ingratiating,smile,and,starting,toward,the,steps
emmie,slattery
the,dirty,tow-headed,slut,whose,illegitimate,baby,ellen,had,baptized,emmie,who,had,given,typhoid,to,ellen,and,killed,her
this,overdressed,common,nasty,piece,of,poor,white,trash,was,coming,up,the,steps,of,tara,bridling,and,grinning,as,if,she,belonged,here
scarlett,thought,of,ellen,and,in,a,rush,feeling,came,back,into,the,emptiness,of,her,mind,a,murderous,rage,so,strong,it,shook,her,like,the,ague
get,off,those,steps,you,trashy,wench
she,cried
get,off,this,land
get,out
emmie's,jaw,sagged,suddenly,and,she,glanced,at,jonas,who,came,up,with,lowering,brows
he,made,an,effort,at,dignity,despite,his,anger
you,must,not,speak,that,way,to,my,wife,he,said
wife
said,scarlett,and,burst,into,a,laugh,that,was,cutting,with,contempt
high,time,you,made,her,your,wife
who,baptized,your,other,brats,after,you,killed,my,mother
emmie,said,oh
and,retreated,hastily,down,the,steps,but,jonas,stopped,her,flight,toward,the,carriage,with,a,rough,grip,on,her,arm
we,came,out,here,to,pay,a,call,a,friendly,call,he,snarled
and,talk,a,little,business,with,old,friends
friends
scarlett's,voice,was,like,a,whiplash
when,were,we,ever,friends,with,the,like,of,you
the,slatterys,lived,on,our,charity,and,paid,it,back,by,killing,mother,and,you,you,pa,discharged,you,about,emmie's,brat,and,you,know,it
friends
get,off,this,place,before,i,call,mr,benteen,and,mr
wilkes
under,the,words,emmie,broke,her,husband's,hold,and,fled,for,the,carriage,scrambling,in,with,a,flash,of,patent-leather,boots,with,bright-red,tops,and,red,tassels
now,jonas,shook,with,a,fury,equal,to,scarlett's,and,his,sallow,face,was,as,red,as,an,angry,turkey,gobbler's
still,high,and,mighty,aren't,you
well,i,know,all,about,you
i,know,you,haven't,got,shoes,for,your,feet
i,know,your,father's,turned,idiot
get,off,this,place
oh,you,won't,sing,that,way,very,long
i,know,you're,broke
i,know,you,can't,even,pay,your,taxes
i,came,out,here,to,offer,to,buy,this,place,from,you,to,make,you,a,right,good,offer
emmie,had,a,hankering,to,live,here
but,by,god,i,won't,give,you,a,cent,now
you,highflying,bog-trotting,irish,will,find,out,who's,running,things,around,here,when,you,get,sold,out,for,taxes
and,i'll,buy,this,place,lock,stock,and,barrel,furniture,and,all,and,i'll,live,in,it
so,it,was,jonas,wilkerson,who,wanted,tara,jonas,and,emmie,who,in,some,twisted,way,thought,to,even,past,slights,by,living,in,the,home,where,they,had,been,slighted
all,her,nerves,hummed,with,hate,as,they,had,hummed,that,day,when,she,shoved,the,pistol,barrel,into,the,yankee's,bearded,face,and,fired
she,wished,she,had,that,pistol,now
i'll,tear,this,house,down,stone,by,stone,and,burn,it,and,sow,every,acre,with,salt,before,i,see,either,of,you,put,foot,over,this,threshold,she,shouted
get,out,i,tell,you
get,out
jonas,glared,at,her,started,to,say,more,and,then,walked,toward,the,carriage
he,climbed,in,beside,his,whimpering,wife,and,turned,the,horse
as,they,drove,off,scarlett,had,the,impulse,to,spit,at,them
she,did,spit
she,knew,it,was,a,common,childish,gesture,but,it,made,her,feel,better
she,wished,she,had,done,it,while,they,could,see,her
those,damned,nigger,lovers,daring,to,come,here,and,taunt,her,about,her,poverty
that,hound,never,intended,offering,her,a,price,for,tara
he,just,used,that,as,an,excuse,to,come,and,flaunt,himself,and,emmie,in,her,face
the,dirty,scallawags,the,lousy,trashy,poor,whites,boasting,they,would,live,at,tara
then,sudden,terror,struck,her,and,her,rage,melted
god's,nightgown
they,will,come,and,live,here
there,was,nothing,she,could,do,to,keep,them,from,buying,tara,nothing,to,keep,them,from,levying,on,every,mirror,and,table,and,bed,on,ellen's,shining,mahogany,and,rosewood,and,every,bit,of,it,precious,to,her,scarred,though,it,was,by,the,yankee,raiders
and,the,robillard,silver,too
i,won't,let,them,do,it,thought,scarlett,vehemently
no,not,if,i've,got,to,burn,the,place,down
emmie,slattery,will,never,set,her,foot,on,a,single,bit,of,flooring,mother,ever,walked,on
she,closed,the,door,and,leaned,against,it,and,she,was,very,frightened
more,frightened,even,than,she,had,been,that,day,when,sherman's,army,was,in,the,house
that,day,the,worst,she,could,fear,was,that,tara,would,be,burned,over,her,head
but,this,was,worse,these,low,common,creatures,living,in,this,house,bragging,to,their,low,common,friends,how,they,had,turned,the,proud,o'haras,out
perhaps,they'd,even,bring,negroes,here,to,dine,and,sleep
will,had,told,her,jonas,made,a,great,to-do,about,being,equal,with,the,negroes,ate,with,them,visited,in,their,houses,rode,them,around,with,him,in,his,carriage,put,his,arms,around,their,shoulders
when,she,thought,of,the,possibility,of,this,final,insult,to,tara,her,heart,pounded,so,hard,she,could,scarcely,breathe
she,was,trying,to,get,her,mind,on,her,problem,trying,to,figure,some,way,out,but,each,time,she,collected,her,thoughts,fresh,gusts,of,rage,and,fear,shook,her
there,must,be,some,way,out,there,must,be,someone,somewhere,who,had,money,she,could,borrow
money,couldn't,just,dry,up,and,blow,away
somebody,had,to,have,money
then,the,laughing,words,of,ashley,came,back,to,her
only,one,person,rhett,butler
who,has,money
rhett,butler
she,walked,quickly,into,the,parlor,and,shut,the,door,behind,her
the,dim,gloom,of,drawn,blinds,and,winter,twilight,closed,about,her
no,one,would,think,of,hunting,for,her,here,and,she,wanted,time,to,think,undisturbed
the,idea,which,had,just,occurred,to,her,was,so,simple,she,wondered,why,she,had,not,thought,of,it,before
i'll,get,the,money,from,rhett
i'll,sell,him,the,diamond,earbobs
or,i'll,borrow,the,money,from,him,and,let,him,keep,the,earbobs,till,i,can,pay,him,back
for,a,moment,relief,was,so,great,she,felt,weak
she,would,pay,the,taxes,and,laugh,in,jonas,wilkerson's,face
but,close,on,this,happy,thought,came,relentless,knowledge
it's,not,only,for,this,year,that,i'll,need,tax,money
there's,next,year,and,all,the,years,of,my,life
if,i,pay,up,this,time,they'll,raise,the,taxes,higher,next,time,till,they,drive,me,out
if,i,make,a,good,cotton,crop,they'll,tax,it,till,i'll,get,nothing,for,it,or,maybe,confiscate,it,outright,and,say,it's,confederate,cotton
the,yankees,and,the,scoundrels,teamed,up,with,them,have,got,me,where,they,want,me
all,my,life,as,long,as,i,live,i'll,be,afraid,they'll,get,me,somehow
all,my,life,i'll,be,scared,and,scrambling,for,money,and,working,myself,to,death,only,to,see,my,work,go,for,nothing,and,my,cotton,stolen
just,borrowing,three,hundred,dollars,for,the,taxes,will,be,only,a,stopgap
what,i,want,is,to,get,out,of,this,fix,for,good,so,i,can,go,to,sleep,at,night,without,worrying,over,what's,going,to,happen,to,me,tomorrow,and,next,month,and,next,year
her,mind,ticked,on,steadily
coldly,and,logically,an,idea,grew,in,her,brain
she,thought,of,rhett,a,flash,of,white,teeth,against,swarthy,skin,sardonic,black,eyes,caressing,her
she,recalled,the,hot,night,in,atlanta,close,to,the,end,of,the,siege,when,he,sat,on,aunt,pitty's,porch,half,hidden,in,the,summer,darkness,and,she,felt,again,the,heat,of,his,hand,upon,her,arm,as,he,said,i,want,you,more,than,i,have,ever,wanted,any,woman,and,i've,waited,longer,for,you,than,i've,ever,waited,for,any,woman
i'll,marry,him,she,thought,coolly
and,then,i'll,never,have,to,bother,about,money,again
oh,blessed,thought,sweeter,than,hope,of,heaven,never,to,worry,about,money,again,to,know,that,tara,was,safe,that,the,family,was,fed,and,clothed,that,she,would,never,again,have,to,bruise,herself,against,stone,walls
she,felt,very,old
the,afternoon's,events,had,drained,her,of,all,feeling,first,the,startling,news,about,the,taxes,then,ashley,and,last,her,murderous,rage,at,jonas,wilkerson
no,there,was,no,emotion,left,in,her
if,all,her,capacity,to,feel,had,not,been,utterly,exhausted,something,in,her,would,have,protested,against,the,plan,taking,form,in,her,mind,for,she,hated,rhett,as,she,hated,no,other,person,in,all,the,world
but,she,could,not,feel
she,could,only,think,and,her,thoughts,were,very,practical
i,said,some,terrible,things,to,him,that,night,when,he,deserted,us,on,the,road,but,i,can,make,him,forget,them,she,thought,contemptuously,still,sure,of,her,power,to,charm
butter,won't,melt,in,my,mouth,when,i'm,around,him
i'll,make,him,think,i,always,loved,him,and,was,just,upset,and,frightened,that,night
oh,men,are,so,conceited,they'll,believe,anything,that,flatters,them
i,must,never,let,him,dream,what,straits,we're,in,not,till,i've,got,him
oh,he,mustn't,know
if,he,even,suspected,how,poor,we,are,he'd,know,it,was,his,money,i,wanted,and,not,himself
after,all,there's,no,way,he,could,know,for,even,aunt,pitty,doesn't,know,the,worst
and,after,i've,married,him,he'll,have,to,help,us
he,can't,let,his,wife's,people,starve
his,wife
mrs,rhett,butler
something,of,repulsion,buried,deep,beneath,her,cold,thinking,stirred,faintly,and,then,was,stilled
she,remembered,the,embarrassing,and,disgusting,events,of,her,brief,honeymoon,with,charles,his,fumbling,hands,his,awkwardness,his,incomprehensible,emotions,and,wade,hampton
i,won't,think,about,it,now
i'll,bother,about,it,after,i've,married,him
after,she,had,married,him
memory,rang,a,bell
a,chill,went,down,her,spine
she,remembered,again,that,night,on,aunt,pitty's,porch,remembered,how,she,asked,him,if,he,was,proposing,to,her,remembered,how,hatefully,he,had,laughed,and,said,my,dear,i'm,not,a,marrying,man
suppose,he,was,still,not,a,marrying,man
suppose,despite,all,her,charms,and,wiles,he,refused,to,marry,her
suppose,oh,terrible,thought,suppose,he,had,completely,forgotten,about,her,and,was,chasing,after,some,other,woman
i,want,you,more,than,i,have,ever,wanted,any,woman
scarlett's,nails,dug,into,her,palms,as,she,clenched,her,fists
if,he's,forgotten,me,i'll,make,him,remember,me
i'll,make,him,want,me,again
and,if,he,would,not,marry,her,but,still,wanted,her,there,was,a,way,to,get,the,money
after,all,he,had,once,asked,her,to,be,his,mistress
in,the,dim,grayness,of,the,parlor,she,fought,a,quick,decisive,battle,with,the,three,most,binding,ties,of,her,soul,the,memory,of,ellen,the,teachings,of,her,religion,and,her,love,for,ashley
she,knew,that,what,she,had,in,her,mind,must,be,hideous,to,her,mother,even,in,that,warm,far-off,heaven,where,she,surely,was
she,knew,that,fornication,was,a,mortal,sin
and,she,knew,that,loving,ashley,as,she,did,her,plan,was,doubly,prostitution
but,all,these,things,went,down,before,the,merciless,coldness,of,her,mind,and,the,goad,of,desperation
ellen,was,dead,and,perhaps,death,gave,an,understanding,of,all,things
religion,forbade,fornication,on,pain,of,hell,fire,but,if,the,church,thought,she,was,going,to,leave,one,stone,unturned,in,saving,tara,and,saving,the,family,from,starving,well,let,the,church,bother,about,that
she,wouldn't
at,least,not,now
and,ashley,ashley,didn't,want,her
yes,he,did,want,her
the,memory,of,his,warm,mouth,on,hers,told,her,that
but,he,would,never,take,her,away,with,him
strange,that,going,away,with,ashley,did,not,seem,like,a,sin,but,with,rhett
in,the,dull,twilight,of,the,winter,afternoon,she,came,to,the,end,of,the,long,road,which,had,begun,the,night,atlanta,fell
she,had,set,her,feet,upon,that,road,a,spoiled,selfish,and,untried,girl,full,of,youth,warm,of,emotion,easily,bewildered,by,life
now,at,the,end,of,the,road,there,was,nothing,left,of,that,girl
hunger,and,hard,labor,fear,and,constant,strain,the,terrors,of,war,and,the,terrors,of,reconstruction,had,taken,away,all,warmth,and,youth,and,softness
about,the,core,of,her,being,a,shell,of,hardness,had,formed,and,little,by,little,layer,by,layer,the,shell,had,thickened,during,the,endless,months
but,until,this,very,day,two,hopes,had,been,left,to,sustain,her
she,had,hoped,that,the,war,being,over,life,would,gradually,resume,its,old,face
she,had,hoped,that,ashley's,return,would,bring,back,some,meaning,into,life
now,both,hopes,were,gone
the,sight,of,jonas,wilkerson,in,the,front,walk,of,tara,had,made,her,realize,that,for,her,for,the,whole,south,the,war,would,never,end
the,bitterest,fighting,the,most,brutal,retaliations,were,just,beginning
and,ashley,was,imprisoned,forever,by,words,which,were,stronger,than,any,jail
peace,had,failed,her,and,ashley,had,failed,her,both,in,the,same,day,and,it,was,as,if,the,last,crevice,in,the,shell,had,been,sealed,the,final,layer,hardened
she,had,become,what,grandma,fontaine,had,counseled,against,a,woman,who,had,seen,the,worst,and,so,had,nothing,else,to,fear
not,life,nor,mother,nor,loss,of,love,nor,public,opinion
only,hunger,and,her,nightmare,dream,of,hunger,could,make,her,afraid
a,curious,sense,of,lightness,of,freedom,pervaded,her,now,that,she,had,finally,hardened,her,heart,against,all,that,bound,her,to,the,old,days,and,the,old,scarlett
she,had,made,her,decision,and,thank,god,she,wasn't,afraid
she,had,nothing,to,lose,and,her,mind,was,made,up
if,she,could,only,coax,rhett,into,marrying,her,all,would,be,perfect
but,if,she,couldn't,well,she'd,get,the,money,just,the,same
for,a,brief,moment,she,wondered,with,impersonal,curiosity,what,would,be,expected,of,a,mistress
would,rhett,insist,on,keeping,her,in,atlanta,as,people,said,he,kept,the,watling,woman
if,he,made,her,stay,in,atlanta,he'd,have,to,pay,well,pay,enough,to,balance,what,her,absence,from,tara,would,be,worth
scarlett,was,very,ignorant,of,the,hidden,side,of,men's,lives,and,had,no,way,of,knowing,just,what,the,arrangement,might,involve
and,she,wondered,if,she,would,have,a,baby
that,would,be,distinctly,terrible
i,won't,think,of,that,now
i'll,think,of,it,later,and,she,pushed,the,unwelcome,idea,into,the,back,of,her,mind,lest,it,shake,her,resolution
she'd,tell,the,family,tonight,she,was,going,to,atlanta,to,borrow,money,to,try,to,mortgage,the,farm,if,necessary
that,would,be,all,they,needed,to,know,until,such,an,evil,day,when,they,might,find,out,differently
with,the,thought,of,action,her,head,went,up,and,her,shoulders,went,back
this,affair,was,not,going,to,be,easy,she,knew
formerly,it,had,been,rhett,who,asked,for,her,favors,and,she,who,held,the,power
now,she,was,the,beggar,and,a,beggar,in,no,position,to,dictate,terms
but,i,won't,go,to,him,like,a,beggar
i'll,go,like,a,queen,granting,favors
he'll,never,know
she,walked,to,the,long,pier,glass,and,looked,at,herself,her,head,held,high
and,she,saw,framed,in,the,cracking,gilt,molding,a,stranger
it,was,as,if,she,were,really,seeing,herself,for,the,first,time,in,a,year
she,had,glanced,in,the,mirror,every,morning,to,see,that,her,face,was,clean,and,her,hair,tidy,but,she,had,always,been,too,pressed,by,other,things,to,really,see,herself
but,this,stranger
surely,this,thin,hollow-cheeked,woman,couldn't,be,scarlett,o'hara
scarlett,o'hara,had,a,pretty,coquettish,high-,spirited,face
this,face,at,which,she,stared,was,not,pretty,at,all,and,had,none,of,the,charm,she,remembered,so,well
it,was,white,and,strained,and,the,black,brows,above,slanting,green,eyes,swooped,up,startlingly,against,the,white,skin,like,frightened,bird's,wings
there,was,a,hard,and,hunted,look,about,this,face
i'm,not,pretty,enough,to,get,him
she,thought,and,desperation,came,back,to,her
i'm,thin,oh,i'm,terribly,thin
she,patted,her,cheeks,felt,frantically,at,her,collar,bones,feeling,them,stand,out,through,her,basque
and,her,breasts,were,so,small,almost,as,small,as,melanie's
she'd,have,to,put,ruffles,in,her,bosom,to,make,them,look,larger,and,she,had,always,had,contempt,for,girls,who,resorted,to,such,subterfuges
ruffles
that,brought,up,another,thought
her,clothes
she,looked,down,at,her,dress,spreading,its,mended,folds,wide,between,her,hands
rhett,liked,women,who,were,well,dressed,fashionably,dressed
she,remembered,with,longing,the,flounced,green,dress,she,had,worn,when,she,first,came,out,of,mourning,the,dress,she,wore,with,the,green,plumed,bonnet,he,had,brought,her,and,she,recalled,the,approving,compliments,he,had,paid,her
she,remembered,too,with,hate,sharpened,by,envy,the,red,plaid,dress,the,red-topped,boots,with,tassels,and,the,pancake,hat,of,emmie,slattery
they,were,gaudy,but,they,were,new,and,fashionable,and,certainly,they,caught,the,eye
and,oh,how,she,wanted,to,catch,the,eye
especially,the,eye,of,rhett,butler
if,he,should,see,her,in,her,old,clothes,he'd,know,everything,was,wrong,at,tara
and,he,must,not,know
what,a,fool,she,had,been,to,think,she,could,go,to,atlanta,and,have,him,for,the,asking,she,with,her,scrawny,neck,and,hungry,cat,eyes,and,raggedy,dress
if,she,hadn't,been,able,to,pry,a,proposal,from,him,at,the,height,of,her,beauty,when,she,had,her,prettiest,clothes,how,could,she,expect,to,get,one,now,when,she,was,ugly,and,dressed,tackily
if,miss,pitty's,story,was,true,he,must,have,more,money,than,anyone,in,atlanta,and,probably,had,his,pick,of,all,the,pretty,ladies,good,and,bad
well,she,thought,grimly,i've,got,something,that,most,pretty,ladies,haven't,got,and,that's,a,mind,that's,made,up
and,if,i,had,just,one,nice,dress
there,wasn't,a,nice,dress,in,tara,or,a,dress,which,hadn't,been,turned,twice,and,mended
that's,that,she,thought,disconsolately,looking,down,at,the,floor
she,saw,ellen's,moss-green,velvet,carpet,now,worn,and,scuffed,and,torn,and,spotted,from,the,numberless,men,who,had,slept,upon,it,and,the,sight,depressed,her,more,for,it,made,her,realize,that,tara,was,just,as,ragged,as,she
the,whole,darkening,room,depressed,her,and,going,to,the,window,she,raised,the,sash,unlatched,the,shutters,and,let,the,last,light,of,the,wintry,sunset,into,the,room
she,closed,the,window,and,leaned,her,head,against,the,velvet,curtains,and,looked,out,across,the,bleak,pasture,toward,the,dark,cedars,of,the,burying,ground
the,moss-green,velvet,curtains,felt,prickly,and,soft,beneath,her,cheek,and,she,rubbed,her,face,against,them,gratefully,like,a,cat
and,then,suddenly,she,looked,at,them
a,minute,later,she,was,dragging,a,heavy,marble-topped,table,across,the,floor
its,rusty,castors,screeching,in,protest
she,rolled,the,table,under,the,window,gathered,up,her,skirts,climbed,on,it,and,tiptoed,to,reach,the,heavy,curtain,pole
it,was,almost,out,of,her,reach,and,she,jerked,at,it,so,impatiently,the,nails,came,out,of,the,wood,and,the,curtains,pole,and,all,fell,to,the,floor,with,a,clatter
as,if,by,magic,the,door,of,the,parlor,opened,and,the,wide,black,face,of,mammy,appeared,ardent,curiosity,and,deepest,suspicion,evident,in,every,wrinkle
she,looked,disapprovingly,at,scarlett,poised,on,the,table,top,her,skirts,above,her,knees,ready,to,leap,to,the,floor
there,was,a,look,of,excitement,and,triumph,on,her,face,which,brought,sudden,distrust,to,mammy
whut,you,up,to,wid,miss,ellen's,po'teers
she,demanded
what,are,you,up,to,listening,outside,doors

scoot,up,to,the,attic,and,get,my,box,of,dress,patterns,mammy,she,cried,giving,her,a,slight,shove

mammy,was,torn,between,indignation,at,the,very,idea,of,her,two,hundred,pounds,scooting,anywhere,much,less,to,the,attic,and,the,dawning,of,a,horrid,suspicion
quickly,she,snatched,the,curtain,lengths,from,scarlett,holding,them,against,her,monumental,sagging,breasts,as,if,they,were,holy,relics

but,it,did,not,fool,the,old,woman
she,knew,miss,scarlett,was,employing,that,smile,merely,to,get,around,her,and,in,this,matter,she,was,determined,not,to,be,gotten,around

i'd,as,soon,have,a,bloodhound,after,me
after,supper,had,been,cleared,away,scarlett,and,mammy,spread,patterns,on,the,dining-room,table,while,suellen,and,carreen,busily,ripped,satin,linings,from,curtains,and,melanie,brushed,the,velvet,with,a,clean,hairbrush,to,remove,the,dust
gerald,will,and,ashley,sat,about,the,room,smoking,smiling,at,the,feminine,tumult
a,feeling,of,pleasurable,excitement,which,seemed,to,emanate,from,scarlett,was,on,them,all,an,excitement,they,could,not,understand
there,was,color,in,scarlett's,face,and,a,bright,hard,glitter,in,her,eyes,and,she,laughed,a,good,deal
her,laughter,pleased,them,all,for,it,had,been,months,since,they,had,heard,her,really,laugh
especially,did,it,please,gerald
his,eyes,were,less,vague,than,usual,as,they,followed,her,swishing,figure,about,the,room,and,he,patted,her,approvingly,whenever,she,was,within,reach
the,girls,were,as,excited,as,if,preparing,for,a,ball,and,they,ripped,and,cut,and,basted,as,if,making,a,ball,dress,of,their,own
scarlett,was,going,to,atlanta,to,borrow,money,or,to,mortgage,tara,if,necessary
but,what,was,a,mortgage,after,all
scarlett,said,they,could,easily,pay,it,off,out,of,next,year's,cotton,and,have,money,left,over,and,she,said,it,with,such,finality,they,did,not,think,to,question
and,when,they,asked,who,was,going,to,lend,the,money,she,said,layovers,catch,meddlers,so,archly,they,all,laughed,and,teased,her,about,her,millionaire,friend
it,must,be,captain,rhett,butler,said,melanie,slyly,and,they,exploded,with,mirth,at,this,absurdity,knowing,how,scarlett,hated,him,and,never,failed,to,refer,to,him,as,that,skunk,rhett,butler
but,scarlett,did,not,laugh,at,this,and,ashley,who,had,laughed,stopped,abruptly,as,he,saw,mammy,shoot,a,quick,guarded,glance,at,scarlett
suellen,moved,to,generosity,by,the,party,spirit,of,the,occasion,produced,her,irish-lace,collar,somewhat,worn,but,still,pretty,and,carreen,insisted,that,scarlett,wear,her,slippers,to,atlanta,for,they,were,in,better,condition,than,any,others,at,tara
melanie,begged,mammy,to,leave,her,enough,velvet,scraps,to,recover,the,frame,of,her,battered,bonnet,and,brought,shouts,of,laughter,when,she,said,the,old,rooster,was,going,to,part,with,his,gorgeous,bronze,and,green-black,tail,feathers,unless,he,took,to,the,swamp,immediately
scarlett,watching,the,flying,fingers,heard,the,laughter,and,looked,at,them,all,with,concealed,bitterness,and,contempt
they,haven't,an,idea,what,is,really,happening,to,me,or,to,themselves,or,to,the,south
they,still,think,in,spite,of,everything,that,nothing,really,dreadful,can,happen,to,any,of,them,because,they,are,who,they,are,o'haras,wilkeses,hamiltons
even,the,darkies,feel,that,way
oh,they're,all,fools
they'll,never,realize
they'll,go,right,on,thinking,and,living,as,they,always,have,and,nothing,will,change,them
melly,can,dress,in,rags,and,pick,cotton,and,even,help,me,murder,a,man,but,it,doesn't,change,her
she's,still,the,shy,well-bred,mrs,wilkes,the,perfect,lady
and,ashley,can,see,death,and,war,and,be,wounded,and,lie,in,jail,and,come,home,to,less,than,nothing,and,still,be,the,same,gentleman,he,was,when,he,had,all,twelve,oaks,behind,him
will,is,different
he,knows,how,things,really,are,but,then,will,never,had,anything,much,to,lose
and,as,for,suellen,and,carreen,they,think,all,this,is,just,a,temporary,matter
they,don't,change,to,meet,changed,conditions,because,they,think,it'll,all,be,over,soon
they,think,god,is,going,to,work,a,miracle,especially,for,their,benefit
but,he,won't
the,only,miracle,that's,going,to,be,worked,around,here,is,the,one,i'm,going,to,work,on,rhett,butler
they,won't,change
maybe,they,can't,change
i'm,the,only,one,who's,changed,and,i,wouldn't,have,changed,if,i,could,have,helped,it
mammy,finally,turned,the,men,out,of,the,dining,room,and,closed,the,door,so,the,fitting,could,begin
pork,helped,gerald,upstairs,to,bed,and,ashley,and,will,were,left,alone,in,the,lamplight,in,the,front,hall
they,were,silent,for,a,while,and,will,chewed,his,tobacco,like,a,placid,ruminant,animal
but,his,mild,face,was,far,from,placid
this,goin',to,atlanta,he,said,at,last,in,a,slow,voice,i,don't,like,it
not,one,bit
ashley,looked,at,will,quickly,and,then,looked,away,saying,nothing,but,wondering,if,will,had,the,same,awful,suspicion,which,was,haunting,him
but,that,was,impossible
will,didn't,know,what,had,taken,place,in,the,orchard,that,afternoon,and,how,it,had,driven,scarlett,to,desperation
will,couldn't,have,noticed,mammy's,face,when,rhett,butler's,name,was,mentioned,and,besides,will,didn't,know,about,rhett's,money,or,his,foul,reputation
at,least,ashley,did,not,think,he,could,know,these,things,but,since,coming,back,to,tara,he,had,realized,that,will,like,mammy,seemed,to,know,things,without,being,told,to,sense,them,before,they,happened
there,was,something,ominous,in,the,air,exactly,what,ashley,did,not,know,but,he,was,powerless,to,save,scarlett,from,it
she,had,not,met,his,eyes,once,that,evening,and,the,hard,bright,gaiety,with,which,she,had,treated,him,was,frightening
the,suspicions,which,tore,at,him,were,too,terrible,to,be,put,into,words
he,did,not,have,the,right,to,insult,her,by,asking,her,if,they,were,true
he,clenched,his,fists
he,had,no,rights,at,all,where,she,was,concerned,this,afternoon,he,had,forfeited,them,all,forever
he,could,not,help,her
no,one,could,help,her
but,when,he,thought,of,mammy,and,the,look,of,grim,determination,she,wore,as,she,cut,into,the,velvet,curtains,he,was,cheered,a,little
mammy,would,take,care,of,scarlett,whether,scarlett,wished,it,or,not
i,have,caused,all,this,he,thought,despairingly
i,have,driven,her,to,this
he,remembered,the,way,she,had,squared,her,shoulders,when,she,turned,away,from,him,that,afternoon,remembered,the,stubborn,lift,of,her,head
his,heart,went,out,to,her,torn,with,his,own,helplessness,wrenched,with,admiration
he,knew,she,had,no,such,word,in,her,vocabulary,as,gallantry,knew,she,would,have,stared,blankly,if,he,had,told,her,she,was,the,most,gallant,soul,he,had,ever,known
he,knew,she,would,not,understand,how,many,truly,fine,things,he,ascribed,to,her,when,he,thought,of,her,as,gallant
he,knew,that,she,took,life,as,it,came,opposed,her,tough-fibered,mind,to,whatever,obstacles,there,might,be,fought,on,with,a,determination,that,would,not,recognize,defeat,and,kept,on,fighting,even,when,she,saw,defeat,was,inevitable
but,for,four,years,he,had,seen,others,who,had,refused,to,recognize,defeat,men,who,rode,gaily,into,sure,disaster,because,they,were,gallant
and,they,had,been,defeated,just,the,same
he,thought,as,he,stared,at,will,in,the,shadowy,hall,that,he,had,never,known,such,gallantry,as,the,gallantry,of,scarlett,o'hara,going,forth,to,conquer,the,world,in,her,mother's,velvet,curtains,and,the,tail,feathers,of,a,rooster
chapter,xxxiii
a,cold,wind,was,blowing,stiffly,and,the,scudding,clouds,overhead,were,the,deep,gray,of,slate,when,scarlett,and,mammy,stepped,from,the,train,in,atlanta,the,next,afternoon
the,depot,had,not,been,rebuilt,since,the,burning,of,the,city,and,they,alighted,amid,cinders,and,mud,a,few,yards,above,the,blackened,ruins,which,marked,the,site
habit,strong,upon,her,scarlett,looked,about,for,uncle,peter,and,pitty's,carriage,for,she,had,always,been,met,by,them,when,returning,from,tara,to,atlanta,during,the,war,years
then,she,caught,herself,with,a,sniff,at,her,own,absent-mindedness
naturally,peter,wasn't,there,for,she,had,given,aunt,pitty,no,warning,of,her,coming,and,moreover,she,remembered,that,one,of,the,old,lady's,letters,had,dealt,tearfully,with,the,death,of,the,old,nag,peter,had,'quired,in,macon,to,bring,her,back,to,atlanta,after,the,surrender
she,looked,about,the,rutted,and,cut-up,space,around,the,depot,for,the,equipage,of,some,old,friend,or,acquaintance,who,might,drive,them,to,aunt,pitty's,house,but,she,recognized,no,one,black,or,white
probably,none,of,her,old,friends,owned,carriages,now,if,what,pitty,had,written,them,was,true
times,were,so,hard,it,was,difficult,to,feed,and,lodge,humans,much,less,animals
most,of,pitty's,friends,like,herself,were,afoot,these,days
there,were,a,few,wagons,loading,at,the,freight,cars,and,several,mud-splashed,buggies,with,rough-looking,strangers,at,the,reins,but,only,two,carriages
one,was,a,closed,carriage,the,other,open,and,occupied,by,a,well-dressed,woman,and,a,yankee,officer
scarlett,drew,in,her,breath,sharply,at,the,sight,of,the,uniform
although,pitty,had,written,that,atlanta,was,garrisoned,and,the,streets,full,of,soldiers,the,first,sight,of,the,bluecoat,startled,and,frightened,her
it,was,hard,to,remember,that,the,war,was,over,and,that,this,man,would,not,pursue,her,rob,her,and,insult,her
the,comparative,emptiness,around,the,train,took,her,mind,back,to,that,morning,in,1862,when,she,had,come,to,atlanta,as,a,young,widow,swathed,in,crepe,and,wild,with,boredom
she,recalled,how,crowded,this,space,had,been,with,wagons,and,carriages,and,ambulances,and,how,noisy,with,drivers,swearing,and,yelling,and,people,calling,greetings,to,friends
she,sighed,for,the,light-hearted,excitement,of,the,war,days,and,sighed,again,at,the,thought,of,walking,all,the,way,to,aunt,pitty's,house
but,she,was,hopeful,that,once,on,peachtree,street,she,might,meet,someone,she,knew,who,would,give,them,a,ride
as,she,stood,looking,about,her,a,saddle-colored,negro,of,middle,age,drove,the,closed,carriage,toward,her,and,leaning,from,the,box,questioned,cah'ige,lady

mammy,was,a,country,negro,but,she,had,not,always,been,a,country,negro,and,she,knew,that,no,chaste,woman,ever,rode,in,a,hired,conveyance,especially,a,closed,carriage,without,the,escort,of,some,male,member,of,her,family
even,the,presence,of,a,negro,maid,would,not,satisfy,the,conventions

she,picked,up,the,carpetbag,which,held,scarlett's,new,velvet,frock,and,bonnet,and,nightgown,and,tucked,the,neat,bandanna,bundle,that,contained,her,own,belongings,under,her,arm,and,shepherded,scarlett,across,the,wet,expanse,of,cinders
scarlett,did,not,argue,the,matter,much,as,she,preferred,to,ride,for,she,wished,no,disagreement,with,mammy
ever,since,yesterday,afternoon,when,mammy,had,caught,her,with,the,velvet,curtains,there,had,been,an,alert,suspicious,look,in,her,eyes,which,scarlett,did,not,like
it,was,going,to,be,difficult,to,escape,from,her,chaperonage,and,she,did,not,intend,to,rouse,mammy's,fighting,blood,before,it,was,absolutely,necessary
as,they,walked,along,the,narrow,sidewalk,toward,peachtree,scarlett,was,dismayed,and,sorrowful,for,atlanta,looked,so,devastated,and,different,from,what,she,remembered
they,passed,beside,what,had,been,the,atlanta,hotel,where,rhett,and,uncle,henry,had,lived,and,of,that,elegant,hostelry,there,remained,only,a,shell,a,part,of,the,blackened,walls
the,warehouses,which,had,bordered,the,train,tracks,for,a,quarter,of,a,mile,and,held,tons,of,military,supplies,had,not,been,rebuilt,and,their,rectangular,foundations,looked,dreary,under,the,dark,sky
without,the,wall,of,buildings,on,either,side,and,with,the,car,shed,gone,the,railroad,tracks,seemed,bare,and,exposed
somewhere,amid,these,ruins,undistinguishable,from,the,others,lay,what,remained,of,her,own,warehouse,on,the,property,charles,had,left,her
uncle,henry,had,paid,last,year's,taxes,on,it,for,her
she'd,have,to,repay,that,money,some,time
that,was,something,else,to,worry,about
as,they,turned,the,corner,into,peachtree,street,and,she,looked,toward,five,points,she,cried,out,with,shock
despite,all,frank,had,told,her,about,the,town,burning,to,the,ground,she,had,never,really,visualized,complete,destruction
in,her,mind,the,town,she,loved,so,well,still,stood,full,of,close-packed,buildings,and,fine,houses
but,this,peachtree,street,she,was,looking,upon,was,so,denuded,of,landmarks,it,was,as,unfamiliar,as,if,she,had,never,seen,it,before
this,muddy,street,down,which,she,had,driven,a,thousand,times,during,the,war,along,which,she,had,fled,with,ducked,head,and,fear-quickened,legs,when,shells,burst,over,her,during,the,siege,this,street,she,had,last,seen,in,the,heat,and,hurry,and,anguish,of,the,day,of,the,retreat,was,so,strange,looking,she,felt,like,crying
though,many,new,buildings,had,sprung,up,in,the,year,since,sherman,marched,out,of,the,burning,town,and,the,confederates,returned,there,were,still,wide,vacant,lots,around,five,points,where,heaps,of,smudged,broken,bricks,lay,amid,a,jumble,of,rubbish,dead,weeds,and,broom-sedge
there,were,the,remains,of,a,few,buildings,she,remembered,roofless,brick,walls,through,which,the,dull,daylight,shone,glassless,windows,gaping,chimneys,towering,lonesomely
here,and,there,her,eyes,gladly,picked,out,a,familiar,store,which,had,partly,survived,shell,and,fire,and,had,been,repaired,the,fresh,red,of,new,brick,glaring,bright,against,the,smut,of,the,old,walls
on,new,store,fronts,and,new,office,windows,she,saw,the,welcome,names,of,men,she,knew,but,more,often,the,names,were,unfamiliar,especially,the,dozens,of,shingles,of,strange,doctors,and,lawyers,and,cotton,merchants
once,she,had,known,practically,everyone,in,atlanta,and,the,sight,of,so,many,strange,names,depressed,her
but,she,was,cheered,by,the,sight,of,new,buildings,going,up,all,along,the,street
there,were,dozens,of,them,and,several,were,three,stories,high
everywhere,building,was,going,on,for,as,she,looked,down,the,street,trying,to,adjust,her,mind,to,the,new,atlanta,she,heard,the,blithe,sound,of,hammers,and,saws,noticed,scaffoldings,rising,and,saw,men,climbing,ladders,with,hods,of,bricks,on,their,shoulders
she,looked,down,the,street,she,loved,so,well,and,her,eyes,misted,a,little
they,burned,you,she,thought,and,they,laid,you,flat
but,they,didn't,lick,you
they,couldn't,lick,you
you'll,grow,back,just,as,big,and,sassy,as,you,used,to,be
as,she,walked,along,peachtree,followed,by,the,waddling,mammy,she,found,the,sidewalks,just,as,crowded,as,they,were,at,the,height,of,the,war,and,there,was,the,same,air,of,rush,and,bustle,about,the,resurrecting,town,which,had,made,her,blood,sing,when,she,came,here,so,long,ago,on,her,first,visit,to,aunt,pitty
there,seemed,to,be,just,as,many,vehicles,wallowing,in,the,mud,holes,as,there,had,been,then,except,that,there,were,no,confederate,ambulances,and,just,as,many,horses,and,mules,tethered,to,hitching,racks,in,front,of,the,wooden,awnings,of,the,stores
though,the,sidewalks,were,jammed,the,faces,she,saw,were,as,unfamiliar,as,the,signs,overhead,new,people,many,rough-looking,men,and,tawdrily,dressed,women
the,streets,were,black,with,loafing,negroes,who,leaned,against,walls,or,sat,on,the,curbing,watching,vehicles,go,past,with,the,naive,curiosity,of,children,at,a,circus,parade
free,issue,country,niggers,snorted,mammy
ain',never,seed,a,proper,cah'ige,in,dere,lives
an',impident,lookin',too
they,were,impudent,looking,scarlett,agreed,for,they,stared,at,her,in,an,insolent,manner,but,she,forgot,them,in,the,renewed,shock,of,seeing,blue,uniforms
the,town,was,full,of,yankee,soldiers,on,horses,afoot,in,army,wagons,loafing,on,the,street,reeling,out,of,barrooms
i'll,never,get,used,to,them,she,thought,clenching,her,fists
never
and,over,her,shoulder,hurry,mammy,let's,get,out,of,this,crowd
soon's,ah,kick,dis,black,trash,outer,mah,way,answered,mammy,loudly,swinging,the,carpetbag,at,a,black,buck,who,loitered,tantalizingly,in,front,of,her,and,making,him,leap,aside
ah,doan,lak,disyere,town,miss,scarlett
it's,too,full,of,yankees,an',cheap,free,issue
it's,nicer,where,it,isn't,so,crowded
when,we,get,across,five,points,it,won't,be,so,bad
they,picked,their,way,across,the,slippery,stepping,stones,that,bridged,the,mud,of,decatur,street,and,continued,up,peachtree,through,a,thinning,crowd
when,they,reached,wesley,chapel,where,scarlett,had,paused,to,catch,her,breath,that,day,in,1864,when,she,had,run,for,dr,meade,she,looked,at,it,and,laughed,aloud,shortly,and,grimly
mammy's,quick,old,eyes,sought,hers,with,suspicion,and,question,but,her,curiosity,went,unsatisfied
scarlett,was,recalling,with,contempt,the,terror,which,had,ridden,her,that,day
she,had,been,crawling,with,fear,rotten,with,fear,terrified,by,the,yankees,terrified,by,the,approaching,birth,of,beau
now,she,wondered,how,she,could,have,been,so,frightened,frightened,like,a,child,at,a,loud,noise
and,what,a,child,she,had,been,to,think,that,yankees,and,fire,and,defeat,were,the,worst,things,that,could,happen,to,her
what,trivialities,they,were,beside,ellen's,death,and,gerald's,vagueness,beside,hunger,and,cold,and,back-breaking,work,and,the,living,nightmare,of,insecurity
how,easy,she,would,find,it,now,to,be,brave,before,an,invading,army,but,how,hard,to,face,the,danger,that,threatened,tara
no,she,would,never,again,be,afraid,of,anything,except,poverty
up,peachtree,came,a,closed,carriage,and,scarlett,went,to,the,curb,eagerly,to,see,if,she,knew,the,occupant,for,aunt,pitty's,house,was,still,several,blocks,away
she,and,mammy,leaned,forward,as,the,carriage,came,abreast,and,scarlett,with,a,smile,arranged,almost,called,out,when,a,woman's,head,appeared,for,a,moment,at,the,window,a,too,bright,red,head,beneath,a,fine,fur,hat
scarlett,took,a,step,back,as,mutual,recognition,leaped,into,both,faces
it,was,belle,watling,and,scarlett,had,a,glimpse,of,nostrils,distended,with,dislike,before,she,disappeared,again
strange,that,belle's,should,be,the,first,familiar,face,she,saw

gawdlmighty
breathed,mammy,her,jaw,dropping,as,she,looked,after,the,carriage,with,passionate,curiosity
she,had,not,seen,a,professional,bad,woman,since,she,left,savannah,with,ellen,more,than,twenty,years,before,and,she,wished,ardently,that,she,had,observed,belle,more,closely
she,sho,dressed,up,fine,an',got,a,fine,cah'ige,an',coachman,she,muttered

the,lord,stopped,thinking,about,us,years,ago,said,scarlett,savagely
and,don't,go,telling,me,mother,is,turning,in,her,grave,to,hear,me,say,it,either
she,wanted,to,feel,superior,and,virtuous,about,belle,but,she,could,not
if,her,plans,went,well,she,might,be,on,the,same,footing,with,belle,and,supported,by,the,same,man
while,she,did,not,regret,her,decision,one,whit,the,matter,in,its,true,light,discomfited,her
i,won't,think,of,it,now,she,told,herself,and,hurried,her,steps
they,passed,the,lot,where,the,meade,house,had,stood,and,there,remained,of,it,only,a,forlorn,pair,of,stone,steps,and,a,walk,leading,up,to,nothing
where,the,whitings',home,had,been,was,bare,ground
even,the,foundation,stones,and,the,brick,chimneys,were,gone,and,there,were,wagon,tracks,where,they,had,been,carted,away
the,brick,house,of,the,elsings,still,stood,with,a,new,roof,and,a,new,second,floor
the,bonnell,home,awkwardly,patched,and,roofed,with,rude,boards,instead,of,shingles,managed,to,look,livable,for,all,its,battered,appearance
but,in,neither,house,was,there,a,face,at,the,window,or,a,figure,on,the,porch,and,scarlett,was,glad
she,did,not,want,to,talk,to,anyone,now
then,the,new,slate,roof,of,aunt,pitty's,house,came,in,view,with,its,red-brick,walls,and,scarlett's,heart,throbbed
how,good,of,the,lord,not,to,level,it,beyond,repair
coming,out,of,the,front,yard,was,uncle,peter,a,market,basket,on,his,arm,and,when,he,saw,scarlett,and,mammy,trudging,along,a,wide,incredulous,smile,split,his,black,face
i,could,kiss,the,old,black,fool,i'm,so,glad,to,see,him,thought,scarlett,joyfully,and,she,called,run,get,auntie's,swoon,bottle,peter
it's,really,me
that,night,the,inevitable,hominy,and,dried,peas,were,on,aunt,pitty's,supper,table,and,as,scarlett,ate,them,she,made,a,vow,that,these,two,dishes,would,never,appear,on,her,table,when,she,had,money,again
and,no,matter,what,price,she,had,to,pay,she,was,going,to,have,money,again,more,than,just,enough,to,pay,the,taxes,on,tara
somehow,some,day,she,was,going,to,have,plenty,of,money,if,she,had,to,commit,murder,to,get,it
in,the,yellow,lamplight,of,the,dining,room,she,asked,pitty,about,her,finances,hoping,against,hope,that,charles',family,might,be,able,to,lend,her,the,money,she,needed
the,questions,were,none,too,subtle,but,pitty,in,her,pleasure,at,having,a,member,of,the,family,to,talk,to,did,not,even,notice,the,bald,way,the,questions,were,put
she,plunged,with,tears,into,the,details,of,her,misfortunes
she,just,didn't,know,where,her,farms,and,town,property,and,money,had,gone,but,everything,had,slipped,away
at,least,that,was,what,brother,henry,told,her
he,hadn't,been,able,to,pay,the,taxes,on,her,estate
everything,except,the,house,she,was,living,in,was,gone,and,pitty,did,not,stop,to,think,that,the,house,had,never,been,hers,but,was,the,joint,property,of,melanie,and,scarlett
brother,henry,could,just,barely,pay,taxes,on,this,house
he,gave,her,a,little,something,every,month,to,live,on,and,though,it,was,very,humiliating,to,take,money,from,him,she,had,to,do,it
brother,henry,says,he,doesn't,know,how,he'll,make,ends,meet,with,the,load,he's,carrying,and,the,taxes,so,high,but,of,course,he's,probably,lying,and,has,loads,of,money,and,just,won't,give,me,much
scarlett,knew,uncle,henry,wasn't,lying
the,few,letters,she,had,had,from,him,in,connection,with,charles',property,showed,that
the,old,lawyer,was,battling,valiantly,to,save,the,house,and,the,one,piece,of,downtown,property,where,the,warehouse,had,been,so,wade,and,scarlett,would,have,something,left,from,the,wreckage
scarlett,knew,he,was,carrying,these,taxes,for,her,at,a,great,sacrifice
of,course,he,hasn't,any,money,thought,scarlett,grimly
well,check,him,and,aunt,pitty,off,my,list
there's,nobody,left,but,rhett
i'll,have,to,do,it
i,must,do,it
but,i,mustn't,think,about,it,now
i,must,get,her,to,talking,about,rhett,so,i,can,casually,suggest,to,her,to,invite,him,to,call,tomorrow
she,smiled,and,squeezed,the,plump,palms,of,aunt,pitty,between,her,own
darling,auntie,she,said,don't,let's,talk,about,distressing,things,like,money,any,more
let's,forget,about,them,and,talk,of,pleasanter,things
you,must,tell,me,all,the,news,about,our,old,friends
how,is,mrs,merriwether,and,maybelle
i,heard,that,maybelle's,little,creole,came,home,safely
how,are,the,elsings,and,dr,and,mrs
meade
pittypat,brightened,at,the,change,of,subject,and,her,baby,face,stopped,quivering,with,tears
she,gave,detailed,reports,about,old,neighbors,what,they,were,doing,and,wearing,and,eating,and,thinking
she,told,with,accents,of,horror,how,before,rene,picard,came,home,from,the,war,mrs,merriwether,and,maybelle,had,made,ends,meet,by,baking,pies,and,selling,them,to,the,yankee,soldiers
imagine,that
sometimes,there,were,two,dozen,yankees,standing,in,the,back,yard,of,the,merriwether,home,waiting,for,the,baking,to,be,finished
now,that,rene,was,home,he,drove,an,old,wagon,to,the,yankee,camp,every,day,and,sold,cakes,and,pies,and,beaten,biscuits,to,the,soldiers
mrs,merriwether,said,that,when,she,made,a,little,more,money,she,was,going,to,open,a,bake,shop,downtown
pitty,did,not,wish,to,criticize,but,after,all,as,for,herself,said,pitty,she,would,rather,starve,than,have,such,commerce,with,yankees
she,made,a,point,of,giving,a,disdainful,look,to,every,soldier,she,met,and,crossed,to,the,other,side,of,the,street,in,as,insulting,a,manner,as,possible,though,she,said,this,was,quite,inconvenient,in,wet,weather
scarlett,gathered,that,no,sacrifice,even,though,it,be,muddy,shoes,was,too,great,to,show,loyalty,to,the,confederacy,in,so,far,as,miss,pittypat,was,concerned
mrs,meade,and,the,doctor,had,lost,their,home,when,the,yankees,fired,the,town,and,they,had,neither,the,money,nor,the,heart,to,rebuild,now,that,phil,and,darcy,were,dead
mrs,meade,said,she,never,wanted,a,home,again,for,what,was,a,home,without,children,and,grandchildren,in,it
they,were,very,lonely,and,had,gone,to,live,with,the,elsings,who,had,rebuilt,the,damaged,part,of,their,home
mr,and,mrs,whiting,had,a,room,there,too,and,mrs,bonnell,was,talking,of,moving,in,if,she,was,fortunate,enough,to,rent,her,house,to,a,yankee,officer,and,his,family
but,how,do,they,all,squeeze,in
cried,scarlett
there's,mrs,elsing,and,fanny,and,hugh
mrs,elsing,and,fanny,sleep,in,the,parlor,and,hugh,in,the,attic,explained,pitty,who,knew,the,domestic,arrangements,of,all,her,friends
my,dear,i,do,hate,to,tell,you,this,but,mrs
elsing,calls,them,'paying,guests',but,pitty,dropped,her,voice,they,are,really,nothing,at,all,except,boarders
mrs,elsing,is,running,a,boarding,house
isn't,that,dreadful
i,think,it's,wonderful,said,scarlett,shortly
i,only,wish,we'd,had,'paying,guests',at,tara,for,the,last,year,instead,of,free,boarders
maybe,we,wouldn't,be,so,poor,now
scarlett,how,can,you,say,such,things
your,poor,mother,must,be,turning,in,her,grave,at,the,very,thought,of,charging,money,for,the,hospitality,of,tara
of,course,mrs,elsing,was,simply,forced,to,it,because,while,she,took,in,fine,sewing,and,fanny,painted,china,and,hugh,made,a,little,money,peddling,firewood,they,couldn't,make,ends,meet
imagine,darling,hugh,forced,to,peddle,wood
and,he,all,set,to,be,a,fine,lawyer
i,could,just,cry,at,the,things,our,boys,are,reduced,to
scarlett,thought,of,the,rows,of,cotton,beneath,the,glaring,coppery,sky,at,tara,and,how,her,back,had,ached,as,she,bent,over,them
she,remembered,the,feel,of,plow,handles,between,her,inexperienced,blistered,palms,and,she,felt,that,hugh,elsing,was,deserving,of,no,special,sympathy
what,an,innocent,old,fool,pitty,was,and,despite,the,ruin,all,around,her,how,sheltered
if,he,doesn't,like,peddling,why,doesn't,he,practice,law
or,isn't,there,any,law,practice,left,in,atlanta
oh,dear,yes
there's,plenty,of,law,practice
practically,everybody,is,suing,everybody,else,these,days
with,everything,burned,down,and,boundary,lines,wiped,out,no,one,knows,just,where,their,land,begins,or,ends
but,you,can't,get,any,pay,for,suing,because,nobody,has,any,money
so,hugh,sticks,to,his,peddling
oh,i,almost,forgot
did,i,write,you
fanny,elsing,is,getting,married,tomorrow,night,and,of,course,you,must,attend
mrs,elsing,will,be,only,too,pleased,to,have,you,when,she,knows,you're,in,town
i,do,hope,you,have,some,other,frock,besides,that,one
not,that,it,isn't,a,very,sweet,frock,darling,but,well,it,does,look,a,bit,worn
oh,you,have,a,pretty,frock
i'm,so,glad,because,it's,going,to,be,the,first,real,wedding,we've,had,in,atlanta,since,before,the,town,fell
cake,and,wine,and,dancing,afterward,though,i,don't,know,how,the,elsings,can,afford,it,they,are,so,poor
who,is,fanny,marrying
i,thought,after,dallas,mclure,was,killed,at,gettysburg
darling,you,mustn't,criticize,fanny
everybody,isn't,as,loyal,to,the,dead,as,you,are,to,poor,charlie
let,me,see
what,is,his,name
i,can,never,remember,names,tom,somebody
i,knew,his,mother,well,we,went,to,lagrange,female,institute,together
she,was,a,tomlinson,from,lagrange,and,her,mother,was,let,me,see
perkins
parkins
parkinson
that's,it
from,sparta
a,very,good,family,but,just,the,same,well,i,know,i,shouldn't,say,it,but,i,don't,see,how,fanny,can,bring,herself,to,marry,him
does,he,drink,or
dear,no
his,character,is,perfect,but,you,see,he,was,wounded,low,down,by,a,bursting,shell,and,it,did,something,to,his,legs,makes,them,makes,them,well,i,hate,to,use,the,word,but,it,makes,him,spraddle
it,gives,him,a,very,vulgar,appearance,when,he,walks,well,it,doesn't,look,very,pretty
i,don't,see,why,she's,marrying,him
girls,have,to,marry,someone
indeed,they,do,not,said,pitty,ruffling
i,never,had,to
now,darling,i,didn't,mean,you
everybody,knows,how,popular,you,were,and,still,are
why,old,judge,canton,used,to,throw,sheep's,eyes,at,you,till,i
oh,scarlett,hush
that,old,fool
giggled,pitty,good,humor,restored
but,after,all,fanny,was,so,popular,she,could,have,made,a,better,match,and,i,don't,believe,she,loves,this,tom,what's-,his-name
i,don't,believe,she's,ever,gotten,over,dallas,mclure,getting,killed,but,she's,not,like,you,darling
you've,remained,so,faithful,to,dear,charlie,though,you,could,have,married,dozens,of,times
melly,and,i,have,often,said,how,loyal,you,were,to,his,memory,when,everyone,else,said,you,were,just,a,heartless,coquette
scarlett,passed,over,this,tactless,confidence,and,skillfully,led,pitty,from,one,friend,to,another,but,all,the,while,she,was,in,a,fever,of,impatience,to,bring,the,conversation,around,to,rhett
it,would,never,do,for,her,to,ask,outright,about,him,so,soon,after,arriving
it,might,start,the,old,lady's,mind,to,working,on,channels,better,left,untouched
there,would,be,time,enough,for,pitty's,suspicions,to,be,aroused,if,rhett,refused,to,marry,her
aunt,pitty,prattled,on,happily,pleased,as,a,child,at,having,an,audience
things,in,atlanta,were,in,a,dreadful,pass,she,said,due,to,the,vile,doings,of,the,republicans
there,was,no,end,to,their,goings,on,and,the,worst,thing,was,the,way,they,were,putting,ideas,in,the,poor,darkies',heads
my,dear,they,want,to,let,the,darkies,vote
did,you,ever,hear,of,anything,more,silly
though,i,don't,know,now,that,i,think,about,it,uncle,peter,has,much,more,sense,than,any,republican,i,ever,saw,and,much,better,manners,but,of,course,uncle,peter,is,far,too,well,bred,to,want,to,vote
but,the,very,notion,has,upset,the,darkies,till,they're,right,addled
and,some,of,them,are,so,insolent
your,life,isn't,safe,on,the,streets,after,dark,and,even,in,the,broad,daylight,they,push,ladies,off,the,sidewalks,into,the,mud
and,if,any,gentleman,dares,to,protest,they,arrest,him,and,my,dear,did,i,tell,you,that,captain,butler,was,in,jail
rhett,butler
even,with,this,startling,news,scarlett,was,grateful,that,aunt,pitty,had,saved,her,the,necessity,of,bringing,his,name,into,the,conversation,herself
yes,indeed
excitement,colored,pitty's,cheeks,pink,and,she,sat,upright
he's,in,jail,this,very,minute,for,killing,a,negro,and,they,may,hang,him
imagine,captain,butler,hanging
for,a,moment,the,breath,went,out,of,scarlett's,lungs,in,a,sickening,gasp,and,she,could,only,stare,at,the,fat,old,lady,who,was,so,obviously,pleased,at,the,effect,of,her,statement
they,haven't,proved,it,yet,but,somebody,killed,this,darky,who,had,insulted,a,white,woman
and,the,yankees,are,very,upset,because,so,many,uppity,darkies,have,been,killed,recently
they,can't,prove,it,on,captain,butler,but,they,want,to,make,an,example,of,someone,so,dr,meade,says
the,doctor,says,that,if,they,do,hang,him,it,will,be,the,first,good,honest,job,the,yankees,ever,did,but,then,i,don't,know
and,to,think,that,captain,butler,was,here,just,a,week,ago,and,brought,me,the,loveliest,quail,you,ever,saw,for,a,present,and,he,was,asking,about,you,and,saying,he,feared,he,had,offended,you,during,the,siege,and,you,would,never,forgive,him
how,long,will,he,be,in,jail
nobody,knows
perhaps,till,they,hang,him,but,maybe,they,won't,be,able,to,prove,the,killing,on,him,after,all
however,it,doesn't,seem,to,bother,the,yankees,whether,folks,are,guilty,or,not,so,long,as,they,can,hang,somebody
they,are,so,upset,pitty,dropped,her,voice,mysteriously,about,the,ku,klux,klan
do,you,have,the,klan,down,in,the,county
my,dear,i'm,sure,you,must,and,ashley,just,doesn't,tell,you,girls,anything,about,it
klansmen,aren't,supposed,to,tell
they,ride,around,at,night,dressed,up,like,ghosts,and,call,on,carpetbaggers,who,steal,money,and,negroes,who,are,uppity
sometimes,they,just,scare,them,and,warn,them,to,leave,atlanta,but,when,they,don't,behave,they,whip,them,and,pitty,whispered,sometimes,they,kill,them,and,leave,them,where,they'll,be,easily,found,with,the,ku,klux,card,on,them
and,the,yankees,are,very,angry,about,it,and,want,to,make,an,example,of,someone
but,hugh,elsing,told,me,he,didn't,think,they'd,hang,captain,butler,because,the,yankees,think,he,does,know,where,the,money,is,and,just,won't,tell
they,are,trying,to,make,him,tell
the,money
didn't,you,know
didn't,i,write,you
my,dear,you,have,been,buried,at,tara,haven't,you
the,town,simply,buzzed,when,captain,butler,came,back,here,with,a,fine,horse,and,carriage,and,his,pockets,full,of,money,when,all,the,rest,of,us,didn't,know,where,our,next,meal,was,coming,from
it,simply,made,everybody,furious,that,an,old,speculator,who,always,said,nasty,things,about,the,confederacy,should,have,so,much,money,when,we,were,all,so,poor
everybody,was,bursting,to,know,how,he,managed,to,save,his,money,but,no,one,had,the,courage,to,ask,him,except,me,and,he,just,laughed,and,said,'in,no,honest,way,you,may,be,sure,'
you,know,how,hard,it,is,to,get,anything,sensible,out,of,him
but,of,course,he,made,his,money,out,of,the,blockade
of,course,he,did,honey,some,of,it
but,that's,not,a,drop,in,the,bucket,to,what,that,man,has,really,got
everybody,including,the,yankees,believes,he's,got,millions,of,dollars,in,gold,belonging,to,the,confederate,government,hid,out,somewhere
millions,in,gold
well,honey,where,did,all,our,confederate,gold,go,to
somebody,got,it,and,captain,butler,must,be,one,of,the,somebodies
the,yankees,thought,president,davis,had,it,when,he,left,richmond,but,when,they,captured,the,poor,man,he,had,hardly,a,cent
there,just,wasn't,any,money,in,the,treasury,when,the,war,was,over,and,everybody,thinks,some,of,the,blockade,runners,got,it,and,are,keeping,quiet,about,it
millions,in,gold
but,how
didn't,captain,butler,take,thousands,of,bales,of,cotton,to,england,and,nassau,to,sell,for,the,confederate,government
asked,pitty,triumphantly
not,only,his,own,cotton,but,government,cotton,too
and,you,know,what,cotton,brought,in,england,during,the,war
any,price,you,wanted,to,ask
he,was,a,free,agent,acting,for,the,government,and,he,was,supposed,to,sell,the,cotton,and,buy,guns,with,the,money,and,run,the,guns,in,for,us
well,when,the,blockade,got,too,tight,he,couldn't,bring,in,the,guns,and,he,couldn't,have,spent,one,one-hundredth,of,the,cotton,money,on,them,anyway,so,there,were,simply,millions,of,dollars,in,english,banks,put,there,by,captain,butler,and,other,blockaders,waiting,till,the,blockade,loosened
and,you,can't,tell,me,they,banked,that,money,in,the,name,of,the,confederacy
they,put,it,in,their,own,names,and,it's,still,there
everybody,has,been,talking,about,it,ever,since,the,surrender,and,criticizing,the,blockaders,severely,and,when,the,yankees,arrested,captain,butler,for,killing,this,darky,they,must,have,heard,the,rumor,because,they've,been,at,him,to,tell,them,where,the,money,is
you,see,all,of,our,confederate,funds,belong,to,the,yankees,now,at,least,the,yankees,think,so
but,captain,butler,says,he,doesn't,know,anything
dr,meade,says,they,ought,to,hang,him,anyhow,only,hanging,is,too,good,for,a,thief,and,a,profiteer,dear,you,look,so,oddly
do,you,feel,faint
have,i,upset,you,talking,like,this
i,knew,he,was,once,a,beau,of,yours,but,i,thought,you'd,fallen,out,long,ago
personally,i,never,approved,of,him,for,he's,such,a,scamp
he's,no,friend,of,mine,said,scarlett,with,an,effort
i,had,a,quarrel,with,him,during,the,siege,after,you,went,to,macon
where,where,is,he
in,the,firehouse,over,near,the,public,square
in,the,firehouse
aunt,pitty,crowed,with,laughter
yes,he's,in,the,firehouse
the,yankees,use,it,for,a,military,jail,now
the,yankees,are,camped,in,huts,all,round,the,city,hall,in,the,square,and,the,firehouse,is,just,down,the,street,so,that's,where,captain,butler,is
and,scarlett,i,heard,the,funniest,thing,yesterday,about,captain,butler
i,forget,who,told,me
you,know,how,well,groomed,he,always,was,really,a,dandy,and,they've,been,keeping,him,in,the,firehouse,and,not,letting,him,bathe,and,every,day,he's,been,insisting,that,he,wanted,a,bath,and,finally,they,led,him,out,of,his,cell,onto,the,square,and,there,was,a,long,horse,trough,where,the,whole,regiment,had,bathed,in,the,same,water
and,they,told,him,he,could,bathe,there,and,he,said,no,that,he,preferred,his,own,brand,of,southern,dirt,to,yankee,dirt,and
scarlett,heard,the,cheerful,babbling,voice,going,on,and,on,but,she,did,not,hear,the,words
in,her,mind,there,were,only,two,ideas,rhett,had,more,money,than,she,had,even,hoped,and,he,was,in,jail
the,fact,that,he,was,in,jail,and,possibly,might,be,hanged,changed,the,face,of,matters,somewhat,in,fact,made,them,look,a,little,brighter
she,had,very,little,feeling,about,rhett,being,hanged
her,need,of,money,was,too,pressing,too,desperate,for,her,to,bother,about,his,ultimate,fate
besides,she,half,shared,dr,meade's,opinion,that,hanging,was,too,good,for,him
any,man,who'd,leave,a,woman,stranded,between,two,armies,in,the,middle,of,the,night,just,to,go,off,and,fight,for,a,cause,already,lost,deserved,hanging
if,she,could,somehow,manage,to,marry,him,while,he,was,in,jail,all,those,millions,would,be,hers,and,hers,alone,should,he,be,executed
and,if,marriage,was,not,possible,perhaps,she,could,get,a,loan,from,him,by,promising,to,marry,him,when,he,was,released,or,by,promising,oh,promising,anything
and,if,they,hanged,him,her,day,of,settlement,would,never,come
for,a,moment,her,imagination,flamed,at,the,thought,of,being,made,a,widow,by,the,kindly,intervention,of,the,yankee,government
millions,in,gold
she,could,repair,tara,and,hire,hands,and,plant,miles,and,miles,of,cotton
and,she,could,have,pretty,clothes,and,all,she,wanted,to,eat,and,so,could,suellen,and,carreen
and,wade,could,have,nourishing,food,to,fill,out,his,thin,cheeks,and,warm,clothes,and,a,governess,and,afterward,go,to,the,university
and,not,grow,up,barefooted,and,ignorant,like,a,cracker
and,a,good,doctor,could,look,after,pa,and,as,for,ashley,what,couldn't,she,do,for,ashley
aunt,pittypat's,monologue,broke,off,suddenly,as,she,said,inquiringly,yes,mammy
and,scarlett,coming,back,from,dreams,saw,mammy,standing,in,the,doorway,her,hands,under,her,apron,and,in,her,eyes,an,alert,piercing,look
she,wondered,how,long,mammy,had,been,standing,there,and,how,much,she,had,heard,and,observed
probably,everything,to,judge,by,the,gleam,in,her,old,eyes
miss,scarlett,look,lak,she,tared
ah,spec,she,better,go,ter,bed
i,am,tired,said,scarlett,rising,and,meeting,mammy's,eyes,with,a,childlike,helpless,look,and,i'm,afraid,i'm,catching,a,cold,too
aunt,pitty,would,you,mind,if,i,stayed,in,bed,tomorrow,and,didn't,go,calling,with,you
i,can,go,calling,any,time,and,i'm,so,anxious,to,go,to,fanny's,wedding,tomorrow,night
and,if,my,cold,gets,worse,i,won't,be,able,to,go
and,a,day,in,bed,would,be,such,a,lovely,treat,for,me
mammy's,look,changed,to,faint,worry,as,she,felt,scarlett's,hands,and,looked,into,her,face
she,certainly,didn't,look,well
the,excitement,of,her,thoughts,had,abruptly,ebbed,leaving,her,white,and,shaking
yo',han's,lak,ice,honey
you,come,ter,bed,an',ah'll,brew,you,some,sassfrass,tea,an',git,you,a,hot,brick,ter,mek,you,sweat
how,thoughtless,i've,been,cried,the,plump,old,lady,hopping,from,her,chair,and,patting,scarlett's,arm
just,chattering,on,and,not,thinking,of,you
honey,you,shall,stay,in,bed,all,tomorrow,and,rest,up,and,we,can,gossip,together,oh,dear,no
i,can't,be,with,you
i've,promised,to,sit,with,mrs,bonnell,tomorrow
she,is,down,with,la,grippe,and,so,is,her,cook
mammy,i'm,so,glad,you,are,here
you,must,go,over,with,me,in,the,morning,and,help,me
mammy,hurried,scarlett,up,the,dark,stairs,muttering,fussy,remarks,about,cold,hands,and,thin,shoes,and,scarlett,looked,meek,and,was,well,content
if,she,could,only,lull,mammy's,suspicions,further,and,get,her,out,of,the,house,in,the,morning,all,would,be,well
then,she,could,go,to,the,yankee,jail,and,see,rhett
as,she,climbed,the,stairs,the,faint,rumbling,of,thunder,began,and,standing,on,the,well-remembered,landing,she,thought,how,like,the,siege,cannon,it,sounded
she,shivered
forever,thunder,would,mean,cannon,and,war,to,her
chapter,xxxiv
the,sun,shone,intermittently,the,next,morning,and,the,hard,wind,that,drove,dark,clouds,swiftly,across,its,face,rattled,the,windowpanes,and,moaned,faintly,about,the,house
scarlett,said,a,brief,prayer,of,thanksgiving,that,the,rain,of,the,previous,night,had,ceased,for,she,had,lain,awake,listening,to,it,knowing,that,it,would,mean,the,ruin,of,her,velvet,dress,and,new,bonnet
now,that,she,could,catch,fleeting,glimpses,of,the,sun,her,spirits,soared
she,could,hardly,remain,in,bed,and,look,languid,and,make,croaking,noises,until,aunt,pitty,mammy,and,uncle,peter,were,out,of,the,house,and,on,their,way,to,mrs,bonnell's
when,at,last,the,front,gate,banged,and,she,was,alone,in,the,house,except,for,cookie,who,was,singing,in,the,kitchen,she,leaped,from,the,bed,and,lifted,her,new,clothes,from,the,closet,hooks
sleep,had,refreshed,her,and,given,her,strength,and,from,the,cold,hard,core,at,the,bottom,of,her,heart,she,drew,courage
there,was,something,about,the,prospect,of,a,struggle,of,wits,with,a,man,with,any,man,that,put,her,on,her,mettle,and,after,months,of,battling,against,countless,discouragements,the,knowledge,that,she,was,at,last,facing,a,definite,adversary,one,whom,she,might,unhorse,by,her,own,efforts,gave,her,a,buoyant,sensation
dressing,unaided,was,difficult,but,she,finally,accomplished,it,and,putting,on,the,bonnet,with,its,rakish,feathers,she,ran,to,aunt,pitty's,room,to,preen,herself,in,front,of,the,long,mirror
how,pretty,she,looked
the,cock,feathers,gave,her,a,dashing,air,and,the,dull-green,velvet,of,the,bonnet,made,her,eyes,startlingly,bright,almost,emerald,colored
and,the,dress,was,incomparable,so,rich,and,handsome,looking,and,yet,so,dignified
it,was,wonderful,to,have,a,lovely,dress,again
it,was,so,nice,to,know,that,she,looked,pretty,and,provocative,and,she,impulsively,bent,forward,and,kissed,her,reflection,in,the,mirror,and,then,laughed,at,her,own,foolishness
she,picked,up,ellen's,paisley,shawl,to,wrap,about,her,but,the,colors,of,the,faded,old,square,clashed,with,the,moss-green,dress,and,made,her,appear,a,little,shabby
opening,aunt,pitty's,closet,she,removed,a,black,broadcloth,cloak,a,thin,fall,garment,which,pitty,used,only,for,sunday,wear,and,put,it,on
she,slipped,into,her,pierced,ears,the,diamond,earrings,she,had,brought,from,tara,and,tossed,her,head,to,observe,the,effect
they,made,pleasant,clicking,noises,which,were,very,satisfactory,and,she,thought,that,she,must,remember,to,toss,her,head,frequently,when,with,rhett
dancing,earrings,always,attracted,a,man,and,gave,a,girl,such,a,spirited,air
what,a,shame,aunt,pitty,had,no,other,gloves,than,the,ones,now,on,her,fat,hands
no,woman,could,really,feel,like,a,lady,without,gloves,but,scarlett,had,not,had,a,pair,since,she,left,atlanta
and,the,long,months,of,hard,work,at,tara,had,roughened,her,hands,until,they,were,far,from,pretty
well,it,couldn't,be,helped
she'd,take,aunt,pitty's,little,seal,muff,and,hide,her,bare,hands,in,it
scarlett,felt,that,it,gave,her,the,final,finishing,touch,of,elegance
no,one,looking,at,her,now,would,suspect,that,poverty,and,want,were,standing,at,her,shoulder
it,was,so,important,that,rhett,should,not,suspect
he,must,not,think,that,anything,but,tender,feelings,were,driving,her
she,tiptoed,down,the,stairs,and,out,of,the,house,while,cookie,bawled,on,unconcernedly,in,the,kitchen
she,hastened,down,baker,street,to,avoid,the,all,seeing,eyes,of,the,neighbors,and,sat,down,on,a,carriage,block,on,ivy,street,in,front,of,a,burned,house,to,wait,for,some,passing,carriage,or,wagon,which,would,give,her,a,ride
the,sun,dipped,in,and,out,from,behind,hurrying,clouds,lighting,the,street,with,a,false,brightness,which,had,no,warmth,in,it,and,the,wind,fluttered,the,lace,of,her,pantalets
it,was,colder,than,she,had,expected,and,she,wrapped,aunt,pitty's,thin,cloak,about,her,and,shivered,impatiently
just,as,she,was,preparing,to,start,walking,the,long,way,across,town,to,the,yankee,encampment,a,battered,wagon,appeared
in,it,was,an,old,woman,with,a,lip,full,of,snuff,and,a,weather-beaten,face,under,a,drab,sunbonnet,driving,a,dawdling,old,mule
she,was,going,in,the,direction,of,the,city,hall,and,she,grudgingly,gave,scarlett,a,ride
but,it,was,obvious,that,the,dress,bonnet,and,muff,found,no,favor,with,her
she,thinks,i'm,a,hussy,thought,scarlett
and,perhaps,she's,right,at,that
when,at,last,they,reached,the,town,square,and,the,tall,white,cupola,of,the,city,hall,loomed,up,she,made,her,thanks,climbed,down,from,the,wagon,and,watched,the,country,woman,drive,off
looking,around,carefully,to,see,that,she,was,not,observed,she,pinched,her,cheeks,to,give,them,color,and,bit,her,lips,until,they,stung,to,make,them,red
she,adjusted,the,bonnet,and,smoothed,back,her,hair,and,looked,about,the,square
the,two-story,red-brick,city,hall,had,survived,the,burning,of,the,city
but,it,looked,forlorn,and,unkempt,under,the,gray,sky
surrounding,the,building,completely,and,covering,the,square,of,land,of,which,it,was,the,center,were,row,after,row,of,army,huts,dingy,and,mud,splashed
yankee,soldiers,loitered,everywhere,and,scarlett,looked,at,them,uncertainly,some,of,her,courage,deserting,her
how,would,she,go,about,finding,rhett,in,this,enemy,camp
she,looked,down,the,street,toward,the,firehouse,and,saw,that,the,wide,arched,doors,were,closed,and,heavily,barred,and,two,sentries,passed,and,repassed,on,each,side,of,the,building
rhett,was,in,there
but,what,should,she,say,to,the,yankee,soldiers
and,what,would,they,say,to,her
she,squared,her,shoulders
if,she,hadn't,been,afraid,to,kill,one,yankee,she,shouldn't,fear,merely,talking,to,another
she,picked,her,way,precariously,across,the,stepping,stones,of,the,muddy,street,and,walked,forward,until,a,sentry,his,blue,overcoat,buttoned,high,against,the,wind,stopped,her
what,is,it,ma'm
his,voice,had,a,strange,mid-western,twang,but,it,was,polite,and,respectful
i,want,to,see,a,man,in,there,he,is,a,prisoner
well,i,don't,know,said,the,sentry,scratching,his,head
they,are,mighty,particular,about,visitors,and,he,stopped,and,peered,into,her,face,sharply
lord,lady
don't,you,cry
you,go,over,to,post,headquarters,and,ask,the,officers
they'll,let,you,see,him,i,bet
scarlett,who,had,no,intention,of,crying,beamed,at,him
he,turned,to,another,sentry,who,was,slowly,pacing,his,beat,yee-ah,bill
come'eer
the,second,sentry,a,large,man,muffled,in,a,blue,overcoat,from,which,villainous,black,whiskers,burst,came,through,the,mud,toward,them
you,take,this,lady,to,headquarters
scarlett,thanked,him,and,followed,the,sentry
mind,you,don't,turn,your,ankle,on,those,stepping,stones,said,the,soldier,taking,her,arm
and,you'd,better,hist,up,your,skirts,a,little,to,keep,them,out,of,the,mud
the,voice,issuing,from,the,whiskers,had,the,same,nasal,twang,but,was,kind,and,pleasant,and,his,hand,was,firm,and,respectful
why,yankees,weren't,bad,at,all
it's,a,mighty,cold,day,for,a,lady,to,be,out,in,said,her,escort
have,you,come,a,fer,piece
oh,yes,from,clear,across,the,other,side,of,town,she,said,warming,to,the,kindness,in,his,voice
this,ain't,no,weather,for,a,lady,to,be,out,in,said,the,soldier,reprovingly,with,all,this,la,grippe,in,the,air
here's,post,command,lady,what's,the,matter
this,house,this,house,is,your,headquarters
scarlett,looked,up,at,the,lovely,old,dwelling,facing,on,the,square,and,could,have,cried
she,had,been,to,so,many,parties,in,this,house,during,the,war
it,had,been,a,gay,beautiful,place,and,now,there,was,a,large,united,states,flag,floating,over,it
what's,the,matter
nothing,only,only,i,used,to,know,the,people,who,lived,here
well,that's,too,bad
i,guess,they,wouldn't,know,it,themselves,if,they,saw,it,for,it,shore,is,torn,up,on,the,inside
now,you,go,on,in,ma'm,and,ask,for,the,captain
she,went,up,the,steps,caressing,the,broken,white,banisters,and,pushed,open,the,front,door
the,hall,was,dark,and,as,cold,as,a,vault,and,a,shivering,sentry,was,leaning,against,the,closed,folding,doors,of,what,had,been,in,better,days,the,dining,room
i,want,to,see,the,captain,she,said
he,pulled,back,the,doors,and,she,entered,the,room,her,heart,beating,rapidly,her,face,flushing,with,embarrassment,and,excitement
there,was,a,close,stuffy,smell,in,the,room,compounded,of,the,smoking,fire,tobacco,fumes,leather,damp,woolen,uniforms,and,unwashed,bodies
she,had,a,confused,impression,of,bare,walls,with,torn,wallpaper,rows,of,blue,overcoats,and,slouch,hats,hung,on,nails,a,roaring,fire,a,long,table,covered,with,papers,and,a,group,of,officers,in,blue,uniforms,with,brass,buttons
she,gulped,once,and,found,her,voice
she,mustn't,let,these,yankees,know,she,was,afraid
she,must,look,and,be,her,prettiest,and,most,unconcerned,self
the,captain
i'm,one,captain,said,a,fat,man,whose,tunic,was,unbuttoned
i,want,to,see,a,prisoner,captain,rhett,butler
butler,again
he's,popular,that,man,laughed,the,captain,taking,a,chewed,cigar,from,his,mouth
you,a,relative,ma'm
yes,his,his,sister
he,laughed,again
he's,got,a,lot,of,sisters,one,of,them,here,yesterday
scarlett,flushed
one,of,those,creatures,rhett,consorted,with,probably,that,watling,woman
and,these,yankees,thought,she,was,another,one
it,was,unendurable
not,even,for,tara,would,she,stay,here,another,minute,and,be,insulted
she,turned,to,the,door,and,reached,angrily,for,the,knob,but,another,officer,was,by,her,side,quickly
he,was,clean,shaven,and,young,and,had,merry,kind,eyes
just,a,minute,ma'm
won't,you,sit,down,here,by,the,fire,where,it's,warm
i'll,go,see,what,i,can,do,about,it
what,is,your,name
he,refused,to,see,the,lady,who,called,yesterday
she,sank,into,the,proffered,chair,glaring,at,the,discomfited,fat,captain,and,gave,her,name
the,nice,young,officer,slipped,on,his,overcoat,and,left,the,room,and,the,others,took,themselves,off,to,the,far,end,of,the,table,where,they,talked,in,low,tones,and,pawed,at,the,papers
she,stretched,her,feet,gratefully,toward,the,fire,realizing,for,the,first,time,how,cold,they,were,and,wishing,she,had,thought,to,put,a,piece,of,cardboard,over,the,hole,in,the,sole,of,one,slipper
after,a,time,voices,murmured,outside,the,door,and,she,heard,rhett's,laugh
the,door,opened,a,cold,draft,swept,the,room,and,rhett,appeared,hatless,a,long,cape,thrown,carelessly,across,his,shoulders
he,was,dirty,and,unshaven,and,without,a,cravat,but,somehow,jaunty,despite,his,dishabille,and,his,dark,eyes,were,snapping,joyfully,at,the,sight,of,her
scarlett
he,had,her,hands,in,both,of,his,and,as,always,there,was,something,hot,and,vital,and,exciting,about,his,grip
before,she,quite,knew,what,he,was,about,he,had,bent,and,kissed,her,cheek,his,mustache,tickling,her
as,he,felt,the,startled,movement,of,her,body,away,from,him,he,hugged,her,about,the,shoulders,and,said,my,darling,little,sister
and,grinned,down,at,her,as,if,he,relished,her,helplessness,in,resisting,his,caress
she,couldn't,help,laughing,back,at,him,for,the,advantage,he,had,taken
what,a,rogue,he,was
jail,had,not,changed,him,one,bit
the,fat,captain,was,muttering,through,his,cigar,to,the,merry-eyed,officer
most,irregular
he,should,be,in,the,firehouse
you,know,the,orders
oh,for,god's,sake,henry
the,lady,would,freeze,in,that,barn
oh,all,right,all,right
it's,your,responsibility
i,assure,you,gentlemen,said,rhett,turning,to,them,but,still,keeping,a,grip,on,scarlett's,shoulders,my,sister,hasn't,brought,me,any,saws,or,files,to,help,me,escape
they,all,laughed,and,as,they,did,scarlett,looked,quickly,about,her
good,heavens,was,she,going,to,have,to,talk,to,rhett,before,six,yankee,officers
was,he,so,dangerous,a,prisoner,they,wouldn't,let,him,out,of,their,sight
seeing,her,anxious,glance,the,nice,officer,pushed,open,a,door,and,spoke,brief,low,words,to,two,privates,who,had,leaped,to,their,feet,at,his,entrance
they,picked,up,their,rifles,and,went,out,into,the,hall,closing,the,door,behind,them
if,you,wish,you,may,sit,here,in,the,orderly,room,said,the,young,captain
and,don't,try,to,bolt,through,that,door
the,men,are,just,outside
you,see,what,a,desperate,character,i,am,scarlett,said,rhett
thank,you,captain
this,is,most,kind,of,you
he,bowed,carelessly,and,taking,scarlett's,arm,pulled,her,to,her,feet,and,propelled,her,into,the,dingy,orderly,room
she,was,never,to,remember,what,the,room,looked,like,except,that,it,was,small,and,dim,and,none,too,warm,and,there,were,handwritten,papers,tacked,on,the,mutilated,walls,and,chairs,which,had,cowhide,seats,with,the,hair,still,on,them
when,he,had,closed,the,door,behind,them,rhett,came,to,her,swiftly,and,bent,over,her
knowing,his,desire,she,turned,her,head,quickly,but,smiled,provocatively,at,him,out,of,the,corners,of,her,eyes
can't,i,really,kiss,you,now
on,the,forehead,like,a,good,brother,she,answered,demurely
thank,you,no
i,prefer,to,wait,and,hope,for,better,things
his,eyes,sought,her,lips,and,lingered,there,a,moment
but,how,good,of,you,to,come,to,see,me,scarlett
you,are,the,first,respectable,citizen,who,has,called,on,me,since,my,incarceration,and,being,in,jail,makes,one,appreciate,friends
when,did,you,come,to,town
yesterday,afternoon
and,you,came,out,this,morning
why,my,dear,you,are,more,than,good
he,smiled,down,at,her,with,the,first,expression,of,honest,pleasure,she,had,ever,seen,on,his,face
scarlett,smiled,inwardly,with,excitement,and,ducked,her,head,as,if,embarrassed
of,course,i,came,out,right,away
aunt,pitty,told,me,about,you,last,night,and,i,i,just,couldn't,sleep,all,night,for,thinking,how,awful,it,was
rhett,i'm,so,distressed
why,scarlett
his,voice,was,soft,but,there,was,a,vibrant,note,in,it,and,looking,up,into,his,dark,face,she,saw,in,it,none,of,the,skepticism,the,jeering,humor,she,knew,so,well
before,his,direct,gaze,her,eyes,fell,again,in,real,confusion
things,were,going,even,better,than,she,hoped
it's,worth,being,in,jail,to,see,you,again,and,to,hear,you,say,things,like,that
i,really,couldn't,believe,my,ears,when,they,brought,me,your,name
you,see,i,never,expected,you,to,forgive,me,for,my,patriotic,conduct,that,night,on,the,road,near,rough,and,ready
but,i,take,it,that,this,call,means,you,have,forgiven,me
she,could,feel,swift,anger,stir,even,at,this,late,date,as,she,thought,of,that,night,but,she,subdued,it,and,tossed,her,head,until,the,earrings,danced
no,i,haven't,forgiven,you,she,said,and,pouted
another,hope,crushed
and,after,i,offered,up,myself,for,my,country,and,fought,barefooted,in,the,snow,at,franklin,and,got,the,finest,case,of,dysentery,you,ever,heard,of,for,my,pains
i,don't,want,to,hear,about,your,pains,she,said,still,pouting,but,smiling,at,him,from,up-tilted,eyes
i,still,think,you,were,hateful,that,night,and,i,never,expect,to,forgive,you
leaving,me,alone,like,that,when,anything,might,have,happened,to,me
but,nothing,did,happen,to,you
so,you,see,my,confidence,in,you,was,justified
i,knew,you'd,get,home,safely,and,god,help,any,yankee,who,got,in,your,way
rhett,why,on,earth,did,you,do,such,a,silly,thing,enlisting,at,the,last,minute,when,you,knew,we,were,going,to,get,licked
and,after,all,you'd,said,about,idiots,who,went,out,and,got,shot
scarlett,spare,me
i,am,always,overcome,with,shame,when,i,think,about,it
well,i'm,glad,to,learn,you,are,ashamed,of,the,way,you,treated,me
you,misunderstand
i,regret,to,say,that,my,conscience,has,not,troubled,me,at,all,about,deserting,you
but,as,for,enlisting,when,i,think,of,joining,the,army,in,varnished,boots,and,a,white,linen,suit,and,armed,with,only,a,pair,of,dueling,pistols,and,those,long,cold,miles,in,the,snow,after,my,boots,wore,out,and,i,had,no,overcoat,and,nothing,to,eat
i,cannot,understand,why,i,did,not,desert
it,was,all,the,purest,insanity
but,it's,in,one's,blood
southerners,can,never,resist,a,losing,cause
but,never,mind,my,reasons
it's,enough,that,i'm,forgiven
you're,not
i,think,you're,a,hound
but,she,caressed,the,last,word,until,it,might,have,been,darling
don't,fib
you've,forgiven,me
young,ladies,don't,dare,yankee,sentries,to,see,a,prisoner,just,for,charity's,sweet,sake,and,come,all,dressed,up,in,velvet,and,feathers,and,seal,muffs,too
scarlett,how,pretty,you,look
thank,god,you,aren't,in,rags,or,mourning
i,get,so,sick,of,women,in,dowdy,old,clothes,and,perpetual,crepe
you,look,like,the,rue,de,la,paix
turn,around,my,dear,and,let,me,look,at,you
so,he,had,noticed,the,dress
of,course,he,would,notice,such,things,being,rhett
she,laughed,in,soft,excitement,and,spun,about,on,her,toes,her,arms,extended,her,hoops,tilting,up,to,show,her,lace,trimmed,pantalets
his,black,eyes,took,her,in,from,bonnet,to,heels,in,a,glance,that,missed,nothing,that,old,impudent,unclothing,glance,which,always,gave,her,goose,bumps
you,look,very,prosperous,and,very,very,tidy
and,almost,good,enough,to,eat
if,it,wasn't,for,the,yankees,outside,but,you,are,quite,safe,my,dear
sit,down
i,won't,take,advantage,of,you,as,i,did,the,last,time,i,saw,you
he,rubbed,his,cheek,with,pseudo,ruefulness
honestly,scarlett,don't,you,think,you,were,a,bit,selfish,that,night
think,of,all,i,had,done,for,you,risked,my,life,stolen,a,horse,and,such,a,horse
rushed,to,the,defense,of,our,glorious,cause
and,what,did,i,get,for,my,pains
some,hard,words,and,a,very,hard,slap,in,the,face
she,sat,down
the,conversation,was,not,going,in,quite,the,direction,she,hoped
he,had,seemed,so,nice,when,he,first,saw,her,so,genuinely,glad,she,had,come
he,had,almost,seemed,like,a,human,being,and,not,the,perverse,wretch,she,knew,so,well
must,you,always,get,something,for,your,pains
why,of,course
i,am,a,monster,of,selfishness,as,you,ought,to,know
i,always,expect,payment,for,anything,i,give
that,sent,a,slight,chill,through,her,but,she,rallied,and,jingled,her,earbobs,again
oh,you,really,aren't,so,bad,rhett
you,just,like,to,show,off
my,word,but,you,have,changed
he,said,and,laughed
what,has,made,a,christian,of,you
i,have,kept,up,with,you,through,miss,pittypat,but,she,gave,me,no,intimation,that,you,had,developed,womanly,sweetness
tell,me,more,about,yourself,scarlett
what,have,you,been,doing,since,i,last,saw,you
the,old,irritation,and,antagonism,which,he,roused,in,her,was,hot,in,her,heart,and,she,yearned,to,speak,tart,words
but,she,smiled,instead,and,the,dimple,crept,into,her,cheek
he,had,drawn,a,chair,close,beside,hers,and,she,leaned,over,and,put,a,gentle,hand,on,his,arm,in,an,unconscious,manner
oh,i've,been,doing,nicely,thank,you,and,everything,at,tara,is,fine,now
of,course,we,had,a,dreadful,time,right,after,sherman,went,through,but,after,all,he,didn't,burn,the,house,and,the,darkies,saved,most,of,the,livestock,by,driving,it,into,the,swamp
and,we,cleared,a,fair,crop,this,last,fall,twenty,bales
of,course,that's,practically,nothing,compared,with,what,tara,can,do,but,we,haven't,many,field,hands
pa,says,of,course,we'll,do,better,next,year
but,rhett,it's,so,dull,in,the,country,now
imagine,there,aren't,any,balls,or,barbecues,and,the,only,thing,people,talk,about,is,hard,times
goodness,i,get,sick,of,it
finally,last,week,i,got,too,bored,to,stand,it,any,longer,so,pa,said,i,must,take,a,trip,and,have,a,good,time
so,i,came,up,here,to,get,me,some,frocks,made,and,then,i'm,going,over,to,charleston,to,visit,my,aunt
it'll,be,lovely,to,go,to,balls,again
there,she,thought,with,pride,i,delivered,that,with,just,the,right,airy,way
not,too,rich,but,certainly,not,poor
you,look,beautiful,in,ball,dresses,my,dear,and,you,know,it,too,worse,luck
i,suppose,the,real,reason,you,are,going,visiting,is,that,you,have,run,through,the,county,swains,and,are,seeking,fresh,ones,in,fields,afar
scarlett,had,a,thankful,thought,that,rhett,had,spent,the,last,several,months,abroad,and,had,only,recently,come,back,to,atlanta
otherwise,he,would,never,have,made,so,ridiculous,a,statement
she,thought,briefly,of,the,county,swains,the,ragged,embittered,little,fontaines,the,poverty-stricken,munroe,boys,the,jonesboro,and,fayetteville,beaux,who,were,so,busy,plowing,splitting,rails,and,nursing,sick,old,animals,that,they,had,forgotten,such,things,as,balls,and,pleasant,flirtations,ever,existed
but,she,put,down,this,memory,and,giggled,self-consciously,as,if,admitting,the,truth,of,his,assertion
oh,well,she,said,deprecatingly
you,are,a,heartless,creature,scarlett,but,perhaps,that's,part,of,your,charm
he,smiled,in,his,old,way,one,corner,of,his,mouth,curving,down,but,she,knew,he,was,complimenting,her
for,of,course,you,know,you,have,more,charm,than,the,law,should,permit
even,i,have,felt,it,case-hardened,though,i,am
i've,often,wondered,what,it,was,about,you,that,made,me,always,remember,you,for,i've,known,many,ladies,who,were,prettier,than,you,and,certainly,more,clever,and,i,fear,morally,more,upright,and,kind
but,somehow,i,always,remembered,you
even,during,the,months,since,the,surrender,when,i,was,in,france,and,england,and,hadn't,seen,you,or,heard,of,you,and,was,enjoying,the,society,of,many,beautiful,ladies,i,always,remembered,you,and,wondered,what,you,were,doing
for,a,moment,she,was,indignant,that,he,should,say,other,women,were,prettier,more,clever,and,kind,than,she,but,that,momentary,flare,was,wiped,out,in,her,pleasure,that,he,had,remembered,her,and,her,charm
so,he,hadn't,forgotten
that,would,make,things,easier
and,he,was,behaving,so,nicely,almost,like,a,gentleman,would,do,under,the,circumstances
now,all,she,had,to,do,was,bring,the,subject,around,to,himself,so,she,could,intimate,that,she,had,not,forgotten,him,either,and,then
she,gently,squeezed,his,arm,and,dimpled,again
oh,rhett,how,you,do,run,on,teasing,a,country,girl,like,me
i,know,mighty,well,you,never,gave,me,a,thought,after,you,left,me,that,night
you,can't,tell,me,you,ever,thought,of,me,with,all,those,pretty,french,and,english,girls,around,you
but,i,didn't,come,all,the,way,out,here,to,hear,you,talk,foolishness,about,me
i,came,i,came,because
because
oh,rhett,i'm,so,terribly,distressed,about,you
so,frightened,for,you
when,will,they,let,you,out,of,that,terrible,place
he,swiftly,covered,her,hand,with,his,and,held,it,hard,against,his,arm
your,distress,does,you,credit
there's,no,telling,when,i'll,be,out
probably,when,they've,stretched,the,rope,a,bit,more
the,rope
yes,i,expect,to,make,my,exit,from,here,at,the,rope's,end
they,won't,really,hang,you
they,will,if,they,can,get,a,little,more,evidence,against,me
oh,rhett
she,cried,her,hand,at,her,heart
would,you,be,sorry
if,you,are,sorry,enough,i'll,mention,you,in,my,will
his,dark,eyes,laughed,at,her,recklessly,and,he,squeezed,her,hand
his,will
she,hastily,cast,down,her,eyes,for,fear,of,betrayal,but,not,swiftly,enough,for,his,eyes,gleamed,suddenly,curious
according,to,the,yankees,i,ought,to,have,a,fine,will
there,seems,to,be,considerable,interest,in,my,finances,at,present
every,day,i,am,hauled,up,before,another,board,of,inquiry,and,asked,foolish,questions
the,rumor,seems,current,that,i,made,off,with,the,mythical,gold,of,the,confederacy
well,did,you
what,a,leading,question
you,know,as,well,as,i,do,that,the,confederacy,ran,a,printing,press,instead,of,a,mint
where,did,you,get,all,your,money
speculating
aunt,pittypat,said
what,probing,questions,you,ask
damn,him
of,course,he,had,the,money
she,was,so,excited,it,became,difficult,to,talk,sweetly,to,him
rhett,i'm,so,upset,about,your,being,here
don't,you,think,there's,a,chance,of,your,getting,out
'nihil,desperandum',is,my,motto
what,does,that,mean
it,means,'maybe,',my,charming,ignoramus
she,fluttered,her,thick,lashes,up,to,look,at,him,and,fluttered,them,down,again
oh,you're,too,smart,to,let,them,hang,you
i,know,you'll,think,of,some,clever,way,to,beat,them,and,get,out
and,when,you,do
and,when,i,do
he,asked,softly,leaning,closer
well,i,and,she,managed,a,pretty,confusion,and,a,blush
the,blush,was,not,difficult,for,she,was,breathless,and,her,heart,was,beating,like,a,drum
rhett,i'm,so,sorry,about,what,i,i,said,to,you,that,night,you,know,at,rough,and,ready
i,was,oh,so,very,frightened,and,upset,and,you,were,so,so,she,looked,down,and,saw,his,brown,hand,tighten,over,hers
and,i,thought,then,that,i'd,never,never,forgive,you
but,when,aunt,pitty,told,me,yesterday,that,you,that,they,might,hang,you,it,came,over,me,of,a,sudden,and,i,i,she,looked,up,into,his,eyes,with,one,swift,imploring,glance,and,in,it,she,put,an,agony,of,heartbreak
oh,rhett,i'd,die,if,they,hanged,you
i,couldn't,bear,it
you,see,i,and,because,she,could,not,longer,sustain,the,hot,leaping,light,that,was,in,his,eyes,her,lids,fluttered,down,again
in,a,moment,i'll,be,crying,she,thought,in,a,frenzy,of,wonder,and,excitement
shall,i,let,myself,cry
would,that,seem,more,natural
he,said,quickly,my,god,scarlett,you,can't,mean,that,you,and,his,hands,closed,over,hers,in,so,hard,a,grip,that,it,hurt
she,shut,her,eyes,tightly,trying,to,squeeze,out,tears,but,remembered,to,turn,her,face,up,slightly,so,he,could,kiss,her,with,no,difficulty
now,in,an,instant,his,lips,would,be,upon,hers,the,hard,insistent,lips,which,she,suddenly,remembered,with,a,vividness,that,left,her,weak
but,he,did,not,kiss,her
disappointment,queerly,stirring,her,she,opened,her,eyes,a,trifle,and,ventured,a,peep,at,him
his,black,head,was,bent,over,her,hands,and,as,she,watched,he,lifted,one,and,kissed,it,and,taking,the,other,laid,it,against,his,cheek,for,a,moment
expecting,violence,this,gentle,and,loverlike,gesture,startled,her
she,wondered,what,expression,was,on,his,face,but,could,not,tell,for,his,head,was,bowed
she,quickly,lowered,her,gaze,lest,he,should,look,up,suddenly,and,see,the,expression,on,her,face
she,knew,that,the,feeling,of,triumph,surging,through,her,was,certain,to,be,plain,in,her,eyes
in,a,moment,he,would,ask,her,to,marry,him,or,at,least,say,that,he,loved,her,and,then
as,she,watched,him,through,the,veil,of,her,lashes,he,turned,her,hand,over,palm,up,to,kiss,it,too,and,suddenly,he,drew,a,quick,breath
looking,down,she,saw,her,own,palm,saw,it,as,it,really,was,for,the,first,time,in,a,year,and,a,cold,sinking,fear,gripped,her
this,was,a,stranger's,palm,not,scarlett,o'hara's,soft,white,dimpled,helpless,one
this,hand,was,rough,from,work,brown,with,sunburn,splotched,with,freckles
the,nails,were,broken,and,irregular,there,were,heavy,calluses,on,the,cushions,of,the,palm,a,half-healed,blister,on,the,thumb
the,red,scar,which,boiling,fat,had,left,last,month,was,ugly,and,glaring
she,looked,at,it,in,horror,and,before,she,thought,she,swiftly,clenched,her,fist
still,he,did,not,raise,his,head
still,she,could,not,see,his,face
he,pried,her,fist,open,inexorably,and,stared,at,it,picked,up,her,other,hand,and,held,them,both,together,silently,looking,down,at,them
look,at,me,he,said,finally,raising,his,head,and,his,voice,was,very,quiet
and,drop,that,demure,expression
unwillingly,she,met,his,eyes,defiance,and,perturbation,on,her,face
his,black,brows,were,up,and,his,eyes,gleamed
so,you,have,been,doing,very,nicely,at,tara,have,you
cleared,so,much,money,on,the,cotton,you,can,go,visiting
what,have,you,been,doing,with,your,hands,plowing
she,tried,to,wrench,them,away,but,he,held,them,hard,running,his,thumbs,over,the,calluses
these,are,not,the,hands,of,a,lady,he,said,and,tossed,them,into,her,lap
oh,shut,up
she,cried,feeling,a,momentary,intense,relief,at,being,able,to,speak,her,feelings
whose,business,is,it,what,i,do,with,my,hands
what,a,fool,i,am,she,thought,vehemently
i,should,have,borrowed,or,stolen,aunt,pitty's,gloves
but,i,didn't,realize,my,hands,looked,so,bad
of,course,he,would,notice,them
and,now,i've,lost,my,temper,and,probably,ruined,everything
oh,to,have,this,happen,when,he,was,right,at,the,point,of,a,declaration
your,hands,are,certainly,no,business,of,mine,said,rhett,coolly,and,lounged,back,in,his,chair,indolently,his,face,a,smooth,blank
so,he,was,going,to,be,difficult
well,she'd,have,to,bear,it,meekly,much,as,she,disliked,it,if,she,expected,to,snatch,victory,from,this,debacle
perhaps,if,she,sweet-talked,him
i,think,you're,real,rude,to,throw,off,on,my,poor,hands
just,because,i,went,riding,last,week,without,my,gloves,and,ruined,them
riding,hell
he,said,in,the,same,level,voice
you've,been,working,with,those,hands,working,like,a,nigger
what's,the,answer
why,did,you,lie,to,me,about,everything,being,nice,at,tara
now,rhett
suppose,we,get,down,to,the,truth
what,is,the,real,purpose,of,your,visit
almost,i,was,persuaded,by,your,coquettish,airs,that,you,cared,something,about,me,and,were,sorry,for,me
oh,i,am,sorry
indeed
no,you,aren't
they,can,hang,me,higher,than,haman,for,all,you,care
it's,written,as,plainly,on,your,face,as,hard,work,is,written,on,your,hands
you,wanted,something,from,me,and,you,wanted,it,badly,enough,to,put,on,quite,a,show
why,didn't,you,come,out,in,the,open,and,tell,me,what,it,was
you'd,have,stood,a,much,better,chance,of,getting,it,for,if,there's,one,virtue,i,value,in,women,it's,frankness
but,no,you,had,to,come,jingling,your,earbobs,and,pouting,and,frisking,like,a,prostitute,with,a,prospective,client
he,did,not,raise,his,voice,at,the,last,words,or,emphasize,them,in,any,way,but,to,scarlett,they,cracked,like,a,whiplash,and,with,despair,she,saw,the,end,of,her,hopes,of,getting,him,to,propose,marriage
had,he,exploded,with,rage,and,injured,vanity,or,upbraided,her,as,other,men,would,have,done,she,could,have,handled,him
but,the,deadly,quietness,of,his,voice,frightened,her,left,her,utterly,at,a,loss,as,to,her,next,move
although,he,was,a,prisoner,and,the,yankees,were,in,the,next,room,it,came,to,her,suddenly,that,rhett,butler,was,a,dangerous,man,to,run,afoul,of
i,suppose,my,memory,is,getting,faulty
i,should,have,recalled,that,you,are,just,like,me,and,that,you,never,do,anything,without,an,ulterior,motive
now,let,me,see
what,could,you,have,had,up,your,sleeve,mrs,hamilton
it,isn't,possible,that,you,were,so,misguided,as,to,think,i,would,propose,matrimony
her,face,went,crimson,and,she,did,not,answer
but,you,can't,have,forgotten,my,oft-repeated,remark,that,i,am,not,a,marrying,man
when,she,did,not,speak,he,said,with,sudden,violence
you,hadn't,forgotten
answer,me
i,hadn't,forgotten,she,said,wretchedly
what,a,gambler,you,are,scarlett,he,jeered
you,took,a,chance,that,my,incarceration,away,from,female,companionship,would,put,me,in,such,a,state,i'd,snap,at,you,like,a,trout,at,a,worm
and,that's,what,you,did,thought,scarlett,with,inward,rage,and,if,it,hadn't,been,for,my,hands
now,we,have,most,of,the,truth,everything,except,your,reason
see,if,you,can,tell,me,the,truth,about,why,you,wanted,to,lead,me,into,wedlock
there,was,a,suave,almost,teasing,note,in,his,voice,and,she,took,heart
perhaps,everything,wasn't,lost,after,all
of,course,she,had,ruined,any,hope,of,marriage,but,even,in,her,despair,she,was,glad
there,was,something,about,this,immobile,man,which,frightened,her,so,that,now,the,thought,of,marrying,him,was,fearful
but,perhaps,if,she,was,clever,and,played,on,his,sympathies,and,his,memories,she,could,secure,a,loan
she,pulled,her,face,into,a,placating,and,childlike,expression
oh,rhett,you,can,help,me,so,much,if,you'll,just,be,sweet
there's,nothing,i,like,better,than,being,sweet
rhett,for,old,friendship's,sake,i,want,you,to,do,me,a,favor
so,at,last,the,horny-handed,lady,comes,to,her,real,mission
i,feared,that,'visiting,the,sick,and,the,imprisoned',was,not,your,proper,role
what,do,you,want
money
the,bluntness,of,his,question,ruined,all,hopes,of,leading,up,to,the,matter,in,any,circuitous,and,sentimental,way
don't,be,mean,rhett,she,coaxed
i,do,want,some,money
i,want,you,to,lend,me,three,hundred,dollars
the,truth,at,last
talking,love,and,thinking,money
how,truly,feminine
do,you,need,the,money,badly
oh,ye,well,not,so,terribly,but,i,could,use,it
three,hundred,dollars
that's,a,vast,amount,of,money
what,do,you,want,it,for
to,pay,taxes,on,tara
so,you,want,to,borrow,some,money
well,since,you're,so,businesslike,i'll,be,businesslike,too
what,collateral,will,you,give,me
what,what
collateral
security,on,my,investment
of,course,i,don't,want,to,lose,all,that,money
his,voice,was,deceptively,smooth,almost,silky,but,she,did,not,notice
maybe,everything,would,turn,out,nicely,after,all
my,earrings
i'm,not,interested,in,earrings
i'll,give,you,a,mortgage,on,tara
now,just,what,would,i,do,with,a,farm
well,you,could,you,could,it's,a,good,plantation
and,you,wouldn't,lose
i'd,pay,you,back,out,of,next,year's,cotton
i'm,not,so,sure
he,tilted,back,in,his,chair,and,stuck,his,hands,in,his,pockets
cotton,prices,are,dropping
times,are,so,hard,and,money's,so,tight
oh,rhett,you,are,teasing,me
you,know,you,have,millions
there,was,a,warm,dancing,malice,in,his,eyes,as,he,surveyed,her
so,everything,is,going,nicely,and,you,don't,need,the,money,very,badly
well,i'm,glad,to,hear,that
i,like,to,know,that,all,is,well,with,old,friends
oh,rhett,for,god's,sake
she,began,desperately,her,courage,and,control,breaking
do,lower,your,voice
you,don't,want,the,yankees,to,hear,you,i,hope
did,anyone,ever,tell,you,you,had,eyes,like,a,cat,a,cat,in,the,dark
rhett,don't
i'll,tell,you,everything
i,do,need,the,money,so,badly
i,i,lied,about,everything,being,all,right
everything's,as,wrong,as,it,could,be
father,is,is,he's,not,himself
he's,been,queer,ever,since,mother,died,and,he,can't,help,me,any
he's,just,like,a,child
and,we,haven't,a,single,field,hand,to,work,the,cotton,and,there's,so,many,to,feed,thirteen,of,us
and,the,taxes,they,are,so,high
rhett,i'll,tell,you,everything
for,over,a,year,we've,been,just,this,side,of,starvation
oh,you,don't,know
you,can't,know
we've,never,had,enough,to,eat,and,it's,terrible,to,wake,up,hungry,and,go,to,sleep,hungry
and,we,haven't,any,warm,clothes,and,the,children,are,always,cold,and,sick,and
where,did,you,get,the,pretty,dress
it's,made,out,of,mother's,curtains,she,answered,too,desperate,to,lie,about,this,shame
i,could,stand,being,hungry,and,cold,but,now,now,the,carpetbaggers,have,raised,our,taxes
and,the,money's,got,to,be,paid,right,away
and,i,haven't,any,money,except,one,five-dollar,gold,piece
i've,got,to,have,money,for,the,taxes
don't,you,see
if,i,don't,pay,them,i'll,we'll,lose,tara,and,we,just,can't,lose,it
i,can't,let,it,go
why,didn't,you,tell,me,all,this,at,first,instead,of,preying,on,my,susceptible,heart,always,weak,where,pretty,ladies,are,concerned
no,scarlett,don't,cry
you've,tried,every,trick,except,that,one,and,i,don't,think,i,could,stand,it
my,feelings,are,already,lacerated,with,disappointment,at,discovering,it,was,my,money,and,not,my,charming,self,you,wanted
she,remembered,that,he,frequently,told,bald,truths,about,himself,when,he,spoke,mockingly,mocking,himself,as,well,as,others,and,she,hastily,looked,up,at,him
were,his,feelings,really,hurt
did,he,really,care,about,her
had,he,been,on,the,verge,of,a,proposal,when,he,saw,her,palms
or,had,he,only,been,leading,up,to,another,such,odious,proposal,as,he,had,made,twice,before
if,he,really,cared,about,her,perhaps,she,could,smooth,him,down
but,his,black,eyes,raked,her,in,no,lover-like,way,and,he,was,laughing,softly
i,don't,like,your,collateral
i'm,no,planter
what,else,have,you,to,offer
well,she,had,come,to,it,at,last
now,for,it
she,drew,a,deep,breath,and,met,his,eyes,squarely,all,coquetry,and,airs,gone,as,her,spirit,rushed,out,to,grapple,that,which,she,feared,most
i,i,have,myself
yes
her,jaw,line,tightened,to,squareness,and,her,eyes,went,emerald
you,remember,that,night,on,aunt,pitty's,porch,during,the,siege
you,said,you,said,then,that,you,wanted,me
he,leaned,back,carelessly,in,his,chair,and,looked,into,her,tense,face,and,his,own,dark,face,was,inscrutable
something,flickered,behind,his,eyes,but,he,said,nothing
you,said,you,said,you'd,never,wanted,a,woman,as,much,as,you,wanted,me
if,you,still,want,me,you,can,have,me
rhett,i'll,do,anything,you,say,but,for,god's,sake,write,me,a,draft,for,the,money
my,word's,good
i,swear,it
i,won't,go,back,on,it
i'll,put,it,in,writing,if,you,like
he,looked,at,her,oddly,still,inscrutable,and,as,she,hurried,on,she,could,not,tell,if,he,were,amused,or,repelled
if,he,would,only,say,something,anything
she,felt,her,cheeks,getting,hot
i,have,got,to,have,the,money,soon,rhett
they'll,turn,us,out,in,the,road,and,that,damned,overseer,of,father's,will,own,the,place,and
just,a,minute
what,makes,you,think,i,still,want,you
what,makes,you,think,you,are,worth,three,hundred,dollars
most,women,don't,come,that,high
she,blushed,to,her,hair,line,and,her,humiliation,was,complete
why,are,you,doing,this
why,not,let,the,farm,go,and,live,at,miss,pittypat's
you,own,half,that,house
name,of,god
she,cried
are,you,a,fool
i,can't,let,tara,go
it's,home
i,won't,let,it,go
not,while,i've,got,breath,left,in,me
the,irish,said,he,lowering,his,chair,back,to,level,and,removing,his,hands,from,his,pockets,are,the,damnedest,race
they,put,so,much,emphasis,on,so,many,wrong,things
land,for,instance
and,every,bit,of,earth,is,just,like,every,other,bit
now,let,me,get,this,straight,scarlett
you,are,coming,to,me,with,a,business,proposition
i'll,give,you,three,hundred,dollars,and,you'll,become,my,mistress
yes
now,that,the,repulsive,word,had,been,said,she,felt,somehow,easier,and,hope,awoke,in,her,again
he,had,said,i'll,give,you
there,was,a,diabolic,gleam,in,his,eyes,as,if,something,amused,him,greatly
and,yet,when,i,had,the,effrontery,to,make,you,this,same,proposition,you,turned,me,out,of,the,house
and,also,you,called,me,a,number,of,very,hard,names,and,mentioned,in,passing,that,you,didn't,want,a,'passel,of,brats,'
no,my,dear,i'm,not,rubbing,it,in
i'm,only,wondering,at,the,peculiarities,of,your,mind
you,wouldn't,do,it,for,your,own,pleasure,but,you,will,to,keep,the,wolf,away,from,the,door
it,proves,my,point,that,all,virtue,is,merely,a,matter,of,prices
oh,rhett,how,you,run,on
if,you,want,to,insult,me,go,on,and,do,it,but,give,me,the,money
she,was,breathing,easier,now
being,what,he,was,rhett,would,naturally,want,to,torment,and,insult,her,as,much,as,possible,to,pay,her,back,for,past,slights,and,for,her,recent,attempted,trickery
well,she,could,stand,it
she,could,stand,anything
tara,was,worth,it,all
for,a,brief,moment,it,was,mid-summer,and,the,afternoon,skies,were,blue,and,she,lay,drowsily,in,the,thick,clover,of,tara's,lawn,looking,up,at,the,billowing,cloud,castles,the,fragrance,of,white,blossoms,in,her,nose,and,the,pleasant,busy,humming,of,bees,in,her,ears
afternoon,and,hush,and,the,far-off,sound,of,the,wagons,coming,in,from,the,spiraling,red,fields
worth,it,all,worth,more
her,head,went,up
are,you,going,to,give,me,the,money
he,looked,as,if,he,were,enjoying,himself,and,when,he,spoke,there,was,suave,brutality,in,his,voice
no,i'm,not,he,said
for,a,moment,her,mind,could,not,adjust,itself,to,his,words
i,couldn't,give,it,to,you,even,if,i,wanted,to
i,haven't,a,cent,on,me
not,a,dollar,in,atlanta
i,have,some,money,yes,but,not,here
and,i'm,not,saying,where,it,is,or,how,much
but,if,i,tried,to,draw,a,draft,on,it,the,yankees,would,be,on,me,like,a,duck,on,a,june,bug,and,then,neither,of,us,would,get,it
what,do,you,think,of,that
her,face,went,an,ugly,green,freckles,suddenly,standing,out,across,her,nose,and,her,contorted,mouth,was,like,gerald's,in,a,killing,rage
she,sprang,to,her,feet,with,an,incoherent,cry,which,made,the,hum,of,voices,in,the,next,room,cease,suddenly
swift,as,a,panther,rhett,was,beside,her,his,heavy,hand,across,her,mouth,his,arm,tight,about,her,waist
she,struggled,against,him,madly,trying,to,bite,his,hand,to,kick,his,legs,to,scream,her,rage,despair,hate,her,agony,of,broken,pride
she,bent,and,twisted,every,way,against,the,iron,of,his,arm,her,heart,near,bursting,her,tight,stays,cutting,off,her,breath
he,held,her,so,tightly,so,roughly,that,it,hurt,and,the,hand,over,her,mouth,pinched,into,her,jaws,cruelly
his,face,was,white,under,its,tan,his,eyes,hard,and,anxious,as,he,lifted,her,completely,off,her,feet,swung,her,up,against,his,chest,and,sat,down,in,the,chair,holding,her,writhing,in,his,lap
darling,for,god's,sake
stop
hush
don't,yell
they'll,be,in,here,in,a,minute,if,you,do
do,calm,yourself
do,you,want,the,yankees,to,see,you,like,this
she,was,beyond,caring,who,saw,her,beyond,anything,except,a,fiery,desire,to,kill,him,but,dizziness,was,sweeping,her
she,could,not,breathe,he,was,choking,her,her,stays,were,like,a,swiftly,compressing,band,of,iron,his,arms,about,her,made,her,shake,with,helpless,hate,and,fury
then,his,voice,became,thin,and,dim,and,his,face,above,her,swirled,in,a,sickening,mist,which,became,heavier,and,heavier,until,she,no,longer,saw,him,or,anything,else
when,she,made,feeble,swimming,motions,to,come,back,to,consciousness,she,was,tired,to,her,bones,weak,bewildered
she,was,lying,back,in,the,chair,her,bonnet,off,rhett,was,slapping,her,wrist,his,black,eyes,searching,her,face,anxiously
the,nice,young,captain,was,trying,to,pour,a,glass,of,brandy,into,her,mouth,and,had,spilled,it,down,her,neck
the,other,officers,hovered,helplessly,about,whispering,and,waving,their,hands
i,guess,i,must,have,fainted,she,said,and,her,voice,sounded,so,far,away,it,frightened,her
drink,this,said,rhett,taking,the,glass,and,pushing,it,against,her,lips
now,she,remembered,and,glared,feebly,at,him,but,she,was,too,tired,for,anger
please,for,my,sake
she,gulped,and,choked,and,began,coughing,but,he,pushed,it,to,her,mouth,again
she,swallowed,deeply,and,the,hot,liquid,burned,suddenly,in,her,throat
i,think,she's,better,now,gentlemen,said,rhett,and,i,thank,you,very,much
the,realization,that,i'm,to,be,executed,was,too,much,for,her
the,group,in,blue,shuffled,their,feet,and,looked,embarrassed,and,after,several,clearings,of,throats,they,tramped,out
the,young,captain,paused,in,the,doorway
if,there's,anything,more,i,can,do
no,thank,you
he,went,out,closing,the,door,behind,him
drink,some,more,said,rhett
no
drink,it
she,swallowed,another,mouthful,and,the,warmth,began,spreading,through,her,body,and,strength,flowed,slowly,back,into,her,shaking,legs
she,pushed,away,the,glass,and,tried,to,rise,but,he,pressed,her,back
take,your,hands,off,me
i'm,going
not,yet
wait,a,minute
you,might,faint,again
i'd,rather,faint,in,the,road,than,be,here,with,you
just,the,same,i,won't,have,you,fainting,in,the,road
let,me,go
i,hate,you
a,faint,smile,came,back,to,his,face,at,her,words
that,sounds,more,like,you
you,must,be,feeling,better
she,lay,relaxed,for,a,moment,trying,to,summon,anger,to,her,aid,trying,to,draw,on,her,strength
but,she,was,too,tired
she,was,too,tired,to,hate,or,to,care,very,much,about,anything
defeat,lay,on,her,spirit,like,lead
she,had,gambled,everything,and,lost,everything
not,even,pride,was,left
this,was,the,dead,end,of,her,last,hope
this,was,the,end,of,tara,the,end,of,them,all
for,a,long,time,she,lay,back,with,her,eyes,closed,hearing,his,heavy,breathing,near,her,and,the,glow,of,the,brandy,crept,gradually,over,her,giving,a,false,strength,and,warmth
when,finally,she,opened,her,eyes,and,looked,him,in,the,face,anger,had,roused,again
as,her,slanting,eyebrows,rushed,down,together,in,a,frown,rhett's,old,smile,came,back

rhett,butler,you,are,hateful,a,skunk,if,ever,i,saw,one
you,knew,very,well,what,i,was,going,to,say,as,soon,as,i,started,talking,and,you,knew,you,weren't,going,to,give,me,the,money
and,yet,you,let,me,go,right,on
you,could,have,spared,me
spared,you,and,missed,hearing,all,that

i,don't,know,when,i've,ever,heard,anything,so,gratifying
he,laughed,his,sudden,mocking,laugh
at,the,sound,she,leaped,to,her,feet,snatching,up,her,bonnet
he,suddenly,had,her,by,the,shoulders
not,quite,yet
do,you,feel,well,enough,to,talk,sense
let,me,go
you,are,well,enough,i,see
then,tell,me,this
was,i,the,only,iron,you,had,in,the,fire
his,eyes,were,keen,and,alert,watching,every,change,in,her,face
what,do,you,mean
was,i,the,only,man,you,were,going,to,try,this,on
is,that,any,of,your,business
more,than,you,realize

i,can't,imagine,you,without,five,or,six,in,reserve
surely,someone,will,turn,up,to,accept,your,interesting,proposition
i,feel,so,sure,of,it,that,i,want,to,give,you,a,little,advice
i,don't,want,your,advice
nevertheless,i,will,give,it
advice,seems,to,be,the,only,thing,i,can,give,you,at,present
listen,to,it,for,it's,good,advice
when,you,are,trying,to,get,something,out,of,a,man,don't,blurt,it,out,as,you,did,to,me
do,try,to,be,more,subtle,more,seductive
it,gets,better,results
you,used,to,know,how,to,perfection
but,just,now,when,you,offered,me,your,er,collateral,for,my,money,you,looked,as,hard,as,nails
i've,seen,eyes,like,yours,above,a,dueling,pistol,twenty,paces,from,me,and,they,aren't,a,pleasant,sight
they,evoke,no,ardor,in,the,male,breast
that's,no,way,to,handle,men,my,dear
you,are,forgetting,your,early,training
i,don't,need,you,to,tell,me,how,to,behave,she,said,and,wearily,put,on,her,bonnet
she,wondered,how,he,could,jest,so,blithely,with,a,rope,about,his,neck,and,her,pitiful,circumstances,before,him
she,did,not,even,notice,that,his,hands,were,jammed,in,his,pockets,in,hard,fists,as,if,he,were,straining,at,his,own,impotence
cheer,up,he,said,as,she,tied,the,bonnet,strings
you,can,come,to,my,hanging,and,it,will,make,you,feel,lots,better
it'll,even,up,all,your,old,scores,with,me,even,this,one
and,i'll,mention,you,in,my,will
thank,you,but,they,may,not,hang,you,till,it's,too,late,to,pay,the,taxes,she,said,with,a,sudden,malice,that,matched,his,own,and,she,meant,it
chapter,xxxv
it,was,raining,when,she,came,out,of,the,building,and,the,sky,was,a,dull,putty,color
the,soldiers,on,the,square,had,taken,shelter,in,their,huts,and,the,streets,were,deserted
there,was,no,vehicle,in,sight,and,she,knew,she,would,have,to,walk,the,long,way,home
the,brandy,glow,faded,as,she,trudged,along
the,cold,wind,made,her,shiver,and,the,chilly,needle-like,drops,drove,hard,into,her,face
the,rain,quickly,penetrated,aunt,pitty's,thin,cloak,until,it,hung,in,clammy,folds,about,her
she,knew,the,velvet,dress,was,being,ruined,and,as,for,the,tail,feathers,on,the,bonnet,they,were,as,drooping,and,draggled,as,when,their,former,owner,had,worn,them,about,the,wet,barn,yard,of,tara
the,bricks,of,the,sidewalk,were,broken,and,for,long,stretches,completely,gone
in,these,spots,the,mud,was,ankle,deep,and,her,slippers,stuck,in,it,as,if,it,were,glue,even,coming,completely,off,her,feet
every,time,she,bent,over,to,retrieve,them,the,hem,of,the,dress,fell,in,the,mud
she,did,not,even,try,to,avoid,puddles,but,stepped,dully,into,them,dragging,her,heavy,skirts,after,her
she,could,feel,her,wet,petticoat,and,pantalets,cold,about,her,ankles,but,she,was,beyond,caring,about,the,wreck,of,the,costume,on,which,she,had,gambled,so,much
she,was,chilled,and,disheartened,and,desperate
how,could,she,ever,go,back,to,tara,and,face,them,after,her,brave,words
how,could,she,tell,them,they,must,all,go,somewhere
how,could,she,leave,it,all,the,red,fields,the,tall,pines,the,dark,swampy,bottom,lands,the,quiet,burying,ground,where,ellen,lay,in,the,cedars',deep,shade
hatred,of,rhett,burned,in,her,heart,as,she,plodded,along,the,slippery,way
what,a,blackguard,he,was
she,hoped,they,did,hang,him,so,she,would,never,have,to,face,him,again,with,his,knowledge,of,her,disgrace,and,her,humiliation
of,course,he,could,have,gotten,the,money,for,her,if,he'd,wanted,to,get,it
oh,hanging,was,too,good,for,him
thank,god,he,couldn't,see,her,now,with,her,clothes,soaking,wet,and,her,hair,straggling,and,her,teeth,chattering
how,hideous,she,must,look,and,how,he,would,laugh
the,negroes,she,passed,turned,insolent,grins,at,her,and,laughed,among,themselves,as,she,hurried,by,slipping,and,sliding,in,the,mud,stopping,panting,to,replace,her,slippers
how,dared,they,laugh,the,black,apes
how,dared,they,grin,at,her,scarlett,o'hara,of,tara
she'd,like,to,have,them,all,whipped,until,the,blood,ran,down,their,backs
what,devils,the,yankees,were,to,set,them,free,free,to,jeer,at,white,people
as,she,walked,down,washington,street,the,landscape,was,as,dreary,as,her,own,heart
here,there,was,none,of,the,bustle,and,cheerfulness,which,she,had,noted,on,peachtree,street
here,many,handsome,homes,had,once,stood,but,few,of,them,had,been,rebuilt
smoked,foundations,and,the,lonesone,blackened,chimneys,now,known,as,sherman's,sentinels,appeared,with,disheartening,frequency
overgrown,paths,led,to,what,had,been,houses,old,lawns,thick,with,dead,weeds,carriage,blocks,bearing,names,she,knew,so,well,hitching,posts,which,would,never,again,know,the,knot,of,reins
cold,wind,and,rain,mud,and,bare,trees,silence,and,desolation
how,wet,her,feet,were,and,how,long,the,journey,home
she,heard,the,splash,of,hooves,behind,her,and,moved,farther,over,on,the,narrow,sidewalk,to,avoid,more,mud,splotches,on,aunt,pittypat's,cloak
a,horse,and,buggy,came,slowly,up,the,road,and,she,turned,to,watch,it,determined,to,beg,a,ride,if,the,driver,was,a,white,person
the,rain,obscured,her,vision,as,the,buggy,came,abreast,but,she,saw,the,driver,peer,over,the,tarpaulin,that,stretched,from,the,dashboard,to,his,chin
there,was,something,familiar,about,his,face,and,as,she,stepped,out,into,the,road,to,get,a,closer,view,there,was,an,embarrassed,little,cough,from,the,man,and,a,well-known,voice,cried,in,accents,of,pleasure,and,astonishment,surely,it,can't,be,miss,scarlett
oh,mr
kennedy
she,cried,splashing,across,the,road,and,leaning,on,the,muddy,wheel,heedless,of,further,damage,to,the,cloak
i,was,never,so,glad,to,see,anybody,in,my,life
he,colored,with,pleasure,at,the,obvious,sincerity,of,her,words,hastily,squirted,a,stream,of,tobacco,juice,from,the,opposite,side,of,the,buggy,and,leaped,spryly,to,the,ground
he,shook,her,hand,enthusiastically,and,holding,up,the,tarpaulin,assisted,her,into,the,buggy
miss,scarlett,what,are,you,doing,over,in,this,section,by,yourself
don't,you,know,it's,dangerous,these,days
and,you,are,soaking,wet
here,wrap,the,robe,around,your,feet
as,he,fussed,over,her,clucking,like,a,hen,she,gave,herself,up,to,the,luxury,of,being,taken,care,of
it,was,nice,to,have,a,man,fussing,and,clucking,and,scolding,even,if,it,was,only,that,old,maid,in,pants,frank,kennedy
it,was,especially,soothing,after,rhett's,brutal,treatment
and,oh,how,good,to,see,a,county,face,when,she,was,so,far,from,home
he,was,well,dressed,she,noticed,and,the,buggy,was,new,too
the,horse,looked,young,and,well,fed,but,frank,looked,far,older,than,his,years,older,than,on,that,christmas,eve,when,he,had,been,at,tara,with,his,men
he,was,thin,and,sallow,faced,and,his,yellow,eyes,were,watery,and,sunken,in,creases,of,loose,flesh
his,ginger-colored,beard,was,scantier,than,ever,streaked,with,tobacco,juice,and,as,ragged,as,if,he,clawed,at,it,incessantly
but,he,looked,bright,and,cheerful,in,contrast,with,the,lines,of,sorrow,and,worry,and,weariness,which,scarlett,saw,in,faces,everywhere
it's,a,pleasure,to,see,you,said,frank,warmly
i,didn't,know,you,were,in,town
i,saw,miss,pittypat,only,last,week,and,she,didn't,tell,me,you,were,coming
did,er,ahem,did,anyone,else,come,up,from,tara,with,you
he,was,thinking,of,suellen,the,silly,old,fool
no,she,said,wrapping,the,warm,lap,robe,about,her,and,trying,to,pull,it,up,around,her,neck
i,came,alone
i,didn't,give,aunt,pitty,any,warning
he,chirruped,to,the,horse,and,it,plodded,off,picking,its,way,carefully,down,the,slick,road
all,the,folks,at,tara,well
oh,yes,so-so
she,must,think,of,something,to,talk,about,yet,it,was,so,hard,to,talk
her,mind,was,leaden,with,defeat,and,all,she,wanted,was,to,lie,back,in,this,warm,blanket,and,say,to,herself,i,won't,think,of,tara,now
i'll,think,of,it,later,when,it,won't,hurt,so,much
if,she,could,just,get,him,started,talking,on,some,subject,which,would,hold,him,all,the,way,home,so,she,would,have,nothing,to,do,but,murmur,how,nice,and,you,certainly,are,smart,at,intervals
mr,kennedy,i'm,so,surprised,to,see,you
i,know,i've,been,a,bad,girl,not,keeping,up,with,old,friends,but,i,didn't,know,you,were,here,in,atlanta
i,thought,somebody,told,me,you,were,in,marietta
i,do,business,in,marietta,a,lot,of,business,he,said
didn't,miss,suellen,tell,you,i,had,settled,in,atlanta
didn't,she,tell,you,about,my,store
vaguely,she,had,a,memory,of,suellen,chattering,about,frank,and,a,store,but,she,never,paid,much,heed,to,anything,suellen,said
it,had,been,sufficient,to,know,that,frank,was,alive,and,would,some,day,take,suellen,off,her,hands
no,not,a,word,she,lied
have,you,a,store
how,smart,you,must,be
he,looked,a,little,hurt,at,hearing,that,suellen,had,not,published,the,news,but,brightened,at,the,flattery
yes,i've,got,a,store,and,a,pretty,good,one,i,think
folks,tell,me,i'm,a,born,merchant
he,laughed,pleasedly,the,tittery,cackling,laugh,which,she,always,found,so,annoying
conceited,old,fool,she,thought
oh,you,could,be,a,success,at,anything,you,turned,your,hand,to,mr,kennedy
but,how,on,earth,did,you,ever,get,started,with,the,store
when,i,saw,you,christmas,before,last,you,said,you,didn't,have,a,cent,in,the,world
he,cleared,his,throat,raspingly,clawed,at,his,whiskers,and,smiled,his,nervous,timid,smile
well,it's,a,long,story,miss,scarlett
thank,the,lord
she,thought
perhaps,it,will,hold,him,till,we,get,home
and,aloud,do,tell
you,recall,when,we,came,to,tara,last,hunting,for,supplies
well,not,long,after,that,i,went,into,active,service
i,mean,real,fighting
no,more,commissary,for,me
there,wasn't,much,need,for,a,commissary,miss,scarlett,because,we,couldn't,hardly,pick,up,a,thing,for,the,army,and,i,thought,the,place,for,an,able-bodied,man,was,in,the,fighting,line
well,i,fought,along,with,the,cavalry,for,a,spell,till,i,got,a,minie,ball,through,the,shoulder
he,looked,very,proud,and,scarlett,said,how,dreadful
oh,it,wasn't,so,bad,just,a,flesh,wound,he,said,deprecatingly
i,was,sent,down,south,to,a,hospital,and,when,i,was,just,about,well,the,yankee,raiders,came,through
my,my,but,that,was,a,hot,time
we,didn't,have,much,warning,and,all,of,us,who,could,walk,helped,haul,out,the,army,stores,and,the,hospital,equipment,to,the,train,tracks,to,move,it
we'd,gotten,one,train,about,loaded,when,the,yankees,rode,in,one,end,of,town,and,out,we,went,the,other,end,as,fast,as,we,could,go
my,my,that,was,a,mighty,sad,sight,sitting,on,top,of,that,train,and,seeing,the,yankees,burn,those,supplies,we,had,to,leave,at,the,depot
miss,scarlett,they,burned,about,a,half-mile,of,stuff,we,had,piled,up,there,along,the,tracks
we,just,did,get,away,ourselves
how,dreadful
yes,that's,the,word
dreadful
our,men,had,come,back,into,atlanta,then,and,so,our,train,was,sent,here
well,miss,scarlett,it,wasn't,long,before,the,war,was,over,and,well,there,was,a,lot,of,china,and,cots,and,mattresses,and,blankets,and,nobody,claiming,them
i,suppose,rightfully,they,belonged,to,the,yankees
i,think,those,were,the,terms,of,the,surrender,weren't,they
um,said,scarlett,absently
she,was,getting,warmer,now,and,a,little,drowsy
i,don't,know,till,now,if,i,did,right,he,said,a,little,querulously
but,the,way,i,figured,it,all,that,stuff,wouldn't,do,the,yankees,a,bit,of,good
they'd,probably,burn,it
and,our,folks,had,paid,good,solid,money,for,it,and,i,thought,it,still,ought,to,belong,to,the,confederacy,or,to,the,confederates
do,you,see,what,i,mean
um
i'm,glad,you,agree,with,me,miss,scarlett
in,a,way,it's,been,on,my,conscience
lots,of,folks,have,told,me,'oh,forget,about,it,frank,',but,i,can't
i,couldn't,hold,up,my,head,if,i,thought,i'd,done,what,wasn't,right
do,you,think,i,did,right
of,course,she,said,wondering,what,the,old,fool,had,been,talking,about
some,struggle,with,his,conscience
when,a,man,got,as,old,as,frank,kennedy,he,ought,to,have,learned,not,to,bother,about,things,that,didn't,matter
but,he,always,was,so,nervous,and,fussy,and,old,maidish
i'm,glad,to,hear,you,say,it
after,the,surrender,i,had,about,ten,dollars,in,silver,and,nothing,else,in,the,world
you,know,what,they,did,to,jonesboro,and,my,house,and,store,there
i,just,didn't,know,what,to,do
but,i,used,the,ten,dollars,to,put,a,roof,on,an,old,store,down,by,five,points,and,i,moved,the,hospital,equipment,in,and,started,selling,it
everybody,needed,beds,and,china,and,mattresses,and,i,sold,them,cheap,because,i,figured,it,was,about,as,much,other,folks',stuff,as,it,was,mine
but,i,cleared,money,on,it,and,bought,some,more,stuff,and,the,store,just,went,along,fine
i,think,i'll,make,a,lot,of,money,on,it,if,things,pick,up
at,the,word,money,her,mind,came,back,to,him,crystal,clear
you,say,you've,made,money
he,visibly,expanded,under,her,interest
few,women,except,suellen,had,ever,given,him,more,than,perfunctory,courtesy,and,it,was,very,flattering,to,have,a,former,belle,like,scarlett,hanging,on,his,words
he,slowed,the,horse,so,they,would,not,reach,home,before,he,had,finished,his,story
i'm,not,a,millionaire,miss,scarlett,and,considering,the,money,i,used,to,have,what,i've,got,now,sounds,small
but,i,made,a,thousand,dollars,this,year
of,course,five,hundred,of,it,went,to,paying,for,new,stock,and,repairing,the,store,and,paying,the,rent
but,i've,made,five,hundred,clear,and,as,things,are,certainly,picking,up,i,ought,to,clear,two,thousand,next,year
i,can,sure,use,it,too,for,you,see,i've,got,another,iron,in,the,fire
interest,had,sprung,up,sharply,in,her,at,the,talk,of,money
she,veiled,her,eyes,with,thick,bristly,lashes,and,moved,a,little,closer,to,him
what,does,that,mean,mr
kennedy
he,laughed,and,slapped,the,reins,against,the,horse's,back
i,guess,i'm,boring,you,talking,about,business,miss,scarlett
a,pretty,little,woman,like,you,doesn't,need,to,know,anything,about,business
the,old,fool
oh,i,know,i'm,a,goose,about,business,but,i'm,so,interested
please,tell,me,all,about,it,and,you,can,explain,what,i,don't,understand
well,my,other,iron,is,a,sawmill
a,what
a,mill,to,cut,up,lumber,and,plane,it
i,haven't,bought,it,yet,but,i'm,going,to
there's,a,man,named,johnson,who,has,one,way,out,peachtree,road,and,he's,anxious,to,sell,it
he,needs,some,cash,right,away,so,he,wants,to,sell,and,stay,and,run,it,for,me,at,a,weekly,wage
it's,one,of,the,few,mills,in,this,section,miss,scarlett
the,yankees,destroyed,most,of,them
and,anyone,who,owns,a,sawmill,owns,a,gold,mine,for,nowadays,you,can,ask,your,own,price,for,lumber
the,yankees,burned,so,many,houses,here,and,there,aren't,enough,for,people,to,live,in,and,it,looks,like,folks,have,gone,crazy,about,rebuilding
they,can't,get,enough,lumber,and,they,can't,get,it,fast,enough
people,are,just,pouring,into,atlanta,now,all,the,folks,from,the,country,districts,who,can't,make,a,go,of,farming,without,darkies,and,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,who,are,swarming,in,trying,to,pick,our,bones,a,little,barer,than,they,already,are
i,tell,you,atlanta's,going,to,be,a,big,town,soon
they've,got,to,have,lumber,for,their,houses,so,i'm,going,to,buy,this,mill,just,as,soon,as,well,as,soon,as,some,of,the,bills,owing,me,are,paid
by,this,time,next,year,i,ought,to,be,breathing,easier,about,money
i,i,guess,you,know,why,i'm,so,anxious,to,make,money,quickly,don't,you
he,blushed,and,cackled,again
he's,thinking,of,suellen,scarlett,thought,in,disgust
for,a,moment,she,considered,asking,him,to,lend,her,three,hundred,dollars,but,wearily,she,rejected,the,idea
he,would,be,embarrassed,he,would,stammer,he,would,offer,excuses,but,he,wouldn't,lend,it,to,her
he,had,worked,hard,for,it,so,he,could,marry,suellen,in,the,spring,and,if,he,parted,with,it,his,wedding,would,be,postponed,indefinitely
even,if,she,worked,on,his,sympathies,and,his,duty,toward,his,future,family,and,gained,his,promise,of,a,loan,she,knew,suellen,would,never,permit,it
suellen,was,getting,more,and,more,worried,over,the,fact,that,she,was,practically,an,old,maid,and,she,would,move,heaven,and,earth,to,prevent,anything,from,delaying,her,marriage
what,was,there,in,that,whining,complaining,girl,to,make,this,old,fool,so,anxious,to,give,her,a,soft,nest
suellen,didn't,deserve,a,loving,husband,and,the,profits,of,a,store,and,a,sawmill
the,minute,sue,got,her,hands,on,a,little,money,she'd,give,herself,unendurable,airs,and,never,contribute,one,cent,toward,the,upkeep,of,tara
not,suellen
she'd,think,herself,well,out,of,it,and,not,care,if,tara,went,for,taxes,or,burned,to,the,ground,so,long,as,she,had,pretty,clothes,and,a,mrs,in,front,of,her,name
as,scarlett,thought,of,suellen's,secure,future,and,the,precarious,one,of,herself,and,tara,anger,flamed,in,her,at,the,unfairness,of,life
hastily,she,looked,out,of,the,buggy,into,the,muddy,street,lest,frank,should,see,her,expression
she,was,going,to,lose,everything,she,had,while,sue,suddenly,a,determination,was,born,in,her
suellen,should,not,have,frank,and,his,store,and,his,mill
suellen,didn't,deserve,them
she,was,going,to,have,them,herself
she,thought,of,tara,and,remembered,jonas,wilkerson,venomous,as,a,rattler,at,the,foot,of,the,front,steps,and,she,grasped,at,the,last,straw,floating,above,the,shipwreck,of,her,life
rhett,had,failed,her,but,the,lord,had,provided,frank
but,can,i,get,him
her,fingers,clenched,as,she,looked,unseeingly,into,the,rain
can,i,make,him,forget,sue,and,propose,to,me,real,quick
if,i,could,make,rhett,almost,propose,i,know,i,could,get,frank
her,eyes,went,over,him,her,lids,flickering
certainly,he's,no,beauty,she,thought,coolly,and,he's,got,very,bad,teeth,and,his,breath,smells,bad,and,he's,old,enough,to,be,my,father
moreover,he's,nervous,and,timid,and,well,meaning,and,i,don't,know,of,any,more,damning,qualities,a,man,can,have
but,at,least,he's,a,gentleman,and,i,believe,i,could,stand,living,with,him,better,than,with,rhett
certainly,i,could,manage,him,easier
at,any,rate,beggars,can't,be,choosers
that,he,was,suellen's,fiance,caused,her,no,qualm,of,conscience
after,the,complete,moral,collapse,which,had,sent,her,to,atlanta,and,to,rhett,the,appropriation,of,her,sister's,betrothed,seemed,a,minor,affair,and,one,not,to,be,bothered,with,at,this,time
with,the,rousing,of,fresh,hope,her,spine,stiffened,and,she,forgot,that,her,feet,were,wet,and,cold
she,looked,at,frank,so,steadily,her,eyes,narrowing,that,he,became,somewhat,alarmed,and,she,dropped,her,gaze,swiftly,remembering,rhett's,words,i've,seen,eyes,like,yours,above,a,dueling,pistol
they,evoke,no,ardor,in,the,male,breast
what's,the,matter,miss,scarlett
you,got,a,chill
yes,she,answered,helplessly
would,you,mind,she,hesitated,timidly
would,you,mind,if,i,put,my,hand,in,your,coat,pocket
it's,so,cold,and,my,muff,is,soaked,through
why,why,of,course,not
and,you,haven't,any,gloves
my,my,what,a,brute,i've,been,idling,along,like,this,talking,my,head,off,when,you,must,be,freezing,and,wanting,to,get,to,a,fire
giddap,sally
by,the,way,miss,scarlett,i've,been,so,busy,talking,about,myself,i,haven't,even,asked,you,what,you,were,doing,in,this,section,in,this,weather
i,was,at,the,yankee,headquarters,she,answered,before,she,thought
his,sandy,brows,went,up,in,astonishment
but,miss,scarlett
the,soldiers,why
mary,mother,of,god,let,me,think,of,a,real,good,lie,she,prayed,hastily
it,would,never,do,for,frank,to,suspect,she,had,seen,rhett
frank,thought,rhett,the,blackest,of,blackguards,and,unsafe,for,decent,women,to,speak,to
i,went,there,i,went,there,to,see,if,if,any,of,the,officers,would,buy,fancy,work,from,me,to,send,home,to,their,wives
i,embroider,very,nicely
he,sank,back,against,the,seat,aghast,indignation,struggling,with,bewilderment
you,went,to,the,yankees,but,miss,scarlett
you,shouldn't
why,why
surely,your,father,doesn't,know
surely,miss,pittypat
oh,i,shall,die,if,you,tell,aunt,pittypat
she,cried,in,real,anxiety,and,burst,into,tears
it,was,easy,to,cry,because,she,was,so,cold,and,miserable,but,the,effect,was,startling
frank,could,not,have,been,more,embarrassed,or,helpless,if,she,had,suddenly,begun,disrobing
he,clicked,his,tongue,against,his,teeth,several,times,muttering,my
my
and,made,futile,gestures,at,her
a,daring,thought,went,through,his,mind,that,he,should,draw,her,head,onto,his,shoulder,and,pat,her,but,he,had,never,done,this,to,any,woman,and,hardly,knew,how,to,go,about,it
scarlett,o'hara,so,high,spirited,and,pretty,crying,here,in,his,buggy
scarlett,o'hara,the,proudest,of,the,proud,trying,to,sell,needlework,to,the,yankees
his,heart,burned
she,sobbed,on,saying,a,few,words,now,and,then,and,he,gathered,that,all,was,not,well,at,tara
mr,o'hara,was,still,not,himself,at,all,and,there,wasn't,enough,food,to,go,around,for,so,many
so,she,had,to,come,to,atlanta,to,try,to,make,a,little,money,for,herself,and,her,boy
frank,clicked,his,tongue,again,and,suddenly,he,found,that,her,head,was,on,his,shoulder
he,did,not,quite,know,how,it,got,there
surely,he,had,not,placed,it,there,but,there,her,head,was,and,there,was,scarlett,helplessly,sobbing,against,his,thin,chest,an,exciting,and,novel,sensation,for,him
he,patted,her,shoulder,timidly,gingerly,at,first,and,when,she,did,not,rebuff,him,he,became,bolder,and,patted,her,firmly
what,a,helpless,sweet,womanly,little,thing,she,was
and,how,brave,and,silly,to,try,her,hand,at,making,money,by,her,needle
but,dealing,with,the,yankees,that,was,too,much
i,won't,tell,miss,pittypat,but,you,must,promise,me,miss,scarlett,that,you,won't,do,anything,like,this,again
the,idea,of,your,father's,daughter
her,wet,green,eyes,sought,his,helplessly
but,mr,kennedy,i,must,do,something
i,must,take,care,of,my,poor,little,boy,and,there,is,no,one,to,look,after,us,now
you,are,a,brave,little,woman,he,pronounced,but,i,won't,have,you,do,this,sort,of,thing
your,family,would,die,of,shame
then,what,will,i,do
the,swimming,eyes,looked,up,to,him,as,if,she,knew,he,knew,everything,and,was,hanging,on,his,words
well,i,don't,know,right,now
but,i'll,think,of,something
oh,i,know,you,will
you,are,so,smart,frank
she,had,never,called,him,by,his,first,name,before,and,the,sound,came,to,him,as,a,pleasant,shock,and,surprise
the,poor,girl,was,probably,so,upset,she,didn't,even,notice,her,slip
he,felt,very,kindly,toward,her,and,very,protecting
if,there,was,anything,he,could,do,for,suellen,o'hara's,sister,he,would,certainly,do,it
he,pulled,out,a,red,bandanna,handkerchief,and,handed,it,to,her,and,she,wiped,her,eyes,and,began,to,smile,tremulously
i'm,such,a,silly,little,goose,she,said,apologetically
please,forgive,me
you,aren't,a,silly,little,goose
you're,a,very,brave,little,woman,and,you,are,trying,to,carry,to,heavy,a,load
i'm,afraid,miss,pittypat,isn't,going,to,be,much,help,to,you
i,hear,she,lost,most,of,her,property,and,mr,henry,hamilton's,in,bad,shape,himself
i,only,wish,i,had,a,home,to,offer,you,shelter,in
but,miss,scarlett,you,just,remember,this,when,miss,suellen,and,i,are,married,there'll,always,be,a,place,for,you,under,our,roof,and,for,wade,hampton,too
now,was,the,time
surely,the,saints,and,angels,watched,over,her,to,give,her,such,a,heaven-sent,opportunity
she,managed,to,look,very,startled,and,embarrassed,and,opened,her,mouth,as,if,to,speak,quickly,and,then,shut,it,with,a,pop
don't,tell,me,you,didn't,know,i,was,to,be,your,brother-in-law,this,spring,he,said,with,nervous,jocularity
and,then,seeing,her,eyes,fill,up,with,tears,he,questioned,in,alarm,what's,the,matter
miss,sue's,not,ill,is,she
oh,no
no
there,is,something,wrong
you,must,tell,me
oh,i,can't
i,didn't,know
i,thought,surely,she,must,have,written,you,oh,how,mean
miss,scarlett,what,is,it
oh,frank,i,didn't,mean,to,let,it,out,but,i,thought,of,course,you,knew,that,she,had,written,you
written,me,what
he,was,trembling
oh,to,do,this,to,a,fine,man,like,you
what's,she,done
she,didn't,write,you
oh,i,guess,she,was,too,ashamed,to,write,you
she,should,be,ashamed
oh,to,have,such,a,mean,sister
by,this,time,frank,could,not,even,get,questions,to,his,lips
he,sat,staring,at,her,gray,faced,the,reins,slack,in,his,hands
she's,going,to,marry,tony,fontaine,next,month
oh,i'm,so,sorry,frank
so,sorry,to,be,the,one,to,tell,you
she,just,got,tired,of,waiting,and,she,was,afraid,she'd,be,an,old,maid
mammy,was,standing,on,the,front,porch,when,frank,helped,scarlett,out,of,the,buggy
she,had,evidently,been,standing,there,for,some,time,for,her,head,rag,was,damp,and,the,old,shawl,clutched,tightly,about,her,showed,rain,spots
her,wrinkled,black,face,was,a,study,in,anger,and,apprehension,and,her,lip,was,pushed,out,farther,than,scarlett,could,ever,remember
she,peered,quickly,at,frank,and,when,she,saw,who,it,was,her,face,changed,pleasure,bewilderment,and,something,akin,to,guilt,spreading,over,it
she,waddled,forward,to,frank,with,pleased,greetings,and,grinned,and,curtsied,when,he,shook,her,hand

she,squeezed,his,hand,in,parting,and,turned,the,full,battery,of,her,eyes,upon,him
mammy,who,was,waiting,just,inside,the,door,gave,her,an,inscrutable,look,and,followed,her,puffing,up,the,stairs,to,the,bedroom
she,was,silent,while,she,stripped,off,the,wet,clothes,and,hung,them,over,chairs,and,tucked,scarlett,into,bed
when,she,had,brought,up,a,cup,of,hot,tea,and,a,hot,brick,rolled,in,flannel,she,looked,down,at,scarlett,and,said,with,the,nearest,approach,to,an,apology,in,her,voice,scarlett,had,ever,heard,lamb,huccome,you,din',tell,yo',own,mammy,whut,you,wuz,upter

that,night,at,mrs,elsing's,when,fanny,had,been,duly,married,and,old,levi,and,the,other,musicians,were,tuning,up,for,the,dance,scarlett,looked,about,her,with,gladness
it,was,so,exciting,to,be,actually,at,a,party,again
she,was,pleased,also,with,the,warm,reception,she,had,received
when,she,entered,the,house,on,frank's,arm,everyone,had,rushed,to,her,with,cries,of,pleasure,and,welcome,kissed,her,shaken,her,hand,told,her,they,had,missed,her,dreadfully,and,that,she,must,never,go,back,to,tara
the,men,seemed,gallantly,to,have,forgotten,she,had,tried,her,best,to,break,their,hearts,in,other,days,and,the,girls,that,she,had,done,everything,in,her,power,to,entice,their,beaux,away,from,them
even,mrs,merriwether,mrs,whiting,mrs,meade,and,the,other,dowagers,who,had,been,so,cool,to,her,during,the,last,days,of,the,war,forgot,her,flighty,conduct,and,their,disapproval,of,it,and,recalled,only,that,she,had,suffered,in,their,common,defeat,and,that,she,was,pitty's,niece,and,charles',widow
they,kissed,her,and,spoke,gently,with,tears,in,their,eyes,of,her,dear,mother's,passing,and,asked,at,length,about,her,father,and,her,sisters
everyone,asked,about,melanie,and,ashley,demanding,the,reason,why,they,too,had,not,come,back,to,atlanta
in,spite,of,her,pleasure,at,the,welcome,scarlett,felt,a,slight,uneasiness,which,she,tried,to,conceal,an,uneasiness,about,the,appearance,of,her,velvet,dress
it,was,still,damp,to,the,knees,and,still,spotted,about,the,hem,despite,the,frantic,efforts,of,mammy,and,cookie,with,a,steaming,kettle,a,clean,hair,brush,and,frantic,wavings,in,front,of,an,open,fire
scarlett,was,afraid,someone,would,notice,her,bedraggled,state,and,realize,that,this,was,her,only,nice,dress
she,was,a,little,cheered,by,the,fact,that,many,of,the,dresses,of,the,other,guests,looked,far,worse,than,hers
they,were,so,old,and,had,such,carefully,mended,and,pressed,looks
at,least,her,dress,was,whole,and,new,damp,though,it,was,in,fact,the,only,new,dress,at,the,gathering,with,the,exception,of,fanny's,white-satin,wedding,gown
remembering,what,aunt,pitty,had,told,her,about,the,elsing,finances,she,wondered,where,the,money,for,the,satin,dress,had,been,obtained,and,for,the,refreshments,and,decorations,and,musicians,too
it,must,have,cost,a,pretty,penny
borrowed,money,probably,or,else,the,whole,elsing,clan,had,contributed,to,give,fanny,this,expensive,wedding
such,a,wedding,in,these,hard,times,seemed,to,scarlett,an,extravagance,on,a,par,with,the,tombstones,of,the,tarleton,boys,and,she,felt,the,same,irritation,and,lack,of,sympathy,she,had,felt,as,she,stood,in,the,tarleton,burying,ground
the,days,when,money,could,be,thrown,away,carelessly,had,passed
why,did,these,people,persist,in,making,the,gestures,of,the,old,days,when,the,old,days,were,gone
but,she,shrugged,off,her,momentary,annoyance
it,wasn't,her,money,and,she,didn't,want,her,evening's,pleasure,spoiled,by,irritation,at,other,people's,foolishness
she,discovered,she,knew,the,groom,quite,well,for,he,was,tommy,wellburn,from,sparta,and,she,had,nursed,him,in,1863,when,he,had,a,wound,in,his,shoulder
he,had,been,a,handsome,young,six-footer,then,and,had,given,up,his,medical,studies,to,go,in,the,cavalry
now,he,looked,like,a,little,old,man,so,bent,was,he,by,the,wound,in,his,hip
he,walked,with,some,difficulty,and,as,aunt,pitty,had,remarked,spraddled,in,a,very,vulgar,way
but,he,seemed,totally,unaware,of,his,appearance,or,unconcerned,about,it,and,had,the,manner,of,one,who,asks,no,odds,from,any,man
he,had,given,up,all,hope,of,continuing,his,medical,studies,and,was,now,a,contractor,working,a,labor,crew,of,irishmen,who,were,building,the,new,hotel
scarlett,wondered,how,he,managed,so,onerous,a,job,in,his,condition,but,asked,no,questions,realizing,wryly,that,almost,anything,was,possible,when,necessity,drove
tommy,and,hugh,elsing,and,the,little,monkey-like,rene,picard,stood,talking,with,her,while,the,chairs,and,furniture,were,pushed,back,to,the,wall,in,preparation,for,the,dancing
hugh,had,not,changed,since,scarlett,last,saw,him,in,1862,he,was,still,the,thin,sensitive,boy,with,the,same,lock,of,pale,brown,hair,hanging,over,his,forehead,and,the,same,delicate,useless-looking,hands,she,remembered,so,well
but,rene,had,changed,since,that,furlough,when,he,married,maybelle,merriwether

scarlett,tried,to,join,politely,in,the,laughter,but,she,did,not,see,any,point,to,the,story,except,that,creoles,were,just,as,stuck,up,as,charleston,and,savannah,people
moreover,she,had,always,thought,ashley's,son,should,have,been,named,after,him
the,musicians,after,preliminary,tunings,and,whangings,broke,into,old,dan,tucker,and,tommy,turned,to,her
will,you,dance,scarlett
i,can't,favor,you,but,hugh,or,rene

i,will,sit,them,out
her,eyes,singled,out,frank,kennedy,and,beckoned,him,from,the,side,of,mrs,elsing
i'll,sit,in,that,alcove,yonder,if,you'll,bring,me,some,refreshments,and,then,we,can,have,a,nice,chat,she,told,frank,as,the,other,three,men,moved,off
when,he,had,hurried,away,to,bring,her,a,glass,of,wine,and,a,paper,thin,slice,of,cake,scarlett,sat,down,in,the,alcove,at,the,end,of,the,drawing,room,and,carefully,arranged,her,skirts,so,that,the,worst,spots,would,not,show
the,humiliating,events,of,the,morning,with,rhett,were,pushed,from,her,mind,by,the,excitement,of,seeing,so,many,people,and,hearing,music,again
tomorrow,she,would,think,of,rhett's,conduct,and,her,shame,and,they,would,make,her,writhe,again
tomorrow,she,would,wonder,if,she,had,made,any,impression,on,frank's,hurt,and,bewildered,heart
but,not,tonight
tonight,she,was,alive,to,her,finger,tips,every,sense,alert,with,hope,her,eyes,sparkling
she,looked,from,the,alcove,into,the,huge,drawing,room,and,watched,the,dancers,remembering,how,beautiful,this,room,had,been,when,first,she,came,to,atlanta,during,the,war
then,the,hardwood,floors,had,shone,like,glass,and,overhead,the,chandelier,with,its,hundreds,of,tiny,prisms,had,caught,and,reflected,every,ray,of,the,dozens,of,candles,it,bore,flinging,them,like,gleams,from,diamonds,flame,and,sapphire,about,the,room
the,old,portraits,on,the,walls,had,been,dignified,and,gracious,and,had,looked,down,upon,guests,with,an,air,of,mellowed,hospitality
the,rosewood,sofas,had,been,soft,and,inviting,and,one,of,them,the,largest,had,stood,in,the,place,of,honor,in,this,same,alcove,where,she,now,sat
it,had,been,scarlett's,favorite,seat,at,parties
from,this,point,stretched,the,pleasant,vista,of,drawing,room,and,dining,room,beyond,the,oval,mahogany,table,which,seated,twenty,and,the,twenty,slim-legged,chairs,demurely,against,the,walls,the,massive,sideboard,and,buffet,weighted,with,heavy,silver,with,seven-branched,candlesticks,goblets,cruets,decanters,and,shining,little,glasses
scarlett,had,sat,on,that,sofa,so,often,in,the,first,years,of,the,war,always,with,some,handsome,officer,beside,her,and,listened,to,violin,and,bull,fiddle,accordion,and,banjo,and,heard,the,exciting,swishing,noises,which,dancing,feet,made,on,the,waxed,and,polished,floor
now,the,chandelier,hung,dark
it,was,twisted,askew,and,most,of,the,prisms,were,broken,as,if,the,yankee,occupants,had,made,their,beauty,a,target,for,their,boots
now,an,oil,lamp,and,a,few,candles,lighted,the,room,and,the,roaring,fire,in,the,wide,hearth,gave,most,of,the,illumination
its,flickering,light,showed,how,irreparably,scarred,and,splintered,the,dull,old,floor,was
squares,on,the,faded,paper,on,the,wall,gave,evidence,that,once,the,portraits,had,hung,there,and,wide,cracks,in,the,plaster,recalled,the,day,during,the,siege,when,a,shell,had,exploded,on,the,house,and,torn,off,parts,of,the,roof,and,second,floor
the,heavy,old,mahogany,table,spread,with,cake,and,decanters,still,presided,in,the,empty-looking,dining,room,but,it,was,scratched,and,the,broken,legs,showed,signs,of,clumsy,repair
the,sideboard,the,silver,and,the,spindly,chairs,were,gone
the,dull-gold,damask,draperies,which,had,covered,the,arching,french,windows,at,the,back,of,the,room,were,missing,and,only,the,remnants,of,the,lace,curtains,remained,clean,but,obviously,mended
in,place,of,the,curved,sofa,she,had,liked,so,much,was,a,hard,bench,that,was,none,too,comfortable
she,sat,upon,it,with,as,good,grace,as,possible,wishing,her,skirts,were,in,such,condition,that,she,could,dance
it,would,be,so,good,to,dance,again
but,of,course,she,could,do,more,with,frank,in,this,sequestered,alcove,than,in,a,breathless,reel,and,she,could,listen,fascinated,to,his,talk,and,encourage,him,to,greater,flights,of,foolishness
but,the,music,certainly,was,inviting
her,slipper,patted,longingly,in,time,with,old,levi's,large,splayed,foot,as,he,twanged,a,strident,banjo,and,called,the,figures,of,the,reel
feet,swished,and,scraped,and,patted,as,the,twin,lines,danced,toward,each,other,retreated,whirled,and,made,arches,of,their,arms
'ole,dan,tucker,he,got,drunk,',swing,yo',padners
'fell,in,de,fiah',an',he,kick,up,a,chunk,'
skip,light,ladies
after,the,dull,and,exhausting,months,at,tara,it,was,good,to,hear,music,again,and,the,sound,of,dancing,feet,good,to,see,familiar,friendly,faces,laughing,in,the,feeble,light,calling,old,jokes,and,catchwords,bantering,rallying,coquetting
it,was,like,coming,to,life,again,after,being,dead
it,almost,seemed,that,the,bright,days,of,five,years,ago,had,come,back,again
if,she,could,close,her,eyes,and,not,see,the,worn,made-over,dresses,and,the,patched,boots,and,mended,slippers,if,her,mind,did,not,call,up,the,faces,of,boys,missing,from,the,reel,she,might,almost,think,that,nothing,had,changed
but,as,she,looked,watching,the,old,men,grouped,about,the,decanter,in,the,dining,room,the,matrons,lining,the,walls,talking,behind,fanless,hands,and,the,swaying,skipping,young,dancers,it,came,to,her,suddenly,coldly,frighteningly,that,it,was,all,as,greatly,changed,as,if,these,familiar,figures,were,ghosts
they,looked,the,same,but,they,were,different
what,was,it
was,it,only,that,they,were,five,years,older
no,it,was,something,more,than,the,passing,of,time
something,had,gone,out,of,them,out,of,their,world
five,years,ago,a,feeling,of,security,had,wrapped,them,all,around,so,gently,they,were,not,even,aware,of,it
in,its,shelter,they,had,flowered
now,it,was,gone,and,with,it,had,gone,the,old,thrill,the,old,sense,of,something,delightful,and,exciting,just,around,the,corner,the,old,glamor,of,their,way,of,living
she,knew,she,had,changed,too,but,not,as,they,had,changed,and,it,puzzled,her
she,sat,and,watched,them,and,she,felt,herself,an,alien,among,them,as,alien,and,lonely,as,if,she,had,come,from,another,world,speaking,a,language,they,did,not,understand,and,she,not,understanding,theirs
then,she,knew,that,this,feeling,was,the,same,one,she,felt,with,ashley
with,him,and,with,people,of,his,kind,and,they,made,up,most,of,her,world,she,felt,outside,of,something,she,could,not,understand
their,faces,were,little,changed,and,their,manners,not,at,all,but,it,seemed,to,her,that,these,two,things,were,all,that,remained,of,her,old,friends
an,ageless,dignity,a,timeless,gallantry,still,clung,about,them,and,would,cling,until,they,died,but,they,would,carry,undying,bitterness,to,their,graves,a,bitterness,too,deep,for,words
they,were,a,soft-spoken,fierce,tired,people,who,were,defeated,and,would,not,know,defeat,broken,yet,standing,determinedly,erect
they,were,crushed,and,helpless,citizens,of,conquered,provinces
they,were,looking,on,the,state,they,loved,seeing,it,trampled,by,the,enemy,rascals,making,a,mock,of,the,law,their,former,slaves,a,menace,their,men,disfranchised,their,women,insulted
and,they,were,remembering,graves
everything,in,their,old,world,had,changed,but,the,old,forms
the,old,usages,went,on,must,go,on,for,the,forms,were,all,that,were,left,to,them
they,were,holding,tightly,to,the,things,they,knew,best,and,loved,best,in,the,old,days,the,leisured,manners,the,courtesy,the,pleasant,casualness,in,human,contacts,and,most,of,all,the,protecting,attitude,of,the,men,toward,their,women
true,to,the,tradition,in,which,they,had,been,reared,the,men,were,courteous,and,tender,and,they,almost,succeeded,in,creating,an,atmosphere,of,sheltering,their,women,from,all,that,was,harsh,and,unfit,for,feminine,eyes
that,thought,scarlett,was,the,height,of,absurdity,for,there,was,little,now,which,even,the,most,cloistered,women,had,not,seen,and,known,in,the,last,five,years
they,had,nursed,the,wounded,closed,dying,eyes,suffered,war,and,fire,and,devastation,known,terror,and,flight,and,starvation
but,no,matter,what,sights,they,had,seen,what,menial,tasks,they,had,done,and,would,have,to,do,they,remained,ladies,and,gentlemen,royalty,in,exile,bitter,aloof,incurious,kind,to,one,another,diamond,hard,as,bright,and,brittle,as,the,crystals,of,the,broken,chandelier,over,their,heads
the,old,days,had,gone,but,these,people,would,go,their,ways,as,if,the,old,days,still,existed,charming,leisurely,determined,not,to,rush,and,scramble,for,pennies,as,the,yankees,did,determined,to,part,with,none,of,the,old,ways
scarlett,knew,that,she,too,was,greatly,changed
otherwise,she,could,not,have,done,the,things,she,had,done,since,she,was,last,in,atlanta,otherwise,she,would,not,now,be,contemplating,doing,what,she,desperately,hoped,to,do
but,there,was,a,difference,in,their,hardness,and,hers,and,just,what,the,difference,was,she,could,not,for,the,moment,tell
perhaps,it,was,that,there,was,nothing,she,would,not,do,and,there,were,so,many,things,these,people,would,rather,die,than,do
perhaps,it,was,that,they,were,without,hope,but,still,smiling,at,life,bowing,gracefully,and,passing,it,by
and,this,scarlett,could,not,do
she,could,not,ignore,life
she,had,to,live,it,and,it,was,too,brutal,too,hostile,for,her,even,to,try,to,gloss,over,its,harshness,with,a,smile
of,the,sweetness,and,courage,and,unyielding,pride,of,her,friends,scarlett,saw,nothing
she,saw,only,a,silly,stiff-neckedness,which,observed,facts,but,smiled,and,refused,to,look,them,in,the,face
as,she,stared,at,the,dancers,flushed,from,the,reel,she,wondered,if,things,drove,them,as,she,was,driven,dead,lovers,maimed,husbands,children,who,were,hungry,acres,slipping,away,beloved,roofs,that,sheltered,strangers
but,of,course,they,were,driven
she,knew,their,circumstances,only,a,little,less,thoroughly,than,she,knew,her,own
their,losses,had,been,her,losses,their,privations,her,privations,their,problems,her,same,problems
yet,they,had,reacted,differently,to,them
the,faces,she,was,seeing,in,the,room,were,not,faces,they,were,masks,excellent,masks,which,would,never,drop
but,if,they,were,suffering,as,acutely,from,brutal,circumstances,as,she,was,and,they,were,how,could,they,maintain,this,air,of,gaiety,and,lightness,of,heart
why,indeed,should,they,even,try,to,do,it
they,were,beyond,her,comprehension,and,vaguely,irritating
she,couldn't,be,like,them
she,couldn't,survey,the,wreck,of,the,world,with,an,air,of,casual,unconcern
she,was,as,hunted,as,a,fox,running,with,a,bursting,heart,trying,to,reach,a,burrow,before,the,hounds,caught,up
suddenly,she,hated,them,all,because,they,were,different,from,her,because,they,carried,their,losses,with,an,air,that,she,could,never,attain,would,never,wish,to,attain
she,hated,them,these,smiling,light-footed,strangers,these,proud,fools,who,took,pride,in,something,they,had,lost,seeming,to,be,proud,that,they,had,lost,it
the,women,bore,themselves,like,ladies,and,she,knew,they,were,ladies,though,menial,tasks,were,their,daily,lot,and,they,didn't,know,where,their,next,dress,was,coming,from
ladies,all
but,she,could,not,feel,herself,a,lady,for,all,her,velvet,dress,and,scented,hair,for,all,the,pride,of,birth,that,stood,behind,her,and,the,pride,of,wealth,that,had,once,been,hers
harsh,contact,with,the,red,earth,of,tara,had,stripped,gentility,from,her,and,she,knew,she,would,never,feel,like,a,lady,again,until,her,table,was,weighted,with,silver,and,crystal,and,smoking,with,rich,food,until,her,own,horses,and,carriages,stood,in,her,stables,until,black,hands,and,not,white,took,the,cotton,from,tara
ah
she,thought,angrily,sucking,in,her,breath
that's,the,difference
even,though,they're,poor,they,still,feel,like,ladies,and,i,don't
the,silly,fools,don't,seem,to,realize,that,you,can't,be,a,lady,without,money
even,in,this,flash,of,revelation,she,realized,vaguely,that,foolish,though,they,seemed,theirs,was,the,right,attitude
ellen,would,have,thought,so
this,disturbed,her
she,knew,she,should,feel,as,these,people,felt,but,she,could,not
she,knew,she,should,believe,devoutly,as,they,did,that,a,born,lady,remained,a,lady,even,if,reduced,to,poverty,but,she,could,not,make,herself,believe,it,now
all,her,life,she,had,heard,sneers,hurled,at,the,yankees,because,their,pretensions,to,gentility,were,based,on,wealth,not,breeding
but,at,this,moment,heresy,though,it,was,she,could,not,help,thinking,the,yankees,were,right,on,this,one,matter,even,if,wrong,in,all,others
it,took,money,to,be,a,lady
she,knew,ellen,would,have,fainted,had,she,ever,heard,such,words,from,her,daughter
no,depth,of,poverty,could,ever,have,made,ellen,feel,ashamed
ashamed
yes,that,was,how,scarlett,felt
ashamed,that,she,was,poor,and,reduced,to,galling,shifts,and,penury,and,work,that,negroes,should,do
she,shrugged,in,irritation
perhaps,these,people,were,right,and,she,was,wrong,but,just,the,same,these,proud,fools,weren't,looking,forward,as,she,was,doing,straining,every,nerve,risking,even,honor,and,good,name,to,get,back,what,they,had,lost
it,was,beneath,the,dignity,of,any,of,them,to,indulge,in,a,scramble,for,money
the,times,were,rude,and,hard
they,called,for,rude,and,hard,struggle,if,one,was,to,conquer,them
scarlett,knew,that,family,tradition,would,forcibly,restrain,many,of,these,people,from,such,a,struggle,with,the,making,of,money,admittedly,its,aim
they,all,thought,that,obvious,money-making,and,even,talk,of,money,were,vulgar,in,the,extreme
of,course,there,were,exceptions
mrs,merriwether,and,her,baking,and,rene,driving,the,pie,wagon
and,hugh,elsing,cutting,and,peddling,firewood,and,tommy,contracting
and,frank,having,the,gumption,to,start,a,store
but,what,of,the,rank,and,file,of,them
the,planters,would,scratch,a,few,acres,and,live,in,poverty
the,lawyers,and,doctors,would,go,back,to,their,professions,and,wait,for,clients,who,might,never,come
and,the,rest,those,who,had,lived,in,leisure,on,their,incomes
what,would,happen,to,them
but,she,wasn't,going,to,be,poor,all,her,life
she,wasn't,going,to,sit,down,and,patiently,wait,for,a,miracle,to,help,her
she,was,going,to,rush,into,life,and,wrest,from,it,what,she,could
her,father,had,started,as,a,poor,immigrant,boy,and,had,won,the,broad,acres,of,tara
what,he,had,done,his,daughter,could,do
she,wasn't,like,these,people,who,had,gambled,everything,on,a,cause,that,was,gone,and,were,content,to,be,proud,of,having,lost,that,cause,because,it,was,worth,any,sacrifice
they,drew,their,courage,from,the,past
she,was,drawing,hers,from,the,future
frank,kennedy,at,present,was,her,future
at,least,he,had,the,store,and,he,had,cash,money
and,if,she,could,only,marry,him,and,get,her,hands,on,that,money,she,could,make,ends,meet,at,tara,for,another,year
and,after,that,frank,must,buy,the,sawmill
she,could,see,for,herself,how,quickly,the,town,was,rebuilding,and,anyone,who,could,establish,a,lumber,business,now,when,there,was,so,little,competition,would,have,a,gold,mine
there,came,to,her,from,the,recesses,of,her,mind,words,rhett,had,spoken,in,the,early,years,of,the,war,about,the,money,he,made,in,the,blockade
she,had,not,taken,the,trouble,to,understand,them,then,but,now,they,seemed,perfectly,clear,and,she,wondered,if,it,had,been,only,her,youth,or,plain,stupidity,which,had,kept,her,from,appreciating,them
there's,just,as,much,money,to,be,made,in,the,wreck,of,a,civilization,as,in,the,upbuilding,of,one
this,is,the,wreck,he,foresaw,she,thought,and,he,was,right
there's,still,plenty,of,money,to,be,made,by,anyone,who,isn't,afraid,to,work,or,to,grab
she,saw,frank,coming,across,the,floor,toward,her,with,a,glass,of,blackberry,wine,in,his,hand,and,a,morsel,of,cake,on,a,saucer,and,she,pulled,her,face,into,a,smile
it,did,not,occur,to,her,to,question,whether,tara,was,worth,marrying,frank
she,knew,it,was,worth,it,and,she,never,gave,the,matter,a,second,thought
she,smiled,up,at,him,as,she,sipped,the,wine,knowing,that,her,cheeks,were,more,attractively,pink,than,any,of,the,dancers'
she,moved,her,skirts,for,him,to,sit,by,her,and,waved,her,handkerchief,idly,so,that,the,faint,sweet,smell,of,the,cologne,could,reach,his,nose
she,was,proud,of,the,cologne,for,no,other,woman,in,the,room,was,wearing,any,and,frank,had,noticed,it
in,a,fit,of,daring,he,had,whispered,to,her,that,she,was,as,pink,and,fragrant,as,a,rose
if,only,he,were,not,so,shy
he,reminded,her,of,a,timid,old,brown,field,rabbit
if,only,he,had,the,gallantry,and,ardor,of,the,tarleton,boys,or,even,the,coarse,impudence,of,rhett,butler
but,if,he,possessed,those,qualities,he'd,probably,have,sense,enough,to,feel,the,desperation,that,lurked,just,beneath,her,demurely,fluttering,eyelids
as,it,was,he,didn't,know,enough,about,women,even,to,suspect,what,she,was,up,to
that,was,her,good,fortune,but,it,did,not,increase,her,respect,for,him
chapter,xxxvi
she,married,frank,kennedy,two,weeks,later,after,a,whirlwind,courtship,which,she,blushingly,told,him,left,her,too,breathless,to,oppose,his,ardor,any,longer
he,did,not,know,that,during,those,two,weeks,she,had,walked,the,floor,at,night,gritting,her,teeth,at,the,slowness,with,which,he,took,hints,and,encouragements,praying,that,no,untimely,letter,from,suellen,would,reach,him,and,ruin,her,plans
she,thanked,god,that,her,sister,was,the,poorest,of,correspondents,delighting,to,receive,letters,and,disliking,to,write,them
but,there,was,always,a,chance,always,a,chance,she,thought,in,the,long,night,hours,as,she,padded,back,and,forth,across,the,cold,floor,of,her,bedroom,with,ellen's,faded,shawl,clutched,about,her,nightdress
frank,did,not,know,she,had,received,a,laconic,letter,from,will,relating,that,jonas,wilkerson,had,paid,another,call,at,tara,and,finding,her,gone,to,atlanta,had,stormed,about,until,will,and,ashley,threw,him,bodily,off,the,place
will's,letter,hammered,into,her,mind,the,fact,she,knew,only,too,well,that,time,was,getting,shorter,and,shorter,before,the,extra,taxes,must,be,paid
a,fierce,desperation,drove,her,as,she,saw,the,days,slipping,by,and,she,wished,she,might,grasp,the,hourglass,in,her,hands,and,keep,the,sands,from,running
but,so,well,did,she,conceal,her,feelings,so,well,did,she,enact,her,role,frank,suspected,nothing,saw,no,more,than,what,lay,on,the,surface,the,pretty,and,helpless,young,widow,of,charles,hamilton,who,greeted,him,every,night,in,miss,pittypat's,parlor,and,listened,breathless,with,admiration,as,he,told,of,future,plans,for,his,store,and,how,much,money,he,expected,to,make,when,he,was,able,to,buy,the,sawmill
her,sweet,sympathy,and,her,bright-eyed,interest,in,every,word,he,uttered,were,balm,upon,the,wound,left,by,suellen's,supposed,defection
his,heart,was,sore,and,bewildered,at,suellen's,conduct,and,his,vanity,the,shy,touchy,vanity,of,a,middle-aged,bachelor,who,knows,himself,to,be,unattractive,to,women,was,deeply,wounded
he,could,not,write,suellen,upbraiding,her,for,her,faithlessness,he,shrank,from,the,very,idea
but,he,could,ease,his,heart,by,talking,about,her,to,scarlett
without,saying,a,disloyal,word,about,suellen,she,could,tell,him,she,understood,how,badly,her,sister,had,treated,him,and,what,good,treatment,he,merited,from,a,woman,who,really,appreciated,him
little,mrs,hamilton,was,such,a,pretty,pink-cheeked,person,alternating,between,melancholy,sighs,when,she,thought,of,her,sad,plight,and,laughter,as,gay,and,sweet,as,the,tinkling,of,tiny,silver,bells,when,he,made,small,jokes,to,cheer,her
her,green,gown,now,neatly,cleaned,by,mammy,showed,off,her,slender,figure,with,its,tiny,waist,to,perfection,and,how,bewitching,was,the,faint,fragrance,which,always,clung,about,her,handkerchief,and,her,hair
it,was,a,shame,that,such,a,fine,little,woman,should,be,alone,and,helpless,in,a,world,so,rough,that,she,didn't,even,understand,its,harshness
no,husband,nor,brother,nor,even,a,father,now,to,protect,her
frank,thought,the,world,too,rude,a,place,for,a,lone,woman,and,in,that,idea,scarlett,silently,and,heartily,concurred
he,came,to,call,every,night,for,the,atmosphere,of,pitty's,house,was,pleasant,and,soothing
mammy's,smile,at,the,front,door,was,the,smile,reserved,for,quality,folks,pitty,served,him,coffee,laced,with,brandy,and,fluttered,about,him,and,scarlett,hung,on,his,every,utterance
sometimes,in,the,afternoons,he,took,scarlett,riding,with,him,in,his,buggy,when,he,went,out,on,business
these,rides,were,merry,affairs,because,she,asked,so,many,foolish,questions,just,like,a,woman,he,told,himself,approvingly
he,couldn't,help,laughing,at,her,ignorance,about,business,matters,and,she,laughed,too,saying,well,of,course,you,can't,expect,a,silly,little,woman,like,me,to,understand,men's,affairs
she,made,him,feel,for,the,first,time,in,his,old-maidish,life,that,he,was,a,strong,upstanding,man,fashioned,by,god,in,a,nobler,mold,than,other,men,fashioned,to,protect,silly,helpless,women
when,at,last,they,stood,together,to,be,married,her,confiding,little,hand,in,his,and,her,downcast,lashes,throwing,thick,black,crescents,on,her,pink,cheeks,he,still,did,not,know,how,it,all,came,about
he,only,knew,he,had,done,something,romantic,and,exciting,for,the,first,time,in,his,life
he,frank,kennedy,had,swept,this,lovely,creature,off,her,feet,and,into,his,strong,arms
that,was,a,heady,feeling
no,friend,or,relative,stood,up,with,them,at,their,marriage
the,witnesses,were,strangers,called,in,from,the,street
scarlett,had,insisted,on,that,and,he,had,given,in,though,reluctantly,for,he,would,have,liked,his,sister,and,his,brother-in-law,from,jonesboro,to,be,with,him
and,a,reception,with,toasts,drunk,to,the,bride,in,miss,pitty's,parlor,amid,happy,friends,would,have,been,a,joy,to,him
but,scarlett,would,not,hear,of,even,miss,pitty,being,present
just,us,two,frank,she,begged,squeezing,his,arm
like,an,elopement
i,always,did,want,to,run,away,and,be,married
please,sweetheart,just,for,me
it,was,that,endearing,term,still,so,new,to,his,ears,and,the,bright,teardrops,which,edged,her,pale,green,eyes,as,she,looked,up,pleadingly,at,him,that,won,him,over
after,all,a,man,had,to,make,some,concessions,to,his,bride,especially,about,the,wedding,for,women,set,such,a,store,by,sentimental,things
and,before,he,knew,it,he,was,married
frank,gave,her,the,three,hundred,dollars,bewildered,by,her,sweet,urgency,reluctant,at,first,because,it,meant,the,end,of,his,hope,of,buying,the,sawmill,immediately
but,he,could,not,see,her,family,evicted,and,his,disappointment,soon,faded,at,the,sight,of,her,radiant,happiness,disappeared,entirely,at,the,loving,way,she,took,on,over,his,generosity
frank,had,never,before,had,a,woman,take,on,over,him,and,he,came,to,feel,that,the,money,had,been,well,spent,after,all
scarlett,dispatched,mammy,to,tara,immediately,for,the,triple,purpose,of,giving,will,the,money,announcing,her,marriage,and,bringing,wade,to,atlanta
in,two,days,she,had,a,brief,note,from,will,which,she,carried,about,with,her,and,read,and,reread,with,mounting,joy
will,wrote,that,the,taxes,had,been,paid,and,jonas,wilkerson,acted,up,pretty,bad,at,the,news,but,had,made,no,other,threats,so,far
will,closed,by,wishing,her,happiness,a,laconic,formal,statement,which,he,qualified,in,no,way
she,knew,will,understood,what,she,had,done,and,why,she,had,done,it,and,neither,blamed,nor,praised
but,what,must,ashley,think
she,wondered,feverishly
what,must,he,think,of,me,now,after,what,i,said,to,him,so,short,a,while,ago,in,the,orchard,at,tara
she,also,had,a,letter,from,suellen,poorly,spelled,violent,abusive,tear,splotched,a,letter,so,full,of,venom,and,truthful,observations,upon,her,character,that,she,was,never,to,forget,it,nor,forgive,the,writer
but,even,suellen's,words,could,not,dim,her,happiness,that,tara,was,safe,at,least,from,immediate,danger
it,was,hard,to,realize,that,atlanta,and,not,tara,was,her,permanent,home,now
in,her,desperation,to,obtain,the,tax,money,no,thought,save,tara,and,the,fate,which,threatened,it,had,any,place,in,her,mind
even,at,the,moment,of,marriage,she,had,not,given,a,thought,to,the,fact,that,the,price,she,was,paying,for,the,safety,of,home,was,permanent,exile,from,it
now,that,the,deed,was,done,she,realized,this,with,a,wave,of,homesickness,hard,to,dispel
but,there,it,was
she,had,made,her,bargain,and,she,intended,to,stand,by,it
and,she,was,so,grateful,to,frank,for,saving,tara,she,felt,a,warm,affection,for,him,and,an,equally,warm,determination,that,he,should,never,regret,marrying,her
the,ladies,of,atlanta,knew,their,neighbors',business,only,slightly,less,completely,than,they,knew,their,own,and,were,far,more,interested,in,it
they,all,knew,that,for,years,frank,kennedy,had,had,an,understanding,with,suellen,o'hara
in,fact,he,had,said,sheepishly,that,he,expected,to,get,married,in,the,spring
so,the,tumult,of,gossip,surmise,and,deep,suspicion,which,followed,the,announcement,of,his,quiet,wedding,to,scarlett,was,not,surprising
mrs,merriwether,who,never,let,her,curiosity,go,long,unsatisfied,if,she,could,help,it,asked,him,point-blank,just,what,he,meant,by,marrying,one,sister,when,he,was,betrothed,to,the,other
she,reported,to,mrs,elsing,that,all,the,answer,she,got,for,her,pains,was,a,silly,look
not,even,mrs,merriwether,doughty,soul,that,she,was,dared,to,approach,scarlett,on,the,subject
scarlett,seemed,demure,and,sweet,enough,these,days,but,there,was,a,pleased,complacency,in,her,eyes,which,annoyed,people,and,she,carried,a,chip,on,her,shoulder,which,no,one,cared,to,disturb
she,knew,atlanta,was,talking,but,she,did,not,care
after,all,there,wasn't,anything,immoral,in,marrying,a,man
tara,was,safe
let,people,talk
she,had,too,many,other,matters,to,occupy,her,mind
the,most,important,was,how,to,make,frank,realize,in,a,tactful,manner,that,his,store,should,bring,in,more,money
after,the,fright,jonas,wilkerson,had,given,her,she,would,never,rest,easy,until,she,and,frank,had,some,money,ahead
and,even,if,no,emergency,developed,frank,would,need,to,make,more,money,if,she,was,going,to,save,enough,for,next,year's,taxes
moreover,what,frank,had,said,about,the,sawmill,stuck,in,her,mind
frank,could,make,lots,of,money,out,of,a,mill
anybody,could,with,lumber,selling,at,such,outrageous,prices
she,fretted,silently,because,frank's,money,had,not,been,enough,to,pay,the,taxes,on,tara,and,buy,the,mill,as,well
and,she,made,up,her,mind,that,he,had,to,make,more,money,on,the,store,somehow,and,do,it,quickly,so,he,could,buy,that,mill,before,some,one,else,snapped,it,up
she,could,see,it,was,a,bargain
if,she,were,a,man,she,would,have,that,mill,if,she,had,to,mortgage,the,store,to,raise,the,money
but,when,she,intimated,this,delicately,to,frank,the,day,after,they,married,he,smiled,and,told,her,not,to,bother,her,sweet,pretty,little,head,about,business,matters
it,had,come,as,a,surprise,to,him,that,she,even,knew,what,a,mortgage,was,and,at,first,he,was,amused
but,this,amusement,quickly,passed,and,a,sense,of,shock,took,its,place,in,the,early,days,of,their,marriage
once,incautiously,he,had,told,her,that,people,he,was,careful,not,to,mention,names,owed,him,money,but,could,not,pay,just,now,and,he,was,of,course,unwilling,to,press,old,friends,and,gentlefolk
frank,regretted,ever,mentioning,it,for,thereafter,she,had,questioned,him,about,it,again,and,again
she,had,the,most,charmingly,childlike,air,but,she,was,just,curious,she,said,to,know,who,owed,him,and,how,much,they,owed
frank,was,very,evasive,about,the,matter
he,coughed,nervously,and,waved,his,hands,and,repeated,his,annoying,remark,about,her,sweet,pretty,little,head
it,had,begun,to,dawn,on,him,that,this,same,sweet,pretty,little,head,was,a,good,head,for,figures
in,fact,a,much,better,one,than,his,own,and,the,knowledge,was,disquieting
he,was,thunderstruck,to,discover,that,she,could,swiftly,add,a,long,column,of,figures,in,her,head,when,he,needed,a,pencil,and,paper,for,more,than,three,figures
and,fractions,presented,no,difficulties,to,her,at,all
he,felt,there,was,something,unbecoming,about,a,woman,understanding,fractions,and,business,matters,and,he,believed,that,should,a,woman,be,so,unfortunate,as,to,have,such,unladylike,comprehension,she,should,pretend,not,to
now,he,disliked,talking,business,with,her,as,much,as,he,had,enjoyed,it,before,they,were,married
then,he,had,thought,it,all,beyond,her,mental,grasp,and,it,had,been,pleasant,to,explain,things,to,her
now,he,saw,that,she,understood,entirely,too,well,and,he,felt,the,usual,masculine,indignation,at,the,duplicity,of,women
added,to,it,was,the,usual,masculine,disillusionment,in,discovering,that,a,woman,has,a,brain
just,how,early,in,his,married,life,frank,learned,of,the,deception,scarlett,had,used,in,marrying,him,no,one,ever,knew
perhaps,the,truth,dawned,on,him,when,tony,fontaine,obviously,fancy,free,came,to,atlanta,on,business
perhaps,it,was,told,him,more,directly,in,letters,from,his,sister,in,jonesboro,who,was,astounded,at,his,marriage
certainly,he,never,learned,from,suellen,herself
she,never,wrote,him,and,naturally,he,could,not,write,her,and,explain
what,good,would,explanations,do,anyway,now,that,he,was,married
he,writhed,inwardly,at,the,thought,that,suellen,would,never,know,the,truth,and,would,always,think,he,had,senselessly,jilted,her
probably,everyone,else,was,thinking,this,too,and,criticizing,him
it,certainly,put,him,in,an,awkward,position
and,he,had,no,way,of,clearing,himself,for,a,man,couldn't,go,about,saying,he,had,lost,his,head,about,a,woman,and,a,gentleman,couldn't,advertise,the,fact,that,his,wife,had,entrapped,him,with,a,lie
scarlett,was,his,wife,and,a,wife,was,entitled,to,the,loyalty,of,her,husband
furthermore,he,could,not,bring,himself,to,believe,she,had,married,him,coldly,and,with,no,affection,for,him,at,all
his,masculine,vanity,would,not,permit,such,a,thought,to,stay,long,in,his,mind
it,was,more,pleasant,to,think,she,had,fallen,so,suddenly,in,love,with,him,she,had,been,willing,to,lie,to,get,him
but,it,was,all,very,puzzling
he,knew,he,was,no,great,catch,for,a,woman,half,his,age,and,pretty,and,smart,to,boot,but,frank,was,a,gentleman,and,he,kept,his,bewilderment,to,himself
scarlett,was,his,wife,and,he,could,not,insult,her,by,asking,awkward,questions,which,after,all,would,not,remedy,matters
not,that,frank,especially,wanted,to,remedy,matters,for,it,appeared,that,his,marriage,would,be,a,happy,one
scarlett,was,the,most,charming,and,exciting,of,women,and,he,thought,her,perfect,in,all,things,except,that,she,was,so,headstrong
frank,learned,early,in,his,marriage,that,so,long,as,she,had,her,own,way,life,could,be,very,pleasant,but,when,she,was,opposed,given,her,own,way,she,was,as,gay,as,a,child,laughed,a,good,deal,made,foolish,little,jokes,sat,on,his,knee,and,tweaked,his,beard,until,he,vowed,he,felt,twenty,years,younger
she,could,be,unexpectedly,sweet,and,thoughtful,having,his,slippers,toasting,at,the,fire,when,he,came,home,at,night,fussing,affectionately,about,his,wet,feet,and,interminable,head,colds,remembering,that,he,always,liked,the,gizzard,of,the,chicken,and,three,spoonfuls,of,sugar,in,his,coffee
yes,life,was,very,sweet,and,cozy,with,scarlett,as,long,as,she,had,her,own,way
when,the,marriage,was,two,weeks,old,frank,contracted,the,grippe,and,dr,meade,put,him,to,bed
in,the,first,year,of,the,war,frank,had,spent,two,months,in,the,hospital,with,pneumonia,and,he,had,lived,in,dread,of,another,attack,since,that,time,so,he,was,only,too,glad,to,lie,sweating,under,three,blankets,and,drink,the,hot,concoctions,mammy,and,aunt,pitty,brought,him,every,hour
the,illness,dragged,on,and,frank,worried,more,and,more,about,the,store,as,each,day,passed
the,place,was,in,charge,of,the,counter,boy,who,came,to,the,house,every,night,to,report,on,the,day's,transactions,but,frank,was,not,satisfied
he,fretted,until,scarlett,who,had,only,been,waiting,for,such,an,opportunity,laid,a,cool,hand,on,his,forehead,and,said,now,sweetheart,i,shall,be,vexed,if,you,take,on,so
i'll,go,to,town,and,see,how,things,are
and,she,went,smiling,as,she,smothered,his,feeble,protests
during,the,three,weeks,of,her,new,marriage,she,had,been,in,a,fever,to,see,his,account,books,and,find,out,just,how,money,matters,stood
what,luck,that,he,was,bedridden
the,store,stood,near,five,points,its,new,roof,glaring,against,the,smoked,bricks,of,the,old,walls
wooden,awnings,covered,the,sidewalk,to,the,edge,of,the,street,and,at,the,long,iron,bars,connecting,the,uprights,horses,and,mules,were,hitched,their,heads,bowed,against,the,cold,misty,rain,their,backs,covered,with,torn,blankets,and,quilts
the,inside,of,the,store,was,almost,like,bullard's,store,in,jonesboro,except,that,there,were,no,loungers,about,the,roaring,red-hot,stove,whittling,and,spitting,streams,of,tobacco,juice,at,the,sand,boxes
it,was,bigger,than,bullard's,store,and,much,darker
the,wooden,awnings,cut,off,most,of,the,winter,daylight,and,the,interior,was,dim,and,dingy,only,a,trickle,of,light,coming,in,through,the,small,fly-specked,windows,high,up,on,the,side,walls
the,floor,was,covered,with,muddy,sawdust,and,everywhere,was,dust,and,dirt
there,was,a,semblance,of,order,in,the,front,of,the,store,where,tall,shelves,rose,into,the,gloom,stacked,with,bright,bolts,of,cloth,china,cooking,utensils,and,notions
but,in,the,back,behind,the,partition,chaos,reigned
here,there,was,no,flooring,and,the,assorted,jumble,of,stock,was,piled,helter-skelter,on,the,hard-packed,earth
in,the,semi-,darkness,she,saw,boxes,and,bales,of,goods,plows,and,harness,and,saddles,and,cheap,pine,coffins
secondhand,furniture,ranging,from,cheap,gum,to,mahogany,and,rosewood,reared,up,in,the,gloom,and,the,rich,but,worn,brocade,and,horsehair,upholstery,gleamed,incongruously,in,the,dingy,surroundings
china,chambers,and,bowl,and,pitcher,sets,littered,the,floor,and,all,around,the,four,walls,were,deep,bins,so,dark,she,had,to,hold,the,lamp,directly,over,them,to,discover,they,contained,seeds,nails,bolts,and,carpenters',tools
i'd,think,a,man,as,fussy,and,old,maidish,as,frank,would,keep,things,tidier,she,thought,scrubbing,her,grimy,hands,with,her,handkerchief
this,place,is,a,pig,pen
what,a,way,to,run,a,store
if,he'd,only,dust,up,this,stuff,and,put,it,out,in,front,where,folks,could,see,it,he,could,sell,things,much,quicker
and,if,his,stock,was,in,such,condition,what,mustn't,his,accounts,be
i'll,look,at,his,account,book,now,she,thought,and,picking,up,the,lamp,she,went,into,the,front,of,the,store
willie,the,counter,boy,was,reluctant,to,give,her,the,large,dirty-backed,ledger
it,was,obvious,that,young,as,he,was,he,shared,frank's,opinion,that,women,had,no,place,in,business
but,scarlett,silenced,him,with,a,sharp,word,and,sent,him,out,to,get,his,dinner
she,felt,better,when,he,was,gone,for,his,disapproval,annoyed,her,and,she,settled,herself,in,a,split-bottomed,chair,by,the,roaring,stove,tucked,one,foot,under,her,and,spread,the,book,across,her,lap
it,was,dinner,time,and,the,streets,were,deserted
no,customers,called,and,she,had,the,store,to,herself
she,turned,the,pages,slowly,narrowly,scanning,the,rows,of,names,and,figures,written,in,frank's,cramped,copperplate,hand
it,was,just,as,she,had,expected,and,she,frowned,as,she,saw,this,newest,evidence,of,frank's,lack,of,business,sense
at,least,five,hundred,dollars,in,debts,some,of,them,months,old,were,set,down,against,the,names,of,people,she,knew,well,the,merriwethers,and,the,elsings,among,other,familiar,names
from,frank's,deprecatory,remarks,about,the,money,people,owed,him,she,had,imagined,the,sums,to,be,small
but,this
if,they,can't,pay,why,do,they,keep,on,buying
she,thought,irritably
and,if,he,knows,they,can't,pay,why,does,he,keep,on,selling,them,stuff
lots,of,them,could,pay,if,he'd,just,make,them,do,it
the,elsings,certainly,could,if,they,could,give,fanny,a,new,satin,dress,and,an,expensive,wedding
frank's,just,too,soft,hearted,and,people,take,advantage,of,him
why,if,he'd,collected,half,this,money,he,could,have,bought,the,sawmill,and,easily,spared,me,the,tax,money,too
then,she,thought,just,imagine,frank,trying,to,operate,a,sawmill
god's,nightgown
if,he,runs,this,store,like,a,charitable,institution,how,could,he,expect,to,make,money,on,a,mill
the,sheriff,would,have,it,in,a,month
why,i,could,run,this,store,better,than,he,does
and,i,could,run,a,mill,better,than,he,could,even,if,i,don't,know,anything,about,the,lumber,business
a,startling,thought,this,that,a,woman,could,handle,business,matters,as,well,as,or,better,than,a,man,a,revolutionary,thought,to,scarlett,who,had,been,reared,in,the,tradition,that,men,were,omniscient,and,women,none,too,bright
of,course,she,had,discovered,that,this,was,not,altogether,true,but,the,pleasant,fiction,still,stuck,in,her,mind
never,before,had,she,put,this,remarkable,idea,into,words
she,sat,quite,still,with,the,heavy,book,across,her,lap,her,mouth,a,little,open,with,surprise,thinking,that,during,the,lean,months,at,tara,she,had,done,a,man's,work,and,done,it,well
she,had,been,brought,up,to,believe,that,a,woman,alone,could,accomplish,nothing,yet,she,had,managed,the,plantation,without,men,to,help,her,until,will,came
why,why,her,mind,stuttered,i,believe,women,could,manage,everything,in,the,world,without,men's,help,except,having,babies,and,god,knows,no,woman,in,her,right,mind,would,have,babies,if,she,could,help,it
with,the,idea,that,she,was,as,capable,as,a,man,came,a,sudden,rush,of,pride,and,a,violent,longing,to,prove,it,to,make,money,for,herself,as,men,made,money
money,which,would,be,her,own,which,she,would,neither,have,to,ask,for,nor,account,for,to,any,man
i,wish,i,had,money,enough,to,buy,that,mill,myself,she,said,aloud,and,sighed
i'd,sure,make,it,hum
and,i,wouldn't,let,even,one,splinter,go,out,on,credit
she,sighed,again
there,was,nowhere,she,could,get,any,money,so,the,idea,was,out,of,the,question
frank,would,simply,have,to,collect,this,money,owing,him,and,buy,the,mill
it,was,a,sure,way,to,make,money,and,when,he,got,the,mill,she,would,certainly,find,some,way,to,make,him,be,more,businesslike,in,its,operation,than,he,had,been,with,the,store
she,pulled,a,back,page,out,of,the,ledger,and,began,copying,the,list,of,debtors,who,had,made,no,payments,in,several,months
she'd,take,the,matter,up,with,frank,just,as,soon,as,she,reached,home
she'd,make,him,realize,that,these,people,had,to,pay,their,bills,even,if,they,were,old,friends,even,if,it,did,embarrass,him,to,press,them,for,money
that,would,probably,upset,frank,for,he,was,timid,and,fond,of,the,approbation,of,his,friends
he,was,so,thin,skinned,he'd,rather,lose,the,money,than,be,businesslike,about,collecting,it
and,he'd,probably,tell,her,that,no,one,had,any,money,with,which,to,pay,him
well,perhaps,that,was,true
poverty,was,certainly,no,news,to,her
but,nearly,everybody,had,saved,some,silver,or,jewelry,or,was,hanging,on,to,a,little,real,estate
frank,could,take,them,in,lieu,of,cash
she,could,imagine,how,frank,would,moan,when,she,broached,such,an,idea,to,him
take,the,jewelry,and,property,of,his,friends
well,she,shrugged,he,can,moan,all,he,likes
i'm,going,to,tell,him,that,he,may,be,willing,to,stay,poor,for,friendship's,sake,but,i'm,not
frank,will,never,get,anywhere,if,he,doesn't,get,up,some,gumption
and,he's,got,to,get,somewhere
he's,got,to,make,money,even,if,i've,got,to,wear,the,pants,in,the,family,to,make,him,do
she,was,writing,busily,her,face,screwed,up,with,the,effort,her,tongue,clamped,between,her,teeth,when,the,front,door,opened,and,a,great,draft,of,cold,wind,swept,the,store
a,tall,man,came,into,the,dingy,room,walking,with,a,light,indian-like,tread,and,looking,up,she,saw,rhett,butler
he,was,resplendent,in,new,clothes,and,a,greatcoat,with,a,dashing,cape,thrown,back,from,his,heavy,shoulders
his,tall,hat,was,off,in,a,deep,bow,when,her,eyes,met,his,and,his,hand,went,to,the,bosom,of,a,spotless,pleated,shirt
his,white,teeth,gleamed,startlingly,against,his,brown,face,and,his,bold,eyes,raked,her
my,dear,mrs,kennedy,he,said,walking,toward,her
my,very,dear,mrs
kennedy
and,he,broke,into,a,loud,merry,laugh
at,first,she,was,as,startled,as,if,a,ghost,had,invaded,the,store,and,then,hastily,removing,her,foot,from,beneath,her,she,stiffened,her,spine,and,gave,him,a,cold,stare
what,are,you,doing,here
i,called,on,miss,pittypat,and,learned,of,your,marriage,and,so,i,hastened,here,to,congratulate,you
the,memory,of,her,humiliation,at,his,hands,made,her,go,crimson,with,shame
i,don't,see,how,you,have,the,gall,to,face,me
she,cried
on,the,contrary
how,have,you,the,gall,to,face,me
oh,you,are,the,most
shall,we,let,the,bugles,sing,truce
he,smiled,down,at,her,a,wide,flashing,smile,that,had,impudence,in,it,but,no,shame,for,his,own,actions,or,condemnation,for,hers
in,spite,of,herself,she,had,to,smile,too,but,it,was,a,wry,uncomfortable,smile
what,a,pity,they,didn't,hang,you
others,share,your,feeling,i,fear
come,scarlett,relax
you,look,like,you'd,swallowed,a,ramrod,and,it,isn't,becoming
surely,you've,had,time,to,recover,from,my,er,my,little,joke
joke
ha
i'll,never,get,over,it
oh,yes,you,will
you,are,just,putting,on,this,indignant,front,because,you,think,it's,proper,and,respectable
may,i,sit,down
no
he,sank,into,a,chair,beside,her,and,grinned
i,hear,you,couldn't,even,wait,two,weeks,for,me,he,said,and,gave,a,mock,sigh
how,fickle,is,woman
when,she,did,not,reply,he,continued
tell,me,scarlett,just,between,friends,between,very,old,and,very,intimate,friends,wouldn't,it,have,been,wiser,to,wait,until,i,got,out,of,jail
or,are,the,charms,of,wedlock,with,old,frank,kennedy,more,alluring,than,illicit,relations,with,me
as,always,when,his,mockery,aroused,wrath,within,her,wrath,fought,with,laughter,at,his,impudence
don't,be,absurd
and,would,you,mind,satisfying,my,curiosity,on,one,point,which,has,bothered,me,for,some,time
did,you,have,no,womanly,repugnance,no,delicate,shrinking,from,marrying,not,just,one,man,but,two,for,whom,you,had,no,love,or,even,affection
or,have,i,been,misinformed,about,the,delicacy,of,our,southern,womanhood
rhett
i,have,my,answer
i,always,felt,that,women,had,a,hardness,and,endurance,unknown,to,men,despite,the,pretty,idea,taught,me,in,childhood,that,women,are,frail,tender,sensitive,creatures
but,after,all,according,to,the,continental,code,of,etiquette,it's,very,bad,form,for,husband,and,wife,to,love,each,other
very,bad,taste,indeed
i,always,felt,that,the,europeans,had,the,right,idea,in,that,matter
marry,for,convenience,and,love,for,pleasure
a,sensible,system,don't,you,think
you,are,closer,to,the,old,country,than,i,thought
how,pleasant,it,would,be,to,shout,at,him,i,did,not,marry,for,convenience
but,unfortunately,rhett,had,her,there,and,any,protest,of,injured,innocence,would,only,bring,more,barbed,remarks,from,him
how,you,do,run,on,she,said,coolly
anxious,to,change,the,subject,she,asked,how,did,you,ever,get,out,of,jail
oh,that
he,answered,making,an,airy,gesture
not,much,trouble
they,let,me,out,this,morning
i,employed,a,delicate,system,of,blackmail,on,a,friend,in,washington,who,is,quite,high,in,the,councils,of,the,federal,government
a,splendid,fellow,one,of,the,staunch,union,patriots,from,whom,i,used,to,buy,muskets,and,hoop,skirts,for,the,confederacy
when,my,distressing,predicament,was,brought,to,his,attention,in,the,right,way,he,hastened,to,use,his,influence,and,so,i,was,released
influence,is,everything,and,guilt,or,innocence,merely,an,academic,question
i'll,take,oath,you,weren't,innocent
no,now,that,i,am,free,of,the,toils,i'll,frankly,admit,that,i'm,as,guilty,as,cain
i,did,kill,the,nigger
he,was,uppity,to,a,lady,and,what,else,could,a,southern,gentleman,do
and,while,i'm,confessing,i,must,admit,that,i,shot,a,yankee,cavalryman,after,some,words,in,a,barroom
i,was,not,charged,with,that,peccadillo,so,perhaps,some,other,poor,devil,has,been,hanged,for,it,long,since
he,was,so,blithe,about,his,murders,her,blood,chilled
words,of,moral,indignation,rose,to,her,lips,but,suddenly,she,remembered,the,yankee,who,lay,under,the,tangle,of,scuppernong,vines,at,tara
he,had,not,been,on,her,conscience,any,more,than,a,roach,upon,which,she,might,have,stepped
she,could,not,sit,in,judgment,on,rhett,when,she,was,as,guilty,as,he
and,as,i,seem,to,be,making,a,clean,breast,of,it,i,must,tell,you,in,strictest,confidence,that,means,don't,tell,miss,pittypat
that,i,did,have,the,money,safe,in,a,bank,in,liverpool
the,money
yes,the,money,the,yankees,were,so,curious,about
scarlett,it,wasn't,altogether,meanness,that,kept,me,from,giving,you,the,money,you,wanted
if,i'd,drawn,a,draft,they,could,have,traced,it,somehow,and,i,doubt,if,you'd,have,gotten,a,cent
my,only,hope,lay,in,doing,nothing
i,knew,the,money,was,pretty,safe,for,if,worst,came,to,worst,if,they,had,located,it,and,tried,to,take,it,away,from,me,i,would,have,named,every,yankee,patriot,who,sold,me,bullets,and,machinery,during,the,war
then,there,would,have,been,a,stink,for,some,of,them,are,high,up,in,washington,now
in,fact,it,was,my,threat,to,unbosom,my,conscience,about,them,that,got,me,out,of,jail
i
do,you,mean,you,you,actually,have,the,confederate,gold
not,all,of,it
good,heavens,no
there,must,be,fifty,or,more,ex-,blockaders,who,have,plenty,salted,away,in,nassau,and,england,and,canada
we,will,be,pretty,unpopular,with,the,confederates,who,weren't,as,slick,as,we,were
i,have,got,close,to,half,a,million
just,think,scarlett,a,half-million,dollars,if,you'd,only,restrained,your,fiery,nature,and,not,rushed,into,wedlock,again
a,half-million,dollars
she,felt,a,pang,of,almost,physical,sickness,at,the,thought,of,so,much,money
his,jeering,words,passed,over,her,head,and,she,did,not,even,hear,them
it,was,hard,to,believe,there,was,so,much,money,in,all,this,bitter,and,poverty-,stricken,world
so,much,money,so,very,much,money,and,someone,else,had,it,someone,who,took,it,lightly,and,didn't,need,it
and,she,had,only,a,sick,elderly,husband,and,this,dirty,piddling,little,store,between,her,and,a,hostile,world
it,wasn't,fair,that,a,reprobate,like,rhett,butler,should,have,so,much,and,she,who,carried,so,heavy,a,load,should,have,so,little
she,hated,him,sitting,there,in,his,dandified,attire,taunting,her
well,she,wouldn't,swell,his,conceit,by,complimenting,him,on,his,cleverness
she,longed,viciously,for,sharp,words,with,which,to,cut,him
i,suppose,you,think,it's,honest,to,keep,the,confederate,money
well,it,isn't
it's,plain,out,and,out,stealing,and,you,know,it
i,wouldn't,have,that,on,my,conscience
my
how,sour,the,grapes,are,today
he,exclaimed,screwing,up,his,face
and,just,whom,am,i,stealing,from
she,was,silent,trying,to,think,just,whom,indeed
after,all,he,had,only,done,what,frank,had,done,on,a,small,scale
half,the,money,is,honestly,mine,he,continued,honestly,made,with,the,aid,of,honest,union,patriots,who,were,willing,to,sell,out,the,union,behind,its,back,for,one-hundred-per-cent,profit,on,their,goods
part,i,made,out,of,my,little,investment,in,cotton,at,the,beginning,of,the,war,the,cotton,i,bought,cheap,and,sold,for,a,dollar,a,pound,when,the,british,mills,were,crying,for,it
part,i,got,from,food,speculation
why,should,i,let,the,yankees,have,the,fruits,of,my,labor
but,the,rest,did,belong,to,the,confederacy
it,came,from,confederate,cotton,which,i,managed,to,run,through,the,blockade,and,sell,in,liverpool,at,sky-high,prices
the,cotton,was,given,me,in,good,faith,to,buy,leather,and,rifles,and,machinery,with
and,it,was,taken,by,me,in,good,faith,to,buy,the,same
my,orders,were,to,leave,the,gold,in,english,banks,under,my,own,name,in,order,that,my,credit,would,be,good
you,remember,when,the,blockade,tightened,i,couldn't,get,a,boat,out,of,any,confederate,port,or,into,one,so,there,the,money,stayed,in,england
what,should,i,have,done
drawn,out,all,that,gold,from,english,banks,like,a,simpleton,and,tried,to,run,it,into,wilmington
and,let,the,yankees,capture,it
was,it,my,fault,that,the,blockade,got,too,tight
was,it,my,fault,that,our,cause,failed
the,money,belonged,to,the,confederacy
well,there,is,no,confederacy,now,though,you'd,never,know,it,to,hear,some,people,talk
whom,shall,i,give,the,money,to
the,yankee,government
i,should,so,hate,for,people,to,think,me,a,thief
he,removed,a,leather,case,from,his,pocket,extracted,a,long,cigar,and,smelled,it,approvingly,meanwhile,watching,her,with,pseudo,anxiety,as,if,he,hung,on,her,words
plague,take,him,she,thought,he's,always,one,jump,ahead,of,me
there,is,always,something,wrong,with,his,arguments,but,i,never,can,put,my,finger,on,just,what,it,is
you,might,she,said,with,dignity,distribute,it,to,those,who,are,in,need
the,confederacy,is,gone,but,there,are,plenty,of,confederates,and,their,families,who,are,starving
he,threw,back,his,bead,and,laughed,rudely
you,are,never,so,charming,or,so,absurd,as,when,you,are,airing,some,hypocrisy,like,that,he,cried,in,frank,enjoyment
always,tell,the,truth,scarlett
you,can't,lie
the,irish,are,the,poorest,liars,in,the,world
come,now,be,frank
you,never,gave,a,damn,about,the,late,lamented,confederacy,and,you,care,less,about,the,starving,confederates
you'd,scream,in,protest,if,i,even,suggested,giving,away,all,the,money,unless,i,started,off,by,giving,you,the,lion's,share
i,don't,want,your,money,she,began,trying,to,be,coldly,dignified
oh,don't,you
your,palm,is,itching,to,beat,the,band,this,minute
if,i,showed,you,a,quarter,you'd,leap,on,it
if,you,have,come,here,to,insult,me,and,laugh,at,my,poverty,i,will,wish,you,good,day,she,retorted,trying,to,rid,her,lap,of,the,heavy,ledger,so,she,might,rise,and,make,her,words,more,impressive
instantly,he,was,on,his,feet,bending,over,her,laughing,as,he,pushed,her,back,into,her,chair
when,will,you,ever,get,over,losing,your,temper,when,you,hear,the,truth
you,never,mind,speaking,the,truth,about,other,people,so,why,should,you,mind,hearing,it,about,yourself
i'm,not,insulting,you
i,think,acquisitiveness,is,a,very,fine,quality
she,was,not,sure,what,acquisitiveness,meant,but,as,he,praised,it,she,felt,slightly,mollified
i,didn't,come,to,gloat,over,your,poverty,but,to,wish,you,long,life,and,happiness,in,your,marriage
by,the,way,what,did,sister,sue,think,of,your,larceny
my,what
your,stealing,frank,from,under,her,nose
i,did,not
well,we,won't,quibble,about,the,word
what,did,she,say
she,said,nothing,said,scarlett
his,eyes,danced,as,they,gave,her,the,lie
how,unselfish,of,her
now,let's,hear,about,your,poverty
surely,i,have,the,right,to,know,after,your,little,trip,out,to,the,jail,not,long,ago
hasn't,frank,as,much,money,as,you,hoped
there,was,no,evading,his,impudence
either,she,would,have,to,put,up,with,it,or,ask,him,to,leave
and,now,she,did,not,want,him,to,leave
his,words,were,barbed,but,they,were,the,barbs,of,truth
he,knew,what,she,had,done,and,why,she,had,done,it,and,he,did,not,seem,to,think,the,less,of,her,for,it
and,though,his,questions,were,unpleasantly,blunt,they,seemed,actuated,by,a,friendly,interest
he,was,one,person,to,whom,she,could,tell,the,truth
that,would,be,a,relief,for,it,had,been,so,long,since,she,had,told,anyone,the,truth,about,herself,and,her,motives
whenever,she,spoke,her,mind,everyone,seemed,to,be,shocked
talking,to,rhett,was,comparable,only,to,one,thing,the,feeling,of,ease,and,comfort,afforded,by,a,pair,of,old,slippers,after,dancing,in,a,pair,too,tight
didn't,you,get,the,money,for,the,taxes
don't,tell,me,the,wolf,is,still,at,the,door,of,tara
there,was,a,different,tone,in,his,voice
she,looked,up,to,meet,his,dark,eyes,and,caught,an,expression,which,startled,and,puzzled,her,at,first,and,then,made,her,suddenly,smile,a,sweet,and,charming,smile,which,was,seldom,on,her,face,these,days
what,a,perverse,wretch,he,was,but,how,nice,he,could,be,at,times
she,knew,now,that,the,real,reason,for,his,call,was,not,to,tease,her,but,to,make,sure,she,had,gotten,the,money,for,which,she,had,been,so,desperate
she,knew,now,that,he,had,hurried,to,her,as,soon,as,he,was,released,without,the,slightest,appearance,of,hurry,to,lend,her,the,money,if,she,still,needed,it
and,yet,he,would,torment,and,insult,her,and,deny,that,such,was,his,intent,should,she,accuse,him
he,was,quite,beyond,all,comprehension
did,he,really,care,about,her,more,than,he,was,willing,to,admit
or,did,he,have,some,other,motive
probably,the,latter,she,thought
but,who,could,tell
he,did,such,strange,things,sometimes
no,she,said,the,wolf,isn't,at,the,door,any,longer
i,i,got,the,money
but,not,without,a,struggle,i'll,warrant
did,you,manage,to,restrain,yourself,until,you,got,the,wedding,ring,on,your,finger
she,tried,not,to,smile,at,his,accurate,summing,up,of,her,conduct,but,she,could,not,help,dimpling
he,seated,himself,again,sprawling,his,long,legs,comfortably
well,tell,me,about,your,poverty
did,frank,the,brute,mislead,you,about,his,prospects
he,should,be,soundly,thrashed,for,taking,advantage,of,a,helpless,female
come,scarlett,tell,me,everything
you,should,have,no,secrets,from,me
surely,i,know,the,worst,about,you
oh,rhett,you're,the,worst,well,i,don't,know,what
no,he,didn't,exactly,fool,me,but,suddenly,it,became,a,pleasure,to,unburden,herself
rhett,if,frank,would,just,collect,the,money,people,owe,him,i,wouldn't,be,worried,about,anything
but,rhett,fifty,people,owe,him,and,he,won't,press,them
he's,so,thin,skinned
he,says,a,gentleman,can't,do,that,to,another,gentleman
and,it,may,be,months,and,may,be,never,before,we,get,the,money
well,what,of,it
haven't,you,enough,to,eat,on,until,he,does,collect
yes,but,well,as,a,matter,of,fact,i,could,use,a,little,money,right,now
her,eyes,brightened,as,she,thought,of,the,mill
perhaps
what,for
more,taxes
is,that,any,of,your,business
yes,because,you,are,getting,ready,to,touch,me,for,a,loan
oh,i,know,all,the,approaches
and,i'll,lend,it,to,you,without,my,dear,mrs,kennedy,that,charming,collateral,you,offered,me,a,short,while,ago
unless,of,course,you,insist
you,are,the,coarsest
not,at,all
i,merely,wanted,to,set,your,mind,at,ease
i,knew,you'd,be,worried,about,that,point
not,much,worried,but,a,little
and,i'm,willing,to,lend,you,the,money
but,i,do,want,to,know,how,you,are,going,to,spend,it
i,have,that,right,i,believe
if,it's,to,buy,you,pretty,frocks,or,a,carriage,take,it,with,my,blessing
but,if,it's,to,buy,a,new,pair,of,breeches,for,ashley,wilkes,i,fear,i,must,decline,to,lend,it
she,was,hot,with,sudden,rage,and,she,stuttered,until,words,came
ashley,wilkes,has,never,taken,a,cent,from,me
i,couldn't,make,him,take,a,cent,if,he,were,starving
you,don't,understand,him,how,honorable,how,proud,he,is
of,course,you,can't,understand,him,being,what,you,are
don't,let's,begin,calling,names
i,could,call,you,a,few,that,would,match,any,you,could,think,of,for,me
you,forget,that,i,have,been,keeping,up,with,you,through,miss,pittypat,and,the,dear,soul,tells,all,she,knows,to,any,sympathetic,listener
i,know,that,ashley,has,been,at,tara,ever,since,he,came,home,from,rock,island
i,know,that,you,have,even,put,up,with,having,his,wife,around,which,must,have,been,a,strain,on,you
ashley,is
oh,yes,he,said,waving,his,hand,negligently
ashley,is,too,sublime,for,my,earthy,comprehension
but,please,don't,forget,i,was,an,interested,witness,to,your,tender,scene,with,him,at,twelve,oaks,and,something,tells,me,he,hasn't,changed,since,then
and,neither,have,you
he,didn't,cut,so,sublime,a,figure,that,day,if,i,remember,rightly
and,i,don't,think,the,figure,he,cuts,now,is,much,better
why,doesn't,he,take,his,family,and,get,out,and,find,work
and,stop,living,at,tara
of,course,it's,just,a,whim,of,mine,but,i,don't,intend,to,lend,you,a,cent,for,tara,to,help,support,him
among,men,there's,a,very,unpleasant,name,for,men,who,permit,women,to,support,them
how,dare,you,say,such,things
he's,been,working,like,a,field,hand
for,all,her,rage,her,heart,was,wrung,by,the,memory,of,ashley,splitting,fence,rails
and,worth,his,weight,in,gold,i,dare,say
what,a,hand,he,must,be,with,the,manure,and
he's
oh,yes,i,know
let's,grant,that,he,does,the,best,he,can,but,i,don't,imagine,he's,much,help
you'll,never,make,a,farm,hand,out,of,a,wilkes,or,anything,else,that's,useful
the,breed,is,purely,ornamental
now,quiet,your,ruffled,feathers,and,overlook,my,boorish,remarks,about,the,proud,and,honorable,ashley
strange,how,these,illusions,will,persist,even,in,women,as,hard,headed,as,you,are
how,much,money,do,you,want,and,what,do,you,want,it,for
when,she,did,not,answer,he,repeated
what,do,you,want,it,for
and,see,if,you,can,manage,to,tell,me,the,truth
it,will,do,as,well,as,a,lie
in,fact,better,for,if,you,lie,to,me,i'll,be,sure,to,find,it,out,and,think,how,embarrassing,that,would,be
always,remember,this,scarlett,i,can,stand,anything,from,you,but,a,lie,your,dislike,for,me,your,tempers,all,your,vixenish,ways,but,not,a,lie
now,what,do,you,want,it,for
raging,as,she,was,at,his,attack,on,ashley,she,would,have,given,anything,to,spit,on,him,and,throw,his,offer,of,money,proudly,into,his,mocking,face
for,a,moment,she,almost,did,but,the,cold,hand,of,common,sense,held,her,back
she,swallowed,her,anger,with,poor,grace,and,tried,to,assume,an,expression,of,pleasant,dignity
he,leaned,back,in,his,chair,stretching,his,legs,toward,the,stove
if,there's,one,thing,in,the,world,that,gives,me,more,amusement,than,anything,else,he,remarked,it's,the,sight,of,your,mental,struggles,when,a,matter,of,principle,is,laid,up,against,something,practical,like,money
of,course,i,know,the,practical,in,you,will,always,win,but,i,keep,hanging,around,to,see,if,your,better,nature,won't,triumph,some,day
and,when,that,day,comes,i,shall,pack,my,bag,and,leave,atlanta,forever
there,are,too,many,women,whose,better,natures,are,always,triumphing
well,let's,get,back,to,business
how,much,and,what,for
i,don't,know,quite,how,much,i'll,need,she,said,sulkily
but,i,want,to,buy,a,sawmill,and,i,think,i,can,get,it,cheap
and,i'll,need,two,wagons,and,two,mules
i,want,good,mules,too
and,a,horse,and,buggy,for,my,own,use
a,sawmill
yes,and,if,you'll,lend,me,the,money,i'll,give,you,a,half-,interest,in,it
whatever,would,i,do,with,a,sawmill
make,money
we,can,make,loads,of,money
or,i'll,pay,you,interest,on,the,loan,let's,see,what,is,good,interest
fifty,per,cent,is,considered,very,fine
fifty,oh,but,you,are,joking
stop,laughing,you,devil
i'm,serious
that's,why,i'm,laughing
i,wonder,if,anyone,but,me,realizes,what,goes,on,in,that,head,back,of,your,deceptively,sweet,face
well,who,cares
listen,rhett,and,see,if,this,doesn't,sound,like,good,business,to,you
frank,told,me,about,this,man,who,has,a,sawmill,a,little,one,out,peachtree,road,and,he,wants,to,sell,it
he's,got,to,have,cash,money,pretty,quick,and,he'll,sell,it,cheap
there,aren't,many,sawmills,around,here,now,and,the,way,people,are,rebuilding,why,we,could,sell,lumber,sky,high
the,man,will,stay,and,run,the,mill,for,a,wage
frank,told,me,about,it
frank,would,buy,the,mill,himself,if,he,had,the,money
i,guess,he,was,intending,buying,it,with,the,money,he,gave,me,for,the,taxes
poor,frank
what,is,he,going,to,say,when,you,tell,him,you've,bought,it,yourself,right,out,from,under,him
and,how,are,you,going,to,explain,my,lending,you,the,money,without,compromising,your,reputation
scarlett,had,given,no,thought,to,this,so,intent,was,she,upon,the,money,the,mill,would,bring,in
well,i,just,won't,tell,him
he'll,know,you,didn't,pick,it,off,a,bush
i'll,tell,him,why,yes,i'll,tell,him,i,sold,you,my,diamond,earbobs
and,i,will,give,them,to,you,too
that'll,be,my,collat,my,whatchucallit
i,wouldn't,take,your,earbobs
i,don't,want,them
i,don't,like,them
they,aren't,really,mine,anyway
whose,are,they
her,mind,went,swiftly,back,to,the,still,hot,noon,with,the,country,hush,deep,about,tara,and,the,dead,man,in,blue,sprawled,in,the,hall
they,were,left,with,me,by,someone,who's,dead
they're,mine,all,right
take,them
i,don't,want,them
i'd,rather,have,the,money,for,them
good,lord
he,cried,impatiently
don't,you,ever,think,of,anything,but,money
no,she,replied,frankly,turning,hard,green,eyes,upon,him
and,if,you'd,been,through,what,i,have,you,wouldn't,either
i've,found,out,that,money,is,the,most,important,thing,in,the,world,and,as,god,is,my,witness,i,don't,ever,intend,to,be,without,it,again
she,remembered,the,hot,sun,the,soft,red,earth,under,her,sick,head,the,niggery,smell,of,the,cabin,behind,the,ruins,of,twelve,oaks,remembered,the,refrain,her,heart,had,beaten,i'll,never,be,hungry,again
i'll,never,be,hungry,again
i'm,going,to,have,money,some,day,lots,of,it,so,i,can,have,anything,i,want,to,eat
and,then,there'll,never,be,any,hominy,or,dried,peas,on,my,table
and,i'm,going,to,have,pretty,clothes,and,all,of,them,are,going,to,be,silk
all
all,she,said,shortly,not,even,troubling,to,blush,at,his,implication
i'm,going,to,have,money,enough,so,the,yankees,can,never,take,tara,away,from,me
and,i'm,going,to,have,a,new,roof,for,tara,and,a,new,barn,and,fine,mules,for,plowing,and,more,cotton,than,you,ever,saw
and,wade,isn't,ever,going,to,know,what,it,means,to,do,without,the,things,he,needs
never
he's,going,to,have,everything,in,the,world
and,all,my,family,they,aren't,ever,going,to,be,hungry,again
i,mean,it
every,word
you,don't,understand,you're,such,a,selfish,hound
you've,never,had,the,carpetbaggers,trying,to,drive,you,out
you've,never,been,cold,and,ragged,and,had,to,break,your,back,to,keep,from,starving
he,said,quietly,i,was,in,the,confederate,army,for,eight,months
i,don't,know,any,better,place,for,starving
the,army
bah
you've,never,had,to,pick,cotton,and,weed,corn
you've,don't,you,laugh,at,me
his,hands,were,on,hers,again,as,her,voice,rose,harshly
i,wasn't,laughing,at,you
i,was,laughing,at,the,difference,in,what,you,look,and,what,you,really,are
and,i,was,remembering,the,first,time,i,ever,saw,you,at,the,barbecue,at,the,wilkes'
you,had,on,a,green,dress,and,little,green,slippers,and,you,were,knee,deep,in,men,and,quite,full,of,yourself
i'll,wager,you,didn't,know,then,how,many,pennies,were,in,a,dollar
there,was,only,one,idea,in,your,whole,mind,then,and,that,was,ensnaring,ash
she,jerked,her,hands,away,from,him
rhett,if,we,are,to,get,on,at,all,you'll,have,to,stop,talking,about,ashley,wilkes
we'll,always,fall,out,about,him,because,you,can't,understand,him
i,suppose,you,understand,him,like,a,book,said,rhett,maliciously
no,scarlett,if,i,am,to,lend,you,the,money,i,reserve,the,right,to,discuss,ashley,wilkes,in,any,terms,i,care,to
i,waive,the,right,to,collect,interest,on,my,loan,but,not,that,right
and,there,are,a,number,of,things,about,that,young,man,i'd,like,to,know
i,do,not,have,to,discuss,him,with,you,she,answered,shortly
oh,but,you,do
i,hold,the,purse,strings,you,see
some,day,when,you,are,rich,you,can,have,the,power,to,do,the,same,to,others
it's,obvious,that,you,still,care,about,him
i,do,not
oh,it's,so,obvious,from,the,way,you,rush,to,his,defense
you
i,won't,stand,having,my,friends,sneered,at
well,we'll,let,that,pass,for,the,moment
does,he,still,care,for,you,or,did,rock,island,make,him,forget
or,perhaps,he's,learned,to,appreciate,what,a,jewel,of,a,wife,he,has
at,the,mention,of,melanie,scarlett,began,to,breathe,hard,and,could,scarcely,restrain,herself,from,crying,out,the,whole,story,that,only,honor,kept,ashley,with,melanie
she,opened,her,mouth,to,speak,and,then,closed,it
oh
so,he,still,hasn't,enough,sense,to,appreciate,mrs,wilkes
and,the,rigors,of,prison,didn't,dim,his,ardor,for,you
i,see,no,need,to,discuss,the,subject
i,wish,to,discuss,it,said,rhett
there,was,a,low,note,in,his,voice,which,scarlett,did,not,understand,but,did,not,like,to,hear
and,by,god,i,will,discuss,it,and,i,expect,you,to,answer,me
so,he's,still,in,love,with,you
well,what,if,he,is
cried,scarlett,goaded
i,don't,care,to,discuss,him,with,you,because,you,can't,understand,him,or,his,kind,of,love
the,only,kind,of,love,you,know,about,is,just,well,the,kind,you,carry,on,with,creatures,like,that,watling,woman
oh,said,rhett,softly
so,i,am,only,capable,of,carnal,lusts
well,you,know,it's,true
now,i,appreciate,your,hesitance,in,discussing,the,matter,with,me
my,unclean,hands,and,lips,besmirch,the,purity,of,his,love
well,yes,something,like,that
i'm,interested,in,this,pure,love
don't,be,so,nasty,rhett,butler
if,you,are,vile,enough,to,think,there's,ever,been,anything,wrong,between,us
oh,the,thought,never,entered,my,head,really
that's,why,it,all,interests,me
just,why,hasn't,there,been,anything,wrong,between,you
if,you,think,that,ashley,would
ah,so,it's,ashley,and,not,you,who,has,fought,the,fight,for,purity
really,scarlett,you,should,not,give,yourself,away,so,easily
scarlett,looked,into,his,smooth,unreadable,face,in,confusion,and,indignation
we,won't,go,any,further,with,this,and,i,don't,want,your,money
so,get,out
oh,yes,you,do,want,my,money,and,as,we've,gone,this,far,why,stop
surely,there,can,be,no,harm,in,discussing,so,chaste,an,idyl,when,there,hasn't,been,anything,wrong
so,ashley,loves,you,for,your,mind,your,soul,your,nobility,of,character
scarlett,writhed,at,his,words
of,course,ashley,loved,her,for,just,these,things
it,was,this,knowledge,that,made,life,endurable,this,knowledge,that,ashley,bound,by,honor,loved,her,from,afar,for,beautiful,things,deep,buried,in,her,that,he,alone,could,see
but,they,did,not,seem,so,beautiful,when,dragged,to,the,light,by,rhett,especially,in,that,deceptively,smooth,voice,that,covered,sarcasm
it,gives,me,back,my,boyish,ideals,to,know,that,such,a,love,can,exist,in,this,naughty,world,he,continued
so,there's,no,touch,of,the,flesh,in,his,love,for,you
it,would,be,the,same,if,you,were,ugly,and,didn't,have,that,white,skin
and,if,you,didn't,have,those,green,eyes,which,make,a,man,wonder,just,what,you,would,do,if,he,took,you,in,his,arms
and,a,way,of,swaying,your,hips,that's,an,allurement,to,any,man,under,ninety
and,those,lips,which,are,well,i,mustn't,let,my,carnal,lusts,obtrude
ashley,sees,none,of,these,things
or,if,he,sees,them,they,move,him,not,at,all
unbidden,scarlett's,mind,went,back,to,that,day,in,the,orchard,when,ashley's,arms,shook,as,he,held,her,when,his,mouth,was,hot,on,hers,as,if,he,would,never,let,her,go
she,went,crimson,at,the,memory,and,her,blush,was,not,lost,on,rhett
so,he,said,and,there,was,a,vibrant,note,almost,like,anger,in,his,voice
i,see
he,loves,you,for,your,mind,alone
how,dare,he,pry,with,dirty,fingers,making,the,one,beautiful,sacred,thing,in,her,life,seem,vile
coolly,determinedly,he,was,breaking,down,the,last,of,her,reserves,and,the,information,he,wanted,was,forthcoming
yes,he,does
she,cried,pushing,back,the,memory,of,ashley's,lips
my,dear,he,doesn't,even,know,you've,got,a,mind
if,it,was,your,mind,that,attracted,him,he,would,not,need,to,struggle,against,you,as,he,must,have,done,to,keep,this,love,so,shall,we,say,'holy'
he,could,rest,easily,for,after,all,a,man,can,admire,a,woman's,mind,and,soul,and,still,be,an,honorable,gentleman,and,true,to,his,wife
but,it,must,be,difficult,for,him,to,reconcile,the,honor,of,the,wilkeses,with,coveting,your,body,as,he,does
you,judge,everybody's,mind,by,your,own,vile,one
oh,i've,never,denied,coveting,you,if,that's,what,you,mean
but,thank,god,i'm,not,bothered,about,matters,of,honor
what,i,want,i,take,if,i,can,get,it,and,so,i,wrestle,neither,with,angels,nor,devils
what,a,merry,hell,you,must,have,made,for,ashley
almost,i,can,be,sorry,for,him
i,i,make,a,hell,for,him
yes,you
there,you,are,a,constant,temptation,to,him,but,like,most,of,his,breed,he,prefers,what,passes,in,these,parts,as,honor,to,any,amount,of,love
and,it,looks,to,me,as,if,the,poor,devil,now,had,neither,love,nor,honor,to,warm,himself
he,has,love
i,mean,he,loves,me
does,he
then,answer,me,this,and,we,are,through,for,the,day,and,you,can,take,the,money,and,throw,it,in,the,gutter,for,all,i,care
rhett,rose,to,his,feet,and,threw,his,half-smoked,cigar,into,the,spittoon
there,was,about,his,movements,the,same,pagan,freedom,and,leashed,power,scarlett,had,noted,that,night,atlanta,fell,something,sinister,and,a,little,frightening
if,he,loved,you,then,why,in,hell,did,he,permit,you,to,come,to,atlanta,to,get,the,tax,money
before,i'd,let,a,woman,i,loved,do,that,i'd
he,didn't,know
he,had,no,idea,that,i
doesn't,it,occur,to,you,that,he,should,have,known
there,was,barely,suppressed,savagery,in,his,voice
loving,you,as,you,say,he,does,he,should,have,known,just,what,you,would,do,when,you,were,desperate
he,should,have,killed,you,rather,than,let,you,come,up,here,and,to,me,of,all,people
god,in,heaven
but,he,didn't,know
if,he,didn't,guess,it,without,being,told,he'll,never,know,anything,about,you,and,your,precious,mind
how,unfair,he,was
as,if,ashley,was,a,mind,reader
as,if,ashley,could,have,stopped,her,even,had,he,known
but,she,knew,suddenly,ashley,could,have,stopped,her
the,faintest,intimation,from,him,in,the,orchard,that,some,day,things,might,be,different,and,she,would,never,have,thought,of,going,to,rhett
a,word,of,tenderness,even,a,parting,caress,when,she,was,getting,on,the,train,would,have,held,her,back
but,he,had,only,talked,of,honor
yet,was,rhett,right
should,ashley,have,known,her,mind
swiftly,she,put,the,disloyal,thought,from,her
of,course,he,didn't,suspect
ashley,would,never,suspect,that,she,would,even,think,of,doing,anything,so,immoral
ashley,was,too,fine,to,have,such,thoughts
rhett,was,just,trying,to,spoil,her,love
he,was,trying,to,tear,down,what,was,most,precious,to,her
some,day,she,thought,viciously,when,the,store,was,on,its,feet,and,the,mill,doing,nicely,and,she,had,money,she,would,make,rhett,butler,pay,for,the,misery,and,humiliation,he,was,causing,her
he,was,standing,over,her,looking,down,at,her,faintly,amused
the,emotion,which,had,stirred,him,was,gone
what,does,it,all,matter,to,you,anyway
she,asked
it's,my,business,and,ashley's,and,not,yours
he,shrugged
only,this
i,have,a,deep,and,impersonal,admiration,for,your,endurance,scarlett,and,i,do,not,like,to,see,your,spirit,crushed,beneath,too,many,millstones
there's,tara
that's,a,man-sized,job,in,itself
there's,your,sick,father,added,on
he'll,never,be,any,help,to,you
and,the,girls,and,the,darkies
and,now,you've,taken,on,a,husband,and,probably,miss,pittypat,too
you've,enough,burdens,without,ashley,wilkes,and,his,family,on,your,hands
he's,not,on,my,hands
he,helps
oh,for,god's,sake,he,said,impatiently
don't,let's,have,any,more,of,that
he's,no,help
he's,on,your,hands,and,he'll,be,on,them,or,on,somebody's,till,he,dies
personally,i'm,sick,of,him,as,a,topic,of,conversation
how,much,money,do,you,want
vituperative,words,rushed,to,her,lips
after,all,his,insults,after,dragging,from,her,those,things,which,were,most,precious,to,her,and,trampling,on,them,he,still,thought,she,would,take,his,money
but,the,words,were,checked,unspoken
how,wonderful,it,would,be,to,scorn,his,offer,and,order,him,out,of,the,store
but,only,the,truly,rich,and,the,truly,secure,could,afford,this,luxury
so,long,as,she,was,poor,just,so,long,would,she,have,to,endure,such,scenes,as,this
but,when,she,was,rich,oh,what,a,beautiful,warming,thought,that,was,when,she,was,rich,she,wouldn't,stand,anything,she,didn't,like,do,without,anything,she,desired,or,even,be,polite,to,people,unless,they,pleased,her
i,shall,tell,them,all,to,go,to,halifax,she,thought,and,rhett,butler,will,be,the,first,one
the,pleasure,in,the,thought,brought,a,sparkle,into,her,green,eyes,and,a,half-smile,to,her,lips
rhett,smiled,too
you're,a,pretty,person,scarlett,he,said
especially,when,you,are,meditating,devilment
and,just,for,the,sight,of,that,dimple,i'll,buy,you,a,baker's,dozen,of,mules,if,you,want,them
the,front,door,opened,and,the,counter,boy,entered,picking,his,teeth,with,a,quill
scarlett,rose,pulled,her,shawl,about,her,and,tied,her,bonnet,strings,firmly,under,her,chin
her,mind,was,made,up
are,you,busy,this,afternoon
can,you,come,with,me,now
she,asked
where
i,want,you,to,drive,to,the,mill,with,me
i,promised,frank,i,wouldn't,drive,out,of,town,by,myself
to,the,mill,in,this,rain
yes,i,want,to,buy,that,mill,now,before,you,change,your,mind
he,laughed,so,loudly,the,boy,behind,the,counter,started,and,looked,at,him,curiously
have,you,forgotten,you,are,married
mrs,kennedy,can't,afford,to,be,seen,driving,out,into,the,country,with,that,butler,reprobate,who,isn't,received,in,the,best,parlors
have,you,forgotten,your,reputation
reputation,fiddle-dee-dee
i,want,that,mill,before,you,change,your,mind,or,frank,finds,out,that,i'm,buying,it
don't,be,a,slow,poke,rhett
what's,a,little,rain
let's,hurry
that,sawmill
frank,groaned,every,time,he,thought,of,it,cursing,himself,for,ever,mentioning,it,to,her
it,was,bad,enough,for,her,to,sell,her,earrings,to,captain,butler,of,all,people
and,buy,the,mill,without,even,consulting,her,own,husband,about,it,but,it,was,worse,still,that,she,did,not,turn,it,over,to,him,to,operate
that,looked,bad
as,if,she,did,not,trust,him,or,his,judgment
frank,in,common,with,all,men,he,knew,felt,that,a,wife,should,be,guided,by,her,husband's,superior,knowledge,should,accept,his,opinions,in,full,and,have,none,of,her,own
he,would,have,given,most,women,their,own,way
women,were,such,funny,little,creatures,and,it,never,hurt,to,humor,their,small,whims
mild,and,gentle,by,nature,it,was,not,in,him,to,deny,a,wife,much
he,would,have,enjoyed,gratifying,the,foolish,notions,of,some,soft,little,person,and,scolding,her,lovingly,for,her,stupidity,and,extravagance
but,the,things,scarlett,set,her,mind,on,were,unthinkable
that,sawmill,for,example
it,was,the,shock,of,his,life,when,she,told,him,with,a,sweet,smile,in,answer,to,his,questions,that,she,intended,to,run,it,herself
go,into,the,lumber,business,myself,was,the,way,she,put,it
frank,would,never,forget,the,horror,of,that,moment
go,into,business,for,herself
it,was,unthinkable
there,were,no,women,in,business,in,atlanta
in,fact,frank,had,never,heard,of,a,woman,in,business,anywhere
if,women,were,so,unfortunate,as,to,be,compelled,to,make,a,little,money,to,assist,their,families,in,these,hard,times,they,made,it,in,quiet,womanly,ways,baking,as,mrs,merriwether,was,doing,or,painting,china,and,sewing,and,keeping,boarders,like,mrs,elsing,and,fanny,or,teaching,school,like,mrs,meade,or,giving,music,lessons,like,mrs,bonnell
these,ladies,made,money,but,they,kept,themselves,at,home,while,they,did,it,as,a,woman,should
but,for,a,woman,to,leave,the,protection,of,her,home,and,venture,out,into,the,rough,world,of,men,competing,with,them,in,business,rubbing,shoulders,with,them,being,exposed,to,insult,and,gossip
especially,when,she,wasn't,forced,to,do,it,when,she,had,a,husband,amply,able,to,provide,for,her
frank,had,hoped,she,was,only,teasing,or,playing,a,joke,on,him,a,joke,of,questionable,taste,but,he,soon,found,she,meant,what,she,said
she,did,operate,the,sawmill
she,rose,earlier,than,he,did,to,drive,out,peachtree,road,and,frequently,did,not,come,home,until,long,after,he,had,locked,up,the,store,and,returned,to,aunt,pitty's,for,supper
she,drove,the,long,miles,to,the,mill,with,only,the,disapproving,uncle,peter,to,protect,her,and,the,woods,were,full,of,free,niggers,and,yankee,riffraff
frank,couldn't,go,with,her,the,store,took,all,of,his,time,but,when,he,protested,she,said,shortly,if,i,don't,keep,an,eye,on,that,slick,scamp,johnson,he'll,steal,my,lumber,and,sell,it,and,put,the,money,in,his,pocket
when,i,can,get,a,good,man,to,run,the,mill,for,me,then,i,won't,have,to,go,out,there,so,often
then,i,can,spend,my,time,in,town,selling,lumber
selling,lumber,in,town
that,was,worst,of,all
she,frequently,did,take,a,day,off,from,the,mill,and,peddle,lumber,and,on,those,days,frank,wished,he,could,hide,in,the,dark,back,room,of,his,store,and,see,no,one
his,wife,selling,lumber
and,people,were,talking,terrible,about,her
probably,about,him,too,for,permitting,her,to,behave,in,so,unwomanly,a,fashion
it,embarrassed,him,to,face,his,customers,over,the,counter,and,hear,them,say,i,saw,mrs,kennedy,a,few,minutes,ago,over,at
everyone,took,pains,to,tell,him,what,she,did
everyone,was,talking,about,what,happened,over,where,the,new,hotel,was,being,built
scarlett,had,driven,up,just,as,tommy,wellburn,was,buying,some,lumber,from,another,man,and,she,climbed,down,out,of,the,buggy,among,the,rough,irish,masons,who,were,laying,the,foundations,and,told,tommy,briefly,that,he,was,being,cheated
she,said,her,lumber,was,better,and,cheaper,too,and,to,prove,it,she,ran,up,a,long,column,of,figures,in,her,head,and,gave,him,an,estimate,then,and,there
it,was,bad,enough,that,she,had,intruded,herself,among,strange,rough,workmen,but,it,was,still,worse,for,a,woman,to,show,publicly,that,she,could,do,mathematics,like,that
when,tommy,accepted,her,estimate,and,gave,her,the,order,scarlett,had,not,taken,her,departure,speedily,and,meekly,but,had,idled,about,talking,to,johnnie,gallegher,the,foreman,of,the,irish,workers,a,hard-bitten,little,gnome,of,a,man,who,had,a,very,bad,reputation
the,town,talked,about,it,for,weeks
on,top,of,everything,else,she,was,actually,making,money,out,of,the,mill,and,no,man,could,feel,right,about,a,wife,who,succeeded,in,so,unwomanly,an,activity
nor,did,she,turn,over,the,money,or,any,part,of,it,to,him,to,use,in,the,store
most,of,it,went,to,tara,and,she,wrote,interminable,letters,to,will,benteen,telling,him,just,how,it,should,be,spent
furthermore,she,told,frank,that,if,the,repairs,at,tara,could,ever,be,completed,she,intended,to,lend,out,her,money,on,mortgages
my
my
moaned,frank,whenever,he,thought,of,this
a,woman,had,no,business,even,knowing,what,a,mortgage,was
scarlett,was,full,of,plans,these,days,and,each,one,of,them,seemed,worse,to,frank,than,the,previous,one
she,even,talked,of,building,a,saloon,on,the,property,where,her,warehouse,had,been,until,sherman,burned,it
frank,was,no,teetotaler,but,he,feverishly,protested,against,the,idea
owning,saloon,property,was,a,bad,business,an,unlucky,business,almost,as,bad,as,renting,to,a,house,of,prostitution
just,why,it,was,bad,he,could,not,explain,to,her,and,to,his,lame,arguments,she,said,fiddle-dee-dee
saloons,are,always,good,tenants
uncle,henry,said,so,she,told,him
they,always,pay,their,rent,and,look,here,frank,i,could,put,up,a,cheap,salon,out,of,poor-grade,lumber,i,can't,sell,and,get,good,rent,for,it,and,with,the,rent,money,and,the,money,from,the,mill,and,what,i,could,get,from,mortgages,i,could,buy,some,more,sawmills
sugar,you,don't,need,any,more,sawmills
cried,frank,appalled
what,you,ought,to,do,is,sell,the,one,you've,got
it's,wearing,you,out,and,you,know,what,trouble,you,have,keeping,free,darkies,at,work,there
free,darkies,are,certainly,worthless,scarlett,agreed,completely,ignoring,his,hint,that,she,should,sell
mr,johnson,says,he,never,knows,when,he,comes,to,work,in,the,morning,whether,he'll,have,a,full,crew,or,not
you,just,can't,depend,on,the,darkies,any,more
they,work,a,day,or,two,and,then,lay,off,till,they've,spent,their,wages,and,the,whole,crew,is,like,as,not,to,quit,overnight
the,more,i,see,of,emancipation,the,more,criminal,i,think,it,is
it's,just,ruined,the,darkies
thousands,of,them,aren't,working,at,all,and,the,ones,we,can,get,to,work,at,the,mill,are,so,lazy,and,shiftless,they,aren't,worth,having
and,if,you,so,much,as,swear,at,them,much,less,hit,them,a,few,licks,for,the,good,of,their,souls,the,freedmen's,bureau,is,down,on,you,like,a,duck,on,a,june,bug
sugar,you,aren't,letting,mr,johnson,beat,those
of,course,not,she,returned,impatiently
didn't,i,just,say,the,yankees,would,put,me,in,jail,if,i,did
i'll,bet,your,pa,never,hit,a,darky,a,lick,in,his,life,said,frank
well,only,one
a,stable,boy,who,didn't,rub,down,his,horse,after,a,day's,hunt
but,frank,it,was,different,then
free,issue,niggers,are,something,else,and,a,good,whipping,would,do,some,of,them,a,lot,of,good
frank,was,not,only,amazed,at,his,wife's,views,and,her,plans,but,at,the,change,which,had,come,over,her,in,the,few,months,since,their,marriage
this,wasn't,the,soft,sweet,feminine,person,he,had,taken,to,wife
in,the,brief,period,of,the,courtship,he,thought,he,had,never,known,a,woman,more,attractively,feminine,in,her,reactions,to,life,ignorant,timid,and,helpless
now,her,reactions,were,all,masculine
despite,her,pink,cheeks,and,dimples,and,pretty,smiles,she,talked,and,acted,like,a,man
her,voice,was,brisk,and,decisive,and,she,made,up,her,mind,instantly,and,with,no,girlish,shilly-,shallying
she,knew,what,she,wanted,and,she,went,after,it,by,the,shortest,route,like,a,man,not,by,the,hidden,and,circuitous,routes,peculiar,to,women
it,was,not,that,frank,had,never,seen,commanding,women,before,this
atlanta,like,all,southern,towns,had,its,share,of,dowagers,whom,no,one,cared,to,cross
no,one,could,be,more,dominating,than,stout,mrs,merriwether,more,imperious,than,frail,mrs,elsing,more,artful,in,securing,her,own,ends,than,the,silver-haired,sweet-voiced,mrs,whiting
but,no,matter,what,devices,these,ladies,employed,in,order,to,get,their,own,way,they,were,always,feminine,devices
they,made,a,point,of,being,deferential,to,men's,opinions,whether,they,were,guided,by,them,or,not
they,had,the,politeness,to,appear,to,be,guided,by,what,men,said,and,that,was,what,mattered
but,scarlett,was,guided,by,no,one,but,herself,and,was,conducting,her,affairs,in,a,masculine,way,which,had,the,whole,town,talking,about,her
and,thought,frank,miserably,probably,talking,about,me,too,for,letting,her,act,so,unwomanly
then,there,was,that,butler,man
his,frequent,calls,at,aunt,pitty's,house,were,the,greatest,humiliation,of,all
frank,had,always,disliked,him,even,when,he,had,done,business,with,him,before,the,war
he,often,cursed,the,day,he,had,brought,rhett,to,twelve,oaks,and,introduced,him,to,his,friends
he,despised,him,for,the,cold-blooded,way,he,had,acted,in,his,speculations,during,the,war,and,for,the,fact,that,he,had,not,been,in,the,army
rhett's,eight,months',service,with,the,confederacy,was,known,only,to,scarlett,for,rhett,had,begged,her,with,mock,fear,not,to,reveal,his,shame,to,anyone
most,of,all,frank,had,contempt,for,him,for,holding,on,to,the,confederate,gold,when,honest,men,like,admiral,bulloch,and,others,confronted,with,the,same,situation,had,turned,back,thousands,to,the,federal,treasury
but,whether,frank,liked,it,or,not,rhett,was,a,frequent,caller
ostensibly,it,was,miss,pitty,he,came,to,see,and,she,had,no,better,sense,than,to,believe,it,and,give,herself,airs,over,his,visits
but,frank,had,an,uncomfortable,feeling,that,miss,pitty,was,not,the,attraction,which,brought,him
little,wade,was,very,fond,of,him,though,the,boy,was,shy,of,most,people,and,even,called,him,uncle,rhett,which,annoyed,frank
and,frank,could,not,help,remembering,that,rhett,had,squired,scarlett,about,during,the,war,days,and,there,had,been,talk,about,them,then
he,imagined,there,might,be,even,worse,talk,about,them,now
none,of,his,friends,had,the,courage,to,mention,anything,of,this,sort,to,frank,for,all,their,outspoken,words,on,scarlett's,conduct,in,the,matter,of,the,mill
but,he,could,not,help,noticing,that,he,and,scarlett,were,less,frequently,invited,to,meals,and,parties,and,fewer,and,fewer,people,came,to,call,on,them
scarlett,disliked,most,of,her,neighbors,and,was,too,busy,with,her,mill,to,care,about,seeing,the,ones,she,did,like,so,the,lack,of,calls,did,not,disturb,her
but,frank,felt,it,keenly
all,of,his,life,frank,had,been,under,the,domination,of,the,phrase,what,will,the,neighbors,say
and,he,was,defenseless,against,the,shocks,of,his,wife's,repeated,disregard,of,the,proprieties
he,felt,that,everyone,disapproved,of,scarlett,and,was,contemptuous,of,him,for,permitting,her,to,unsex,herself
she,did,so,many,things,a,husband,should,not,permit,according,to,his,views,but,if,he,ordered,her,to,stop,them,argued,or,even,criticized,a,storm,broke,on,his,head
my
my
he,thought,helplessly
she,can,get,mad,quicker,and,stay,mad,longer,than,any,woman,i,ever,saw
even,at,the,times,when,things,were,most,pleasant,it,was,amazing,how,completely,and,how,quickly,the,teasing,affectionate,wife,who,hummed,to,herself,as,she,went,about,the,house,could,be,transformed,into,an,entirely,different,person
he,had,only,to,say,sugar,if,i,were,you,i,wouldn't,and,the,tempest,would,break
her,black,brows,rushed,together,to,meet,in,a,sharp,angle,over,her,nose,and,frank,cowered,almost,visibly
she,had,the,temper,of,a,tartar,and,the,rages,of,a,wild,cat,and,at,such,times,she,did,not,seem,to,care,what,she,said,or,how,much,it,hurt
clouds,of,gloom,hung,over,the,house,on,such,occasions
frank,went,early,to,the,store,and,stayed,late
pitty,scrambled,into,her,bedroom,like,a,rabbit,panting,for,its,burrow
wade,and,uncle,peter,retired,to,the,carriage,house,and,cookie,kept,to,her,kitchen,and,forebore,to,raise,her,voice,to,praise,the,lord,in,song
only,mammy,endured,scarlett's,temper,with,equanimity,and,mammy,had,had,many,years,of,training,with,gerald,o'hara,and,his,explosions
scarlett,did,not,mean,to,be,short,tempered,and,she,really,wanted,to,make,frank,a,good,wife,for,she,was,fond,of,him,and,grateful,for,his,help,in,saving,tara
but,he,did,try,her,patience,to,the,breaking,point,so,often,and,in,so,many,different,ways
she,could,never,respect,a,man,who,let,her,run,over,him,and,the,timid,hesitant,attitude,he,displayed,in,any,unpleasant,situation,with,her,or,with,others,irritated,her,unbearably
but,she,could,have,overlooked,these,things,and,even,been,happy,now,that,some,of,her,money,problems,were,being,solved,except,for,her,constantly,renewed,exasperation,growing,out,of,the,many,incidents,which,showed,that,frank,was,neither,a,good,business,man,nor,did,he,want,her,to,be,a,good,business,man
as,she,expected,he,had,refused,to,collect,the,unpaid,bills,until,she,prodded,him,into,it,and,then,he,had,done,it,apologetically,and,half,heartedly
that,experience,was,the,final,evidence,she,needed,to,show,her,that,the,kennedy,family,would,never,have,more,than,a,bare,living,unless,she,personally,made,the,money,she,was,determined,to,have
she,knew,now,that,frank,would,be,contented,to,dawdle,along,with,his,dirty,little,store,for,the,rest,of,his,life
he,didn't,seem,to,realize,what,a,slender,fingerhold,they,had,on,security,and,how,important,it,was,to,make,more,money,in,these,troublous,times,when,money,was,the,only,protection,against,fresh,calamities
frank,might,have,been,a,successful,business,man,in,the,easy,days,before,the,war,but,he,was,so,annoyingly,old-fashioned,she,thought,and,so,stubborn,about,wanting,to,do,things,in,the,old,ways,when,the,old,ways,and,the,old,days,were,gone
he,was,utterly,lacking,in,the,aggressiveness,needed,in,these,new,bitter,times
well,she,had,the,aggressiveness,and,she,intended,to,use,it,whether,frank,liked,it,or,not
they,needed,money,and,she,was,making,money,and,it,was,hard,work
the,very,least,frank,could,do,in,her,opinion,was,not,to,interfere,with,her,plans,which,were,getting,results
with,her,inexperience,operating,the,new,mill,was,no,easy,job,and,competition,was,keener,now,than,it,had,been,at,first,so,she,was,usually,tired,and,worried,and,cross,when,she,came,home,at,nights
and,when,frank,would,cough,apologetically,and,say,sugar,i,wouldn't,do,this,or,i,wouldn't,do,that,sugar,if,i,were,you,it,was,all,she,could,do,to,restrain,herself,from,flying,into,a,rage,and,frequently,she,did,not,restrain,herself
if,he,didn't,have,the,gumption,to,get,out,and,make,some,money,why,was,he,always,finding,fault,with,her
and,the,things,he,nagged,her,about,were,so,silly
what,difference,did,it,make,in,times,like,these,if,she,was,being,unwomanly
especially,when,her,unwomanly,sawmill,was,bringing,in,money,they,needed,so,badly,she,and,the,family,and,tara,and,frank,too
frank,wanted,rest,and,quiet
the,war,in,which,he,had,served,so,conscientiously,had,wrecked,his,health,cost,him,his,fortune,and,made,him,an,old,man
he,regretted,none,of,these,things,and,after,four,years,of,war,all,he,asked,of,life,was,peace,and,kindliness,loving,faces,about,him,and,the,approval,of,friends
he,soon,found,that,domestic,peace,had,its,price,and,that,price,was,letting,scarlett,have,her,own,way,no,matter,what,she,might,wish,to,do
so,because,he,was,tired,he,bought,peace,at,her,own,terms
sometimes,he,thought,it,was,worth,it,to,have,her,smiling,when,she,opened,the,front,door,in,the,cold,twilights,kissing,him,on,the,ear,or,the,nose,or,some,other,inappropriate,place,to,feel,her,head,snuggling,drowsily,on,his,shoulder,at,night,under,warm,quilts
home,life,could,be,so,pleasant,when,scarlett,was,having,her,own,way
but,the,peace,he,gained,was,hollow,only,an,outward,semblance,for,he,had,purchased,it,at,the,cost,of,everything,he,held,to,be,right,in,married,life
a,woman,ought,to,pay,more,attention,to,her,home,and,her,family,and,not,be,gadding,about,like,a,man,he,thought
now,if,she,just,had,a,baby
he,smiled,when,he,thought,of,a,baby,and,he,thought,of,a,baby,very,often
scarlett,had,been,most,outspoken,about,not,wanting,a,child,but,then,babies,seldom,waited,to,be,invited
frank,knew,that,many,women,said,they,didn't,want,babies,but,that,was,all,foolishness,and,fear
if,scarlett,had,a,baby,she,would,love,it,and,be,content,to,stay,home,and,tend,it,like,other,women
then,she,would,be,forced,to,sell,the,mill,and,his,problems,would,be,ended
all,women,needed,babies,to,make,them,completely,happy,and,frank,knew,that,scarlett,was,not,happy
ignorant,as,he,was,of,women,he,was,not,so,blind,that,he,could,not,see,she,was,unhappy,at,times
sometimes,he,awoke,at,night,and,heard,the,soft,sound,of,tears,muffled,in,the,pillow
the,first,time,he,had,waked,to,feel,the,bed,shaking,with,her,sobbing,he,had,questioned,in,alarm,sugar,what,is,it
and,had,been,rebuked,by,a,passionate,cry,oh,let,me,alone
yes,a,baby,would,make,her,happy,and,would,take,her,mind,off,things,she,had,no,business,fooling,with
sometimes,frank,sighed,thinking,he,had,caught,a,tropic,bird,all,flame,and,jewel,color,when,a,wren,would,have,served,him,just,as,well
in,fact,much,better
chapter,xxxvii
it,was,on,a,wild,wet,night,in,april,that,tony,fontaine,rode,in,from,jonesboro,on,a,lathered,horse,that,was,half,dead,from,exhaustion,and,came,knocking,at,their,door,rousing,her,and,frank,from,sleep,with,their,hearts,in,their,throats
then,for,the,second,time,in,four,months,scarlett,was,made,to,feel,acutely,what,reconstruction,in,all,its,implications,meant,made,to,understand,more,completely,what,was,in,will's,mind,when,he,said,our,troubles,have,just,begun,to,know,that,the,bleak,words,of,ashley,spoken,in,the,wind-,swept,orchard,of,tara,were,true,this,that's,facing,all,of,us,is,worse,than,war,worse,than,prison,worse,than,death
the,first,time,she,had,come,face,to,face,with,reconstruction,was,when,she,learned,that,jonas,wilkerson,with,the,aid,of,the,yankees,could,evict,her,from,tara
but,tony's,advent,brought,it,all,home,to,her,in,a,far,more,terrifying,manner
tony,came,in,the,dark,and,the,lashing,rain,and,in,a,few,minutes,he,was,gone,back,into,the,night,forever,but,in,the,brief,interval,between,he,raised,the,curtain,on,a,scene,of,new,horror,a,curtain,that,she,felt,hopelessly,would,never,be,lowered,again
that,stormy,night,when,the,knocker,hammered,on,the,door,with,such,hurried,urgency,she,stood,on,the,landing,clutching,her,wrapper,to,her,and,looking,down,into,the,hall,below,had,one,glimpse,of,tony's,swarthy,saturnine,face,before,he,leaned,forward,and,blew,out,the,candle,in,frank's,hand
she,hurried,down,in,the,darkness,to,grasp,his,cold,wet,hand,and,hear,him,whisper,they're,after,me,going,to,texas,my,horse,is,about,dead,and,i'm,about,starved
ashley,said,you'd,don't,light,the,candle
don't,wake,the,darkies
i,don't,want,to,get,you,folks,in,trouble,if,i,can,help,it
with,the,kitchen,blinds,drawn,and,all,the,shades,pulled,down,to,the,sills,he,permitted,a,light,and,he,talked,to,frank,in,swift,jerky,sentences,as,scarlett,hurried,about,trying,to,scrape,together,a,meal,for,him
he,was,without,a,greatcoat,and,soaked,to,the,skin
he,was,hatless,and,his,black,hair,was,plastered,to,his,little,skull
but,the,merriment,of,the,fontaine,boys,a,chilling,merriment,that,night,was,in,his,little,dancing,eyes,as,he,gulped,down,the,whisky,she,brought,him
scarlett,thanked,god,that,aunt,pittypat,was,snoring,undisturbed,upstairs
she,would,certainly,swoon,if,she,saw,this,apparition
one,damned,bast,scallawag,less,said,tony,holding,out,his,glass,for,another,drink
i've,ridden,hard,and,it'll,cost,me,my,skin,if,i,don't,get,out,of,here,quick,but,it,was,worth,it
by,god,yes
i'm,going,to,try,to,get,to,texas,and,lay,low,there
ashley,was,with,me,in,jonesboro,and,he,told,me,to,come,to,you,all
got,to,have,another,horse,frank,and,some,money
my,horse,is,nearly,dead,all,the,way,up,here,at,a,dead,run,and,like,a,fool,i,went,out,of,the,house,today,like,a,bat,out,of,hell,without,a,coat,or,hat,or,a,cent,of,money
not,that,there's,much,money,in,our,house
he,laughed,and,applied,himself,hungrily,to,the,cold,corn,pone,and,cold,turnip,greens,on,which,congealed,grease,was,thick,in,white,flakes
you,can,have,my,horse,said,frank,calmly
i've,only,ten,dollars,with,me,but,if,you,can,wait,till,morning
hell's,afire,i,can't,wait
said,tony,emphatically,but,jovially
they're,probably,right,behind,me
i,didn't,get,much,of,a,start
if,it,hadn't,been,for,ashley,dragging,me,out,of,there,and,making,me,get,on,my,horse,i'd,have,stayed,there,like,a,fool,and,probably,had,my,neck,stretched,by,now
good,fellow,ashley
so,ashley,was,mixed,up,in,this,frightening,puzzle
scarlett,went,cold,her,hand,at,her,throat
did,the,yankees,have,ashley,now
why,why,didn't,frank,ask,what,it,was,all,about
why,did,he,take,it,all,so,coolly,so,much,as,a,matter,of,course
she,struggled,to,get,the,question,to,her,lips
what,she,began
who
your,father's,old,overseer,that,damned,jonas,wilkerson
did,you,is,he,dead
my,god,scarlett,o'hara
said,tony,peevishly
when,i,start,out,to,cut,somebody,up,you,don't,think,i'd,be,satisfied,with,scratching,him,with,the,blunt,side,of,my,knife,do,you
no,by,god,i,cut,him,to,ribbons
good,said,frank,casually
i,never,liked,the,fellow
scarlett,looked,at,him
this,was,not,the,meek,frank,she,knew,the,nervous,beard,clawer,who,she,had,learned,could,be,bullied,with,such,ease
there,was,an,air,about,him,that,was,crisp,and,cool,and,he,was,meeting,the,emergency,with,no,unnecessary,words
he,was,a,man,and,tony,was,a,man,and,this,situation,of,violence,was,men's,business,in,which,a,woman,had,no,part
but,ashley,did,he
no
he,wanted,to,kill,him,but,i,told,him,it,was,my,right,because,sally,is,my,sister-in-law,and,he,saw,reason,finally
he,went,into,jonesboro,with,me,in,case,wilkerson,got,me,first
but,i,don't,think,old,ash,will,get,in,any,trouble,about,it
i,hope,not
got,any,jam,for,this,corn,pone
and,can,you,wrap,me,up,something,to,take,with,me
i,shall,scream,if,you,don't,tell,me,everything
wait,till,i've,gone,and,then,scream,if,you've,got,to
i'll,tell,you,about,it,while,frank,saddles,the,horse
that,damned,wilkerson,has,caused,enough,trouble,already
i,know,how,he,did,you,about,your,taxes
that's,just,one,of,his,meannesses
but,the,worst,thing,was,the,way,he,kept,the,darkies,stirred,up
if,anybody,had,told,me,i'd,ever,live,to,see,the,day,when,i'd,hate,darkies
damn,their,black,souls,they,believe,anything,those,scoundrels,tell,them,and,forget,every,living,thing,we've,done,for,them
now,the,yankees,are,talking,about,letting,the,darkies,vote
and,they,won't,let,us,vote
why,there's,hardly,a,handful,of,democrats,in,the,whole,county,who,aren't,barred,from,voting,now,that,they've,ruled,out,every,man,who,fought,in,the,confederate,army
and,if,they,give,the,negroes,the,vote,it's,the,end,of,us
damn,it,it's,our,state
it,doesn't,belong,to,the,yankees
by,god,scarlett,it,isn't,to,be,borne
and,it,won't,be,borne
we'll,do,something,about,it,if,it,means,another,war
soon,we'll,be,having,nigger,judges,nigger,legislators,black,apes,out,of,the,jungle
please,hurry,tell,me
what,did,you,do
give,me,another,mite,of,that,pone,before,you,wrap,it,up
well,the,word,got,around,that,wilkerson,had,gone,a,bit,too,far,with,his,nigger-equality,business
oh,yes,he,talks,it,to,those,black,fools,by,the,hour
he,had,the,gall,the,tony,spluttered,helplessly,to,say,niggers,had,a,right,to,to,white,women
oh,tony,no
by,god,yes
i,don't,wonder,you,look,sick
but,hell's,afire,scarlett,it,can't,be,news,to,you
they've,been,telling,it,to,them,here,in,atlanta
i,i,didn't,know
well,frank,would,have,kept,it,from,you
anyway,after,that,we,all,sort,of,thought,we'd,call,on,mr,wilkerson,privately,by,night,and,tend,to,him,but,before,we,could,you,remember,that,black,buck,eustis,who,used,to,be,our,foreman
yes
came,to,the,kitchen,door,today,while,sally,was,fixing,dinner,and,i,don't,know,what,he,said,to,her
i,guess,i'll,never,know,now
but,he,said,something,and,i,heard,her,scream,and,i,ran,into,the,kitchen,and,there,he,was,drunk,as,a,fiddler's,bitch,i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett,it,just,slipped,out
go,on
i,shot,him,and,when,mother,ran,in,to,take,care,of,sally,i,got,my,horse,and,started,to,jonesboro,for,wilkerson
he,was,the,one,to,blame
the,damned,black,fool,would,never,have,thought,of,it,but,for,him
and,on,the,way,past,tara,i,met,ashley,and,of,course,he,went,with,me
he,said,to,let,him,do,it,because,of,the,way,wilkerson,acted,about,tara,and,i,said,no,it,was,my,place,because,sally,was,my,own,dead,brother's,wife,and,he,went,with,me,arguing,the,whole,way
and,when,we,got,to,town,by,god,scarlett,do,you,know,i,hadn't,even,brought,my,pistol,i'd,left,it,in,the,stable
so,mad,i,forgot
he,paused,and,gnawed,the,tough,pone,and,scarlett,shivered
the,murderous,rages,of,the,fontaines,had,made,county,history,long,before,this,chapter,had,opened
so,i,had,to,take,my,knife,to,him
i,found,him,in,the,barroom
i,got,him,in,a,corner,with,ashley,holding,back,the,others,and,i,told,him,why,before,i,lit,into,him
why,it,was,over,before,i,knew,it,said,tony,reflecting
first,thing,i,knew,ashley,had,me,on,my,horse,and,told,me,to,come,to,you,folks
ashley's,a,good,man,in,a,pinch
he,keeps,his,head
frank,came,in,his,greatcoat,over,his,arm,and,handed,it,to,tony
it,was,his,only,heavy,coat,but,scarlett,made,no,protest
she,seemed,so,much,on,the,outside,of,this,affair,this,purely,masculine,affair
but,tony,they,need,you,at,home
surely,if,you,went,back,and,explained
frank,you've,married,a,fool,said,tony,with,a,grin,struggling,into,the,coat
she,thinks,the,yankees,will,reward,a,man,for,keeping,niggers,off,his,women,folks
so,they,will,with,a,drumhead,court,and,a,rope
give,me,a,kiss,scarlett
frank,won't,mind,and,i,may,never,see,you,again
texas,is,a,long,way,off
i,won't,dare,write,so,let,the,home,folks,know,i,got,this,far,in,safety
she,let,him,kiss,her,and,the,two,men,went,out,into,the,driving,rain,and,stood,for,a,moment,talking,on,the,back,porch
then,she,heard,a,sudden,splashing,of,hooves,and,tony,was,gone
she,opened,the,door,a,crack,and,saw,frank,leading,a,heaving,stumbling,horse,into,the,carriage,house
she,shut,the,door,again,and,sat,down,her,knees,trembling
now,she,knew,what,reconstruction,meant,knew,as,well,as,if,the,house,were,ringed,about,by,naked,savages,squatting,in,breech,clouts
now,there,came,rushing,to,her,mind,many,things,to,which,she,had,given,little,thought,recently,conversations,she,had,heard,but,to,which,she,had,not,listened,masculine,talk,which,had,been,checked,half,finished,when,she,came,into,rooms,small,incidents,in,which,she,had,seen,no,significance,at,the,time,frank's,futile,warnings,to,her,against,driving,out,to,the,mill,with,only,the,feeble,uncle,peter,to,protect,her
now,they,fitted,themselves,together,into,one,horrifying,picture
the,negroes,were,on,top,and,behind,them,were,the,yankee,bayonets
she,could,be,killed,she,could,be,raped,and,very,probably,nothing,would,ever,be,done,about,it
and,anyone,who,avenged,her,would,be,hanged,by,the,yankees,hanged,without,benefit,of,trial,by,judge,and,jury
yankee,officers,who,knew,nothing,of,law,and,cared,less,for,the,circumstances,of,the,crime,could,go,through,the,motions,of,holding,a,trial,and,put,a,rope,around,a,southerner's,neck
what,can,we,do
she,thought,wringing,her,hands,in,an,agony,of,helpless,fear
what,can,we,do,with,devils,who'd,hang,a,nice,boy,like,tony,just,for,killing,a,drunken,buck,and,a,scoundrelly,scallawag,to,protect,his,women,folks
it,isn't,to,be,borne
tony,had,cried,and,he,was,right
it,couldn't,be,borne
but,what,could,they,do,except,bear,it,helpless,as,they,were
she,fell,to,trembling,and,for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,saw,people,and,events,as,something,apart,from,herself,saw,clearly,that,scarlett,o'hara,frightened,and,helpless,was,not,all,that,mattered
there,were,thousands,of,women,like,her,all,over,the,south,who,were,frightened,and,helpless
and,thousands,of,men,who,had,laid,down,their,arms,at,appomattox,had,taken,them,up,again,and,stood,ready,to,risk,their,necks,on,a,minute's,notice,to,protect,those,women
there,had,been,something,in,tony's,face,which,had,been,mirrored,in,frank's,an,expression,she,had,seen,recently,on,the,faces,of,other,men,in,atlanta,a,look,she,had,noticed,but,had,not,troubled,to,analyze
it,was,an,expression,vastly,different,from,the,tired,helplessness,she,had,seen,in,the,faces,of,men,coming,home,from,the,war,after,the,surrender
those,men,had,not,cared,about,anything,except,getting,home
now,they,were,caring,about,something,again,numbed,nerves,were,coming,back,to,life,and,the,old,spirit,was,beginning,to,burn
they,were,caring,again,with,a,cold,ruthless,bitterness
and,like,tony,they,were,thinking,it,isn't,to,be,borne
she,had,seen,southern,men,soft,voiced,and,dangerous,in,the,days,before,the,war,reckless,and,hard,in,the,last,despairing,days,of,the,fighting
but,in,the,faces,of,the,two,men,who,stared,at,each,other,across,the,candle,flame,so,short,a,while,ago,there,had,been,something,that,was,different,something,that,heartened,her,but,frightened,her,fury,which,could,find,no,words,determination,which,would,stop,at,nothing
for,the,first,time,she,felt,a,kinship,with,the,people,about,her,felt,one,with,them,in,their,fears,their,bitterness,their,determination
no,it,wasn't,to,be,borne
the,south,was,too,beautiful,a,place,to,be,let,go,without,a,struggle,too,loved,to,be,trampled,by,yankees,who,hated,southerners,enough,to,enjoy,grinding,them,into,the,dirt,too,dear,a,homeland,to,be,turned,over,to,ignorant,negroes,drunk,with,whisky,and,freedom
as,she,thought,of,tony's,sudden,entrance,and,swift,exit,she,felt,herself,akin,to,him,for,she,remembered,the,old,story,how,her,father,had,left,ireland,left,hastily,and,by,night,after,a,murder,which,was,no,murder,to,him,or,to,his,family
gerald's,blood,was,in,her,violent,blood
she,remembered,her,hot,joy,in,shooting,the,marauding,yankee
violent,blood,was,in,them,all,perilously,close,to,the,surface,lurking,just,beneath,the,kindly,courteous,exteriors
all,of,them,all,the,men,she,knew,even,the,drowsy-eyed,ashley,and,fidgety,old,frank,were,like,that,underneath,murderous,violent,if,the,need,arose
even,rhett,conscienceless,scamp,that,he,was,had,killed,a,negro,for,being,uppity,to,a,lady
oh,frank,how,long,will,it,be,like,this
she,leaped,to,her,feet
as,long,as,the,yankees,hate,us,so,sugar
is,there,nothing,anybody,can,do
frank,passed,a,tired,hand,over,his,wet,beard
we,are,doing,things
what
why,talk,of,them,till,we,have,accomplished,something
it,may,take,years
perhaps,perhaps,the,south,will,always,be,like,this
oh,no
sugar,come,to,bed
you,must,be,chilled
you,are,shaking
when,will,it,all,end
when,we,can,all,vote,again,sugar
when,every,man,who,fought,for,the,south,can,put,a,ballot,in,the,box,for,a,southerner,and,a,democrat
a,ballot
she,cried,despairingly
what,good's,a,ballot,when,the,darkies,have,lost,their,minds,when,the,yankees,have,poisoned,them,against,us
frank,went,on,to,explain,in,his,patient,manner,but,the,idea,that,ballots,could,cure,the,trouble,was,too,complicated,for,her,to,follow
she,was,thinking,gratefully,that,jonas,wilkerson,would,never,again,be,a,menace,of,tara,and,she,was,thinking,about,tony
oh,the,poor,fontaines
she,exclaimed
only,alex,left,and,so,much,to,do,at,mimosa
why,didn't,tony,have,sense,enough,to,to,do,it,at,night,when,no,one,would,know,who,it,was
a,sight,more,good,he'd,do,helping,with,the,spring,plowing,than,in,texas
frank,put,an,arm,about,her
usually,he,was,gingerly,when,he,did,this,as,if,he,anticipated,being,impatiently,shaken,off,but,tonight,there,was,a,far-off,look,in,his,eyes,and,his,arm,was,firm,about,her,waist
there,are,things,more,important,now,than,plowing,sugar
and,scaring,the,darkies,and,teaching,the,scallawags,a,lesson,is,one,of,them
as,long,as,there,are,fine,boys,like,tony,left,i,guess,we,won't,need,to,worry,about,the,south,too,much
come,to,bed
but,frank
if,we,just,stand,together,and,don't,give,an,inch,to,the,yankees,we'll,win,some,day
don't,you,bother,your,pretty,head,about,it,sugar
you,let,your,men,folks,worry,about,it
maybe,it,won't,come,in,our,time,but,surely,it,will,come,some,day
the,yankees,will,get,tired,of,pestering,us,when,they,see,they,can't,even,dent,us,and,then,we'll,have,a,decent,world,to,live,in,and,raise,our,children,in
she,thought,of,wade,and,the,secret,she,had,carried,silently,for,some,days
no,she,didn't,want,her,children,raised,in,this,welter,of,hate,and,uncertainty,of,bitterness,and,violence,lurking,just,below,the,surface,of,poverty,and,grinding,hardships,and,insecurity
she,never,wanted,children,of,hers,to,know,what,all,this,was,like
she,wanted,a,secure,and,well-ordered,world,in,which,she,could,look,forward,and,know,there,was,a,safe,future,ahead,for,them,a,world,where,her,children,would,know,only,softness,and,warmth,and,good,clothes,and,fine,food
frank,thought,this,could,be,accomplished,by,voting
voting
what,did,votes,matter
nice,people,in,the,south,would,never,have,the,vote,again
there,was,only,one,thing,in,the,world,that,was,a,certain,bulwark,against,any,calamity,which,fate,could,bring,and,that,was,money
she,thought,feverishly,that,they,must,have,money,lots,of,it,to,keep,them,safe,against,disaster
abruptly,she,told,him,she,was,going,to,have,a,baby
for,weeks,after,tony's,escape,aunt,pitty's,house,was,subjected,to,repeated,searches,by,parties,of,yankee,soldiers
they,invaded,the,house,at,all,hours,and,without,warning
they,swarmed,through,the,rooms,asking,questions,opening,closets,prodding,clothes,hampers,peering,under,beds
the,military,authorities,had,heard,that,tony,had,been,advised,to,go,to,miss,pitty's,house,and,they,were,certain,he,was,still,hiding,there,or,somewhere,in,the,neighborhood
as,a,result,aunt,pitty,was,chronically,in,what,uncle,peter,called,a,state,never,knowing,when,her,bedroom,would,be,entered,by,an,officer,and,a,squad,of,men
neither,frank,nor,scarlett,had,mentioned,tony's,brief,visit,so,the,old,lady,could,have,revealed,nothing,even,had,she,been,so,inclined
she,was,entirely,honest,in,her,fluttery,protestations,that,she,had,seen,tony,fontaine,only,once,in,her,life,and,that,was,at,christmas,time,in,1862
and,she,would,add,breathlessly,to,the,yankee,soldiers,in,an,effort,to,be,helpful,he,was,quite,intoxicated,at,the,time
scarlett,sick,and,miserable,in,the,early,stage,of,pregnancy,alternated,between,a,passionate,hatred,of,the,bluecoats,who,invaded,her,privacy,frequently,carrying,away,any,little,knick-knack,that,appealed,to,them,and,an,equally,passionate,fear,that,tony,might,prove,the,undoing,of,them,all
the,prisons,were,full,of,people,who,had,been,arrested,for,much,less,reason
she,knew,that,if,one,iota,of,the,truth,were,proved,against,them,not,only,she,and,frank,but,the,innocent,pitty,as,well,would,go,to,jail
for,some,time,there,had,been,an,agitation,in,washington,to,confiscate,all,rebel,property,to,pay,the,united,states',war,debt,and,this,agitation,had,kept,scarlett,in,a,state,of,anguished,apprehension
now,in,addition,to,this,atlanta,was,full,of,wild,rumors,about,the,confiscation,of,property,of,offenders,against,military,law,and,scarlett,quaked,lest,she,and,frank,lose,not,only,their,freedom,but,the,house,the,store,and,the,mill
and,even,if,their,property,were,not,appropriated,by,the,military,it,would,be,as,good,as,lost,if,she,and,frank,went,to,jail,for,who,would,look,after,their,business,in,their,absence
she,hated,tony,for,bringing,such,trouble,upon,them
how,could,he,have,done,such,a,thing,to,friends
and,how,could,ashley,have,sent,tony,to,them
never,again,would,she,give,aid,to,anyone,if,it,meant,having,the,yankees,come,down,on,her,like,a,swarm,of,hornets
no,she,would,bar,the,door,against,anyone,needing,help
except,of,course,ashley
for,weeks,after,tony's,brief,visit,she,woke,from,uneasy,dreams,at,any,sound,in,the,road,outside,fearing,it,might,be,ashley,trying,to,make,his,escape,fleeing,to,texas,because,of,the,aid,he,had,given,tony
she,did,not,know,how,matters,stood,with,him,for,they,did,not,dare,write,to,tara,about,tony's,midnight,visit
their,letters,might,be,intercepted,by,the,yankees,and,bring,trouble,upon,the,plantation,as,well
but,when,weeks,went,by,and,they,heard,no,bad,news,they,knew,that,ashley,had,somehow,come,clear
and,finally,the,yankees,ceased,annoying,them
but,even,this,relief,did,not,free,scarlett,from,the,state,of,dread,which,began,when,tony,came,knocking,at,their,door,a,dread,which,was,worse,than,the,quaking,fear,of,the,siege,shells,worse,even,than,the,terror,of,sherman's,men,during,the,last,days,of,the,war
it,was,as,if,tony's,appearance,that,wild,rainy,night,had,stripped,merciful,blinders,from,her,eyes,and,forced,her,to,see,the,true,uncertainty,of,her,life
looking,about,her,in,that,cold,spring,of,1866,scarlett,realized,what,was,facing,her,and,the,whole,south
she,might,plan,and,scheme,she,might,work,harder,than,her,slaves,had,ever,worked,she,might,succeed,in,overcoming,all,of,her,hardships,she,might,through,dint,of,determination,solve,problems,for,which,her,earlier,life,had,provided,no,training,at,all
but,for,all,her,labor,and,sacrifice,and,resourcefulness,her,small,beginnings,purchased,at,so,great,a,cost,might,be,snatched,away,from,her,at,any,minute
and,should,this,happen,she,had,no,legal,rights,no,legal,redress,except,those,same,drumhead,courts,of,which,tony,had,spoken,so,bitterly,those,military,courts,with,their,arbitrary,powers
only,the,negroes,had,rights,or,redress,these,days
the,yankees,had,the,south,prostrate,and,they,intended,to,keep,it,so
the,south,had,been,tilted,as,by,a,giant,malicious,hand,and,those,who,had,once,ruled,were,now,more,helpless,than,their,former,slaves,had,ever,been
georgia,was,heavily,garrisoned,with,troops,and,atlanta,had,more,than,its,share
the,commandants,of,the,yankee,troops,in,the,various,cities,had,complete,power,even,the,power,of,life,and,death,over,the,civilian,population,and,they,used,that,power
they,could,and,did,imprison,citizens,for,any,cause,or,no,cause,seize,their,property,hang,them
they,could,and,did,harass,and,hamstring,them,with,conflicting,regulations,about,the,operation,of,their,business,the,wages,they,must,pay,their,servants,what,they,should,say,in,public,and,private,utterances,and,what,they,should,write,in,newspapers
they,regulated,how,when,and,where,they,must,dump,their,garbage,and,they,decided,what,songs,the,daughters,and,wives,of,ex-confederates,could,sing,so,that,the,singing,of,dixie,or,bonnie,blue,flag,became,an,offense,only,a,little,less,serious,than,treason
they,ruled,that,no,one,could,get,a,letter,out,of,the,post,office,without,taking,the,iron,clad,oath,and,in,some,instances,they,even,prohibited,the,issuance,of,marriage,licenses,unless,the,couples,had,taken,the,hated,oath
the,newspapers,were,so,muzzled,that,no,public,protest,could,be,raised,against,the,injustices,or,depredations,of,the,military,and,individual,protests,were,silenced,with,jail,sentences
the,jails,were,full,of,prominent,citizens,and,there,they,stayed,without,hope,of,early,trial
trial,by,jury,and,the,law,of,habeas,corpus,were,practically,suspended
the,civil,courts,still,functioned,after,a,fashion,but,they,functioned,at,the,pleasure,of,the,military,who,could,and,did,interfere,with,their,verdicts,so,that,citizens,so,unfortunate,as,to,get,arrested,were,virtually,at,the,mercy,of,the,military,authorities
and,so,many,did,get,arrested
the,very,suspicion,of,seditious,utterances,against,the,government,suspected,complicity,in,the,ku,klux,klan,or,complaint,by,a,negro,that,a,white,man,had,been,uppity,to,him,were,enough,to,land,a,citizen,in,jail
proof,and,evidence,were,not,needed
the,accusation,was,sufficient
and,thanks,to,the,incitement,of,the,freedmen's,bureau,negroes,could,always,be,found,who,were,willing,to,bring,accusations
the,negroes,had,not,yet,been,given,the,right,to,vote,but,the,north,was,determined,that,they,should,vote,and,equally,determined,that,their,vote,should,be,friendly,to,the,north
with,this,in,mind,nothing,was,too,good,for,the,negroes
the,yankee,soldiers,backed,them,up,in,anything,they,chose,to,do,and,the,surest,way,for,a,white,person,to,get,himself,into,trouble,was,to,bring,a,complaint,of,any,kind,against,a,negro
the,former,slaves,were,now,the,lords,of,creation,and,with,the,aid,of,the,yankees,the,lowest,and,most,ignorant,ones,were,on,top
the,better,class,of,them,scorning,freedom,were,suffering,as,severely,as,their,white,masters
thousands,of,house,servants,the,highest,caste,in,the,slave,population,remained,with,their,white,folks,doing,manual,labor,which,had,been,beneath,them,in,the,old,days
many,loyal,field,hands,also,refused,to,avail,themselves,of,the,new,freedom,but,the,hordes,of,trashy,free,issue,niggers,who,were,causing,most,of,the,trouble,were,drawn,largely,from,the,field-hand,class
in,slave,days,these,lowly,blacks,had,been,despised,by,the,house,negroes,and,yard,negroes,as,creatures,of,small,worth
just,as,ellen,had,done,other,plantation,mistresses,throughout,the,south,had,put,the,pickaninnies,through,courses,of,training,and,elimination,to,select,the,best,of,them,for,the,positions,of,greater,responsibility
those,consigned,to,the,fields,were,the,ones,least,willing,or,able,to,learn,the,least,energetic,the,least,honest,and,trustworthy,the,most,vicious,and,brutish
and,now,this,class,the,lowest,in,the,black,social,order,was,making,life,a,misery,for,the,south
aided,by,the,unscrupulous,adventurers,who,operated,the,freedmen's,bureau,and,urged,on,by,a,fervor,of,northern,hatred,almost,religious,in,its,fanaticism,the,former,field,hands,found,themselves,suddenly,elevated,to,the,seats,of,the,mighty
there,they,conducted,themselves,as,creatures,of,small,intelligence,might,naturally,be,expected,to,do
like,monkeys,or,small,children,turned,loose,among,treasured,objects,whose,value,is,beyond,their,comprehension,they,ran,wild,either,from,perverse,pleasure,in,destruction,or,simply,because,of,their,ignorance
to,the,credit,of,the,negroes,including,the,least,intelligent,of,them,few,were,actuated,by,malice,and,those,few,had,usually,been,mean,niggers,even,in,slave,days
but,they,were,as,a,class,childlike,in,mentality,easily,led,and,from,long,habit,accustomed,to,taking,orders
formerly,their,white,masters,had,given,the,orders
now,they,had,a,new,set,of,masters,the,bureau,and,the,carpetbaggers,and,their,orders,were,you're,just,as,good,as,any,white,man,so,act,that,way
just,as,soon,as,you,can,vote,the,republican,ticket,you,are,going,to,have,the,white,man's,property
it's,as,good,as,yours,now
take,it,if,you,can,get,it
dazzled,by,these,tales,freedom,became,a,never-ending,picnic,a,barbecue,every,day,of,the,week,a,carnival,of,idleness,and,theft,and,insolence
country,negroes,flocked,into,the,cities,leaving,the,rural,districts,without,labor,to,make,the,crops
atlanta,was,crowded,with,them,and,still,they,came,by,the,hundreds,lazy,and,dangerous,as,a,result,of,the,new,doctrines,being,taught,them
packed,into,squalid,cabins,smallpox,typhoid,and,tuberculosis,broke,out,among,them
accustomed,to,the,care,of,their,mistresses,when,they,were,ill,in,slave,days,they,did,not,know,how,to,nurse,themselves,or,their,sick
relying,upon,their,masters,in,the,old,days,to,care,for,their,aged,and,their,babies,they,now,had,no,sense,of,responsibility,for,their,helpless
and,the,bureau,was,far,too,interested,in,political,matters,to,provide,the,care,the,plantation,owners,had,once,given
abandoned,negro,children,ran,like,frightened,animals,about,the,town,until,kind-hearted,white,people,took,them,into,their,kitchens,to,raise
aged,country,darkies,deserted,by,their,children,bewildered,and,panic,stricken,in,the,bustling,town,sat,on,the,curbs,and,cried,to,the,ladies,who,passed,mistis,please,ma'm,write,mah,old,marster,down,in,fayette,county,dat,ah's,up,hyah

the,freedmen's,bureau,overwhelmed,by,the,numbers,who,poured,in,upon,them,realized,too,late,a,part,of,the,mistake,and,tried,to,send,them,back,to,their,former,owners
they,told,the,negroes,that,if,they,would,go,back,they,would,go,as,free,workers,protected,by,written,contracts,specifying,wages,by,the,day
the,old,darkies,went,back,to,the,plantations,gladly,making,a,heavier,burden,than,ever,on,the,poverty-stricken,planters,who,had,not,the,heart,to,turn,them,out,but,the,young,ones,remained,in,atlanta
they,did,not,want,to,be,workers,of,any,kind,anywhere
why,work,when,the,belly,is,full
for,the,first,time,in,their,lives,the,negroes,were,able,to,get,all,the,whisky,they,might,want
in,slave,days,it,was,something,they,never,tasted,except,at,christmas,when,each,one,received,a,drap,along,with,his,gift
now,they,had,not,only,the,bureau,agitators,and,the,carpetbaggers,urging,them,on,but,the,incitement,of,whisky,as,well,and,outrages,were,inevitable
neither,life,nor,property,was,safe,from,them,and,the,white,people,unprotected,by,law,were,terrorized
men,were,insulted,on,the,streets,by,drunken,blacks,houses,and,barns,were,burned,at,night,horses,and,cattle,and,chickens,stolen,in,broad,daylight,crimes,of,all,varieties,were,committed,and,few,of,the,perpetrators,were,brought,to,justice
but,these,ignominies,and,dangers,were,as,nothing,compared,with,the,peril,of,white,women,many,bereft,by,the,war,of,male,protection,who,lived,alone,in,the,outlying,districts,and,on,lonely,roads
it,was,the,large,number,of,outrages,on,women,and,the,ever-present,fear,for,the,safety,of,their,wives,and,daughters,that,drove,southern,men,to,cold,and,trembling,fury,and,caused,the,ku,klux,klan,to,spring,up,overnight
and,it,was,against,this,nocturnal,organization,that,the,newspapers,of,the,north,cried,out,most,loudly,never,realizing,the,tragic,necessity,that,brought,it,into,being
the,north,wanted,every,member,of,the,ku,klux,hunted,down,and,hanged,because,they,had,dared,take,the,punishment,of,crime,into,their,own,hands,at,a,time,when,the,ordinary,processes,of,law,and,order,had,been,overthrown,by,the,invaders
here,was,the,astonishing,spectacle,of,half,a,nation,attempting,at,the,point,of,bayonet,to,force,upon,the,other,half,the,rule,of,negroes,many,of,them,scarcely,one,generation,out,of,the,african,jungles
the,vote,must,be,given,to,them,but,it,must,be,denied,to,most,of,their,former,owners
the,south,must,be,kept,down,and,disfranchisement,of,the,whites,was,one,way,to,keep,the,south,down
most,of,those,who,had,fought,for,the,confederacy,held,office,under,it,or,given,aid,and,comfort,to,it,were,not,allowed,to,vote,had,no,choice,in,the,selection,of,their,public,officials,and,were,wholly,under,the,power,of,an,alien,rule
many,men,thinking,soberly,of,general,lee's,words,and,example,wished,to,take,the,oath,become,citizens,again,and,forget,the,past
but,they,were,not,permitted,to,take,it
others,who,were,permitted,to,take,the,oath,hotly,refused,to,do,so,scorning,to,swear,allegiance,to,a,government,which,was,deliberately,subjecting,them,to,cruelty,and,humiliation
scarlett,heard,over,and,over,until,she,could,have,screamed,at,the,repetition,i'd,have,taken,their,damned,oath,right,after,the,surrender,if,they'd,acted,decent
i,can,be,restored,to,the,union,but,by,god,i,can't,be,reconstructed,into,it
through,these,anxious,days,and,nights,scarlett,was,torn,with,fear
the,ever-present,menace,of,lawless,negroes,and,yankee,soldiers,preyed,on,her,mind,the,danger,of,confiscation,was,constantly,with,her,even,in,her,dreams,and,she,dreaded,worse,terrors,to,come
depressed,by,the,helplessness,of,herself,and,her,friends,of,the,whole,south,it,was,not,strange,that,she,often,remembered,during,these,days,the,words,which,tony,fontaine,had,spoken,so,passionately
good,god,scarlett,it,isn't,to,be,borne
and,it,won't,be,borne
in,spite,of,war,fire,and,reconstruction,atlanta,had,again,become,a,boom,town
in,many,ways,the,place,resembled,the,busy,young,city,of,the,confederacy's,early,days
the,only,trouble,was,that,the,soldiers,crowding,the,streets,wore,the,wrong,kind,of,uniforms,the,money,was,in,the,hands,of,the,wrong,people,and,the,negroes,were,living,in,leisure,while,their,former,masters,struggled,and,starved
underneath,the,surface,were,misery,and,fear,but,all,the,outward,appearances,were,those,of,a,thriving,town,that,was,rapidly,rebuilding,from,its,ruins,a,bustling,hurrying,town
atlanta,it,seemed,must,always,be,hurrying,no,matter,what,its,circumstances,might,be
savannah,charleston,augusta,richmond,new,orleans,would,never,hurry
it,was,ill,bred,and,yankeefied,to,hurry
but,in,this,period,atlanta,was,more,ill,bred,and,yankeefied,than,it,had,ever,been,before,or,would,ever,be,again
with,new,people,thronging,in,from,all,directions,the,streets,were,choked,and,noisy,from,morning,till,night
the,shiny,carriages,of,yankee,officers',wives,and,newly,rich,carpetbaggers,splashed,mud,on,the,dilapidated,buggies,of,the,townspeople,and,gaudy,new,homes,of,wealthy,strangers,crowded,in,among,the,sedate,dwellings,of,older,citizens
the,war,had,definitely,established,the,importance,of,atlanta,in,the,affairs,of,the,south,and,the,hitherto,obscure,town,was,now,known,far,and,wide
the,railroads,for,which,sherman,had,fought,an,entire,summer,and,killed,thousands,of,men,were,again,stimulating,the,life,of,the,city,they,had,brought,into,being
atlanta,was,again,the,center,of,activities,for,a,wide,region,as,it,had,been,before,its,destruction,and,the,town,was,receiving,a,great,influx,of,new,citizens,both,welcome,and,unwelcome
invading,carpetbaggers,made,atlanta,their,headquarters,and,on,the,streets,they,jostled,against,representatives,of,the,oldest,families,in,the,south,who,were,likewise,newcomers,in,the,town
families,from,the,country,districts,who,had,been,burned,out,during,sherman's,march,and,who,could,no,longer,make,a,living,without,the,slaves,to,till,the,cotton,had,come,to,atlanta,to,live
new,settlers,were,coming,in,every,day,from,tennessee,and,the,carolinas,where,the,hand,of,reconstruction,lay,even,heavier,than,in,georgia
many,irish,and,germans,who,had,been,bounty,men,in,the,union,army,had,settled,in,atlanta,after,their,discharge
the,wives,and,families,of,the,yankee,garrison,filled,with,curiosity,about,the,south,after,four,years,of,war,came,to,swell,the,population
adventurers,of,every,kind,swarmed,in,hoping,to,make,their,fortunes,and,the,negroes,from,the,country,continued,to,come,by,the,hundreds
the,town,was,roaring,wide,open,like,a,frontier,village,making,no,effort,to,cover,its,vices,and,sins
saloons,blossomed,overnight,two,and,sometimes,three,in,a,block,and,after,nightfall,the,streets,were,full,of,drunken,men,black,and,white,reeling,from,wall,to,curb,and,back,again
thugs,pickpockets,and,prostitutes,lurked,in,the,unlit,alleys,and,shadowy,streets
gambling,houses,ran,full,blast,and,hardly,a,night,passed,without,its,shooting,or,cutting,affray
respectable,citizens,were,scandalized,to,find,that,atlanta,had,a,large,and,thriving,red-light,district,larger,and,more,thriving,than,during,the,war
all,night,long,pianos,jangled,from,behind,drawn,shades,and,rowdy,songs,and,laughter,floated,out,punctuated,by,occasional,screams,and,pistol,shots
the,inmates,of,these,houses,were,bolder,than,the,prostitutes,of,the,war,days,and,brazenly,hung,out,of,their,windows,and,called,to,passers-by
and,on,sunday,afternoons,the,handsome,closed,carriages,of,the,madams,of,the,district,rolled,down,the,main,streets,filled,with,girls,in,their,best,finery,taking,the,air,from,behind,lowered,silk,shades
belle,watling,was,the,most,notorious,of,the,madams
she,had,opened,a,new,house,of,her,own,a,large,two-story,building,that,made,neighboring,houses,in,the,district,look,like,shabby,rabbit,warrens
there,was,a,long,barroom,downstairs,elegantly,hung,with,oil,paintings,and,a,negro,orchestra,played,every,night
the,upstairs,so,rumor,said,was,fitted,out,with,the,finest,of,plush,upholstered,furniture,heavy,lace,curtains,and,imported,mirrors,in,gilt,frames
the,dozen,young,ladies,with,whom,the,house,was,furnished,were,comely,if,brightly,painted,and,comported,themselves,more,quietly,than,those,of,other,houses
at,least,the,police,were,seldom,summoned,to,belle's
this,house,was,something,that,the,matrons,of,atlanta,whispered,about,furtively,and,ministers,preached,against,in,guarded,terms,as,a,cesspool,of,iniquity,a,hissing,and,a,reproach
everyone,knew,that,a,woman,of,belle's,type,couldn't,have,made,enough,money,by,herself,to,set,up,such,a,luxurious,establishment
she,had,to,have,a,backer,and,a,rich,one,at,that
and,rhett,butler,had,never,had,the,decency,to,conceal,his,relations,with,her,so,it,was,obvious,that,he,and,no,other,must,be,that,backer
belle,herself,presented,a,prosperous,appearance,when,glimpsed,occasionally,in,her,closed,carriage,driven,by,an,impudent,yellow,negro
when,she,drove,by,behind,a,fine,pair,of,bays,all,the,little,boys,along,the,street,who,could,evade,their,mothers,ran,to,peer,at,her,and,whisper,excitedly,that's,her
that's,ole,belle

shouldering,the,shell-pitted,houses,patched,with,bits,of,old,lumber,and,smoke-blackened,bricks,the,fine,homes,of,the,carpetbaggers,and,war,profiteers,were,rising,with,mansard,roofs,gables,and,turrets,stained-glass,windows,and,wide,lawns
night,after,night,in,these,newly,built,homes,the,windows,were,ablaze,with,gas,light,and,the,sound,of,music,and,dancing,feet,drifted,out,upon,the,air
women,in,stiff,bright-colored,silks,strolled,about,long,verandas,squired,by,men,in,evening,clothes
champagne,corks,popped,and,on,lace,tablecloths,seven-course,dinners,were,laid
hams,in,wine,pressed,duck,pate,de,foie,gras,rare,fruits,in,and,out,of,season,were,spread,in,profusion
behind,the,shabby,doors,of,the,old,houses,poverty,and,hunger,lived,all,the,more,bitter,for,the,brave,gentility,with,which,they,were,borne,all,the,more,pinching,for,the,outward,show,of,proud,indifference,to,material,wants
dr,meade,could,tell,unlovely,stories,of,those,families,who,had,been,driven,from,mansions,to,boarding,houses,and,from,boarding,houses,to,dingy,rooms,on,back,streets
he,had,too,many,lady,patients,who,were,suffering,from,weak,hearts,and,declines
he,knew,and,they,knew,he,knew,that,slow,starvation,was,the,trouble
he,could,tell,of,consumption,making,inroads,on,entire,families,and,of,pellagra,once,found,only,among,poor,whites,which,was,now,appearing,in,atlanta's,best,families
and,there,were,babies,with,thin,rickety,legs,and,mothers,who,could,not,nurse,them
once,the,old,doctor,had,been,wont,to,thank,god,reverently,for,each,child,he,brought,into,the,world
now,he,did,not,think,life,was,such,a,boon
it,was,a,hard,world,for,little,babies,and,so,many,died,in,their,first,few,months,of,life

chapter,xxxviii
scarlett,saw,it,all,lived,with,it,by,day,took,it,to,bed,with,her,at,night,dreading,always,what,might,happen,next
she,knew,that,she,and,frank,were,already,in,the,yankees',black,books,because,of,tony,and,disaster,might,descend,on,them,at,any,hour
but,now,of,all,times,she,could,not,afford,to,be,pushed,back,to,her,beginnings,not,now,with,a,baby,coming,the,mill,just,commencing,to,pay,and,tara,depending,on,her,for,money,until,the,cotton,came,in,in,the,fall
oh,suppose,she,should,lose,everything
suppose,she,should,have,to,start,all,over,again,with,only,her,puny,weapons,against,this,mad,world
to,have,to,pit,her,red,lips,and,green,eyes,and,her,shrewd,shallow,brain,against,the,yankees,and,everything,the,yankees,stood,for
weary,with,dread,she,felt,that,she,would,rather,kill,herself,than,try,to,make,a,new,beginning
in,the,ruin,and,chaos,of,that,spring,of,1866,she,single,mindedly,turned,her,energies,to,making,the,mill,pay
there,was,money,in,atlanta
the,wave,of,rebuilding,was,giving,her,the,opportunity,she,wanted,and,she,knew,she,could,make,money,if,only,she,could,stay,out,of,jail
but,she,told,herself,time,and,again,she,would,have,to,walk,easily,gingerly,be,meek,under,insults,yielding,to,injustices,never,giving,offense,to,anyone,black,or,white,who,might,do,her,harm
she,hated,the,impudent,free,negroes,as,much,as,anyone,and,her,flesh,crawled,with,fury,every,time,she,heard,their,insulting,remarks,and,high-pitched,laughter,as,she,went,by
but,she,never,even,gave,them,a,glance,of,contempt
she,hated,the,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,who,were,getting,rich,with,ease,while,she,struggled,but,she,said,nothing,in,condemnation,of,them
no,one,in,atlanta,could,have,loathed,the,yankees,more,than,she,for,the,very,sight,of,a,blue,uniform,made,her,sick,with,rage,but,even,in,the,privacy,of,her,family,she,kept,silent,about,them
i,won't,be,a,big-mouthed,fool,she,thought,grimly
let,others,break,their,hearts,over,the,old,days,and,the,men,who'll,never,come,back
let,others,burn,with,fury,over,the,yankee,rule,and,losing,the,ballot
let,others,go,to,jail,for,speaking,their,minds,and,get,themselves,hanged,for,being,in,the,ku,klux,klan
oh,what,a,dreaded,name,that,was,almost,as,terrifying,to,scarlett,as,to,the,negroes
let,other,women,be,proud,that,their,husbands,belonged
thank,god,frank,had,never,been,mixed,up,in,it
let,others,stew,and,fume,and,plot,and,plan,about,things,they,could,not,help
what,did,the,past,matter,compared,with,the,tense,present,and,the,dubious,future
what,did,the,ballot,matter,when,bread,a,roof,and,staying,out,of,jail,were,the,real,problems
and,please,god,just,let,me,stay,out,of,trouble,until,june
only,till,june
by,that,month,scarlett,knew,she,would,be,forced,to,retire,into,aunt,pitty's,house,and,remain,secluded,there,until,after,her,child,was,born
already,people,were,criticizing,her,for,appearing,in,public,when,she,was,in,such,a,condition
no,lady,ever,showed,herself,when,she,was,pregnant
already,frank,and,pitty,were,begging,her,not,to,expose,herself,and,them,to,embarrassment,and,she,had,promised,them,to,stop,work,in,june
only,till,june
by,june,she,must,have,the,mill,well,enough,established,for,her,to,leave,it
by,june,she,must,have,money,enough,to,give,her,at,least,some,little,protection,against,misfortune
so,much,to,do,and,so,little,time,to,do,it
she,wished,for,more,hours,of,the,day,and,counted,the,minutes,as,she,strained,forward,feverishly,in,her,pursuit,of,money,and,still,more,money
because,she,nagged,the,timid,frank,the,store,was,doing,better,now,and,he,was,even,collecting,some,of,the,old,bills
but,it,was,the,sawmill,on,which,her,hopes,were,pinned
atlanta,these,days,was,like,a,giant,plant,which,had,been,cut,to,the,ground,but,now,was,springing,up,again,with,sturdier,shoots,thicker,foliage,more,numerous,branches
the,demand,for,building,materials,was,far,greater,than,could,be,supplied
prices,of,lumber,brick,and,stone,soared,and,scarlett,kept,the,mill,running,from,dawn,until,lantern,light
a,part,of,every,day,she,spent,at,the,mill,prying,into,everything,doing,her,best,to,check,the,thievery,she,felt,sure,was,going,on
but,most,of,the,time,she,was,riding,about,the,town,making,the,rounds,of,builders,contractors,and,carpenters,even,calling,on,strangers,she,had,heard,might,build,at,future,dates,cajoling,them,into,promises,of,buying,from,her,and,her,only
soon,she,was,a,familiar,sight,on,atlanta's,streets,sitting,in,her,buggy,beside,the,dignified,disapproving,old,darky,driver,a,lap,robe,pulled,high,about,her,her,little,mittened,hands,clasped,in,her,lap
aunt,pitty,had,made,her,a,pretty,green,mantelet,which,hid,her,figure,and,a,green,pancake,hat,which,matched,her,eyes,and,she,always,wore,these,becoming,garments,on,her,business,calls
a,faint,dab,of,rouge,on,her,cheeks,and,a,fainter,fragrance,of,cologne,made,her,a,charming,picture,as,long,as,she,did,not,alight,from,the,buggy,and,show,her,figure
and,there,was,seldom,any,need,for,this,for,she,smiled,and,beckoned,and,the,men,came,quickly,to,the,buggy,and,frequently,stood,bareheaded,in,the,rain,to,talk,business,with,her
she,was,not,the,only,one,who,had,seen,the,opportunities,for,making,money,out,of,lumber,but,she,did,not,fear,her,competitors
she,knew,with,conscious,pride,in,her,own,smartness,that,she,was,the,equal,of,any,of,them
she,was,gerald's,own,daughter,and,the,shrewd,trading,instinct,she,had,inherited,was,now,sharpened,by,her,needs
at,first,the,other,dealers,had,laughed,at,her,laughed,with,good-,natured,contempt,at,the,very,idea,of,a,woman,in,business
but,now,they,did,not,laugh
they,swore,silently,as,they,saw,her,ride,by
the,fact,that,she,was,a,woman,frequently,worked,in,her,favor,for,she,could,upon,occasion,look,so,helpless,and,appealing,that,she,melted,hearts
with,no,difficulty,whatever,she,could,mutely,convey,the,impression,of,a,brave,but,timid,lady,forced,by,brutal,circumstance,into,a,distasteful,position,a,helpless,little,lady,who,would,probably,starve,if,customers,didn't,buy,her,lumber
but,when,ladylike,airs,failed,to,get,results,she,was,coldly,businesslike,and,willingly,undersold,her,competitors,at,a,loss,to,herself,if,it,would,bring,her,a,new,customer
she,was,not,above,selling,a,poor,grade,of,lumber,for,the,price,of,good,lumber,if,she,thought,she,would,not,be,detected,and,she,had,no,scruples,about,black-guarding,the,other,lumber,dealers
with,every,appearance,of,reluctance,at,disclosing,the,unpleasant,truth,she,would,sigh,and,tell,prospective,customers,that,her,competitors',lumber,was,far,too,high,in,price,rotten,full,of,knot,holes,and,in,general,of,deplorably,poor,quality
the,first,time,scarlett,lied,in,this,fashion,she,felt,disconcerted,and,guilty,disconcerted,because,the,lie,sprang,so,easily,and,naturally,to,her,lips,guilty,because,the,thought,flashed,into,her,mind,what,would,mother,say
there,was,no,doubt,what,ellen,would,say,to,a,daughter,who,told,lies,and,engaged,in,sharp,practices
she,would,be,stunned,and,incredulous,and,would,speak,gentle,words,that,stung,despite,their,gentleness,would,talk,of,honor,and,honesty,and,truth,and,duty,to,one's,neighbor
momentarily,scarlett,cringed,as,she,pictured,the,look,on,her,mother's,face
and,then,the,picture,faded,blotted,out,by,an,impulse,hard,unscrupulous,and,greedy,which,had,been,born,in,the,lean,days,at,tara,and,was,now,strengthened,by,the,present,uncertainty,of,life
so,she,passed,this,milestone,as,she,had,passed,others,before,it,with,a,sigh,that,she,was,not,as,ellen,would,like,her,to,be,a,shrug,and,the,repetition,of,her,unfailing,charm,i'll,think,of,all,this,later
but,she,never,again,thought,of,ellen,in,connection,with,her,business,practices,never,again,regretted,any,means,she,used,to,take,trade,away,from,other,lumber,dealers
she,knew,she,was,perfectly,safe,in,lying,about,them
southern,chivalry,protected,her
a,southern,lady,could,lie,about,a,gentleman,but,a,southern,gentleman,could,not,lie,about,a,lady,or,worse,still,call,the,lady,a,liar
other,lumbermen,could,only,fume,inwardly,and,state,heatedly,in,the,bosoms,of,their,families,that,they,wished,to,god,mrs,kennedy,was,a,man,for,just,about,five,minutes
one,poor,white,who,operated,a,mill,on,the,decatur,road,did,try,to,fight,scarlett,with,her,own,weapons,saying,openly,that,she,was,a,liar,and,a,swindler
but,it,hurt,him,rather,than,helped,for,everyone,was,appalled,that,even,a,poor,white,should,say,such,shocking,things,about,a,lady,of,good,family,even,when,the,lady,was,conducting,herself,in,such,an,unwomanly,way
scarlett,bore,his,remarks,with,silent,dignity,and,as,time,went,by,she,turned,all,her,attention,to,him,and,his,customers
she,undersold,him,so,relentlessly,and,delivered,with,secret,groans,such,an,excellent,quality,of,lumber,to,prove,her,probity,that,he,was,soon,bankrupt
then,to,frank's,horror,she,triumphantly,bought,his,mill,at,her,own,price
once,in,her,possession,there,arose,the,perplexing,problem,of,finding,a,trustworthy,man,to,put,in,charge,of,it
she,did,not,want,another,man,like,mr,johnson
she,knew,that,despite,all,her,watchfulness,he,was,still,selling,her,lumber,behind,her,back,but,she,thought,it,would,be,easy,to,find,the,right,sort,of,man
wasn't,everybody,as,poor,as,job's,turkey,and,weren't,the,streets,full,of,men,some,of,them,formerly,rich,who,were,without,work
the,day,never,went,by,that,frank,did,not,give,money,to,some,hungry,ex-,soldier,or,that,pitty,and,cookie,did,not,wrap,up,food,for,gaunt,beggars
but,scarlett,for,some,reason,she,could,not,understand,did,not,want,any,of,these
i,don't,want,men,who,haven't,found,something,to,do,after,a,year,she,thought
if,they,haven't,adjusted,to,peace,yet,they,couldn't,adjust,to,me
and,they,all,look,so,hangdog,and,licked
i,don't,want,a,man,who's,licked
i,want,somebody,who's,smart,and,energetic,like,renny,or,tommy,wellburn,or,kells,whiting,or,one,of,the,simmons,boys,or,or,any,of,that,tribe
they,haven't,got,that,i-don't-care-about-anything,look,the,soldiers,had,right,after,the,surrender
they,look,like,they,cared,a,heap,about,a,heap,of,things
but,to,her,surprise,the,simmons,boys,who,had,started,a,brick,kiln,and,kells,whiting,who,was,selling,a,preparation,made,up,in,his,mother's,kitchen,that,was,guaranteed,to,straighten,the,kinkiest,negro,hair,in,six,applications,smiled,politely,thanked,her,and,refused
it,was,the,same,with,the,dozen,others,she,approached
in,desperation,she,raised,the,wage,she,was,offering,but,she,was,still,refused
one,of,mrs,merriwether's,nephews,observed,impertinently,that,while,he,didn't,especially,enjoy,driving,a,dray,it,was,his,own,dray,and,he,would,rather,get,somewhere,under,his,own,steam,than,scarlett's
one,afternoon,scarlett,pulled,up,her,buggy,beside,rene,picard's,pie,wagon,and,hailed,rene,and,the,crippled,tommy,wellburn,who,was,catching,a,ride,home,with,his,friend
look,here,renny,why,don't,you,come,and,work,for,me
managing,a,mill,is,a,sight,more,respectable,than,driving,a,pie,wagon
i'd,think,you'd,be,ashamed
me,i,am,dead,to,shame,grinned,rene
who,would,be,respectable
all,of,my,days,i,was,respectable,until,ze,war,set,me,free,lak,ze,darkies

no,my,scarlett,i,must,be,ze,king,of,ze,pies
eet,ees,my,destiny
lak,napoleon,i,follow,my,star
he,flourished,his,whip,dramatically
but,you,weren't,raised,to,sell,pies,any,more,than,tommy,was,raised,to,wrastle,with,a,bunch,of,wild,irish,masons
my,kind,of,work,is,more
and,i,suppose,you,were,raised,to,run,a,lumber,mill,said,tommy,the,corners,of,his,mouth,twitching
yes,i,can,just,see,little,scarlett,at,her,mother's,knee,lisping,her,lesson,'never,sell,good,lumber,if,you,can,get,a,better,price,for,bad,'
rene,roared,at,this,his,small,monkey,eyes,dancing,with,glee,as,he,whacked,tommy,on,his,twisted,back
don't,be,impudent,said,scarlett,coldly,for,she,saw,little,humor,in,tommy's,remark
of,course,i,wasn't,raised,to,run,a,sawmill
i,didn't,mean,to,be,impudent
but,you,are,running,a,sawmill,whether,you,were,raised,to,it,or,not
and,running,it,very,well,too
well,none,of,us,as,far,as,i,can,see,are,doing,what,we,intended,to,do,right,now,but,i,think,we'll,make,out,just,the,same
it's,a,poor,person,and,a,poor,nation,that,sits,down,and,cries,because,life,isn't,precisely,what,they,expected,it,to,be
why,don't,you,pick,up,some,enterprising,carpetbagger,to,work,for,you,scarlett
the,woods,are,full,of,them,god,knows
i,don't,want,a,carpetbagger
carpetbaggers,will,steal,anything,that,isn't,red,hot,or,nailed,down
if,they,amounted,to,anything,they'd,have,stayed,where,they,were,instead,of,coming,down,here,to,pick,our,bones
i,want,a,nice,man,from,nice,folks,who,is,smart,and,honest,and,energetic,and
you,don't,want,much
and,you,won't,get,it,for,the,wage,you're,offering
all,the,men,of,that,description,barring,the,badly,maimed,ones,have,already,got,something,to,do
they,may,be,round,pegs,in,square,holes,but,they've,all,got,something,to,do
something,of,their,own,that,they'd,rather,do,than,work,for,a,woman
men,haven't,got,much,sense,have,they,when,you,get,down,to,rock,bottom
maybe,not,but,they've,got,a,heap,of,pride,said,tommy,soberly
pride
pride,tastes,awfully,good,especially,when,the,crust,is,flaky,and,you,put,meringue,on,it,said,scarlett,tartly
the,two,men,laughed,a,bit,unwillingly,and,it,seemed,to,scarlett,that,they,drew,together,in,united,masculine,disapproval,of,her
what,tommy,said,was,true,she,thought,running,over,in,her,mind,the,men,she,had,approached,and,the,ones,she,intended,to,approach
they,were,all,busy,busy,at,something,working,hard,working,harder,than,they,would,have,dreamed,possible,in,the,days,before,the,war
they,weren't,doing,what,they,wanted,to,do,perhaps,or,what,was,easiest,to,do,or,what,they,had,been,reared,to,do,but,they,were,doing,something
times,were,too,hard,for,men,to,be,choosy
and,if,they,were,sorrowing,for,lost,hopes,longing,for,lost,ways,of,living,no,one,knew,it,but,they
they,were,fighting,a,new,war,a,harder,war,than,the,one,before
and,they,were,caring,about,life,again,caring,with,the,same,urgency,and,the,same,violence,that,animated,them,before,the,war,had,cut,their,lives,in,two
scarlett,said,tommy,awkwardly,i,do,hate,to,ask,a,favor,of,you,after,being,impudent,to,you,but,i'm,going,to,ask,it,just,the,same
maybe,it,would,help,you,anyway
my,brother-in-law,hugh,elsing,isn't,doing,any,too,well,peddling,kindling,wood
everybody,except,the,yankees,goes,out,and,collects,his,own,kindling,wood
and,i,know,things,are,mighty,hard,with,the,whole,elsing,family
i,i,do,what,i,can,but,you,see,i've,got,fanny,to,support,and,then,too,i've,got,my,mother,and,two,widowed,sisters,down,in,sparta,to,look,after
hugh,is,nice,and,you,wanted,a,nice,man,and,he's,from,nice,folks,as,you,know,and,he's,honest
but,well,hugh,hasn't,got,much,gumption,or,else,he'd,make,a,success,of,his,kindling
tommy,shrugged
you've,got,a,hard,way,of,looking,at,things,scarlett,he,said
but,you,think,hugh,over
you,could,go,far,and,do,worse
i,think,his,honesty,and,his,willingness,will,outweigh,his,lack,of,gumption
scarlett,did,not,answer,for,she,did,not,want,to,be,too,rude
but,to,her,mind,there,were,few,if,any,qualities,that,out-weighed,gumption
after,she,had,unsuccessfully,canvassed,the,town,and,refused,the,importuning,of,many,eager,carpetbaggers,she,finally,decided,to,take,tommy's,suggestion,and,ask,hugh,elsing
he,had,been,a,dashing,and,resourceful,officer,during,the,war,but,two,severe,wounds,and,four,years,of,fighting,seemed,to,have,drained,him,of,all,his,resourcefulness,leaving,him,to,face,the,rigors,of,peace,as,bewildered,as,a,child
there,was,a,lost-dog,look,in,his,eyes,these,days,as,he,went,about,peddling,his,firewood,and,he,was,not,at,all,the,kind,of,man,she,had,hoped,to,get
he's,stupid,she,thought
he,doesn't,know,a,thing,about,business,and,i'll,bet,he,can't,add,two,and,two
and,i,doubt,if,he'll,ever,learn
but,at,least,he's,honest,and,won't,swindle,me
scarlett,had,little,use,these,days,for,honesty,in,herself,but,the,less,she,valued,it,in,herself,the,more,she,was,beginning,to,value,it,in,others
it's,a,pity,johnnie,gallegher,is,tied,up,with,tommy,wellburn,on,that,construction,work,she,thought
he's,just,the,kind,of,man,i,want
he's,hard,as,nails,and,slick,as,a,snake,but,he'd,be,honest,if,it,paid,him,to,be,honest
i,understand,him,and,he,understands,me,and,we,could,do,business,together,very,well
maybe,i,can,get,him,when,the,hotel,is,finished,and,till,then,i'll,have,to,make,out,on,hugh,and,mr,johnson
if,i,put,hugh,in,charge,of,the,new,mill,and,leave,mr,johnson,at,the,old,one,i,can,stay,in,town,and,see,to,the,selling,while,they,handle,the,milling,and,hauling
until,i,can,get,johnnie,i'll,have,to,risk,mr,johnson,robbing,me,if,i,stay,in,town,all,the,time
if,only,he,wasn't,a,thief
i,believe,i'll,build,a,lumber,yard,on,half,that,lot,charles,left,me
if,only,frank,didn't,holler,so,loud,about,me,building,a,saloon,on,the,other,half
well,i,shall,build,the,saloon,just,as,soon,as,i,get,enough,money,ahead,no,matter,how,he,takes,on
if,only,frank,wasn't,so,thin,skinned
oh,god,if,only,i,wasn't,going,to,have,a,baby,at,this,of,all,times
in,a,little,while,i'll,be,so,big,i,can't,go,out
oh,god,if,only,i,wasn't,going,to,have,a,baby
and,oh,god,if,the,damned,yankees,will,only,let,me,alone
if
if
if
if
there,were,so,many,ifs,in,life,never,any,certainty,of,anything,never,any,sense,of,security,always,the,dread,of,losing,everything,and,being,cold,and,hungry,again
of,course,frank,was,making,a,little,more,money,now,but,frank,was,always,ailing,with,colds,and,frequently,forced,to,stay,in,bed,for,days
suppose,he,should,become,an,invalid
no,she,could,not,afford,to,count,on,frank,for,much
she,must,not,count,on,anything,or,anybody,but,herself
and,what,she,could,earn,seemed,so,pitiably,small
oh,what,would,she,do,if,the,yankees,came,and,took,it,all,away,from,her
if
if
if
half,of,what,she,made,every,month,went,to,will,at,tara,part,to,rhett,to,repay,his,loan,and,the,rest,she,hoarded
no,miser,ever,counted,his,gold,oftener,than,she,and,no,miser,ever,had,greater,fear,of,losing,it
she,would,not,put,the,money,in,the,bank,for,it,might,fail,or,the,yankees,might,confiscate,it
so,she,carried,what,she,could,with,her,tucked,into,her,corset,and,hid,small,wads,of,bills,about,the,house,under,loose,bricks,on,the,hearth,in,her,scrap,bag,between,the,pages,of,the,bible
and,her,temper,grew,shorter,and,shorter,as,the,weeks,went,by,for,every,dollar,she,saved,would,be,just,one,more,dollar,to,lose,if,disaster,descended
frank,pitty,and,the,servants,bore,her,outbursts,with,maddening,kindness,attributing,her,bad,disposition,to,her,pregnancy,never,realizing,the,true,cause
frank,knew,that,pregnant,women,must,be,humored,so,he,put,his,pride,in,his,pocket,and,said,nothing,more,about,her,running,the,mills,and,her,going,about,town,at,such,a,time,as,no,lady,should,do
her,conduct,was,a,constant,embarrassment,to,him,but,he,reckoned,he,could,endure,it,for,a,while,longer
after,the,baby,came,he,knew,she,would,be,the,same,sweet,feminine,girl,he,had,courted
but,in,spite,of,everything,he,did,to,appease,her,she,continued,to,have,her,tantrums,and,often,he,thought,she,acted,like,one,possessed
no,one,seemed,to,realize,what,really,possessed,her,what,drove,her,like,a,mad,woman
it,was,a,passion,to,get,her,affairs,in,order,before,she,had,to,retire,behind,doors,to,have,as,much,money,as,possible,in,case,the,deluge,broke,upon,her,again,to,have,a,stout,levee,of,cash,against,the,rising,tide,of,yankee,hate
money,was,the,obsession,dominating,her,mind,these,days
when,she,thought,of,the,baby,at,all,it,was,with,baffled,rage,at,the,untimeliness,of,it
death,and,taxes,and,childbirth
there's,never,any,convenient,time,for,any,of,them
atlanta,had,been,scandalized,enough,when,scarlett,a,woman,began,operating,the,sawmill,but,as,time,went,by,the,town,decided,there,was,no,limit,to,what,she,would,do
her,sharp,trading,was,shocking,especially,when,her,poor,mother,had,been,a,robillard,and,it,was,positively,indecent,the,way,she,kept,on,going,about,the,streets,when,everyone,knew,she,was,pregnant
no,respectable,white,woman,and,few,negroes,ever,went,outside,their,homes,from,the,moment,they,first,suspected,they,were,with,child,and,mrs,merriwether,declared,indignantly,that,from,the,way,scarlett,was,acting,she,was,likely,to,have,the,baby,on,the,public,streets
but,all,the,previous,criticism,of,her,conduct,was,as,nothing,compared,with,the,buzz,of,gossip,that,now,went,through,the,town
scarlett,was,not,only,trafficking,with,the,yankees,but,was,giving,every,appearance,of,really,liking,it
mrs,merriwether,and,many,other,southerners,were,also,doing,business,with,the,newcomers,from,the,north,but,the,difference,was,that,they,did,not,like,it,and,plainly,showed,they,did,not,like,it
and,scarlett,did,or,seemed,to,which,was,just,as,bad
she,had,actually,taken,tea,with,the,yankee,officers',wives,in,their,homes
in,fact,she,had,done,practically,everything,short,of,inviting,them,into,her,own,home,and,the,town,guessed,she,would,do,even,that,except,for,aunt,pitty,and,frank
scarlett,knew,the,town,was,talking,but,she,did,not,care,could,not,afford,to,care
she,still,hated,the,yankees,with,as,fierce,a,hate,as,on,the,day,when,they,tried,to,burn,tara,but,she,could,dissemble,that,hate
she,knew,that,if,she,was,going,to,make,money,she,would,have,to,make,it,out,of,the,yankees,and,she,had,learned,that,buttering,them,up,with,smiles,and,kind,words,was,the,surest,way,to,get,their,business,for,her,mill
some,day,when,she,was,very,rich,and,her,money,was,hidden,away,where,the,yankees,could,not,find,it,then,then,she,would,tell,them,exactly,what,she,thought,of,them,tell,them,how,she,hated,and,loathed,and,despised,them
and,what,a,joy,that,would,be
but,until,that,time,came,it,was,just,plain,common,sense,to,get,along,with,them
and,if,that,was,hypocrisy,let,atlanta,make,the,most,of,it
she,discovered,that,making,friends,with,the,yankee,officers,was,as,easy,as,shooting,birds,on,the,ground
they,were,lonely,exiles,in,a,hostile,land,and,many,of,them,were,starved,for,polite,feminine,associations,in,a,town,where,respectable,women,drew,their,skirts,aside,in,passing,and,looked,as,if,they,would,like,to,spit,on,them
only,the,prostitutes,and,the,negro,women,had,kind,words,for,them
but,scarlett,was,obviously,a,lady,and,a,lady,of,family,for,all,that,she,worked,and,they,thrilled,to,her,flashing,smile,and,the,pleasant,light,in,her,green,eyes
frequently,when,scarlett,sat,in,her,buggy,talking,to,them,and,making,her,dimples,play,her,dislike,for,them,rose,so,strong,that,it,was,hard,not,to,curse,them,to,their,faces
but,she,restrained,herself,and,she,found,that,twisting,yankee,men,around,her,finger,was,no,more,difficult,than,that,same,diversion,had,been,with,southern,men
only,this,was,no,diversion,but,a,grim,business
the,role,she,enacted,was,that,of,a,refined,sweet,southern,lady,in,distress
with,an,air,of,dignified,reserve,she,was,able,to,keep,her,victims,at,their,proper,distance,but,there,was,nevertheless,a,graciousness,in,her,manner,which,left,a,certain,warmth,in,the,yankee,officers',memories,of,mrs,kennedy
this,warmth,was,very,profitable,as,scarlett,had,intended,it,to,be
many,of,the,officers,of,the,garrison,not,knowing,how,long,they,would,be,stationed,in,atlanta,had,sent,for,their,wives,and,families
as,the,hotels,and,boarding,houses,were,overflowing,they,were,building,small,houses,and,they,were,glad,to,buy,their,lumber,from,the,gracious,mrs,kennedy,who,treated,them,more,politely,than,anyone,else,in,town
the,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,also,who,were,building,fine,homes,and,stores,and,hotels,with,their,new,wealth,found,it,more,pleasant,to,do,business,with,her,than,with,the,former,confederate,soldiers,who,were,courteous,but,with,a,courtesy,more,formal,and,cold,than,outspoken,hate
so,because,she,was,pretty,and,charming,and,could,appear,quite,helpless,and,forlorn,at,times,they,gladly,patronized,her,lumber,yard,and,also,frank's,store,feeling,that,they,should,help,a,plucky,little,woman,who,apparently,had,only,a,shiftless,husband,to,support,her
and,scarlett,watching,the,business,grow,felt,that,she,was,safeguarding,not,only,the,present,with,yankee,money,but,the,future,with,yankee,friends
keeping,her,relations,with,the,yankee,officers,on,the,plane,she,desired,was,easier,than,she,expected,for,they,all,seemed,to,be,in,awe,of,southern,ladies,but,scarlett,soon,found,that,their,wives,presented,a,problem,she,had,not,anticipated
contacts,with,the,yankee,women,were,not,of,her,seeking
she,would,have,been,glad,to,avoid,them,but,she,could,not,for,the,officers',wives,were,determined,to,meet,her
they,had,an,avid,curiosity,about,the,south,and,southern,women,and,scarlett,gave,them,their,first,opportunity,to,satisfy,it
other,atlanta,women,would,have,nothing,to,do,with,them,and,even,refused,to,bow,to,them,in,church,so,when,business,brought,scarlett,to,their,homes,she,was,like,an,answer,to,prayer
often,when,scarlett,sat,in,her,buggy,in,front,of,a,yankee,home,talking,of,uprights,and,shingles,with,the,man,of,the,house,the,wife,came,out,to,join,in,the,conversation,or,insist,that,she,come,inside,for,a,cup,of,tea
scarlett,seldom,refused,no,matter,how,distasteful,the,idea,might,be,for,she,always,hoped,to,have,an,opportunity,to,suggest,tactfully,that,they,do,their,trading,at,frank's,store
but,her,self-control,was,severely,tested,many,times,because,of,the,personal,questions,they,asked,and,because,of,the,smug,and,condescending,attitude,they,displayed,toward,all,things,southern
accepting,uncle,tom's,cabin,as,revelation,second,only,to,the,bible,the,yankee,women,all,wanted,to,know,about,the,bloodhounds,which,every,southerner,kept,to,track,down,runaway,slaves
and,they,never,believed,her,when,she,told,them,she,had,only,seen,one,bloodhound,in,all,her,life,and,it,was,a,small,mild,dog,and,not,a,huge,ferocious,mastiff
they,wanted,to,know,about,the,dreadful,branding,irons,which,planters,used,to,mark,the,faces,of,their,slaves,and,the,cat-,o'-nine-tails,with,which,they,beat,them,to,death,and,they,evidenced,what,scarlett,felt,was,a,very,nasty,and,ill-bred,interest,in,slave,concubinage
especially,did,she,resent,this,in,view,of,the,enormous,increase,in,mulatto,babies,in,atlanta,since,the,yankee,soldiers,had,settled,in,the,town
any,other,atlanta,woman,would,have,expired,in,rage,at,having,to,listen,to,such,bigoted,ignorance,but,scarlett,managed,to,control,herself
assisting,her,in,this,was,the,fact,that,they,aroused,her,contempt,more,than,her,anger
after,all,they,were,yankees,and,no,one,expected,anything,better,from,yankees
so,their,unthinking,insults,to,her,state,her,people,and,their,morals,glanced,off,and,never,struck,deep,enough,to,cause,her,more,than,a,well-concealed,sneer,until,an,incident,occurred,which,made,her,sick,with,rage,and,showed,her,if,she,needed,any,showing,how,wide,was,the,gap,between,north,and,south,and,how,utterly,impossible,it,was,to,bridge,it
while,driving,home,with,uncle,peter,one,afternoon,she,passed,the,house,into,which,were,crowded,the,families,of,three,officers,who,were,building,their,own,homes,with,scarlett's,lumber
the,three,wives,were,standing,in,the,walk,as,she,drove,by,and,they,waved,to,her,to,stop
coming,out,to,the,carriage,block,they,greeted,her,in,accents,that,always,made,her,feel,that,one,could,forgive,yankees,almost,anything,except,their,voices
you,are,just,the,person,i,want,to,see,mrs,kennedy,said,a,tall,thin,woman,from,maine
i,want,to,get,some,information,about,this,benighted,town
scarlett,swallowed,the,insult,to,atlanta,with,the,contempt,it,deserved,and,smiled,her,best
and,what,can,i,tell,you
my,nurse,my,bridget,has,gone,back,north
she,said,she,wouldn't,stay,another,day,down,here,among,the,'naygurs',as,she,calls,them
and,the,children,are,just,driving,me,distracted
do,tell,me,how,to,go,about,getting,another,nurse
i,do,not,know,where,to,apply
that,shouldn't,be,difficult,said,scarlett,and,laughed
if,you,can,find,a,darky,just,in,from,the,country,who,hasn't,been,spoiled,by,the,freedmen's,bureau,you'll,have,the,best,kind,of,servant,possible
just,stand,at,your,gate,here,and,ask,every,darky,woman,who,passes,and,i'm,sure
the,three,women,broke,into,indignant,outcries
do,you,think,i'd,trust,my,babies,to,a,black,nigger
cried,the,maine,woman
i,want,a,good,irish,girl
i'm,afraid,you'll,find,no,irish,servants,in,atlanta,answered,scarlett,coolness,in,her,voice
personally,i've,never,seen,a,white,servant,and,i,shouldn't,care,to,have,one,in,my,house
and,she,could,not,keep,a,slight,note,of,sarcasm,from,her,words,i,assure,you,that,darkies,aren't,cannibals,and,are,quite,trustworthy
goodness,no
i,wouldn't,have,one,in,my,house
the,idea
i,wouldn't,trust,them,any,farther,than,i,could,see,them,and,as,for,letting,them,handle,my,babies
scarlett,thought,of,the,kind,gnarled,hands,of,mammy,worn,rough,in,ellen's,service,and,hers,and,wade's
what,did,these,strangers,know,of,black,hands,how,dear,and,comforting,they,could,be,how,unerringly,they,knew,how,to,soothe,to,pat,to,fondle
she,laughed,shortly
it's,strange,you,should,feel,that,way,when,it,was,you,all,who,freed,them
lor'
not,i,dearie,laughed,the,maine,woman
i,never,saw,a,nigger,till,i,came,south,last,month,and,i,don't,care,if,i,never,see,another
they,give,me,the,creeps
i,wouldn't,trust,one,of,them
for,some,moments,scarlett,had,been,conscious,that,uncle,peter,was,breathing,hard,and,sitting,up,very,straight,as,he,stared,steadily,at,the,horse's,ears
her,attention,was,called,to,him,more,forcibly,when,the,maine,woman,broke,off,suddenly,with,a,laugh,and,pointed,him,out,to,her,companions
look,at,that,old,nigger,swell,up,like,a,toad,she,giggled
i'll,bet,he's,an,old,pet,of,yours,isn't,he
you,southerners,don't,know,how,to,treat,niggers
you,spoil,them,to,death
peter,sucked,in,his,breath,and,his,wrinkled,brow,showed,deep,furrows,but,he,kept,his,eyes,straight,ahead
he,had,never,had,the,term,nigger,applied,to,him,by,a,white,person,in,all,his,life
by,other,negroes,yes
but,never,by,a,white,person
and,to,be,called,untrustworthy,and,an,old,pet,he,peter,who,had,been,the,dignified,mainstay,of,the,hamilton,family,for,years
scarlett,felt,rather,than,saw,the,black,chin,begin,to,shake,with,hurt,pride,and,a,killing,rage,swept,over,her
she,had,listened,with,calm,contempt,while,these,women,had,underrated,the,confederate,army,blackguarded,jeff,davis,and,accused,southerners,of,murder,and,torture,of,their,slaves
if,it,were,to,her,advantage,she,would,have,endured,insults,about,her,own,virtue,and,honesty
but,the,knowledge,that,they,had,hurt,the,faithful,old,darky,with,their,stupid,remarks,fired,her,like,a,match,in,gunpowder
for,a,moment,she,looked,at,the,big,horse,pistol,in,peter's,belt,and,her,hands,itched,for,the,feel,of,it
they,deserved,killing,these,insolent,ignorant,arrogant,conquerors
but,she,bit,down,on,her,teeth,until,her,jaw,muscles,stood,out,reminding,herself,that,the,time,had,not,yet,come,when,she,could,tell,the,yankees,just,what,she,thought,of,them
some,day,yes
my,god,yes
but,not,yet
uncle,peter,is,one,of,our,family,she,said,her,voice,shaking
good,afternoon
drive,on,peter
peter,laid,the,whip,on,the,horse,so,suddenly,that,the,startled,animal,jumped,forward,and,as,the,buggy,jounced,off,scarlett,heard,the,maine,woman,say,with,puzzled,accents,her,family
you,don't,suppose,she,meant,a,relative
he's,exceedingly,black
god,damn,them
they,ought,to,be,wiped,off,the,face,of,the,earth
if,ever,i,get,money,enough,i'll,spit,in,all,their,faces
i'll
she,glanced,at,peter,and,saw,that,a,tear,was,trickling,down,his,nose
instantly,a,passion,of,tenderness,of,grief,for,his,humiliation,swamped,her,made,her,eyes,sting
it,was,as,though,someone,had,been,senselessly,brutal,to,a,child
those,women,had,hurt,uncle,peter,peter,who,had,been,through,the,mexican,war,with,old,colonel,hamilton,peter,who,had,held,his,master,in,his,arms,when,he,died,who,had,raised,melly,and,charles,and,looked,after,the,feckless,foolish,pittypat,pertecked,her,when,she,refugeed,and,'quired,a,horse,to,bring,her,back,from,macon,through,a,war-torn,country,after,the,surrender
and,they,said,they,wouldn't,trust,niggers
peter,she,said,her,voice,breaking,as,she,put,her,hand,on,his,thin,arm
i'm,ashamed,of,you,for,crying

scarlett,said,nothing,for,she,was,still,burning,with,the,wrath,she,had,not,exploded,in,the,yankee,women's,faces
the,two,drove,home,in,silence
peter's,sniffles,stopped,and,his,underlip,began,to,protrude,gradually,until,it,stuck,out,alarmingly
his,indignation,was,mounting,now,that,the,initial,hurt,was,subsiding
scarlett,thought,what,damnably,queer,people,yankees,are
those,women,seemed,to,think,that,because,uncle,peter,was,black,he,had,no,ears,to,hear,with,and,no,feelings,as,tender,as,their,own,to,be,hurt
they,did,not,know,that,negroes,had,to,be,handled,gently,as,though,they,were,children,directed,praised,petted,scolded
they,didn't,understand,negroes,or,the,relations,between,the,negroes,and,their,former,masters
yet,they,had,fought,a,war,to,free,them
and,having,freed,them,they,didn't,want,to,have,anything,to,do,with,them,except,to,use,them,to,terrorize,southerners
they,didn't,like,them,didn't,trust,them,didn't,understand,them,and,yet,their,constant,cry,was,that,southerners,didn't,know,how,to,get,along,with,them
not,trust,a,darky
scarlett,trusted,them,far,more,than,most,white,people,certainly,more,than,she,trusted,any,yankee
there,were,qualities,of,loyalty,and,tirelessness,and,love,in,them,that,no,strain,could,break,no,money,could,buy
she,thought,of,the,faithful,few,who,remained,at,tara,in,the,face,of,the,yankee,invasion,when,they,could,have,fled,or,joined,the,troops,for,lives,of,leisure
but,they,had,stayed
she,thought,of,dilcey,toiling,in,the,cotton,fields,beside,her,of,pork,risking,his,life,in,neighboring,hen,houses,that,the,family,might,eat,of,mammy,coming,to,atlanta,with,her,to,keep,her,from,doing,wrong
she,thought,of,the,servants,of,her,neighbors,who,had,stood,loyally,beside,their,white,owners,protecting,their,mistresses,while,the,men,were,at,the,front,refugeeing,with,them,through,the,terrors,of,the,war,nursing,the,wounded,burying,the,dead,comforting,the,bereaved,working,begging,stealing,to,keep,food,on,the,tables
and,even,now,with,the,freedmen's,bureau,promising,all,manner,of,wonders,they,still,stuck,with,their,white,folks,and,worked,much,harder,than,they,ever,worked,in,slave,times
but,the,yankees,didn't,understand,these,things,and,would,never,understand,them
yet,they,set,you,free,she,said,aloud

peter's,criticism,hurt,worse,than,anything,frank,or,aunt,pitty,or,the,neighbors,had,said,and,it,so,annoyed,her,she,longed,to,shake,the,old,darky,until,his,toothless,gums,clapped,together
what,peter,said,was,true,but,she,hated,to,hear,it,from,a,negro,and,a,family,negro,too
not,to,stand,high,in,the,opinion,of,one's,servants,was,as,humiliating,a,thing,as,could,happen,to,a,southerner

that,was,as,accurate,a,summing,up,of,the,situation,as,could,be,made,and,scarlett,relapsed,into,infuriated,silence
yes,the,conquerors,did,approve,of,her,and,her,family,and,her,neighbors,did,not
she,knew,all,the,things,the,town,was,saying,about,her
and,now,even,peter,disapproved,of,her,to,the,point,of,not,caring,to,be,seen,in,public,with,her
that,was,the,last,straw
heretofore,she,had,been,careless,of,public,opinion,careless,and,a,little,contemptuous
but,peter's,words,caused,fierce,resentment,to,burn,in,her,breast,drove,her,to,a,defensive,position,made,her,suddenly,dislike,her,neighbors,as,much,as,she,disliked,the,yankees
why,should,they,care,what,i,do
she,thought
they,must,think,i,enjoy,associating,with,yankees,and,working,like,a,field,hand
they're,just,making,a,hard,job,harder,for,me
but,i,don't,care,what,they,think
i,won't,let,myself,care
i,can't,afford,to,care,now
but,some,day,some,day
oh,some,day
when,there,was,security,in,her,world,again,then,she,would,sit,back,and,fold,her,hands,and,be,a,great,lady,as,ellen,had,been
she,would,be,helpless,and,sheltered,as,a,lady,should,be,and,then,everyone,would,approve,of,her
oh,how,grand,she,would,be,when,she,had,money,again
then,she,could,permit,herself,to,be,kind,and,gentle,as,ellen,had,been,and,thoughtful,of,other,people,and,of,the,proprieties,to
she,would,not,be,driven,by,fears,day,and,night,and,life,would,be,a,placid,unhurried,affair
she,would,have,time,to,play,with,her,children,and,listen,to,their,lessons
there,would,be,long,warm,afternoons,when,ladies,would,call,and,amid,the,rustlings,of,taffeta,petticoats,and,the,rhythmic,harsh,cracklings,of,palmetto,fans,she,would,serve,tea,and,delicious,sandwiches,and,cakes,and,leisurely,gossip,the,hours,away
and,she,would,be,so,kind,to,those,who,were,suffering,misfortune,take,baskets,to,the,poor,and,soup,and,jelly,to,the,sick,and,air,those,less,fortunate,in,her,fine,carriage
she,would,be,a,lady,in,the,true,southern,manner,as,her,mother,had,been
and,then,everyone,would,love,her,as,they,had,loved,ellen,and,they,would,say,how,unselfish,she,was,and,call,her,lady,bountiful
her,pleasure,in,these,thoughts,of,the,future,was,undimmed,by,any,realization,that,she,had,no,real,desire,to,be,unselfish,or,charitable,or,kind
all,she,wanted,was,the,reputation,for,possessing,these,qualities
but,the,meshes,of,her,brain,were,too,wide,too,coarse,to,filter,such,small,differences
it,was,enough,that,some,day,when,she,had,money,everyone,would,approve,of,her
some,day
but,not,now
not,now,in,spite,of,what,anyone,might,say,of,her
now,there,was,no,time,to,be,a,great,lady
peter,was,as,good,as,his,word
aunt,pitty,did,get,into,a,state,and,peter's,misery,developed,overnight,to,such,proportions,that,he,never,drove,the,buggy,again
thereafter,scarlett,drove,alone,and,the,calluses,which,had,begun,to,leave,her,palms,came,back,again
so,the,spring,months,went,by,the,cool,rains,of,april,passing,into,the,warm,balm,of,green,may,weather
the,weeks,were,packed,with,work,and,worry,and,the,handicaps,of,increasing,pregnancy,with,old,friends,growing,cooler,and,her,family,increasingly,more,kind,more,maddeningly,solicitous,and,more,completely,blind,to,what,was,driving,her
during,those,days,of,anxiety,and,struggle,there,was,only,one,dependable,understanding,person,in,her,world,and,that,person,was,rhett,butler
it,was,odd,that,he,of,all,people,should,appear,in,this,light,for,he,was,as,unstable,as,quicksilver,and,as,perverse,as,a,demon,fresh,from,the,pit
but,he,gave,her,sympathy,something,she,had,never,had,from,anyone,and,never,expected,from,him
frequently,he,was,out,of,town,on,those,mysterious,trips,to,new,orleans,which,he,never,explained,but,which,she,felt,sure,in,a,faintly,jealous,way,were,connected,with,a,woman,or,women
but,after,uncle,peter's,refusal,to,drive,her,he,remained,in,atlanta,for,longer,and,longer,intervals
while,in,town,he,spent,most,of,his,time,gambling,in,the,rooms,above,the,girl,of,the,period,saloon,or,in,belle,watling's,bar,hobnobbing,with,the,wealthier,of,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,in,money-making,schemes,which,made,the,townspeople,detest,him,even,more,than,his,cronies
he,did,not,call,at,the,house,now,probably,in,deference,to,the,feelings,of,frank,and,pitty,who,would,have,been,outraged,at,a,male,caller,while,scarlett,was,in,a,delicate,condition
but,she,met,him,by,accident,almost,every,day
time,and,again,he,came,riding,up,to,her,buggy,when,she,was,passing,through,lonely,stretches,of,peachtree,road,and,decatur,road,where,the,mills,lay
he,always,drew,rein,and,talked,and,sometimes,he,tied,his,horse,to,the,back,of,the,buggy,and,drove,her,on,her,rounds
she,tired,more,easily,these,days,than,she,liked,to,admit,and,she,was,always,silently,grateful,when,he,took,the,reins
he,always,left,her,before,they,reached,the,town,again,but,all,atlanta,knew,about,their,meetings,and,it,gave,the,gossips,something,new,to,add,to,the,long,list,of,scarlett's,affronts,to,the,proprieties
she,wondered,occasionally,if,these,meetings,were,not,more,than,accidental
they,became,more,and,more,numerous,as,the,weeks,went,by,and,as,the,tension,in,town,heightened,over,negro,outrages
but,why,did,he,seek,her,out,now,of,all,times,when,she,looked,her,worst
certainly,he,had,no,designs,upon,her,if,he,had,ever,had,any,and,she,was,beginning,to,doubt,even,this
it,had,been,months,since,he,made,any,joking,references,to,their,distressing,scene,at,the,yankee,jail
he,never,mentioned,ashley,and,her,love,for,him,or,made,any,coarse,and,ill-bred,remarks,about,coveting,her
she,thought,it,best,to,let,sleeping,dogs,lie,so,she,did,not,ask,for,an,explanation,of,their,frequent,meetings
and,finally,she,decided,that,because,he,had,little,to,do,besides,gamble,and,had,few,enough,nice,friends,in,atlanta,he,sought,her,out,solely,for,companionship's,sake
whatever,his,reason,might,be,she,found,his,company,most,welcome
he,listened,to,her,moans,about,lost,customers,and,bad,debts,the,swindling,ways,of,mr,johnson,and,the,incompetency,of,hugh
he,applauded,her,triumphs,where,frank,merely,smiled,indulgently,and,pitty,said,dear,me
in,a,dazed,manner
she,was,sure,that,he,frequently,threw,business,her,way,for,he,knew,all,the,rich,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,intimately,but,he,always,denied,being,helpful
she,knew,him,for,what,he,was,and,she,never,trusted,him,but,her,spirits,always,rose,with,pleasure,at,the,sight,of,him,riding,around,the,curve,of,a,shady,road,on,his,big,black,horse
when,he,climbed,into,the,buggy,and,took,the,reins,from,her,and,threw,her,some,impertinent,remark,she,felt,young,and,gay,and,attractive,again,for,all,her,worries,and,her,increasing,bulk
she,could,talk,to,him,about,almost,everything,with,no,care,for,concealing,her,motives,or,her,real,opinions,and,she,never,ran,out,of,things,to,say,as,she,did,with,frank,or,even,with,ashley,if,she,must,be,honest,with,herself
but,of,course,in,all,her,conversations,with,ashley,there,were,so,many,things,which,could,not,be,said,for,honor's,sake,that,the,sheer,force,of,them,inhibited,other,remarks
it,was,comforting,to,have,a,friend,like,rhett,now,that,for,some,unaccountable,reason,he,had,decided,to,be,on,good,behavior,with,her
very,comforting,for,she,had,so,few,friends,these,days
rhett,she,asked,stormily,shortly,after,uncle,peter's,ultimatum,why,do,folks,in,this,town,treat,me,so,scurvily,and,talk,about,me,so
it's,a,toss-up,who,they,talk,worst,about,me,or,the,carpetbaggers
i've,minded,my,own,business,and,haven't,done,anything,wrong,and
if,you,haven't,done,anything,wrong,it's,because,you,haven't,had,the,opportunity,and,perhaps,they,dimly,realize,it
oh,do,be,serious
they,make,me,so,mad
all,i've,done,is,try,to,make,a,little,money,and
all,you've,done,is,to,be,different,from,other,women,and,you've,made,a,little,success,at,it
as,i've,told,you,before,that,is,the,one,unforgivable,sin,in,any,society
be,different,and,be,damned
scarlett,the,mere,fact,that,you've,made,a,success,of,your,mill,is,an,insult,to,every,man,who,hasn't,succeeded
remember,a,well-bred,female's,place,is,in,the,home,and,she,should,know,nothing,about,this,busy,brutal,world
but,if,i,had,stayed,in,my,home,i,wouldn't,have,had,any,home,left,to,stay,in
the,inference,is,that,you,should,have,starved,genteelly,and,with,pride
oh,fiddle-dee-dee
but,look,at,mrs,merriwether
she's,selling,pies,to,yankees,and,that's,worse,than,running,a,sawmill,and,mrs,elsing,takes,in,sewing,and,keeps,boarders,and,fanny,paints,awful-,looking,china,things,that,nobody,wants,and,everybody,buys,to,help,her,and
but,you,miss,the,point,my,pet
they,aren't,successful,and,so,they,aren't,affronting,the,hot,southern,pride,of,their,men,folks
the,men,can,still,say,'poor,sweet,sillies,how,hard,they,try
well,i'll,let,them,think,they're,helping,'
and,besides,the,ladies,you,mentioned,don't,enjoy,having,to,work
they,let,it,be,known,that,they,are,only,doing,it,until,some,man,comes,along,to,relieve,them,of,their,unwomanly,burdens
and,so,everybody,feels,sorry,for,them
but,obviously,you,do,like,to,work,and,obviously,you,aren't,going,to,let,any,man,tend,to,your,business,for,you,and,so,no,one,can,feel,sorry,for,you
and,atlanta,is,never,going,to,forgive,you,for,that
it's,so,pleasant,to,feel,sorry,for,people
i,wish,you'd,be,serious,sometimes
did,you,ever,hear,the,oriental,proverb,'the,dogs,bark,but,the,caravan,passes,on,'
let,them,bark,scarlett
i,fear,nothing,will,stop,your,caravan
but,why,should,they,mind,my,making,a,little,money
you,can't,have,everything,scarlett
you,can,either,make,money,in,your,present,unladylike,manner,and,meet,cold,shoulders,everywhere,you,go,or,you,can,be,poor,and,genteel,and,have,lots,of,friends
you've,made,your,choice
i,won't,be,poor,she,said,swiftly
but,it,is,the,right,choice,isn't,it
if,it's,money,you,want,most
yes,i,want,money,more,than,anything,else,in,the,world
then,you've,made,the,only,choice
but,there's,a,penalty,attached,as,there,is,to,most,things,you,want
it's,loneliness
that,silenced,her,for,a,moment
it,was,true
when,she,stopped,to,think,about,it,she,was,a,little,lonely,lonely,for,feminine,companionship
during,the,war,years,she,had,had,ellen,to,visit,when,she,felt,blue
and,since,ellen's,death,there,had,always,been,melanie,though,she,and,melanie,had,nothing,in,common,except,the,hard,work,at,tara
now,there,was,no,one,for,aunt,pitty,had,no,conception,of,life,beyond,her,small,round,of,gossip
i,think,i,think,she,began,hesitantly,that,i've,always,been,lonely,where,women,were,concerned
it,isn't,just,my,working,that,makes,atlanta,ladies,dislike,me
they,just,don't,like,me,anyway
no,woman,ever,really,liked,me,except,mother
even,my,sisters
i,don't,know,why,but,even,before,the,war,even,before,i,married,charlie,ladies,didn't,seem,to,approve,of,anything,i,did
you,forget,mrs,wilkes,said,rhett,and,his,eyes,gleamed,maliciously
she,has,always,approved,of,you,up,to,the,hilt
i,daresay,she'd,approve,of,anything,you,did,short,of,murder
scarlett,thought,grimly,she's,even,approved,of,murder,and,she,laughed,contemptuously
oh,melly
she,said,and,then,ruefully,it's,certainly,not,to,my,credit,that,melly,is,the,only,woman,who,approves,of,me,for,she,hasn't,the,sense,of,a,guinea,hen
if,she,had,any,sense,she,stopped,in,some,confusion
if,she,had,any,sense,she'd,realize,a,few,things,and,she,couldn't,approve,rhett,finished
well,you,know,more,about,that,than,i,do,of,course
oh,damn,your,memory,and,your,bad,manners
i'll,pass,over,your,unjustified,rudeness,with,the,silence,it,deserves,and,return,to,our,former,subject
make,up,your,mind,to,this
if,you,are,different,you,are,isolated,not,only,from,people,of,your,own,age,but,from,those,of,your,parents',generation,and,from,your,children's,generation,too
they'll,never,understand,you,and,they'll,be,shocked,no,matter,what,you,do
but,your,grandparents,would,probably,be,proud,of,you,and,say,'there's,a,chip,off,the,old,block,',and,your,grandchildren,will,sigh,enviously,and,say,'what,an,old,rip,grandma,must,have,been,'
and,they'll,try,to,be,like,you
scarlett,laughed,with,amusement
sometimes,you,do,hit,on,the,truth
now,there,was,my,grandma,robillard
mammy,used,to,hold,her,over,my,head,whenever,i,was,naughty
grandma,was,as,cold,as,an,icicle,and,strict,about,her,manners,and,everybody,else's,manners,but,she,married,three,times,and,had,any,number,of,duels,fought,over,her,and,she,wore,rouge,and,the,most,shockingly,low-cut,dresses,and,no,well,er,not,much,under,her,dresses
and,you,admired,her,tremendously,for,all,that,you,tried,to,be,like,your,mother
i,had,a,grandfather,on,the,butler,side,who,was,a,pirate
not,really
a,walk-the-plank,kind
i,daresay,he,made,people,walk,the,plank,if,there,was,any,money,to,be,made,that,way
at,any,rate,he,made,enough,money,to,leave,my,father,quite,wealthy
but,the,family,always,referred,to,him,carefully,as,a,'sea,captain,'
he,was,killed,in,a,saloon,brawl,long,before,i,was,born
his,death,was,needless,to,say,a,great,relief,to,his,children,for,the,old,gentleman,was,drunk,most,of,the,time,and,when,in,his,cups,was,apt,to,forget,that,he,was,a,retired,sea,captain,and,give,reminiscences,that,curled,his,children's,hair
however,i,admired,him,and,tried,to,copy,him,far,more,than,i,ever,did,my,father,for,father,is,an,amiable,gentleman,full,of,honorable,habits,and,pious,saws,so,you,see,how,it,goes
i'm,sure,your,children,won't,approve,of,you,scarlett,any,more,than,mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,elsing,and,their,broods,approve,of,you,now
your,children,will,probably,be,soft,prissy,creatures,as,the,children,of,hard-bitten,characters,usually,are
and,to,make,them,worse,you,like,every,other,mother,are,probably,determined,that,they,shall,never,know,the,hardships,you've,known
and,that's,all,wrong
hardships,make,or,break,people
so,you'll,have,to,wait,for,approval,from,your,grandchildren
i,wonder,what,our,grandchildren,will,be,like
are,you,suggesting,by,that,'our',that,you,and,i,will,have,mutual,grandchildren
fie,mrs
kennedy
scarlett,suddenly,conscious,of,her,error,of,speech,went,red
it,was,more,than,his,joking,words,that,shamed,her,for,she,was,suddenly,aware,again,of,her,thickening,body
in,no,way,had,either,of,them,ever,hinted,at,her,condition,and,she,had,always,kept,the,lap,robe,high,under,her,armpits,when,with,him,even,on,warm,days,comforting,herself,in,the,usual,feminine,manner,with,the,belief,that,she,did,not,show,at,all,when,thus,covered,and,she,was,suddenly,sick,with,quick,rage,at,her,own,condition,and,shame,that,he,should,know
you,get,out,of,this,buggy,you,dirty-minded,varmit,she,said,her,voice,shaking
i'll,do,nothing,of,the,kind,he,returned,calmly
it'll,be,dark,before,you,get,home,and,there's,a,new,colony,of,darkies,living,in,tents,and,shanties,near,the,next,spring,mean,niggers,i've,been,told,and,i,see,no,reason,why,you,should,give,the,impulsive,ku,klux,a,cause,for,putting,on,their,nightshirts,and,riding,abroad,this,evening
get,out
she,cried,tugging,at,the,reins,and,suddenly,nausea,overwhelmed,her
he,stopped,the,horse,quickly,passed,her,two,clean,handkerchiefs,and,held,her,head,over,the,side,of,the,buggy,with,some,skill
the,afternoon,sun,slanting,low,through,the,newly,leaved,trees,spun,sickeningly,for,a,few,moments,in,a,swirl,of,gold,and,green
when,the,spell,had,passed,she,put,her,head,in,her,hands,and,cried,from,sheer,mortification
not,only,had,she,vomited,before,a,man,in,itself,as,horrible,a,contretemps,as,could,overtake,a,woman,but,by,doing,so,the,humiliating,fact,of,her,pregnancy,must,now,be,evident
she,felt,that,she,could,never,look,him,in,the,face,again
to,have,this,happen,with,him,of,all,people,with,rhett,who,had,no,respect,for,women
she,cried,expecting,some,coarse,and,jocular,remark,from,him,which,she,would,never,be,able,to,forget
don't,be,a,fool,he,said,quietly
and,you,are,a,fool,if,you,are,crying,for,shame
come,scarlett,don't,be,a,child
surely,you,must,know,that,not,being,blind,i,knew,you,were,pregnant
she,said,oh,in,a,stunned,voice,and,tightened,her,fingers,over,her,crimson,face
the,word,itself,horrified,her
frank,always,referred,to,her,pregnancy,embarrassedly,as,your,condition,gerald,had,been,wont,to,say,delicately,in,the,family,way,when,he,had,to,mention,such,matters,and,ladies,genteelly,referred,to,pregnancy,as,being,in,a,fix
you,are,a,child,if,you,thought,i,didn't,know,for,all,your,smothering,yourself,under,that,hot,lap,robe
of,course,i,knew
why,else,do,you,think,i've,been
he,stopped,suddenly,and,a,silence,fell,between,them
he,picked,up,the,reins,and,clucked,to,the,horse
he,went,on,talking,quietly,and,as,his,drawl,fell,pleasantly,on,her,ears,some,of,the,color,faded,from,her,down-tucked,face
i,didn't,think,you,could,be,so,shocked,scarlett
i,thought,you,were,a,sensible,person,and,i'm,disappointed
can,it,be,possible,that,modesty,still,lingers,in,your,breast
i'm,afraid,i'm,not,a,gentleman,to,have,mentioned,the,matter
and,i,know,i'm,not,a,gentleman,in,view,of,the,fact,that,pregnant,women,do,not,embarrass,me,as,they,should
i,find,it,possible,to,treat,them,as,normal,creatures,and,not,look,at,the,ground,or,the,sky,or,anywhere,else,in,the,universe,except,their,waist,lines,and,then,cast,at,them,those,furtive,glances,i've,always,thought,the,height,of,indecency
why,should,i
it's,a,perfectly,normal,state
the,europeans,are,far,more,sensible,than,we,are
they,compliment,expectant,mothers,upon,their,expectations
while,i,wouldn't,advise,going,that,far,still,it's,more,sensible,than,our,way,of,trying,to,ignore,it
it's,a,normal,state,and,women,should,be,proud,of,it,instead,of,hiding,behind,closed,doors,as,if,they'd,committed,a,crime
proud
she,cried,in,a,strangled,voice
proud,ugh
aren't,you,proud,to,be,having,a,child
oh,dear,god,no
i,i,hate,babies
you,mean,frank's,baby
no,anybody's,baby
for,a,moment,she,went,sick,again,at,this,new,error,of,speech,but,his,voice,went,on,as,easily,as,though,he,had,not,marked,it
then,we're,different
i,like,babies
you,like,them
she,cried,looking,up,so,startled,at,the,statement,that,she,forgot,her,embarrassment
what,a,liar,you,are
i,like,babies,and,i,like,little,children,till,they,begin,to,grow,up,and,acquire,adult,habits,of,thought,and,adult,abilities,to,lie,and,cheat,and,be,dirty
that,can't,be,news,to,you
you,know,i,like,wade,hampton,a,lot,for,all,that,he,isn't,the,boy,he,ought,to,be
that,was,true,thought,scarlett,suddenly,marveling
he,did,seem,to,enjoy,playing,with,wade,and,often,brought,him,presents
now,that,we've,brought,this,dreadful,subject,into,the,light,and,you,admit,that,you,expect,a,baby,some,time,in,the,not,too,distant,future,i'll,say,something,i've,been,wanting,to,say,for,weeks,two,things
the,first,is,that,it's,dangerous,for,you,to,drive,alone
you,know,it
you've,been,told,it,often,enough
if,you,don't,care,personally,whether,or,not,you,are,raped,you,might,consider,the,consequences
because,of,your,obstinacy,you,may,get,yourself,into,a,situation,where,your,gallant,fellow,townsmen,will,be,forced,to,avenge,you,by,stringing,up,a,few,darkies
and,that,will,bring,the,yankees,down,on,them,and,someone,will,probably,get,hanged
has,it,ever,occurred,to,you,that,perhaps,one,of,the,reasons,the,ladies,do,not,like,you,is,that,your,conduct,may,cause,the,neck-stretching,of,their,sons,and,husbands
and,furthermore,if,the,ku,klux,handles,many,more,negroes,the,yankees,are,going,to,tighten,up,on,atlanta,in,a,way,that,will,make,sherman's,conduct,look,angelic
i,know,what,i'm,talking,about,for,i'm,hand,in,glove,with,the,yankees
shameful,to,state,they,treat,me,as,one,of,them,and,i,hear,them,talk,openly
they,mean,to,stamp,out,the,ku,klux,if,it,means,burning,the,whole,town,again,and,hanging,every,male,over,ten
that,would,hurt,you,scarlett
you,might,lose,money
and,there's,no,telling,where,a,prairie,fire,will,stop,once,it,gets,started
confiscation,of,property,higher,taxes,fines,for,suspected,women,i've,heard,them,all,suggested
the,ku,klux
do,you,know,any,ku,klux
is,tommy,wellburn,or,hugh,or
he,shrugged,impatiently
how,should,i,know
i'm,a,renegade,a,turncoat,a,scallawag
would,i,be,likely,to,know
but,i,do,know,men,who,are,suspected,by,the,yankees,and,one,false,move,from,them,and,they,are,as,good,as,hanged
while,i,know,you,would,have,no,regrets,at,getting,your,neighbors,on,the,gallows,i,do,believe,you'd,regret,losing,your,mills
i,see,by,the,stubborn,look,on,your,face,that,you,do,not,believe,me,and,my,words,are,falling,on,stony,ground
so,all,i,can,say,is,keep,that,pistol,of,yours,handy,and,when,i'm,in,town,i'll,try,to,be,on,hand,to,drive,you
rhett,do,you,really,is,it,to,protect,me,that,you
yes,my,dear,it,is,my,much,advertised,chivalry,that,makes,me,protect,you
the,mocking,light,began,to,dance,in,his,black,eyes,and,all,signs,of,earnestness,fled,from,his,face
and,why
because,of,my,deep,love,for,you,mrs,kennedy
yes,i,have,silently,hungered,and,thirsted,for,you,and,worshipped,you,from,afar,but,being,an,honorable,man,like,mr,ashley,wilkes,i,have,concealed,it,from,you
you,are,alas,frank's,wife,and,honor,has,forbidden,my,telling,this,to,you
but,even,as,mr,wilkes',honor,cracks,occasionally,so,mine,is,cracking,now,and,i,reveal,my,secret,passion,and,my
oh,for,god's,sake,hush
interrupted,scarlett,annoyed,as,usual,when,he,made,her,look,like,a,conceited,fool,and,not,caring,to,have,ashley,and,his,honor,become,the,subject,of,further,conversation
what,was,the,other,thing,you,wanted,to,tell,me
what
you,change,the,subject,when,i,am,baring,a,loving,but,lacerated,heart
well,the,other,thing,is,this
the,mocking,light,died,out,of,his,eyes,again,and,his,face,was,dark,and,quiet
i,want,you,to,do,something,about,this,horse
he's,stubborn,and,he's,got,a,mouth,as,tough,as,iron
tires,you,to,drive,him,doesn't,it
well,if,he,chose,to,bolt,you,couldn't,possibly,stop,him
and,if,you,turned,over,in,a,ditch,it,might,kill,your,baby,and,you,too
you,ought,to,get,the,heaviest,curb,bit,you,can,or,else,let,me,swap,him,for,a,gentle,horse,with,a,more,sensitive,mouth
she,looked,up,into,his,blank,smooth,face,and,suddenly,her,irritation,fell,away,even,as,her,embarrassment,had,disappeared,after,the,conversation,about,her,pregnancy
he,had,been,kind,a,few,moments,before,to,put,her,at,her,ease,when,she,was,wishing,that,she,were,dead
and,he,was,being,kinder,now,and,very,thoughtful,about,the,horse
she,felt,a,rush,of,gratitude,to,him,and,she,wondered,why,he,could,not,always,be,this,way
the,horse,is,hard,to,drive,she,agreed,meekly
sometimes,my,arms,ache,all,night,from,tugging,at,him
you,do,what,you,think,best,about,him,rhett
his,eyes,sparkled,wickedly
that,sounds,very,sweet,and,feminine,mrs,kennedy
not,in,your,usual,masterful,vein,at,all
well,it,only,takes,proper,handling,to,make,a,clinging,vine,out,of,you
she,scowled,and,her,temper,came,back
you,will,get,out,of,this,buggy,this,time,or,i,will,hit,you,with,the,whip
i,don't,know,why,i,put,up,with,you,why,i,try,to,be,nice,to,you
you,have,no,manners
you,have,no,morals
you,are,nothing,but,a,well,get,out
i,mean,it
but,when,he,had,climbed,down,and,untied,his,horse,from,the,back,of,the,buggy,and,stood,in,the,twilight,road,grinning,tantalizingly,at,her,she,could,not,smother,her,own,grin,as,she,drove,off
yes,he,was,coarse,he,was,tricky,he,was,unsafe,to,have,dealings,with,and,you,never,could,tell,when,the,dull,weapon,you,put,into,his,hands,in,an,unguarded,moment,might,turn,into,the,keenest,of,blades
but,after,all,he,was,as,stimulating,as,well,as,a,surreptitious,glass,of,brandy
during,these,months,scarlett,had,learned,the,use,of,brandy
when,she,came,home,in,the,late,afternoons,damp,from,the,rain,cramped,and,aching,from,long,hours,in,the,buggy,nothing,sustained,her,except,the,thought,of,the,bottle,hidden,in,her,top,bureau,drawer,locked,against,mammy's,prying,eyes
dr,meade,had,not,thought,to,warn,her,that,a,woman,in,her,condition,should,not,drink,for,it,never,occurred,to,him,that,a,decent,woman,would,drink,anything,stronger,than,scuppernong,wine
except,of,course,a,glass,of,champagne,at,a,wedding,or,a,hot,toddy,when,confined,to,bed,with,a,hard,cold
of,course,there,were,unfortunate,women,who,drank,to,the,eternal,disgrace,of,their,families,just,as,there,were,women,who,were,insane,or,divorced,or,who,believed,with,miss,susan,b,anthony,that,women,should,have,the,vote
but,as,much,as,the,doctor,disapproved,of,scarlett,he,never,suspected,her,of,drinking
scarlett,had,found,that,a,drink,of,neat,brandy,before,supper,helped,immeasurably,and,she,would,always,chew,coffee,or,gargle,cologne,to,disguise,the,smell
why,were,people,so,silly,about,women,drinking,when,men,could,and,did,get,reeling,drunk,whenever,they,wanted,to
sometimes,when,frank,lay,snoring,beside,her,and,sleep,would,not,come,when,she,lay,tossing,torn,with,fears,of,poverty,dreading,the,yankees,homesick,for,tara,and,yearning,for,ashley,she,thought,she,would,go,crazy,were,it,not,for,the,brandy,bottle
and,when,the,pleasant,familiar,warmth,stole,through,her,veins,her,troubles,began,to,fade
after,three,drinks,she,could,always,say,to,herself,i'll,think,of,these,things,tomorrow,when,i,can,stand,them,better
but,there,were,some,nights,when,even,brandy,would,not,still,the,ache,in,her,heart,the,ache,that,was,even,stronger,than,fear,of,losing,the,mills,the,ache,to,see,tara,again
atlanta,with,its,noises,its,new,buildings,its,strange,faces,its,narrow,streets,crowded,with,horses,and,wagons,and,bustling,crowds,sometimes,seemed,to,stifle,her
she,loved,atlanta,but,oh,for,the,sweet,peace,and,country,quiet,of,tara,the,red,fields,and,the,dark,pines,about,it
oh,to,be,back,at,tara,no,matter,how,hard,the,life,might,be
and,to,be,near,ashley,just,to,see,him,to,hear,him,speak,to,be,sustained,by,the,knowledge,of,his,love
each,letter,from,melanie,saying,that,they,were,well,each,brief,note,from,will,reporting,about,the,plowing,the,planting,the,growing,of,the,cotton,made,her,long,anew,to,be,home,again
i'll,go,home,in,june
i,can't,do,anything,here,after,that
i'll,go,home,for,a,couple,of,months,she,thought,and,her,heart,would,rise
she,did,go,home,in,june,but,not,as,she,longed,to,go,for,early,in,that,month,came,a,brief,message,from,will,that,gerald,was,dead
chapter,xxxix
the,train,was,very,late,and,the,long,deeply,blue,twilight,of,june,was,settling,over,the,countryside,when,scarlett,alighted,in,jonesboro
yellow,gleams,of,lamplight,showed,in,the,stores,and,houses,which,remained,in,the,village,but,they,were,few
here,and,there,were,wide,gaps,between,the,buildings,on,the,main,street,where,dwellings,had,been,shelled,or,burned
ruined,houses,with,shell,holes,in,their,roofs,and,half,the,walls,torn,away,stared,at,her,silent,and,dark
a,few,saddle,horses,and,mule,teams,were,hitched,outside,the,wooden,awning,of,bullard's,store
the,dusty,red,road,was,empty,and,lifeless,and,the,only,sounds,in,the,village,were,a,few,whoops,and,drunken,laughs,that,floated,on,the,still,twilight,air,from,a,saloon,far,down,the,street
the,depot,had,not,been,rebuilt,since,it,was,burned,in,the,battle,and,in,its,place,was,only,a,wooden,shelter,with,no,sides,to,keep,out,the,weather
scarlett,walked,under,it,and,sat,down,on,one,of,the,empty,kegs,that,were,evidently,put,there,for,seats
she,peered,up,and,down,the,street,for,will,benteen
will,should,have,been,here,to,meet,her
he,should,have,known,she,would,take,the,first,train,possible,after,receiving,his,laconic,message,that,gerald,was,dead
she,had,come,so,hurriedly,that,she,had,in,her,small,carpetbag,only,a,nightgown,and,a,tooth,brush,not,even,a,change,of,underwear
she,was,uncomfortable,in,the,tight,black,dress,she,had,borrowed,from,mrs,meade,for,she,had,had,no,time,to,get,mourning,clothes,for,herself
mrs,meade,was,thin,now,and,scarlett's,pregnancy,being,advanced,the,dress,was,doubly,uncomfortable
even,in,her,sorrow,at,gerald's,death,she,did,not,forget,the,appearance,she,was,making,and,she,looked,down,at,her,body,with,distaste
her,figure,was,completely,gone,and,her,face,and,ankles,were,puffy
heretofore,she,had,not,cared,very,much,how,she,looked,but,now,that,she,would,see,ashley,within,the,hour,she,cared,greatly
even,in,her,heartbreak,she,shrank,from,the,thought,of,facing,him,when,she,was,carrying,another,man's,child
she,loved,him,and,he,loved,her,and,this,unwanted,child,now,seemed,to,her,a,proof,of,infidelity,to,that,love
but,much,as,she,disliked,having,him,see,her,with,the,slenderness,gone,from,her,waist,and,the,lightness,from,her,step,it,was,something,she,could,not,escape,now
she,patted,her,foot,impatiently
will,should,have,met,her
of,course,she,could,go,over,to,bullard's,and,inquire,after,him,or,ask,someone,there,to,drive,her,over,to,tara,should,she,find,he,had,been,unable,to,come
but,she,did,not,want,to,go,to,bullard's
it,was,saturday,night,and,probably,half,the,men,of,the,county,would,be,there
she,did,not,want,to,display,her,condition,in,this,poorly,fitting,black,dress,which,accentuated,rather,than,hid,her,figure
and,she,did,not,want,to,hear,the,kindly,sympathy,that,would,be,poured,out,about,gerald
she,did,not,want,sympathy
she,was,afraid,she,would,cry,if,anyone,even,mentioned,his,name,to,her
and,she,wouldn't,cry
she,knew,if,she,once,began,it,would,be,like,the,time,she,cried,into,the,horse's,mane,that,dreadful,night,when,atlanta,fell,and,rhett,had,left,her,on,the,dark,road,outside,the,town,terrible,tears,that,tore,her,heart,and,could,not,be,stopped
no,she,wouldn't,cry
she,felt,the,lump,in,her,throat,rising,again,as,it,had,done,so,often,since,the,news,came,but,crying,wouldn't,do,any,good
it,would,only,confuse,and,weaken,her
why,oh,why,hadn't,will,or,melanie,or,the,girls,written,her,that,gerald,was,ailing
she,would,have,taken,the,first,train,to,tara,to,care,for,him,brought,a,doctor,from,atlanta,if,necessary
the,fools,all,of,them
couldn't,they,manage,anything,without,her
she,couldn't,be,in,two,places,at,once,and,the,good,lord,knew,she,was,doing,her,best,for,them,all,in,atlanta
she,twisted,about,on,the,keg,becoming,nervous,and,fidgety,as,will,still,did,not,come
where,was,he
then,she,heard,the,scrunching,of,cinders,on,the,railroad,tracks,behind,her,and,twisting,her,body,she,saw,alex,fontaine,crossing,the,tracks,toward,a,wagon,a,sack,of,oats,on,his,shoulder
good,lord
isn't,that,you,scarlett
he,cried,dropping,the,sack,and,running,to,take,her,hand,pleasure,written,all,over,his,bitter,swarthy,little,face
i'm,so,glad,to,see,you
i,saw,will,over,at,the,blacksmith's,shop,getting,the,horse,shod
the,train,was,late,and,he,thought,he'd,have,time
shall,i,run,fetch,him
yes,please,alex,she,said,smiling,in,spite,of,her,sorrow
it,was,good,to,see,a,county,face,again
oh,er,scarlett,he,began,awkwardly,still,holding,her,hand,i'm,mighty,sorry,about,your,father
thank,you,she,replied,wishing,he,had,not,said,it
his,words,brought,up,gerald's,florid,face,and,bellowing,voice,so,clearly
if,it's,any,comfort,to,you,scarlett,we're,mighty,proud,of,him,around,here,alex,continued,dropping,her,hand
he,well,we,figure,he,died,like,a,soldier,and,in,a,soldier's,cause
now,what,did,he,mean,by,that,she,thought,confusedly
a,soldier
had,someone,shot,him
had,he,gotten,into,a,fight,with,the,scallawags,as,tony,had
but,she,mustn't,hear,more
she,would,cry,if,she,talked,about,him,and,she,mustn't,cry,not,until,she,was,safely,in,the,wagon,with,will,and,out,in,the,country,where,no,stranger,could,see,her
will,wouldn't,matter
he,was,just,like,a,brother
alex,i,don't,want,to,talk,about,it,she,said,shortly
i,don't,blame,you,one,bit,scarlett,said,alex,while,the,dark,blood,of,anger,flooded,his,face
if,it,was,my,sister,i'd,well,scarlett,i've,never,yet,said,a,harsh,word,about,any,woman,but,personally,i,think,somebody,ought,to,take,a,rawhide,whip,to,suellen
what,foolishness,was,he,talking,about,now,she,wondered
what,had,suellen,to,do,with,it,all
everybody,around,here,feels,the,same,way,about,her,i'm,sorry,to,say
will's,the,only,one,who,takes,up,for,her,and,of,course,miss,melanie,but,she's,a,saint,and,won't,see,bad,in,anyone,and
i,said,i,didn't,want,to,talk,about,it,she,said,coldly,but,alex,did,not,seem,rebuffed
he,looked,as,though,he,understood,her,rudeness,and,that,was,annoying
she,didn't,want,to,hear,bad,tidings,about,her,own,family,from,an,outsider,didn't,want,him,to,know,of,her,ignorance,of,what,had,happened
why,hadn't,will,sent,her,the,full,details
she,wished,alex,wouldn't,look,at,her,so,hard
she,felt,that,he,realized,her,condition,and,it,embarrassed,her
but,what,alex,was,thinking,as,he,peered,at,her,in,the,twilight,was,that,her,face,had,changed,so,completely,he,wondered,how,he,had,ever,recognized,her
perhaps,it,was,because,she,was,going,to,have,a,baby
women,did,look,like,the,devil,at,such,times
and,of,course,she,must,be,feeling,badly,about,old,man,o'hara
she,had,been,his,pet
but,no,the,change,was,deeper,than,that
she,really,looked,as,if,she,had,three,square,meals,a,day
and,the,hunted-animal,look,had,partly,gone,from,her,eyes
now,the,eyes,which,had,been,fearful,and,desperate,were,hard
there,was,an,air,of,command,assurance,and,determination,about,her,even,when,she,smiled
bet,she,led,old,frank,a,merry,life
yes,she,had,changed
she,was,a,handsome,woman,to,be,sure,but,all,that,pretty,sweet,softness,had,gone,from,her,face,and,that,flattering,way,of,looking,up,at,a,man,like,he,knew,more,than,god,almighty,had,utterly,vanished
well,hadn't,they,all,changed
alex,looked,down,at,his,rough,clothes,and,his,face,fell,into,its,usual,bitter,lines
sometimes,at,night,when,he,lay,awake,wondering,how,his,mother,was,going,to,get,that,operation,and,how,poor,dead,joe's,little,boy,was,going,to,get,an,education,and,how,he,was,going,to,get,money,for,another,mule,he,wished,the,war,was,still,going,on,wished,it,had,gone,on,forever
they,didn't,know,their,luck,then
there,was,always,something,to,eat,in,the,army,even,if,it,was,just,corn,bread,always,somebody,to,give,orders,and,none,of,this,torturing,sense,of,facing,problems,that,couldn't,be,solved,nothing,to,bother,about,in,the,army,except,getting,killed
and,then,there,was,dimity,munroe
alex,wanted,to,marry,her,and,he,knew,he,couldn't,when,so,many,were,already,looking,to,him,for,support
he,had,loved,her,for,so,long,and,now,the,roses,were,fading,from,her,cheeks,and,the,joy,from,her,eyes
if,only,tony,hadn't,had,to,run,away,to,texas
another,man,on,the,place,would,make,all,the,difference,in,the,world
his,lovable,bad-tempered,little,brother,penniless,somewhere,in,the,west
yes,they,had,all,changed
and,why,not
he,sighed,heavily
i,haven't,thanked,you,for,what,you,and,frank,did,for,tony,he,said
it,was,you,who,helped,him,get,away,wasn't,it
it,was,fine,of,you
i,heard,in,a,roundabout,way,that,he,was,safe,in,texas
i,was,afraid,to,write,and,ask,you,but,did,you,or,frank,lend,him,any,money
i,want,to,repay
oh,alex,please,hush
not,now
cried,scarlett
for,once,money,meant,nothing,to,her
alex,was,silent,for,a,moment
i'll,get,will,for,you,he,said,and,we'll,all,be,over,tomorrow,for,the,funeral
as,he,picked,up,the,sack,of,oats,and,turned,away,a,wobbly-wheeled,wagon,swayed,out,of,a,side,street,and,creaked,up,to,them
will,called,from,the,seat,i'm,sorry,i'm,late,scarlett
climbing,awkwardly,down,from,the,wagon,he,stumped,toward,her,and,bending,kissed,her,cheek
will,had,never,kissed,her,before,had,never,failed,to,precede,her,name,with,miss,and,while,it,surprised,her,it,warmed,her,heart,and,pleased,her,very,much
he,lifted,her,carefully,over,the,wheel,and,into,the,wagon,and,looking,down,she,saw,that,it,was,the,same,old,rickety,wagon,in,which,she,had,fled,from,atlanta
how,had,it,ever,held,together,so,long
will,must,have,kept,it,patched,up,very,well
it,made,her,slightly,sick,to,look,at,it,and,to,remember,that,night
if,it,took,the,shoes,off,her,feet,or,food,from,aunt,pitty's,table,she'd,see,that,there,was,a,new,wagon,at,tara,and,this,one,burned
will,did,not,speak,at,first,and,scarlett,was,grateful
he,threw,his,battered,straw,hat,into,the,back,of,the,wagon,clucked,to,the,horse,and,they,moved,off
will,was,just,the,same,lank,and,gangling,pink,of,hair,mild,of,eye,patient,as,a,draft,animal
they,left,the,village,behind,and,turned,into,the,red,road,to,tara
a,faint,pink,still,lingered,about,the,edges,of,the,sky,and,fat,feathery,clouds,were,tinged,with,gold,and,palest,green
the,stillness,of,the,country,twilight,came,down,about,them,as,calming,as,a,prayer
how,had,she,ever,borne,it,she,thought,away,for,all,these,months,away,from,the,fresh,smell,of,country,air,the,plowed,earth,and,the,sweetness,of,summer,nights
the,moist,red,earth,smelled,so,good,so,familiar,so,friendly,she,wanted,to,get,out,and,scoop,up,a,handful
the,honeysuckle,which,draped,the,gullied,red,sides,of,the,road,in,tangled,greenery,was,piercingly,fragrant,as,always,after,rain,the,sweetest,perfume,in,the,world
above,their,heads,a,flock,of,chimney,swallows,whirled,suddenly,on,swift,wings,and,now,and,then,a,rabbit,scurried,startled,across,the,road,his,white,tail,bobbing,like,an,eiderdown,powder,puff
she,saw,with,pleasure,that,the,cotton,stood,well,as,they,passed,between,plowed,fields,where,the,green,bushes,reared,themselves,sturdily,out,of,the,red,earth
how,beautiful,all,this,was
the,soft,gray,mist,in,the,swampy,bottoms,the,red,earth,and,growing,cotton,the,sloping,fields,with,curving,green,rows,and,the,black,pines,rising,behind,everything,like,sable,walls
how,had,she,ever,stayed,in,atlanta,so,long
scarlett,before,i,tell,you,about,mr,o'hara,and,i,want,to,tell,you,everything,before,you,get,home,i,want,to,ask,your,opinion,on,a,matter
i,figger,you're,the,head,of,the,house,now
what,is,it,will
he,turned,his,mild,sober,gaze,on,her,for,a,moment
i,just,wanted,your,approval,to,my,marryin',suellen
scarlett,clutched,the,seat,so,surprised,that,she,almost,fell,backwards
marry,suellen
she'd,never,thought,of,anybody,marrying,suellen,since,she,had,taken,frank,kennedy,from,her
who,would,have,suellen
goodness,will
then,i,take,it,you,don't,mind
mind
no,but,why,will,you've,taken,my,breath,away
you,marry,suellen
will,i,always,thought,you,were,sweet,on,carreen
will,kept,his,eyes,on,the,horse,and,flapped,the,reins
his,profile,did,not,change,but,she,thought,he,sighed,slightly
maybe,i,was,he,said
well,won't,she,have,you
i,never,asked,her
oh,will,you're,a,fool
ask,her
she's,worth,two,of,suellen
scarlett,you,don't,know,a,lot,of,things,that's,been,going,on,at,tara
you,ain't,favored,us,with,much,of,your,attention,these,last,months
i,haven't,haven't,i
she,flared
what,do,you,suppose,i've,been,doing,in,atlanta
riding,around,in,a,coach,and,four,and,going,to,balls
haven't,i,sent,you,money,every,month
haven't,i,paid,the,taxes,and,fixed,the,roof,and,bought,the,new,plow,and,the,mules
haven't
now,don't,fly,off,the,handle,and,get,your,irish,up,he,interrupted,imperturbably
if,anybody,knows,what,you've,done,i,do,and,it's,been,two,men's,work
slightly,mollified,she,questioned,well,then,what,do,you,mean
well,you've,kept,the,roof,over,us,and,food,in,the,pantry,and,i,ain't,denyin',that,but,you,ain't,given,much,thought,to,what's,been,goin',on,in,anybody's,head,here,at,tara
i,ain't,blamin',you,scarlett
that's,just,your,way
you,warn't,never,very,much,interested,in,what,was,in,folks',heads
but,what,i'm,tryin',to,tell,you,is,that,i,didn't,never,ask,miss,carreen,because,i,knew,it,wouldn't,be,no,use
she's,been,like,a,little,sister,to,me,and,i,guess,she,talks,to,me,plainer,than,to,anybody,in,the,world
but,she,never,got,over,that,dead,boy,and,she,never,will
and,i,might,as,well,tell,you,now,she's,aimin',to,go,in,a,convent,over,to,charleston
are,you,joking
well,i,knew,it,would,take,you,back,and,i,just,want,to,ask,you,scarlett,don't,you,argue,with,her,about,it,or,scold,her,or,laugh,at,her
let,her,go
it's,all,she,wants,now
her,heart's,broken
but,god's,nightgown
lots,of,people's,hearts,have,been,broken,and,they,didn't,run,off,to,convents
look,at,me
i,lost,a,husband
but,your,heart,warn't,broken,will,said,calmly,and,picking,up,a,straw,from,the,bottom,of,the,wagon,he,put,it,in,his,mouth,and,chewed,slowly
that,remark,took,the,wind,out,of,her
as,always,when,she,heard,the,truth,spoken,no,matter,how,unpalatable,it,was,basic,honesty,forced,her,to,acknowledge,it,as,truth
she,was,silent,a,moment,trying,to,accustom,herself,to,the,idea,of,carreen,as,a,nun
promise,you,won't,fuss,at,her
oh,well,i,promise,and,then,she,looked,at,him,with,a,new,understanding,and,some,amazement
will,had,loved,carreen,loved,her,now,enough,to,take,her,part,and,make,her,retreat,easy
and,yet,he,wanted,to,marry,suellen
well,what's,all,this,about,suellen
you,don't,care,for,her,do,you
oh,yes,i,do,in,a,way,he,said,removing,the,straw,and,surveying,it,as,if,it,were,highly,interesting
suellen,ain't,as,bad,as,you,think,scarlett
i,think,we'll,get,along,right,well
the,only,trouble,with,suellen,is,that,she,needs,a,husband,and,some,children,and,that's,just,what,every,woman,needs
the,wagon,jolted,over,the,rutty,road,and,for,a,few,minutes,while,the,two,sat,silent,scarlett's,mind,was,busy
there,must,be,something,more,to,it,than,appeared,on,the,surface,something,deeper,more,important,to,make,the,mild,and,soft-spoken,will,want,to,marry,a,complaining,nagger,like,suellen
you,haven't,told,me,the,real,reason,will
if,i'm,head,of,the,family,i've,got,a,right,to,know
that's,right,said,will,and,i,guess,you'll,understand
i,can't,leave,tara
it's,home,to,me,scarlett,the,only,real,home,i,ever,knew,and,i,love,every,stone,of,it
i've,worked,on,it,like,it,was,mine
and,when,you,put,out,work,on,somethin',you,come,to,love,it
you,know,what,i,mean
she,knew,what,he,meant,and,her,heart,went,out,in,a,surge,of,warm,affection,for,him,hearing,him,say,he,too,loved,the,thing,she,loved,best
and,i,figger,it,this,way
with,your,pa,gone,and,carreen,a,nun,there'll,be,just,me,and,suellen,left,here,and,of,course,i,couldn't,live,on,at,tara,without,marryin',suellen
you,know,how,folks,talk
but,but,will,there's,melanie,and,ashley
at,ashley's,name,he,turned,and,looked,at,her,his,pale,eyes,unfathomable
she,had,the,old,feeling,that,will,knew,all,about,her,and,ashley,understood,all,and,did,not,either,censure,or,approve
they'll,be,goin',soon
going
where
tara,is,their,home,as,well,as,yours
no,it,ain't,their,home
that's,just,what's,eatin',on,ashley
it,ain't,his,home,and,he,don't,feel,like,he's,earnin',his,keep
he's,a,mighty,pore,farmer,and,he,knows,it
god,knows,he,tries,his,best,but,he,warn't,cut,out,for,farmin',and,you,know,it,as,well,as,i,do
if,he,splits,kindlin',like,as,not,he'll,slice,off,his,foot
he,can't,no,more,keep,a,plow,straight,in,a,furrow,than,little,beau,can,and,what,he,don't,know,about,makin',things,grow,would,fill,a,book
it,ain't,his,fault
he,just,warn't,bred,for,it
and,it,worries,him,that,he's,a,man,livin',at,tara,on,a,woman's,charity,and,not,givin',much,in,return
charity
has,he,ever,said
no,he's,never,said,a,word
you,know,ashley
but,i,can,tell
last,night,when,we,were,sittin',up,with,your,pa,i,tole,him,i,had,asked,suellen,and,she'd,said,yes
and,then,ashley,said,that,relieved,him,because,he'd,been,feelin',like,a,dog,stayin',on,at,tara,and,he,knew,he,and,miss,melly,would,have,to,keep,stayin',on,now,that,mr,o'hara,was,dead,just,to,keep,folks,from,talkin',about,me,and,suellen
so,then,he,told,me,he,was,aimin',to,leave,tara,and,get,work
work
what,kind
where
i,don't,know,exactly,what,he'll,do,but,he,said,he,was,goin',up,north
he's,got,a,yankee,friend,in,new,york,who,wrote,him,about,workin',in,a,bank,up,there
oh,no
cried,scarlett,from,the,bottom,of,her,heart,and,at,the,cry,will,gave,her,the,same,look,as,before
maybe,'twould,be,better,all,'round,if,he,did,go,north
no
no
i,don't,think,so
her,mind,was,working,feverishly
ashley,couldn't,go,north
she,might,never,see,him,again
even,though,she,had,not,seen,him,in,months,had,not,spoken,to,him,alone,since,that,fateful,scene,in,the,orchard,there,had,not,been,a,day,when,she,had,not,thought,of,him,been,glad,he,was,sheltered,under,her,roof
she,had,never,sent,a,dollar,to,will,that,she,had,not,been,pleased,that,it,would,make,ashley's,life,easier
of,course,he,wasn't,any,good,as,a,farmer
ashley,was,bred,for,better,things,she,thought,proudly
he,was,born,to,rule,to,live,in,a,large,house,ride,fine,horses,read,books,of,poetry,and,tell,negroes,what,to,do
that,there,were,no,more,mansions,and,horses,and,negroes,and,few,books,did,not,alter,matters
ashley,wasn't,bred,to,plow,and,split,rails
no,wonder,he,wanted,to,leave,tara
but,she,could,not,let,him,go,away,from,georgia
if,necessary,she,would,bully,frank,into,giving,him,a,job,in,the,store,make,frank,turn,off,the,boy,he,now,had,behind,the,counter
but,no,ashley's,place,was,no,more,behind,a,counter,than,it,was,behind,a,plow

then,mrs,macintosh,gave,herself,a,lot,of,airs,and,said,as,how,her,husband,had,put,in,a,claim,with,the,federal,government,for,destroyin',the,property,of,a,loyal,union,sympathizer,who,had,never,given,aid,and,comfort,to,the,confederacy,in,any,shape,or,form

everything,was,fresh,and,dewy,and,silent,and,green,and,the,sight,of,the,cotton,fields,brought,a,measure,of,balm,and,comfort,to,her,sore,heart
tara,at,sunrise,looked,loved,well,tended,and,at,peace,for,all,that,its,master,lay,dead
the,squatty,log,chicken,house,was,clay,daubed,against,rats,weasels,and,clean,with,whitewash,and,so,was,the,log,stable
the,garden,with,its,rows,of,corn,bright-yellow,squash,butter,beans,and,turnips,was,well,weeded,and,neatly,fenced,with,split-oak,rails
the,orchard,was,cleared,of,underbrush,and,only,daisies,grew,beneath,the,long,rows,of,trees
the,sun,picked,out,with,faint,glistening,the,apples,and,the,furred,pink,peaches,half,hidden,in,the,green,leaves
beyond,lay,the,curving,rows,of,cotton,still,and,green,under,the,gold,of,the,new,sky
the,ducks,and,chickens,were,waddling,and,strutting,off,toward,the,fields,for,under,the,bushes,in,the,soft,plowed,earth,were,found,the,choicest,worms,and,slugs
scarlett's,heart,swelled,with,affection,and,gratitude,to,will,who,had,done,all,of,this
even,her,loyalty,to,ashley,could,not,make,her,believe,he,had,been,responsible,for,much,of,this,well-being,for,tara's,bloom,was,not,the,work,of,a,planter-aristocrat,but,of,the,plodding,tireless,small,farmer,who,loved,his,land
it,was,a,two-horse,farm,not,the,lordly,plantation,of,other,days,with,pastures,full,of,mules,and,fine,horses,and,cotton,and,corn,stretching,as,far,as,eye,could,see
but,what,there,was,of,it,was,good,and,the,acres,that,were,lying,fallow,could,be,reclaimed,when,times,grew,better,and,they,would,be,the,more,fertile,for,their,rest
will,had,done,more,than,merely,farm,a,few,acres
he,had,kept,sternly,at,bay,those,two,enemies,of,georgia,planters,the,seedling,pine,and,the,blackberry,brambles
they,had,not,stealthily,taken,garden,and,pasture,and,cotton,field,and,lawn,and,reared,themselves,insolently,by,the,porches,of,tara,as,they,were,doing,on,numberless,plantations,throughout,the,state
scarlett's,heart,failed,a,beat,when,she,thought,how,close,tara,had,come,to,going,back,to,wilderness
between,herself,and,will,they,had,done,a,good,job
they,had,held,off,the,yankees,the,carpetbaggers,and,the,encroachments,of,nature
and,best,of,all,will,had,told,her,that,after,the,cotton,came,in,in,the,fall,she,need,send,no,more,money,unless,some,other,carpetbagger,coveted,tara,and,skyrocketed,the,taxes
scarlett,knew,will,would,have,a,hard,pull,without,her,help,but,she,admired,and,respected,his,independence
as,long,as,he,was,in,the,position,of,hired,help,he,would,take,her,money,but,now,that,he,was,to,become,her,brother-in-,law,and,the,man,of,the,house,he,intended,to,stand,on,his,own,efforts
yes,will,was,something,the,lord,had,provided
pork,had,dug,the,grave,the,night,before,close,by,ellen's,grave,and,he,stood,spade,in,hand,behind,the,moist,red,clay,he,was,soon,to,shovel,back,in,place
scarlett,stood,behind,him,in,the,patchy,shade,of,a,gnarled,low-limbed,cedar,the,hot,sun,of,the,june,morning,dappling,her,and,tried,to,keep,her,eyes,away,from,the,red,trench,in,front,of,her
jim,tarleton,little,hugh,munroe,alex,fontaine,and,old,man,mcrae's,youngest,grandson,came,slowly,and,awkwardly,down,the,path,from,the,house,bearing,gerald's,coffin,on,two,lengths,of,split,oak
behind,them,at,a,respectful,distance,followed,a,large,straggling,crowd,of,neighbors,and,friends,shabbily,dressed,silent
as,they,came,down,the,sunny,path,through,the,garden,pork,bowed,his,head,upon,the,top,of,the,spade,handle,and,cried,and,scarlett,saw,with,incurious,surprise,that,the,kinks,on,his,head,so,jettily,black,when,she,went,to,atlanta,a,few,months,before,were,now,grizzled
she,thanked,god,tiredly,that,she,had,cried,all,her,tears,the,night,before,so,now,she,could,stand,erect,and,dry,eyed
the,sound,of,suellen's,tears,just,back,of,her,shoulder,irritated,her,unbearably,and,she,had,to,clench,her,fists,to,keep,from,turning,and,slapping,the,swollen,face
sue,had,been,the,cause,of,her,father's,death,whether,she,intended,it,or,not,and,she,should,have,the,decency,to,control,herself,in,front,of,the,hostile,neighbors
not,a,single,person,had,spoken,to,her,that,morning,or,given,her,one,look,of,sympathy
they,had,kissed,scarlett,quietly,shaken,her,hand,murmured,kind,words,to,carreen,and,even,to,pork,but,had,looked,through,suellen,as,if,she,were,not,there
to,them,she,had,done,worse,than,murder,her,father
she,had,tried,to,betray,him,into,disloyalty,to,the,south
and,to,that,grim,and,close-knit,community,it,was,as,if,she,had,tried,to,betray,the,honor,of,them,all
she,had,broken,the,solid,front,the,county,presented,to,the,world
by,her,attempt,to,get,money,from,the,yankee,government,she,had,aligned,herself,with,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,more,hated,enemies,than,the,yankee,soldiers,had,ever,been
she,a,member,of,an,old,and,staunchly,confederate,family,a,planter's,family,had,gone,over,to,the,enemy,and,by,so,doing,had,brought,shame,on,every,family,in,the,county
the,mourners,were,seething,with,indignation,and,downcast,with,sorrow,especially,three,of,them,old,man,mcrae,who,had,been,gerald's,crony,since,he,came,to,the,up-country,from,savannah,so,many,years,before,grandma,fontaine,who,loved,him,because,he,was,ellen's,husband,and,mrs,tarleton,who,had,been,closer,to,him,than,to,any,of,her,neighbors,because,as,she,often,said,he,was,the,only,man,in,the,county,who,knew,a,stallion,from,a,gelding
the,sight,of,the,stormy,faces,of,these,three,in,the,dim,parlor,where,gerald,lay,before,the,funeral,had,caused,ashley,and,will,some,uneasiness,and,they,had,retired,to,ellen's,office,for,a,consultation
some,of,them,are,goin',to,say,somethin',about,suellen,said,will,abruptly,biting,his,straw,in,half
they,think,they,got,just,cause,to,say,somethin'
maybe,they,have
it,ain't,for,me,to,say
but,ashley,whether,they're,right,or,not,we'll,have,to,resent,it,bein',the,men,of,the,family,and,then,there'll,be,trouble
can't,nobody,do,nothin',with,old,man,mcrae,because,he's,deaf,as,a,post,and,can't,hear,folks,tryin',to,shut,him,up
and,you,know,there,ain't,nobody,in,god's,world,ever,stopped,grandma,fontaine,from,speakin',her,mind
and,as,for,mrs,tarleton,did,you,see,her,roll,them,russet,eyes,of,hers,every,time,she,looked,at,sue
she's,got,her,ears,laid,back,and,can't,hardly,wait
if,they,say,somethin',we,got,to,take,it,up,and,we,got,enough,trouble,at,tara,now,without,bein',at,outs,with,our,neighbors
ashley,sighed,worriedly
he,knew,the,tempers,of,his,neighbors,better,than,will,did,and,he,remembered,that,fully,half,of,the,quarrels,and,some,of,the,shootings,of,the,days,before,the,war,had,risen,from,the,county,custom,of,saying,a,few,words,over,the,coffins,of,departed,neighbors
generally,the,words,were,eulogistic,in,the,extreme,but,occasionally,they,were,not
sometimes,words,meant,in,the,utmost,respect,were,misconstrued,by,overstrung,relatives,of,the,dead,and,scarcely,were,the,last,shovels,of,earth,mounded,above,the,coffin,before,trouble,began
in,the,absence,of,a,priest,ashley,was,to,conduct,the,services,with,the,aid,of,carreen's,book,of,devotions,the,assistance,of,the,methodist,and,baptist,preachers,of,jonesboro,and,fayetteville,having,been,tactfully,refused
carreen,more,devoutly,catholic,than,her,sisters,had,been,very,upset,that,scarlett,had,neglected,to,bring,a,priest,from,atlanta,with,her,and,had,only,been,a,little,eased,by,the,reminder,that,when,the,priest,came,down,to,marry,will,and,suellen,he,could,read,the,services,over,gerald
it,was,she,who,objected,to,the,neighboring,protestant,preachers,and,gave,the,matter,into,ashley's,hands,marking,passages,in,her,book,for,him,to,read
ashley,leaning,against,the,old,secretary,knew,that,the,responsibility,for,preventing,trouble,lay,with,him,and,knowing,the,hair-trigger,tempers,of,the,county,was,at,a,loss,as,to,how,to,proceed
there's,no,help,for,it,will,he,said,rumpling,his,bright,hair
i,can't,knock,grandma,fontaine,down,or,old,man,mcrae,either,and,i,can't,hold,my,hand,over,mrs,tarleton's,mouth
and,the,mildest,thing,they'll,say,is,that,suellen,is,a,murderess,and,a,traitor,and,but,for,her,mr,o'hara,would,still,be,alive
damn,this,custom,of,speaking,over,the,dead
it's,barbarous
look,ash,said,will,slowly
i,ain't,aimin',to,have,nobody,say,nothin',against,suellen,no,matter,what,they,think
you,leave,it,to,me
when,you've,finished,with,the,readin',and,the,prayin',and,you,say,'if,anyone,would,like,to,say,a,few,words,',you,look,right,at,me,so,i,can,speak,first
but,scarlett,watching,the,pallbearers',difficulty,in,getting,the,coffin,through,the,narrow,entrance,into,the,burying,ground,had,no,thought,of,trouble,to,come,after,the,funeral
she,was,thinking,with,a,leaden,heart,that,in,burying,gerald,she,was,burying,one,of,the,last,links,that,joined,her,to,the,old,days,of,happiness,and,irresponsibility
finally,the,pallbearers,set,the,coffin,down,near,the,grave,and,stood,clenching,and,unclenching,their,aching,fingers
ashley,melanie,and,will,filed,into,the,inclosure,and,stood,behind,the,o'hara,girls
all,the,closer,neighbors,who,could,crowd,in,were,behind,them,and,the,others,stood,outside,the,brick,wall
scarlett,really,seeing,them,for,the,first,time,was,surprised,and,touched,by,the,size,of,the,crowd
with,transportation,so,limited,it,was,kind,of,so,many,to,come
there,were,fifty,or,sixty,people,there,some,of,them,from,so,far,away,she,wondered,how,they,had,heard,in,time,to,come
there,were,whole,families,from,jonesboro,and,fayetteville,and,lovejoy,and,with,them,a,few,negro,servants
many,small,farmers,from,far,across,the,river,were,present,and,crackers,from,the,backwoods,and,a,scattering,of,swamp,folk
the,swamp,men,were,lean,bearded,giants,in,homespun,coon-skin,caps,on,their,heads,their,rifles,easy,in,the,crooks,of,their,arms,their,wads,of,tobacco,stilled,in,their,cheeks
their,women,were,with,them,their,bare,feet,sunk,in,the,soft,red,earth,their,lower,lips,full,of,snuff
their,faces,beneath,their,sun-bonnets,were,sallow,and,malarial-,looking,but,shining,clean,and,their,freshly,ironed,calicoes,glistened,with,starch
the,near,neighbors,were,there,in,full,force
grandma,fontaine,withered,wrinkled,and,yellow,as,an,old,molted,bird,was,leaning,on,her,cane,and,behind,her,were,sally,munroe,fontaine,and,young,miss,fontaine
they,were,trying,vainly,by,whispered,pleas,and,jerks,at,her,skirt,to,make,the,old,lady,sit,down,on,the,brick,wall
grandma's,husband,the,old,doctor,was,not,there
he,had,died,two,months,before,and,much,of,the,bright,malicious,joy,of,life,had,gone,from,her,old,eyes
cathleen,calvert,hilton,stood,alone,as,befitted,one,whose,husband,had,helped,bring,about,the,present,tragedy,her,faded,sunbonnet,hiding,her,bowed,face
scarlett,saw,with,amazement,that,her,percale,dress,had,grease,spots,on,it,and,her,hands,were,freckled,and,unclean
there,were,even,black,crescents,under,her,fingernails
there,was,nothing,of,quality,folks,about,cathleen,now
she,looked,cracker,even,worse
she,looked,poor,white,shiftless,slovenly,trifling
she'll,be,dipping,snuff,soon,if,she,isn't,doing,it,already,thought,scarlett,in,horror
good,lord
what,a,comedown
she,shuddered,turning,her,eyes,from,cathleen,as,she,realized,how,narrow,was,the,chasm,between,quality,folk,and,poor,whites
there,but,for,a,lot,of,gumption,am,i,she,thought,and,pride,surged,through,her,as,she,realized,that,she,and,cathleen,had,started,with,the,same,equipment,after,the,surrender,empty,hands,and,what,they,had,in,their,heads
i,haven't,done,so,bad,she,thought,lifting,her,chin,and,smiling
but,she,stopped,in,mid-smile,as,she,saw,the,scandalized,eyes,of,mrs,tarleton,upon,her
her,eyes,were,red-rimmed,from,tears,and,after,giving,scarlett,a,reproving,look,she,turned,her,gaze,back,to,suellen,a,fierce,angry,gaze,that,boded,ill,for,her
behind,her,and,her,husband,were,the,four,tarleton,girls,their,red,locks,indecorous,notes,in,the,solemn,occasion,their,russet,eyes,still,looking,like,the,eyes,of,vital,young,animals,spirited,and,dangerous
feet,were,stilled,hats,were,removed,hands,folded,and,skirts,rustled,into,quietness,as,ashley,stepped,forward,with,carreen's,worn,book,of,devotions,in,his,hand
he,stood,for,a,moment,looking,down,the,sun,glittering,on,his,golden,head
a,deep,silence,fell,on,the,crowd,so,deep,that,the,harsh,whisper,of,the,wind,in,the,magnolia,leaves,came,clear,to,their,ears,and,the,far-off,repetitious,note,of,a,mockingbird,sounded,unendurably,loud,and,sad
ashley,began,to,read,the,prayers,and,all,heads,bowed,as,his,resonant,beautifully,modulated,voice,rolled,out,the,brief,and,dignified,words
oh
thought,scarlett,her,throat,constricting
how,beautiful,his,voice,is
if,anyone,has,to,do,this,for,pa,i'm,glad,it's,ashley
i'd,rather,have,him,than,a,priest
i'd,rather,have,pa,buried,by,one,of,his,own,folks,than,a,stranger
when,ashley,came,to,the,part,of,the,prayers,concerning,the,souls,in,purgatory,which,carreen,had,marked,for,him,to,read,he,abruptly,closed,the,book
only,carreen,noticed,the,omission,and,looked,up,puzzled,as,he,began,the,lord's,prayer
ashley,knew,that,half,the,people,present,had,never,heard,of,purgatory,and,those,who,had,would,take,it,as,a,personal,affront,if,he,insinuated,even,in,prayer,that,so,fine,a,man,as,mr,o'hara,had,not,gone,straight,to,heaven
so,in,deference,to,public,opinion,he,skipped,all,mention,of,purgatory
the,gathering,joined,heartily,in,the,lord's,prayer,but,their,voices,trailed,off,into,embarrassed,silence,when,he,began,the,hail,mary
they,had,never,heard,that,prayer,and,they,looked,furtively,at,each,other,as,the,o'hara,girls,melanie,and,the,tara,servants,gave,the,response,pray,for,us,now,and,at,the,hour,of,our,death
amen
then,ashley,raised,his,head,and,stood,for,a,moment,uncertain
the,eyes,of,the,neighbors,were,expectantly,upon,him,as,they,settled,themselves,in,easier,positions,for,a,long,harangue
they,were,waiting,for,him,to,go,on,with,the,service,for,it,did,not,occur,to,any,of,them,that,he,was,at,the,end,of,the,catholic,prayers
county,funerals,were,always,long
the,baptist,and,methodist,ministers,who,performed,them,had,no,set,prayers,but,extemporized,as,the,circumstances,demanded,and,seldom,stopped,before,all,mourners,were,in,tears,and,the,bereaved,feminine,relatives,screaming,with,grief
the,neighbors,would,have,been,shocked,aggrieved,and,indignant,had,these,brief,prayers,been,all,the,service,over,the,body,of,their,loved,friend,and,no,one,knew,this,better,than,ashley
the,matter,would,be,discussed,at,dinner,tables,for,weeks,and,the,opinion,of,the,county,would,be,that,the,o'hara,girls,had,not,shown,proper,respect,for,their,father
so,he,threw,a,quick,apologetic,glance,at,carreen,and,bowing,his,head,again,began,reciting,from,memory,the,episcopal,burial,service,which,he,had,often,read,over,slaves,buried,at,twelve,oaks
i,am,the,resurrection,and,the,life
and,whosoever
believeth,in,me,shall,never,die
it,did,not,come,back,to,him,readily,and,he,spoke,slowly,occasionally,falling,silent,for,a,space,as,he,waited,for,phrases,to,rise,from,his,memory
but,this,measured,delivery,made,his,words,more,impressive,and,mourners,who,had,been,dry-eyed,before,began,now,to,reach,for,handkerchiefs
sturdy,baptists,and,methodists,all,they,thought,it,the,catholic,ceremony,and,immediately,rearranged,their,first,opinion,that,the,catholic,services,were,cold,and,popish
scarlett,and,suellen,were,equally,ignorant,and,thought,the,words,comforting,and,beautiful
only,melanie,and,carreen,realized,that,a,devoutly,catholic,irishman,was,being,laid,to,rest,by,the,church,of,england's,service
and,carreen,was,too,stunned,by,grief,and,her,hurt,at,ashley's,treachery,to,interfere
when,he,had,finished,ashley,opened,wide,his,sad,gray,eyes,and,looked,about,the,crowd
after,a,pause,his,eyes,caught,those,of,will,and,he,said,is,there,anyone,present,who,would,like,to,say,a,word
mrs,tarleton,twitched,nervously,but,before,she,could,act,will,stumped,forward,and,standing,at,the,head,of,the,coffin,began,to,speak
friends,he,began,in,his,flat,voice,maybe,you,think,i'm,gettin',above,myself,speakin',first,me,who,never,knew,mr,o'hara,till,'bout,a,year,ago,when,you,all,have,known,him,twenty,years,or,more
but,this,here,is,my,excuse
if,he'd,lived,a,month,or,so,longer,i'd,have,had,the,right,to,call,him,pa
a,startled,ripple,went,over,the,crowd
they,were,too,well,bred,to,whisper,but,they,shifted,on,their,feet,and,stared,at,carreen's,bowed,head
everyone,knew,his,dumb,devotion,to,her
seeing,the,direction,in,which,all,eyes,were,cast,will,went,on,as,if,he,had,taken,no,note
so,bein',as,how,i'm,to,marry,miss,suellen,as,soon,as,the,priest,comes,down,from,atlanta,i,thought,maybe,that,gives,me,the,right,to,speak,first
the,last,part,of,his,speech,was,lost,in,a,faint,sibilant,buzz,that,went,through,the,gathering,an,angry,beelike,buzz
there,were,indignation,and,disappointment,in,the,sound
everyone,liked,will,everyone,respected,him,for,what,he,had,done,for,tara
everyone,knew,his,affections,lay,with,carreen,so,the,news,that,he,was,to,marry,the,neighborhood,pariah,instead,sat,ill,upon,them
good,old,will,marrying,that,nasty,sneaking,little,suellen,o'hara
for,a,moment,the,air,was,tense
mrs,tarleton's,eyes,began,to,snap,and,her,lips,to,shape,soundless,words
in,the,silence,old,man,mcrae's,high,voice,could,be,heard,imploring,his,grandson,to,tell,him,what,had,been,said
will,faced,them,all,still,mild,of,face,but,there,was,something,in,his,pale,blue,eyes,which,dared,them,to,say,one,word,about,his,future,wife
for,a,moment,the,balance,hung,between,the,honest,affection,everyone,had,for,will,and,their,contempt,for,suellen
and,will,won
he,continued,as,if,his,pause,had,been,a,natural,one
i,never,knew,mr,o'hara,in,his,prime,like,you,all,done
all,i,knew,personally,was,a,fine,old,gentleman,who,was,a,mite,addled
but,i've,heard,tell,from,you,all,'bout,what,he,used,to,be,like
and,i,want,to,say,this
he,was,a,fightin',irishman,and,a,southern,gentleman,and,as,loyal,a,confederate,as,ever,lived
you,can't,get,no,better,combination,than,that
and,we,ain't,likely,to,see,many,more,like,him,because,the,times,that,bred,men,like,him,are,as,dead,as,he,is
he,was,born,in,a,furrin,country,but,the,man,we're,buryin',here,today,was,more,of,a,georgian,than,any,of,us,mournin',him
he,lived,our,life,he,loved,our,land,and,when,you,come,right,down,to,it,he,died,for,our,cause,same,as,the,soldiers,did
he,was,one,of,us,and,he,had,our,good,points,and,our,bad,points,and,he,had,our,strength,and,he,had,our,failin's
he,had,our,good,points,in,that,couldn't,nothin',stop,him,when,his,mind,was,made,up,and,he,warn't,scared,of,nothin',that,walked,in,shoe,leather
there,warn't,nothin',that,come,to,him,from,the,outside,that,could,lick,him
he,warn't,scared,of,the,english,government,when,they,wanted,to,hang,him
he,just,lit,out,and,left,home
and,when,he,come,to,this,country,and,was,pore,that,didn't,scare,him,a,mite,neither
he,went,to,work,and,he,made,his,money
and,he,warn't,scared,to,tackle,this,section,when,it,was,part,wild,and,the,injuns,had,just,been,run,out,of,it
he,made,a,big,plantation,out,of,a,wilderness
and,when,the,war,come,on,and,his,money,begun,to,go,he,warn't,scared,to,be,pore,again
and,when,the,yankees,come,through,tara,and,might,of,burnt,him,out,or,killed,him,he,warn't,fazed,a,bit,and,he,warn't,licked,neither
he,just,planted,his,front,feet,and,stood,his,ground
that's,why,i,say,he,had,our,good,points
there,ain't,nothin',from,the,outside,can,lick,any,of,us
but,he,had,our,failin's,too,'cause,he,could,be,licked,from,the,inside
i,mean,to,say,that,what,the,whole,world,couldn't,do,his,own,heart,could
when,mrs,o'hara,died,his,heart,died,too,and,he,was,licked
and,what,we,seen,walking,'round,here,warn't,him
will,paused,and,his,eyes,went,quietly,around,the,circle,of,faces
the,crowd,stood,in,the,hot,sun,as,if,enchanted,to,the,ground,and,whatever,wrath,they,had,felt,for,suellen,was,forgotten
will's,eyes,rested,for,a,moment,on,scarlett,and,they,crinkled,slightly,at,the,corners,as,if,he,were,inwardly,smiling,comfort,to,her
scarlett,who,had,been,fighting,back,rising,tears,did,feel,comforted
will,was,talking,common,sense,instead,of,a,lot,of,tootle,about,reunions,in,another,and,better,world,and,submitting,her,will,to,god's
and,scarlett,had,always,found,strength,and,comfort,in,common,sense
and,i,don't,want,none,of,you,to,think,the,less,of,him,for,breakin',like,he,done
all,you,all,and,me,too,are,like,him
we,got,the,same,weakness,and,failin'
there,ain't,nothin',that,walks,can,lick,us,any,more,than,it,could,lick,him,not,yankees,nor,carpetbaggers,nor,hard,times,nor,high,taxes,nor,even,downright,starvation
but,that,weakness,that's,in,our,hearts,can,lick,us,in,the,time,it,takes,to,bat,your,eye
it,ain't,always,losin',someone,you,love,that,does,it,like,it,done,mr,o'hara
everybody's,mainspring,is,different
and,i,want,to,say,this,folks,whose,main-springs,are,busted,are,better,dead
there,ain't,no,place,for,them,in,the,world,these,days,and,they're,happier,bein',dead
that's,why,i'm,sayin',you,all,ain't,got,no,cause,to,grieve,for,mr,o'hara,now
the,time,to,grieve,was,back,when,sherman,come,through,and,he,lost,mrs,o'hara
now,that,his,body's,gone,to,join,his,heart,i,don't,see,that,we,got,reason,to,mourn,unless,we're,pretty,damned,selfish,and,i'm,sayin',it,who,loved,him,like,he,was,my,own,pa
there,won't,be,no,more,words,said,if,you,folks,don't,mind
the,family,is,too,cut,up,to,listen,and,it,wouldn't,be,no,kindness,to,them
will,stopped,and,turning,to,mrs,tarleton,he,said,in,a,lower,voice,i,wonder,couldn't,you,take,scarlett,in,the,house,ma'm
it,ain't,right,for,her,to,be,standin',in,the,sun,so,long
and,grandma,fontaine,don't,look,any,too,peart,neither,meanin',no,disrespect
startled,at,the,abrupt,switching,from,the,eulogy,to,herself,scarlett,went,red,with,embarrassment,as,all,eyes,turned,toward,her
why,should,will,advertise,her,already,obvious,pregnancy
she,gave,him,a,shamed,indignant,look,but,will's,placid,gaze,bore,her,down
please,his,look,said
i,know,what,i'm,doin'
already,he,was,the,man,of,the,house,and,not,wishing,to,make,a,scene,scarlett,turned,helplessly,to,mrs,tarleton
that,lady,suddenly,diverted,as,will,had,intended,from,thoughts,of,suellen,to,the,always,fascinating,matter,of,breeding,be,it,animal,or,human,took,scarlett's,arm
come,in,the,house,honey
her,face,took,on,a,look,of,kind,absorbed,interest,and,scarlett,suffered,herself,to,be,led,through,the,crowd,that,gave,way,and,made,a,narrow,path,for,her
there,was,a,sympathetic,murmuring,as,she,passed,and,several,hands,went,out,to,pat,her,comfortingly
when,she,came,abreast,grandma,fontaine,the,old,lady,put,out,a,skinny,claw,and,said,give,me,your,arm,child,and,added,with,a,fierce,glance,at,sally,and,young,miss,no,don't,you,come
i,don't,want,you
they,passed,slowly,through,the,crowd,which,closed,behind,them,and,went,up,the,shady,path,toward,the,house,mrs,tarleton's,eager,helping,hand,so,strong,under,scarlett's,elbow,that,she,was,almost,lifted,from,the,ground,at,each,step
now,why,did,will,do,that
cried,scarlett,heatedly,when,they,were,out,of,earshot
he,practically,said,'look,at,her
she's,going,to,have,a,baby,'
well,sake's,alive,you,are,aren't,you
said,mrs,tarleton
will,did,right
it,was,foolish,of,you,to,stand,in,the,hot,sun,when,you,might,have,fainted,and,had,a,miscarriage
will,wasn't,bothered,about,her,miscarrying,said,grandma,a,little,breathless,as,she,labored,across,the,front,yard,toward,the,steps
there,was,a,grim,knowing,smile,on,her,face
will's,smart
he,didn't,want,either,you,or,me,beetrice,at,the,graveside
he,was,scared,of,what,we'd,say,and,he,knew,this,was,the,only,way,to,get,rid,of,us
and,it,was,more,than,that
he,didn't,want,scarlett,to,hear,the,clods,dropping,on,the,coffin
and,he's,right
just,remember,scarlett,as,long,as,you,don't,hear,that,sound,folks,aren't,actually,dead,to,you
but,once,you,hear,it
well,it's,the,most,dreadfully,final,sound,in,the,world
help,me,up,the,steps,child,and,give,me,a,hand,beetrice
scarlett,don't,any,more,need,your,arm,than,she,needs,crutches,and,i'm,not,so,peart,as,will,observed
will,knew,you,were,your,father's,pet,and,he,didn't,want,to,make,it,worse,for,you,than,it,already,was
he,figured,it,wouldn't,be,so,bad,for,your,sisters
suellen,has,her,shame,to,sustain,her,and,carreen,her,god
but,you've,got,nothing,to,sustain,you,have,you,child
no,answered,scarlett,helping,the,old,lady,up,the,steps,faintly,surprised,at,the,truth,that,sounded,in,the,reedy,old,voice
i've,never,had,anything,to,sustain,me,except,mother
but,when,you,lost,her,you,found,you,could,stand,alone,didn't,you
well,some,folks,can't
your,pa,was,one
will's,right
don't,you,grieve
he,couldn't,get,along,without,ellen,and,he's,happier,where,he,is
just,like,i'll,be,happier,when,i,join,the,old,doctor
she,spoke,without,any,desire,for,sympathy,and,the,two,gave,her,none
she,spoke,as,briskly,and,naturally,as,if,her,husband,were,alive,and,in,jonesboro,and,a,short,buggy,ride,would,bring,them,together
grandma,was,too,old,and,had,seen,too,much,to,fear,death
but,you,can,stand,alone,too,said,scarlett
yes,but,it's,powerful,uncomfortable,at,times
look,here,grandma,interrupted,mrs,tarleton,you,ought,not,to,talk,to,scarlett,like,that
she's,upset,enough,already
what,with,her,trip,down,here,and,that,tight,dress,and,her,grief,and,the,heat,she's,got,enough,to,make,her,miscarry,without,your,adding,to,it,talking,grief,and,sorrow
god's,nightgown
cried,scarlett,in,irritation
i'm,not,upset
and,i'm,not,one,of,those,sickly,miscarrying,fools
you,never,can,tell,said,mrs,tarleton,omnisciently
i,lost,my,first,when,i,saw,a,bull,gore,one,of,our,darkies,and,you,remember,my,red,mare,nellie
now,there,was,the,healthiest-looking,mare,you,ever,saw,but,she,was,nervous,and,high,strung,and,if,i,didn't,watch,her,she'd
beetrice,hush,said,grandma
scarlett,wouldn't,miscarry,on,a,bet
let's,us,sit,here,in,the,hall,where,it's,cool
there's,a,nice,draft,through,here
now,you,go,fetch,us,a,glass,of,buttermilk,beetrice,if,there's,any,in,the,kitchen
or,look,in,the,pantry,and,see,if,there's,any,wine
i,could,do,with,a,glass
we'll,sit,here,till,the,folks,come,up,to,say,goodby
scarlett,ought,to,be,in,bed,insisted,mrs,tarleton,running,her,eyes,over,her,with,the,expert,air,of,one,who,calculated,a,pregnancy,to,the,last,minute,of,its,length
get,going,said,grandma,giving,her,a,prod,with,her,cane,and,mrs,tarleton,went,toward,the,kitchen,throwing,her,hat,carelessly,on,the,sideboard,and,running,her,hands,through,her,damp,red,hair
scarlett,lay,back,in,her,chair,and,unbuttoned,the,two,top,buttons,of,her,tight,basque
it,was,cool,and,dim,in,the,high-ceilinged,hall,and,the,vagrant,draft,that,went,from,back,to,front,of,the,house,was,refreshing,after,the,heat,of,the,sun
she,looked,across,the,hall,into,the,parlor,where,gerald,had,lain,and,wrenching,her,thoughts,from,him,looked,up,at,the,portrait,of,grandma,robillard,hanging,above,the,fireplace
the,bayonet-scarred,portrait,with,its,high-piled,hair,hall-exposed,breasts,and,cool,insolence,had,as,always,a,tonic,effect,upon,her
i,don't,know,which,hit,beetrice,tarleton,worse,losing,her,boys,or,her,horses,said,grandma,fontaine
she,never,did,pay,much,mind,to,jim,or,her,girls,you,know
she's,one,of,those,folks,will,was,talking,about
her,mainspring's,busted
sometimes,i,wonder,if,she,won't,go,the,way,your,pa,went
she,wasn't,ever,happy,unless,horses,or,humans,were,breeding,right,in,her,face,and,none,of,her,girls,are,married,or,got,any,prospects,of,catching,husbands,in,this,county,so,she's,got,nothing,to,occupy,her,mind
if,she,wasn't,such,lady,at,heart,she'd,be,downright,common
was,will,telling,the,truth,about,marrying,suellen
yes,said,scarlett,looking,the,old,lady,full,in,the,eye
goodness,she,could,remember,the,time,when,she,was,scared,to,death,of,grandma,fontaine
well,she'd,grown,up,since,then,and,she'd,just,as,soon,as,not,tell,her,to,go,to,the,devil,if,she,meddled,in,affairs,at,tara
he,could,do,better,said,grandma,candidly
indeed
said,scarlett,haughtily
come,off,your,high,horse,miss,said,the,old,lady,tartly
i,shan't,attack,your,precious,sister,though,i,might,have,if,i'd,stayed,at,the,burying,ground
what,i,mean,is,with,the,scarcity,of,men,in,the,neighborhood,will,could,marry,most,any,of,the,girls
there's,beetrice's,four,wild,cats,and,the,munroe,girls,and,the,mcrae
he's,going,to,marry,sue,and,that's,that
she's,lucky,to,get,him
tara,is,lucky,to,get,him
you,love,this,place,don't,you
yes
so,much,that,you,don't,mind,your,sister,marrying,out,of,her,class,as,long,as,you,have,a,man,around,to,care,for,tara
class
said,scarlett,startled,at,the,idea
class
what,does,class,matter,now,so,long,as,a,girl,gets,a,husband,who,can,take,care,of,her
that's,a,debatable,question,said,old,miss
some,folks,would,say,you,were,talking,common,sense
others,would,say,you,were,letting,down,bars,that,ought,never,be,lowered,one,inch
will's,certainly,not,quality,folks,and,some,of,your,people,were
her,sharp,old,eyes,went,to,the,portrait,of,grandma,robillard
scarlett,thought,of,will,lank,unimpressive,mild,eternally,chewing,a,straw,his,whole,appearance,deceptively,devoid,of,energy,like,that,of,most,crackers
he,did,not,have,behind,him,a,long,line,of,ancestors,of,wealth,prominence,and,blood
the,first,of,will's,family,to,set,foot,on,georgia,soil,might,even,have,been,one,of,oglethorpe's,debtors,or,a,bond,servant
will,had,not,been,to,college
in,fact,four,years,in,a,backwoods,school,was,all,the,education,he,had,ever,had
he,was,honest,and,he,was,loyal,he,was,patient,and,he,was,hard,working,but,certainly,he,was,not,quality
undoubtedly,by,robillard,standards,suellen,was,coming,down,in,the,world
so,you,approve,of,will,coming,into,your,family
yes,answered,scarlett,fiercely,ready,to,pounce,upon,the,old,lady,at,the,first,words,of,condemnation
you,may,kiss,me,said,grandma,surprisingly,and,she,smiled,in,her,most,approving,manner
i,never,liked,you,much,till,now,scarlett
you,were,always,hard,as,a,hickory,nut,even,as,a,child,and,i,don't,like,hard,females,barring,myself
but,i,do,like,the,way,you,meet,things
you,don't,make,a,fuss,about,things,that,can't,be,helped,even,if,they,are,disagreeable
you,take,your,fences,cleanly,like,a,good,hunter
scarlett,smiled,uncertainly,and,pecked,obediently,at,the,withered,cheek,presented,to,her
it,was,pleasant,to,hear,approving,words,again,even,if,she,had,little,idea,what,they,meant
there's,plenty,of,folks,hereabouts,who'll,have,something,to,say,about,you,letting,sue,marry,a,cracker,for,all,that,everybody,likes,will
they'll,say,in,one,breath,what,a,fine,man,he,is,and,how,terrible,it,is,for,an,o'hara,girl,to,marry,beneath,her
but,don't,you,let,it,bother,you
i've,never,bothered,about,what,people,said
so,i've,heard
there,was,a,hint,of,acid,in,the,old,voice
well,don't,bother,about,what,folks,say
it'll,probably,be,a,very,successful,marriage
of,course,will's,always,going,to,look,like,a,cracker,and,marriage,won't,improve,his,grammar,any
and,even,if,he,makes,a,mint,of,money,he'll,never,lend,any,shine,and,sparkle,to,tara,like,your,father,did
crackers,are,short,on,sparkle
but,will's,a,gentleman,at,heart
he's,got,the,right,instincts
nobody,but,a,born,gentleman,could,have,put,his,finger,on,what,is,wrong,with,us,as,accurately,as,he,just,did,down,there,at,the,burying
the,whole,world,can't,lick,us,but,we,can,lick,ourselves,by,longing,too,hard,for,things,we,haven't,got,any,more,and,by,remembering,too,much
yes,will,will,do,well,by,suellen,and,by,tara
then,you,approve,of,me,letting,him,marry,her
god,no
the,old,voice,was,tired,and,bitter,but,vigorous
approve,of,crackers,marrying,into,old,families
bah
would,i,approve,of,breeding,scrub,stock,to,thoroughbreds
oh,crackers,are,good,and,solid,and,honest,but
but,you,said,you,thought,it,would,be,a,successful,match
cried,scarlett,bewildered
oh,i,think,it's,good,for,suellen,to,marry,will,to,marry,anybody,for,that,matter,because,she,needs,a,husband,bad
and,where,else,could,she,get,one
and,where,else,could,you,get,as,good,a,manager,for,tara
but,that,doesn't,mean,i,like,the,situation,any,better,than,you,do
but,i,do,like,it,thought,scarlett,trying,to,grasp,the,old,lady's,meaning
i'm,glad,will,is,going,to,marry,her
why,should,she,think,i,minded
she's,taking,it,for,granted,that,i,do,mind,just,like,her
she,felt,puzzled,and,a,little,ashamed,as,always,when,people,attributed,to,her,emotions,and,motives,they,possessed,and,thought,she,shared
grandma,fanned,herself,with,her,palmetto,leaf,and,went,on,briskly,i,don't,approve,of,the,match,any,more,than,you,do,but,i'm,practical,and,so,are,you
and,when,it,comes,to,something,that's,unpleasant,but,can't,be,helped,i,don't,see,any,sense,in,screaming,and,kicking,about,it
that's,no,way,to,meet,the,ups,and,downs,of,life
i,know,because,my,family,and,the,old,doctor's,family,have,had,more,than,our,share,of,ups,and,downs
and,if,we,folks,have,a,motto,it's,this,'don't,holler,smile,and,bide,your,time,'
we've,survived,a,passel,of,things,that,way,smiling,and,biding,our,time,and,we've,gotten,to,be,experts,at,surviving
we,had,to,be
we've,always,bet,on,the,wrong,horses
run,out,of,france,with,the,huguenots,run,out,of,england,with,the,cavaliers,run,out,of,scotland,with,bonnie,prince,charlie,run,out,of,haiti,by,the,niggers,and,now,licked,by,the,yankees
but,we,always,turn,up,on,top,in,a,few,years
you,know,why
she,cocked,her,head,and,scarlett,thought,she,looked,like,nothing,so,much,as,an,old,knowing,parrot
no,i,don't,know,i'm,sure,she,answered,politely
but,she,was,heartily,bored,even,as,she,had,been,the,day,when,grandma,launched,on,her,memories,of,the,creek,uprising
well,this,is,the,reason
we,bow,to,the,inevitable
we're,not,wheat,we're,buckwheat
when,a,storm,comes,along,it,flattens,ripe,wheat,because,it's,dry,and,can't,bend,with,the,wind
but,ripe,buckwheat's,got,sap,in,it,and,it,bends
and,when,the,wind,has,passed,it,springs,up,almost,as,straight,and,strong,as,before
we,aren't,a,stiff-necked,tribe
we're,mighty,limber,when,a,hard,wind's,blowing,because,we,know,it,pays,to,be,limber
when,trouble,comes,we,bow,to,the,inevitable,without,any,mouthing,and,we,work,and,we,smile,and,we,bide,our,time
and,we,play,along,with,lesser,folks,and,we,take,what,we,can,get,from,them
and,when,we're,strong,enough,we,kick,the,folks,whose,necks,we've,climbed,over
that,my,child,is,the,secret,of,the,survival
and,after,a,pause,she,added,i,pass,it,on,to,you
the,old,lady,cackled,as,if,she,were,amused,by,her,words,despite,the,venom,in,them
she,looked,as,if,she,expected,some,comment,from,scarlett,but,the,words,had,made,little,sense,to,her,and,she,could,think,of,nothing,to,say
no,sir,old,miss,went,on,our,folks,get,flattened,out,but,they,rise,up,again,and,that's,more,than,i,can,say,for,plenty,of,people,not,so,far,away,from,here
look,at,cathleen,calvert
you,can,see,what,she's,come,to
poor,white
and,a,heap,lower,than,the,man,she,married
look,at,the,mcrae,family
flat,to,the,ground,helpless,don't,know,what,to,do,don't,know,how,to,do,anything
won't,even,try
they,spend,their,time,whining,about,the,good,old,days
and,look,at,well,look,at,nearly,anybody,in,this,county,except,my,alex,and,my,sally,and,you,and,jim,tarleton,and,his,girls,and,some,others
the,rest,have,gone,under,because,they,didn't,have,any,sap,in,them,because,they,didn't,have,the,gumption,to,rise,up,again
there,never,was,anything,to,those,folks,but,money,and,darkies,and,now,that,the,money,and,darkies,are,gone,those,folks,will,be,cracker,in,another,generation
you,forgot,the,wilkes
no,i,didn't,forget,them
i,just,thought,i'd,be,polite,and,not,mention,them,seeing,that,ashley's,a,guest,under,this,roof
but,seeing,as,how,you've,brought,up,their,names,look,at,them
there's,india,who,from,all,i,hear,is,a,dried-up,old,maid,already,giving,herself,all,kinds,of,widowed,airs,because,stu,tarleton,was,killed,and,not,making,any,effort,to,forget,him,and,try,to,catch,another,man
of,course,she's,old,but,she,could,catch,some,widower,with,a,big,family,if,she,tried
and,poor,honey,was,always,a,man-crazy,fool,with,no,more,sense,than,a,guinea,hen
and,as,for,ashley,look,at,him
ashley,is,a,very,fine,man,began,scarlett,hotly
i,never,said,he,wasn't,but,he's,as,helpless,as,a,turtle,on,his,back
if,the,wilkes,family,pulls,through,these,hard,times,it'll,be,melly,who,pulls,them,through
not,ashley
melly
lord,grandma
what,are,you,talking,about
i've,lived,with,melly,long,enough,to,know,she's,sickly,and,scared,and,hasn't,the,gumption,to,say,boo,to,a,goose
now,why,on,earth,should,anyone,want,to,say,boo,to,a,goose
it,always,sounded,like,a,waste,of,time,to,me
she,might,not,say,boo,to,a,goose,but,she'd,say,boo,to,the,world,or,the,yankee,government,or,anything,else,that,threatened,her,precious,ashley,or,her,boy,or,her,notions,of,gentility
her,way,isn't,your,way,scarlett,or,my,way
it's,the,way,your,mother,would,have,acted,if,she'd,lived
melly,puts,me,in,mind,of,your,mother,when,she,was,young
and,maybe,she'll,pull,the,wilkes,family,through
oh,melly's,a,well-meaning,little,ninny
but,you,are,very,unjust,to,ashley
he's
oh,foot
ashley,was,bred,to,read,books,and,nothing,else
that,doesn't,help,a,man,pull,himself,out,of,a,tough,fix,like,we're,all,in,now
from,what,i,hear,he's,the,worst,plow,hand,in,the,county
now,you,just,compare,him,with,my,alex
before,the,war,alex,was,the,most,worthless,dandy,in,the,world,and,he,never,had,a,thought,beyond,a,new,cravat,and,getting,drunk,and,shooting,somebody,and,chasing,girls,who,were,no,better,than,they,should,be
but,look,at,him,now
he,learned,farming,because,he,had,to,learn
he'd,have,starved,and,so,would,all,of,us
now,he,raises,the,best,cotton,in,the,county,yes,miss
it's,a,heap,better,than,tara,cotton,and,he,knows,what,to,do,with,hogs,and,chickens
ha
he's,a,fine,boy,for,all,his,bad,temper
he,knows,how,to,bide,his,time,and,change,with,changing,ways,and,when,all,this,reconstruction,misery,is,over,you're,going,to,see,my,alex,as,rich,a,man,as,his,father,and,his,grandfather,were
but,ashley
scarlett,was,smarting,at,the,slight,to,ashley
it,all,sounds,like,tootle,to,me,she,said,coldly
well,it,shouldn't,said,grandma,fastening,a,sharp,eye,upon,her
for,it's,just,exactly,the,course,you've,been,following,since,you,went,to,atlanta
oh,yes
we,hear,of,your,didoes,even,if,we,are,buried,down,here,in,the,country
you've,changed,with,the,changing,times,too
we,hear,how,you,suck,up,to,the,yankees,and,the,white,trash,and,the,new-rich,carpetbaggers,to,get,money,out,of,them
butter,doesn't,melt,in,your,mouth,from,all,i,can,hear
well,go,to,it,i,say
and,get,every,cent,out,of,them,you,can,but,when,you've,got,enough,money,kick,them,in,the,face,because,they,can't,serve,you,any,longer
be,sure,you,do,that,and,do,it,properly,for,trash,hanging,onto,your,coat,tails,can,ruin,you
scarlett,looked,at,her,her,brow,wrinkling,with,the,effort,to,digest,the,words
they,still,didn't,make,much,sense,and,she,was,still,angry,at,ashley,being,called,a,turtle,on,his,back
i,think,you're,wrong,about,ashley,she,said,abruptly
scarlett,you,just,aren't,smart
that's,your,opinion,said,scarlett,rudely,wishing,it,were,permissible,to,smack,old,ladies',jaws
oh,you're,smart,enough,about,dollars,and,cents
that's,a,man's,way,of,being,smart
but,you,aren't,smart,at,all,like,a,woman
you,aren't,a,speck,smart,about,folks
scarlett's,eyes,began,to,snap,fire,and,her,hands,to,clench,and,unclench
i've,made,you,good,and,mad,haven't,i
asked,the,old,lady,smiling
well,i,aimed,to,do,just,that
oh,you,did,did,you
and,why,pray
i,had,good,and,plenty,reasons
grandma,sank,back,in,her,chair,and,scarlett,suddenly,realized,that,she,looked,very,tired,and,incredibly,old
the,tiny,clawlike,hands,folded,over,the,fan,were,yellow,and,waxy,as,a,dead,person's
the,anger,went,out,of,scarlett's,heart,as,a,thought,came,to,her
she,leaned,over,and,took,one,of,the,hands,in,hers
you're,a,mighty,sweet,old,liar,she,said
you,didn't,mean,a,word,of,all,this,rigmarole
you've,just,been,talking,to,keep,my,mind,off,pa,haven't,you
don't,fiddle,with,me
said,old,miss,grumpily,jerking,away,her,hand
partly,for,that,reason,partly,because,what,i've,been,telling,you,is,the,truth,and,you're,just,too,stupid,to,realize,it
but,she,smiled,a,little,and,took,the,sting,from,her,words
scarlett's,heart,emptied,itself,of,wrath,about,ashley
it,was,nice,to,know,grandma,hadn't,meant,any,of,it
thank,you,just,the,same
it,was,nice,of,you,to,talk,to,me,and,i'm,glad,to,know,you're,with,me,about,will,and,suellen,even,if,even,if,a,lot,of,other,people,do,disapprove

scarlett's,eyes,met,those,of,grandma
there,was,a,wicked,sparkle,in,the,old,eyes,that,found,an,answer,in,her,own
chapter,xli
when,the,last,good-by,had,been,said,and,the,last,sound,of,wheels,and,hooves,died,away,scarlett,went,into,ellen's,office,and,removed,a,gleaming,object,from,where,she,had,hidden,it,the,night,before,between,the,yellowed,papers,in,the,pigeon-holes,of,the,secretary

ashley,sat,on,ellen's,little,writing,chair,his,long,body,dwarfing,the,frail,bit,of,furniture,while,scarlett,offered,him,a,half-,interest,in,the,mill
not,once,did,his,eyes,meet,hers,and,he,spoke,no,word,of,interruption
he,sat,looking,down,at,his,hands,turning,them,over,slowly,inspecting,first,palms,and,then,backs,as,though,he,had,never,seen,them,before
despite,hard,work,they,were,still,slender,and,sensitive,looking,and,remarkably,well,tended,for,a,farmer's,hands
his,bowed,head,and,silence,disturbed,her,a,little,and,she,redoubled,her,efforts,to,make,the,mill,sound,attractive
she,brought,to,bear,too,all,the,charm,of,smile,and,glance,she,possessed,but,they,were,wasted,for,he,did,not,raise,his,eyes
if,he,would,only,look,at,her
she,made,no,mention,of,the,information,will,had,given,her,of,ashley's,determination,to,go,north,and,spoke,with,the,outward,assumption,that,no,obstacle,stood,in,the,way,of,his,agreement,with,her,plan
still,he,did,not,speak,and,finally,her,words,trailed,into,silence
there,was,a,determined,squareness,about,his,slender,shoulders,that,alarmed,her
surely,he,wouldn't,refuse
what,earthly,reason,could,he,have,for,refusing
ashley,she,began,again,and,paused
she,had,not,intended,using,her,pregnancy,as,an,argument,had,shrunk,from,the,thought,of,ashley,even,seeing,her,so,bloated,and,ugly,but,as,her,other,persuasions,seemed,to,have,made,no,impression,she,decided,to,use,it,and,her,helplessness,as,a,last,card
you,must,come,to,atlanta
i,do,need,your,help,so,badly,now,because,i,can't,look,after,the,mills
it,may,be,months,before,i,can,because,you,see,well,because
please
he,said,roughly
good,god,scarlett
he,rose,and,went,abruptly,to,the,window,and,stood,with,his,back,to,her,watching,the,solemn,single,file,of,ducks,parade,across,the,barnyard
is,that,is,that,why,you,won't,look,at,me
she,questioned,forlornly
i,know,i,look
he,swung,around,in,a,flash,and,his,gray,eyes,met,hers,with,an,intensity,that,made,her,hands,go,to,her,throat
damn,your,looks
he,said,with,a,swift,violence
you,know,you,always,look,beautiful,to,me
happiness,flooded,her,until,her,eyes,were,liquid,with,tears
how,sweet,of,you,to,say,that
for,i,was,so,ashamed,to,let,you,see,me
you,ashamed
why,should,you,be,ashamed
i'm,the,one,to,feel,shame,and,i,do
if,it,hadn't,been,for,my,stupidity,you,wouldn't,be,in,this,fix
you'd,never,have,married,frank
i,should,never,have,let,you,leave,tara,last,winter
oh,fool,that,i,was
i,should,have,known,you,known,you,were,desperate,so,desperate,that,you'd,i,should,have,i,should,have,his,face,went,haggard
scarlett's,heart,beat,wildly
he,was,regretting,that,he,had,not,run,away,with,her
the,least,i,could,have,done,was,go,out,and,commit,highway,robbery,or,murder,to,get,the,tax,money,for,you,when,you,had,taken,us,in,as,beggars
oh,i,messed,it,up,all,the,way,around
her,heart,contracted,with,disappointment,and,some,of,the,happiness,went,from,her,for,these,were,not,the,words,she,hoped,to,hear
i,would,have,gone,anyway,she,said,tiredly
i,couldn't,have,let,you,do,anything,like,that
and,anyway,it's,done,now
yes,it's,done,now,he,said,with,slow,bitterness
you,wouldn't,have,let,me,do,anything,dishonorable,but,you,would,sell,yourself,to,a,man,you,didn't,love,and,bear,his,child,so,that,my,family,and,i,wouldn't,starve
it,was,kind,of,you,to,shelter,my,helplessness
the,edge,in,his,voice,spoke,of,a,raw,unhealed,wound,that,ached,within,him,and,his,words,brought,shame,to,her,eyes
he,was,swift,to,see,it,and,his,face,changed,to,gentleness
you,didn't,think,i,was,blaming,you
dear,god,scarlett
no
you,are,the,bravest,woman,i've,ever,known
it's,myself,i'm,blaming
he,turned,and,looked,out,of,the,window,again,and,the,shoulders,presented,to,her,gaze,did,not,look,quite,so,square
scarlett,waited,a,long,moment,in,silence,hoping,that,ashley,would,return,to,the,mood,in,which,he,spoke,of,her,beauty,hoping,he,would,say,more,words,that,she,could,treasure
it,had,been,so,long,since,she,had,seen,him,and,she,had,lived,on,memories,until,they,were,worn,thin
she,knew,he,still,loved,her
that,fact,was,evident,in,every,line,of,him,in,every,bitter,self-condemnatory,word,in,his,resentment,at,her,bearing,frank's,child
she,so,longed,to,hear,him,say,it,in,words,longed,to,speak,words,herself,that,would,provoke,a,confession,but,she,dared,not
she,remembered,her,promise,given,last,winter,in,the,orchard,that,she,would,never,again,throw,herself,at,his,head
sadly,she,knew,that,promise,must,be,kept,if,ashley,were,to,remain,near,her
one,cry,from,her,of,love,and,longing,one,look,that,pleaded,for,his,arms,and,the,matter,would,be,settled,forever
ashley,would,surely,go,to,new,york
and,he,must,not,go,away
oh,ashley,don't,blame,yourself
how,could,it,be,your,fault
you,will,come,to,atlanta,and,help,me,won't,you
no
but,ashley,her,voice,was,beginning,to,break,with,anguish,and,disappointment,but,i'd,counted,on,you
i,do,need,you,so
frank,can't,help,me
he's,so,busy,with,the,store,and,if,you,don't,come,i,don't,know,where,i,can,get,a,man
everybody,in,atlanta,who,is,smart,is,busy,with,his,own,affairs,and,the,others,are,so,incompetent,and
it's,no,use,scarlett
you,mean,you'd,rather,go,to,new,york,and,live,among,yankees,than,come,to,atlanta
who,told,you,that
he,turned,and,faced,her,faint,annoyance,wrinkling,his,forehead
will
yes,i've,decided,to,go,north
an,old,friend,who,made,the,grand,tour,with,me,before,the,war,has,offered,me,a,position,in,his,father's,bank
it's,better,so,scarlett
i'd,be,no,good,to,you
i,know,nothing,of,the,lumber,business
but,you,know,less,about,banking,and,it's,much,harder
and,i,know,i'd,make,far,more,allowances,for,your,inexperience,than,yankees,would
he,winced,and,she,knew,she,had,said,the,wrong,thing
he,turned,and,looked,out,of,the,window,again
i,don't,want,allowances,made,for,me
i,want,to,stand,on,my,own,feet,for,what,i'm,worth
what,have,i,done,with,my,life,up,till,now
it's,time,i,made,something,of,myself,or,went,down,through,my,own,fault
i've,been,your,pensioner,too,long,already
but,i'm,offering,you,a,half-interest,in,the,mill,ashley
you,would,be,standing,on,your,own,feet,because,you,see,it,would,be,your,own,business
it,would,amount,to,the,same,thing
i'd,not,be,buying,the,half-,interest
i'd,be,taking,it,as,a,gift
and,i've,taken,too,many,gifts,from,you,already,scarlett,food,and,shelter,and,even,clothes,for,myself,and,melanie,and,the,baby
and,i've,given,you,nothing,in,return
oh,but,you,have
will,couldn't,have
i,can,split,kindling,very,nicely,now
oh,ashley
she,cried,despairingly,tears,in,her,eyes,at,the,jeering,note,in,his,voice
what,has,happened,to,you,since,i've,been,gone
you,sound,so,hard,and,bitter
you,didn't,used,to,be,this,way
what's,happened
a,very,remarkable,thing,scarlett
i've,been,thinking
i,don't,believe,i,really,thought,from,the,time,of,the,surrender,until,you,went,away,from,here
i,was,in,a,state,of,suspended,animation,and,it,was,enough,that,i,had,something,to,eat,and,a,bed,to,lie,on
but,when,you,went,to,atlanta,shouldering,a,man's,burden,i,saw,myself,as,much,less,than,a,man,much,less,indeed,than,a,woman
such,thoughts,aren't,pleasant,to,live,with,and,i,do,not,intend,to,live,with,them,any,longer
other,men,came,out,of,the,war,with,less,than,i,had,and,look,at,them,now
so,i'm,going,to,new,york
but,i,don't,understand
if,it's,work,you,want,why,won't,atlanta,do,as,well,as,new,york
and,my,mill
no,scarlett
this,is,my,last,chance
i'll,go,north
if,i,go,to,atlanta,and,work,for,you,i'm,lost,forever
the,word,lost,lost,lost,dinged,frighteningly,in,her,heart,like,a,death,bell,sounding
her,eyes,went,quickly,to,his,but,they,were,wide,and,crystal,gray,and,they,were,looking,through,her,and,beyond,her,at,some,fate,she,could,not,see,could,not,understand
lost
do,you,mean,have,you,done,something,the,atlanta,yankees,can,get,you,for
i,mean,about,helping,tony,get,away,or,or,oh,ashley,you,aren't,in,the,ku,klux,are,you
his,remote,eyes,came,back,to,her,swiftly,and,he,smiled,a,brief,smile,that,never,reached,his,eyes
i,had,forgotten,you,were,so,literal
no,it's,not,the,yankees,i'm,afraid,of
i,mean,if,i,go,to,atlanta,and,take,help,from,you,again,i,bury,forever,any,hope,of,ever,standing,alone
oh,she,sighed,in,quick,relief,if,it's,only,that
yes,and,he,smiled,again,the,smile,more,wintry,than,before
only,that
only,my,masculine,pride,my,self-respect,and,if,you,choose,to,so,call,it,my,immortal,soul
but,she,swung,around,on,another,tack,you,could,gradually,buy,the,mill,from,me,and,it,would,be,your,own,and,then
scarlett,he,interrupted,fiercely,i,tell,you,no
there,are,other,reasons
what,reasons
you,know,my,reasons,better,than,anyone,in,the,world
oh,that
but,that'll,be,all,right,she,assured,swiftly
i,promised,you,know,out,in,the,orchard,last,winter,and,i'll,keep,my,promise,and
then,you,are,surer,of,yourself,than,i,am
i,could,not,count,on,myself,to,keep,such,a,promise
i,should,not,have,said,that,but,i,had,to,make,you,understand
scarlett,i,will,not,talk,of,this,any,more
it's,finished
when,will,and,suellen,marry,i,am,going,to,new,york
his,eyes,wide,and,stormy,met,hers,for,an,instant,and,then,he,went,swiftly,across,the,room
his,hand,was,on,the,door,knob
scarlett,stared,at,him,in,agony
the,interview,was,ended,and,she,had,lost
suddenly,weak,from,the,strain,and,sorrow,of,the,last,day,and,the,present,disappointment,her,nerves,broke,abruptly,and,she,screamed,oh,ashley
and,flinging,herself,down,on,the,sagging,sofa,she,burst,into,wild,crying
she,heard,his,uncertain,footsteps,leaving,the,door,and,his,helpless,voice,saying,her,name,over,and,over,above,her,head
there,was,a,swift,pattering,of,feet,racing,up,the,hall,from,the,kitchen,and,melanie,burst,into,the,room,her,eyes,wide,with,alarm
scarlett
the,baby,isn't
scarlett,burrowed,her,head,in,the,dusty,upholstery,and,screamed,again
ashley,he's,so,mean
so,doggoned,mean,so,hateful
oh,ashley,what,have,you,done,to,her
melanie,threw,herself,on,the,floor,beside,the,sofa,and,gathered,scarlett,into,her,arms
what,have,you,said
how,could,you
you,might,bring,on,the,baby
there,my,darling,put,your,head,on,melanie's,shoulder
what,is,wrong
ashley,he's,so,so,bullheaded,and,hateful
ashley,i'm,surprised,at,you
upsetting,her,so,much,and,in,her,condition,and,mr,o'hara,hardly,in,his,grave
don't,you,fuss,at,him
cried,scarlett,illogically,raising,her,head,abruptly,from,melanie's,shoulder,her,coarse,black,hair,tumbling,out,from,its,net,and,her,face,streaked,with,tears
he's,got,a,right,to,do,as,he,pleases
melanie,said,ashley,his,face,white,let,me,explain
scarlett,was,kind,enough,to,offer,me,a,position,in,atlanta,as,manager,of,one,of,her,mills
manager
cried,scarlett,indignantly
i,offered,him,a,half-,interest,and,he
and,i,told,her,i,had,already,made,arrangements,for,us,to,go,north,and,she
oh,cried,scarlett,beginning,to,sob,again,i,told,him,and,told,him,how,much,i,needed,him,how,i,couldn't,get,anybody,to,manage,the,mill,how,i,was,going,to,have,this,baby,and,he,refused,to,come
and,now,now,i'll,have,to,sell,the,mill,and,i,know,i,can't,get,anything,like,a,good,price,for,it,and,i'll,lose,money,and,i,guess,maybe,we'll,starve,but,he,won't,care
he's,so,mean
she,burrowed,her,head,back,into,melanie's,thin,shoulder,and,some,of,the,real,anguish,went,from,her,as,a,flicker,of,hope,woke,in,her
she,could,sense,that,in,melanie's,devoted,heart,she,had,an,ally,feel,melanie's,indignation,that,anyone,even,her,beloved,husband,should,make,scarlett,cry
melanie,flew,at,ashley,like,a,small,determined,dove,and,pecked,him,for,the,first,time,in,her,life
ashley,how,could,you,refuse,her
and,after,all,she's,done,for,us
how,ungrateful,you,make,us,appear
and,she,so,helpless,now,with,the,bab,how,unchivalrous,of,you
she,helped,us,when,we,needed,help,and,now,you,deny,her,when,she,needs,you
scarlett,peeped,slyly,at,ashley,and,saw,surprise,and,uncertainty,plain,in,his,face,as,he,looked,into,melanie's,dark,indignant,eyes
scarlett,was,surprised,too,at,the,vigor,of,melanie's,attack,for,she,knew,melanie,considered,her,husband,beyond,wifely,reproaches,and,thought,his,decisions,second,only,to,god's
melanie
he,began,and,then,threw,out,his,hands,helplessly
ashley,how,can,you,hesitate
think,what,she's,done,for,us,for,me
i'd,have,died,in,atlanta,when,beau,came,if,it,hadn't,been,for,her
and,she,yes,she,killed,a,yankee,defending,us
did,you,know,that
she,killed,a,man,for,us
and,she,worked,and,slaved,before,you,and,will,came,home,just,to,keep,food,in,our,mouths
and,when,i,think,of,her,plowing,and,picking,cotton,i,could,just,oh,my,darling
and,she,swooped,her,head,and,kissed,scarlett's,tumbled,hair,in,fierce,loyalty
and,now,the,first,time,she,asks,us,to,do,something,for,her
you,don't,need,to,tell,me,what,she,has,done,for,us
and,ashley,just,think
besides,helping,her,just,think,what,it'll,mean,for,us,to,live,in,atlanta,among,our,own,people,and,not,have,to,live,with,yankees
there'll,be,auntie,and,uncle,henry,and,all,our,friends,and,beau,can,have,lots,of,playmates,and,go,to,school
if,we,went,north,we,couldn't,let,him,go,to,school,and,associate,with,yankee,children,and,have,pickaninnies,in,his,class
we'd,have,to,have,a,governess,and,i,don't,see,how,we'd,afford
melanie,said,ashley,and,his,voice,was,deadly,quiet,do,you,really,want,to,go,to,atlanta,so,badly
you,never,said,so,when,we,talked,about,going,to,new,york
you,never,intimated
oh,but,when,we,talked,about,going,to,new,york,i,thought,there,was,nothing,for,you,in,atlanta,and,besides,it,wasn't,my,place,to,say,anything
it's,a,wife's,duty,to,go,where,her,husband,goes
but,now,that,scarlett,needs,us,so,and,has,a,position,that,only,you,can,fill,we,can,go,home
home
her,voice,was,rapturous,as,she,squeezed,scarlett
and,i'll,see,five,points,again,and,peachtree,road,and,and,oh,how,i've,missed,them,all
and,maybe,we,could,have,a,little,home,of,our,own
i,wouldn't,care,how,little,and,tacky,it,was,but,a,home,of,our,own
her,eyes,blazed,with,enthusiasm,and,happiness,and,the,two,stared,at,her,ashley,with,a,queer,stunned,look,scarlett,with,surprise,mingled,with,shame
it,had,never,occurred,to,her,that,melanie,missed,atlanta,so,much,and,longed,to,be,back,longed,for,a,home,of,her,own
she,had,seemed,so,contented,at,tara,it,came,to,scarlett,as,a,shock,that,she,was,homesick
oh,scarlett,how,good,of,you,to,plan,all,this,for,us
you,knew,how,i,longed,for,home
as,usual,when,confronted,by,melanie's,habit,of,attributing,worthy,motives,where,no,worth,existed,scarlett,was,ashamed,and,irritated,and,suddenly,she,could,not,meet,either,ashley's,or,melanie's,eyes
we,could,get,a,little,house,of,our,own
do,you,realize,that,we've,been,married,five,years,and,never,had,a,home
you,can,stay,with,us,at,aunt,pitty's
that's,your,home,mumbled,scarlett,toying,with,a,pillow,and,keeping,her,eyes,down,to,hide,dawning,triumph,in,them,as,she,felt,the,tide,turning,her,way
no,but,thank,you,just,the,same,darling
that,would,crowd,us,so
we'll,get,a,house,oh,ashley,do,say,yes
scarlett,said,ashley,and,his,voice,was,toneless,look,at,me
startled,she,looked,up,and,met,gray,eyes,that,were,bitter,and,full,of,tired,futility
scarlett,i,will,come,to,atlanta
i,cannot,fight,you,both
he,turned,and,walked,out,of,the,room
some,of,the,triumph,in,her,heart,was,dulled,by,a,nagging,fear
the,look,in,his,eyes,when,he,spoke,had,been,the,same,as,when,he,said,he,would,be,lost,forever,if,he,came,to,atlanta
after,suellen,and,will,married,and,carreen,went,off,to,charleston,to,the,convent,ashley,melanie,and,beau,came,to,atlanta,bringing,dilcey,with,them,to,cook,and,nurse
prissy,and,pork,were,left,at,tara,until,such,a,time,as,will,could,get,other,darkies,to,help,him,in,the,fields,and,then,they,too,would,come,to,town
the,little,brick,house,that,ashley,took,for,his,family,was,on,ivy,street,directly,behind,aunt,pitty's,house,and,the,two,back,yards,ran,together,divided,only,by,a,ragged,overgrown,privet,hedge
melanie,had,chosen,it,especially,for,this,reason
she,said,on,the,first,morning,of,her,return,to,atlanta,as,she,laughed,and,cried,and,embraced,scarlett,and,aunt,pitty,she,had,been,separated,from,her,loved,ones,for,so,long,that,she,could,never,be,close,enough,to,them,again
the,house,had,originally,been,two,stories,high,but,the,upper,floor,had,been,destroyed,by,shells,during,the,siege,and,the,owner,returning,after,the,surrender,had,lacked,the,money,to,replace,it
he,had,contented,himself,with,putting,a,flat,roof,on,the,remaining,first,floor,which,gave,the,building,the,squat,disproportionate,look,of,a,child's,playhouse,built,of,shoe,boxes
the,house,was,high,from,the,ground,built,over,a,large,cellar,and,the,long,sweeping,flight,of,stairs,which,reached,it,made,it,look,slightly,ridiculous
but,the,flat,squashed,look,of,the,place,was,partly,redeemed,by,the,two,fine,old,oaks,which,shaded,it,and,a,dusty-,leaved,magnolia,splotched,with,white,blossoms,standing,beside,the,front,steps
the,lawn,was,wide,and,green,with,thick,clover,and,bordering,it,was,a,straggling,unkempt,privet,hedge,interlaced,with,sweet-smelling,honeysuckle,vines
here,and,there,in,the,grass,roses,threw,out,sprangles,from,crushed,old,stems,and,pink,and,white,crepe,myrtle,bloomed,as,valiantly,as,if,war,had,not,passed,over,their,heads,and,yankee,horses,gnawed,their,boughs
scarlett,thought,it,quite,the,ugliest,dwelling,she,had,ever,seen,but,to,melanie,twelve,oaks,in,all,its,grandeur,had,not,been,more,beautiful
it,was,home,and,she,and,ashley,and,beau,were,at,last,together,under,their,own,roof
india,wilkes,came,back,from,macon,where,she,and,honey,had,lived,since,1864,and,took,up,her,residence,with,her,brother,crowding,the,occupants,of,the,little,house
but,ashley,and,melanie,welcomed,her
times,had,changed,money,was,scarce,but,nothing,had,altered,the,rule,of,southern,life,that,families,always,made,room,gladly,for,indigent,or,unmarried,female,relatives
honey,had,married,and,so,india,said,married,beneath,her,a,coarse,westerner,from,mississippi,who,had,settled,in,macon
he,had,a,red,face,and,a,loud,voice,and,jolly,ways
india,had,not,approved,of,the,match,and,not,approving,had,not,been,happy,in,her,brother-in-,law's,home
she,welcomed,the,news,that,ashley,now,had,a,home,of,his,own,so,she,could,remove,herself,from,uncongenial,surroundings,and,also,from,the,distressing,sight,of,her,sister,so,fatuously,happy,with,a,man,unworthy,of,her
the,rest,of,the,family,privately,thought,that,the,giggling,and,simple-minded,honey,had,done,far,better,than,could,be,expected,and,they,marveled,that,she,had,caught,any,man
her,husband,was,a,gentleman,and,a,man,of,some,means,but,to,india,born,in,georgia,and,reared,in,virginia,traditions,anyone,not,from,the,eastern,seaboard,was,a,boor,and,a,barbarian
probably,honey's,husband,was,as,happy,to,be,relieved,of,her,company,as,she,was,to,leave,him,for,india,was,not,easy,to,live,with,these,days
the,mantle,of,spinsterhood,was,definitely,on,her,shoulders,now
she,was,twenty-five,and,looked,it,and,so,there,was,no,longer,any,need,for,her,to,try,to,be,attractive
her,pale,lashless,eyes,looked,directly,and,uncompromisingly,upon,the,world,and,her,thin,lips,were,ever,set,in,haughty,tightness
there,was,an,air,of,dignity,and,pride,about,her,now,that,oddly,enough,became,her,better,than,the,determined,girlish,sweetness,of,her,days,at,twelve,oaks
the,position,she,held,was,almost,that,of,a,widow
everyone,knew,that,stuart,tarleton,would,have,married,her,had,he,not,been,killed,at,gettysburg,and,so,she,was,accorded,the,respect,due,a,woman,who,had,been,wanted,if,not,wed
the,six,rooms,of,the,little,house,on,ivy,street,were,soon,scantily,furnished,with,the,cheapest,pine,and,oak,furniture,in,frank's,store,for,as,ashley,was,penniless,and,forced,to,buy,on,credit,he,refused,anything,except,the,least,expensive,and,bought,only,the,barest,necessities
this,embarrassed,frank,who,was,fond,of,ashley,and,it,distressed,scarlett
both,she,and,frank,would,willingly,have,given,without,any,charge,the,finest,mahogany,and,carved,rosewood,in,the,store,but,the,wilkeses,obstinately,refused
their,house,was,painfully,ugly,and,bare,and,scarlett,hated,to,see,ashley,living,in,the,uncarpeted,uncurtained,rooms
but,he,did,not,seem,to,notice,his,surroundings,and,melanie,having,her,own,home,for,the,first,time,since,her,marriage,was,so,happy,she,was,actually,proud,of,the,place
scarlett,would,have,suffered,agonies,of,humiliation,at,having,friends,find,her,without,draperies,and,carpets,and,cushions,and,the,proper,number,of,chairs,and,teacups,and,spoons
but,melanie,did,the,honors,of,her,house,as,though,plush,curtains,and,brocade,sofas,were,hers
for,all,her,obvious,happiness,melanie,was,not,well
little,beau,had,cost,her,her,health,and,the,hard,work,she,had,done,at,tara,since,his,birth,had,taken,further,toll,of,her,strength
she,was,so,thin,that,her,small,bones,seemed,ready,to,come,through,her,white,skin
seen,from,a,distance,romping,about,the,back,yard,with,her,child,she,looked,like,a,little,girl,for,her,waist,was,unbelievably,tiny,and,she,had,practically,no,figure
she,had,no,bust,and,her,hips,were,as,flat,as,little,beau's,and,as,she,had,neither,the,pride,nor,the,good,sense,so,scarlett,thought,to,sew,ruffles,in,the,bosom,of,her,basque,or,pads,on,the,back,of,her,corsets,her,thinness,was,very,obvious
like,her,body,her,face,was,too,thin,and,too,pale,and,her,silky,brows,arched,and,delicate,as,a,butterfly's,feelers,stood,out,too,blackly,against,her,colorless,skin
in,her,small,face,her,eyes,were,too,large,for,beauty,the,dark,smudges,under,them,making,them,appear,enormous,but,the,expression,in,them,had,not,altered,since,the,days,of,her,unworried,girlhood
war,and,constant,pain,and,hard,work,had,been,powerless,against,their,sweet,tranquillity
they,were,the,eyes,of,a,happy,woman,a,woman,around,whom,storms,might,blow,without,ever,ruffling,the,serene,core,of,her,being
how,did,she,keep,her,eyes,that,way,thought,scarlett,looking,at,her,enviously
she,knew,her,own,eyes,sometimes,had,the,look,of,a,hungry,cat
what,was,it,rhett,had,said,once,about,melanie's,eyes,some,foolishness,about,them,being,like,candles
oh,yes,like,two,good,deeds,in,a,naughty,world
yes,they,were,like,candles,candles,shielded,from,every,wind,two,soft,lights,glowing,with,happiness,at,being,home,again,among,her,friends
the,little,house,was,always,full,of,company
melanie,had,been,a,favorite,even,as,a,child,and,the,town,flocked,to,welcome,her,home,again
everyone,brought,presents,for,the,house,bric-a-brac,pictures,a,silver,spoon,or,two,linen,pillow,cases,napkins,rag,rugs,small,articles,which,they,had,saved,from,sherman,and,treasured,but,which,they,now,swore,were,of,no,earthly,use,to,them
old,men,who,had,campaigned,in,mexico,with,her,father,came,to,see,her,bringing,visitors,to,meet,old,colonel,hamilton's,sweet,daughter
her,mother's,old,friends,clustered,about,her,for,melanie,had,a,respectful,deference,to,her,elders,that,was,very,soothing,to,dowagers,in,these,wild,days,when,young,people,seemed,to,have,forgotten,all,their,manners
her,contemporaries,the,young,wives,mothers,and,widows,loved,her,because,she,had,suffered,what,they,had,suffered,had,not,become,embittered,and,always,lent,them,a,sympathetic,ear
the,young,people,came,as,young,people,always,come,simply,because,they,had,a,good,time,at,her,home,and,met,there,the,friends,they,wanted,to,meet
around,melanie's,tactful,and,self-effacing,person,there,rapidly,grew,up,a,clique,of,young,and,old,who,represented,what,was,left,of,the,best,of,atlanta's,ante-bellum,society,all,poor,in,purse,all,proud,in,family,die-hards,of,the,stoutest,variety
it,was,as,if,atlanta,society,scattered,and,wrecked,by,war,depleted,by,death,bewildered,by,change,had,found,in,her,an,unyielding,nucleus,about,which,it,could,re-form
melanie,was,young,but,she,had,in,her,all,the,qualities,this,embattled,remnant,prized,poverty,and,pride,in,poverty,uncomplaining,courage,gaiety,hospitality,kindness,and,above,all,loyalty,to,all,the,old,traditions
melanie,refused,to,change,refused,even,to,admit,that,there,was,any,reason,to,change,in,a,changing,world
under,her,roof,the,old,days,seemed,to,come,back,again,and,people,took,heart,and,felt,even,more,contemptuous,of,the,tide,of,wild,life,and,high,living,that,was,sweeping,the,carpetbaggers,and,newly,rich,republicans,along
when,they,looked,into,her,young,face,and,saw,there,the,inflexible,loyalty,to,the,old,days,they,could,forget,for,a,moment,the,traitors,within,their,own,class,who,were,causing,fury,fear,and,heartbreak
and,there,were,many,such
there,were,men,of,good,family,driven,to,desperation,by,poverty,who,had,gone,over,to,the,enemy,become,republicans,and,accepted,positions,from,the,conquerors,so,their,families,would,not,be,on,charity
there,were,young,ex-soldiers,who,lacked,the,courage,to,face,the,long,years,necessary,to,build,up,fortunes
these,youngsters,following,the,lead,of,rhett,butler,went,hand,in,hand,with,the,carpetbaggers,in,money-making,schemes,of,unsavory,kinds
worst,of,all,the,traitors,were,the,daughters,of,some,of,atlanta's,most,prominent,families
these,girls,who,had,come,to,maturity,since,the,surrender,had,only,childish,memories,of,the,war,and,lacked,the,bitterness,that,animated,their,elders
they,had,lost,no,husbands,no,lovers
they,had,few,recollections,of,past,wealth,and,splendor,and,the,yankee,officers,were,so,handsome,and,finely,dressed,and,so,carefree
and,they,gave,such,splendid,balls,and,drove,such,fine,horses,and,simply,worshiped,southern,girls
they,treated,them,like,queens,and,were,so,careful,not,to,injure,their,touchy,pride,and,after,all,why,not,associate,with,them
they,were,so,much,more,attractive,than,the,town,swains,who,dressed,so,shabbily,and,were,so,serious,and,worked,so,hard,that,they,had,little,time,to,play
so,there,had,been,a,number,of,elopements,with,yankee,officers,which,broke,the,hearts,of,atlanta,families
there,were,brothers,who,passed,sisters,on,the,streets,and,did,not,speak,and,mothers,and,fathers,who,never,mentioned,daughters',names
remembering,these,tragedies,a,cold,dread,ran,in,the,veins,of,those,whose,motto,was,no,surrender,a,dread,which,the,very,sight,of,melanie's,soft,but,unyielding,face,dispelled
she,was,as,the,dowagers,said,such,an,excellent,and,wholesome,example,to,the,young,girls,of,the,town
and,because,she,made,no,parade,of,her,virtues,the,young,girls,did,not,resent,her
it,never,occurred,to,melanie,that,she,was,becoming,the,leader,of,a,new,society
she,only,thought,the,people,were,nice,to,come,to,see,her,and,to,want,her,in,their,little,sewing,circles,cotillion,clubs,and,musical,societies
atlanta,had,always,been,musical,and,loved,good,music,despite,the,sneering,comments,of,sister,cities,of,the,south,concerning,the,town's,lack,of,culture,and,there,was,now,an,enthusiastic,resurrection,of,interest,that,grew,stronger,as,the,times,grew,harder,and,more,tense
it,was,easier,to,forget,the,impudent,black,faces,in,the,streets,and,the,blue,uniforms,of,the,garrison,while,they,were,listening,to,music
melanie,was,a,little,embarrassed,to,find,herself,at,the,head,of,the,newly,formed,saturday,night,musical,circle
she,could,not,account,for,her,elevation,to,this,position,except,by,the,fact,that,she,could,accompany,anyone,on,the,piano,even,the,misses,mclure,who,were,tone,deaf,but,who,would,sing,duets
the,truth,of,the,matter,was,that,melanie,had,diplomatically,managed,to,amalgamate,the,lady,harpists,the,gentlemen's,glee,club,and,the,young,ladies,mandolin,and,guitar,society,with,the,saturday,night,musical,circle,so,that,now,atlanta,had,music,worth,listening,to
in,fact,the,circle's,rendition,of,the,bohemian,girl,was,said,by,many,to,be,far,superior,to,professional,performances,heard,in,new,york,and,new,orleans
it,was,after,she,had,maneuvered,the,lady,harpists,into,the,fold,that,mrs,merriwether,said,to,mrs,meade,and,mrs,whiting,that,they,must,have,melanie,at,the,head,of,the,circle
if,she,could,get,on,with,the,harpists,she,could,get,on,with,anyone,mrs,merriwether,declared
that,lady,herself,played,the,organ,for,the,choir,at,the,methodist,church,and,as,an,organist,had,scant,respect,for,harps,or,harpists
melanie,had,also,been,made,secretary,for,both,the,association,for,the,beautification,of,the,graves,of,our,glorious,dead,and,the,sewing,circle,for,the,widows,and,orphans,of,the,confederacy
this,new,honor,came,to,her,after,an,exciting,joint,meeting,of,those,societies,which,threatened,to,end,in,violence,and,the,severance,of,lifelong,ties,of,friendship
the,question,had,arisen,at,the,meeting,as,to,whether,or,not,weeds,should,be,removed,from,the,graves,of,the,union,soldiers,near,those,of,confederate,soldiers
the,appearance,of,the,scraggly,yankee,mounds,defeated,all,the,efforts,of,the,ladies,to,beautify,those,of,their,own,dead
immediately,the,fires,which,smoldered,beneath,tight,basques,flamed,wildly,and,the,two,organizations,split,up,and,glared,hostilely
the,sewing,circle,was,in,favor,of,the,removal,of,the,weeds,the,ladies,of,the,beautification,were,violently,opposed
mrs,meade,expressed,the,views,of,the,latter,group,when,she,said,dig,up,the,weeds,off,yankee,graves
for,two,cents,i'd,dig,up,all,the,yankees,and,throw,them,in,the,city,dump
at,these,ringing,words,the,two,associations,arose,and,every,lady,spoke,her,mind,and,no,one,listened
the,meeting,was,being,held,in,mrs,merriwether's,parlor,and,grandpa,merriwether,who,had,been,banished,to,the,kitchen,reported,afterwards,that,the,noise,sounded,just,like,the,opening,guns,of,the,battle,of,franklin
and,he,added,he,guessed,it,was,a,dinged,sight,safer,to,be,present,at,the,battle,of,franklin,than,at,the,ladies',meeting
somehow,melanie,made,her,way,to,the,center,of,the,excited,throng,and,somehow,made,her,usually,soft,voice,heard,above,the,tumult
her,heart,was,in,her,throat,with,fright,at,daring,to,address,the,indignant,gathering,and,her,voice,shook,but,she,kept,crying,ladies
please
till,the,din,died,down
i,want,to,say,i,mean,i've,thought,for,a,long,time,that,that,not,only,should,we,pull,up,the,weeds,but,we,should,plant,flowers,on,i,i,don't,care,what,you,think,but,every,time,i,go,to,take,flowers,to,dear,charlie's,grave,i,always,put,some,on,the,grave,of,an,unknown,yankee,which,is,near,by
it,it,looks,so,forlorn
the,excitement,broke,out,again,in,louder,words,and,this,time,the,two,organizations,merged,and,spoke,as,one
on,yankee,graves
oh,melly,how,could,you
and,they,killed,charlie
they,almost,killed,you
why,the,yankees,might,have,killed,beau,when,he,was,born
they,tried,to,burn,you,out,of,tara
melanie,held,onto,the,back,of,her,chair,for,support,almost,crumpling,beneath,the,weight,of,a,disapproval,she,had,never,known,before
oh,ladies
she,cried,pleading
please,let,me,finish
i,know,i,haven't,the,right,to,speak,on,this,matter,for,none,of,my,loved,ones,were,killed,except,charlie,and,i,know,where,he,lies,thank,god
but,there,are,so,many,among,us,today,who,do,not,know,where,their,sons,and,husbands,and,brothers,are,buried,and
she,choked,and,there,was,a,dead,silence,in,the,room
mrs,meade's,flaming,eyes,went,somber
she,had,made,the,long,trip,to,gettysburg,after,the,battle,to,bring,back,darcy's,body,but,no,one,had,been,able,to,tell,her,where,he,was,buried
somewhere,in,some,hastily,dug,trench,in,the,enemy's,country
and,mrs,allan's,mouth,quivered
her,husband,and,brother,had,been,on,that,ill-,starred,raid,morgan,made,into,ohio,and,the,last,information,she,had,of,them,was,that,they,fell,on,the,banks,of,the,river,just,as,the,yankee,cavalry,stormed,up
she,did,not,know,where,they,lay
mrs,allison's,son,had,died,in,a,northern,prison,camp,and,she,the,poorest,of,the,poor,was,unable,to,bring,his,body,home
there,were,others,who,had,read,on,casualty,lists,missing,believed,dead,and,in,those,words,had,learned,the,last,news,they,were,ever,to,learn,of,men,they,had,seen,march,away
they,turned,to,melanie,with,eyes,that,said,why,do,you,open,these,wounds,again
these,are,the,wounds,that,never,heal,the,wounds,of,not,knowing,where,they,lie
melanie's,voice,gathered,strength,in,the,stillness,of,the,room
their,graves,are,somewhere,up,in,the,yankees',country,just,like,the,yankee,graves,are,here,and,oh,how,awful,it,would,be,to,know,that,some,yankee,woman,said,to,dig,them,up,and
mrs,meade,made,a,small,dreadful,sound
but,how,nice,it,would,be,to,know,that,some,good,yankee,woman,and,there,must,be,some,good,yankee,women
i,don't,care,what,people,say,they,can't,all,be,bad
how,nice,it,would,be,to,know,that,they,pulled,weeds,off,our,men's,graves,and,brought,flowers,to,them,even,if,they,were,enemies
if,charlie,were,dead,in,the,north,it,would,comfort,me,to,know,that,someone,and,i,don't,care,what,you,ladies,think,of,me,her,voice,broke,again,i,will,withdraw,from,both,clubs,and,i'll,i'll,pull,up,every,weed,off,every,yankee's,grave,i,can,find,and,i'll,plant,flowers,too,and,i,just,dare,anyone,to,stop,me
with,this,final,defiance,melanie,burst,into,tears,and,tried,to,make,her,stumbling,way,to,the,door
grandpa,merriwether,safe,in,the,masculine,confines,of,the,girl,of,the,period,saloon,an,hour,later,reported,to,uncle,henry,hamilton,that,after,these,words,everybody,cried,and,embraced,melanie,and,it,all,ended,up,in,a,love,feast,and,melanie,was,made,secretary,of,both,organizations
and,they,are,going,to,pull,up,the,weeds
the,hell,of,it,is,dolly,said,i'd,be,only,too,pleased,to,help,do,it,'cause,i,didn't,have,anything,much,else,to,do
i,got,nothing,against,the,yankees,and,i,think,miss,melly,was,right,and,the,rest,of,those,lady,wild,cats,wrong
but,the,idea,of,me,pulling,weeds,at,my,time,of,life,and,with,my,lumbago
melanie,was,on,the,board,of,lady,managers,of,the,orphans',home,and,assisted,in,the,collection,of,books,for,the,newly,formed,young,men's,library,association
even,the,thespians,who,gave,amateur,plays,once,a,month,clamored,for,her
she,was,too,timid,to,appear,behind,the,kerosene-lamp,footlights,but,she,could,make,costumes,out,of,croker,sacks,if,they,were,the,only,material,available
it,was,she,who,cast,the,deciding,vote,at,the,shakespeare,reading,circle,that,the,bard's,works,should,be,varied,with,those,of,mr,dickens,and,mr,bulwer-lytton,and,not,the,poems,of,lord,byron,as,had,been,suggested,by,a,young,and,melanie,privately,feared,very,fast,bachelor,member,of,the,circle
in,the,nights,of,the,late,summer,her,small,feebly,lighted,house,was,always,full,of,guests
there,were,never,enough,chairs,to,go,around,and,frequently,ladies,sat,on,the,steps,of,the,front,porch,with,men,grouped,about,them,on,the,banisters,on,packing,boxes,or,on,the,lawn,below
sometimes,when,scarlett,saw,guests,sitting,on,the,grass,sipping,tea,the,only,refreshment,the,wilkeses,could,afford,she,wondered,how,melanie,could,bring,herself,to,expose,her,poverty,so,shamelessly
until,scarlett,was,able,to,furnish,aunt,pitty's,house,as,it,had,been,before,the,war,and,serve,her,guests,good,wine,and,juleps,and,baked,ham,and,cold,haunches,of,venison,she,had,no,intention,of,having,guests,in,her,house,especially,prominent,guests,such,as,melanie,had
general,john,b,gordon,georgia's,great,hero,was,frequently,there,with,his,family
father,ryan,the,poet-priest,of,the,confederacy,never,failed,to,call,when,passing,through,atlanta
he,charmed,gatherings,there,with,his,wit,and,seldom,needed,much,urging,to,recite,his,sword,of,lee,or,his,deathless,conquered,banner,which,never,failed,to,make,the,ladies,cry
alex,stephens,late,vice-president,of,the,confederacy,visited,whenever,in,town,and,when,the,word,went,about,that,he,was,at,melanie's,the,house,was,filled,and,people,sat,for,hours,under,the,spell,of,the,frail,invalid,with,the,ringing,voice
usually,there,were,a,dozen,children,present,nodding,sleepily,in,their,parents',arms,up,hours,after,their,normal,bedtime
no,family,wanted,its,children,to,miss,being,able,to,say,in,after,years,that,they,had,been,kissed,by,the,great,vice-president,or,had,shaken,the,hand,that,helped,to,guide,the,cause
every,person,of,importance,who,came,to,town,found,his,way,to,the,wilkes,home,and,often,they,spent,the,night,there
it,crowded,the,little,flat-topped,house,forced,india,to,sleep,on,a,pallet,in,the,cubbyhole,that,was,beau's,nursery,and,sent,dilcey,speeding,through,the,back,hedge,to,borrow,breakfast,eggs,from,aunt,pitty's,cookie,but,melanie,entertained,them,as,graciously,as,if,hers,was,a,mansion
no,it,did,not,occur,to,melanie,that,people,rallied,round,her,as,round,a,worn,and,loved,standard
and,so,she,was,both,astounded,and,embarrassed,when,dr,meade,after,a,pleasant,evening,at,her,house,where,he,acquitted,himself,nobly,in,reading,the,part,of,macbeth,kissed,her,hand,and,made,observations,in,the,voice,he,once,used,in,speaking,of,our,glorious,cause
my,dear,miss,melly,it,is,always,a,privilege,and,a,pleasure,to,be,in,your,home,for,you,and,ladies,like,you,are,the,hearts,of,all,of,us,all,that,we,have,left
they,have,taken,the,flower,of,our,manhood,and,the,laughter,of,our,young,women
they,have,broken,our,health,uprooted,our,lives,and,unsettled,our,habits
they,have,ruined,our,prosperity,set,us,back,fifty,years,and,placed,too,heavy,a,burden,on,the,shoulders,of,our,boys,who,should,be,in,school,and,our,old,men,who,should,be,sleeping,in,the,sun
but,we,will,build,back,because,we,have,hearts,like,yours,to,build,upon
and,as,long,as,we,have,them,the,yankees,can,have,the,rest
until,scarlett's,figure,reached,such,proportions,that,even,aunt,pitty's,big,black,shawl,did,not,conceal,her,condition,she,and,frank,frequently,slipped,through,the,back,hedge,to,join,the,summer-,night,gatherings,on,melanie's,porch
scarlett,always,sat,well,out,of,the,light,hidden,in,the,protecting,shadows,where,she,was,not,only,inconspicuous,but,could,unobserved,watch,ashley's,face,to,her,heart's,content
it,was,only,ashley,who,drew,her,to,the,house,for,the,conversations,bored,and,saddened,her
they,always,followed,a,set,pattern,first,hard,times,next,the,political,situation,and,then,inevitably,the,war
the,ladies,bewailed,the,high,prices,of,everything,and,asked,the,gentlemen,if,they,thought,good,times,would,ever,come,back
and,the,omniscient,gentlemen,always,said,indeed,they,would
merely,a,matter,of,time
hard,times,were,just,temporary
the,ladies,knew,the,gentlemen,were,lying,and,the,gentlemen,knew,the,ladies,knew,they,were,lying
but,they,lied,cheerfully,just,the,same,and,the,ladies,pretended,to,believe,them
everyone,knew,hard,times,were,here,to,stay
once,the,hard,times,were,disposed,of,the,ladies,spoke,of,the,increasing,impudence,of,the,negroes,and,the,outrages,of,the,carpetbaggers,and,the,humiliation,of,having,the,yankee,soldiers,loafing,on,every,corner
did,the,gentlemen,think,the,yankees,would,ever,get,through,with,reconstructing,georgia
the,reassuring,gentlemen,thought,reconstruction,would,be,over,in,no,time,that,is,just,as,soon,as,the,democrats,could,vote,again
the,ladies,were,considerate,enough,not,to,ask,when,this,would,be
and,having,finished,with,politics,the,talk,about,the,war,began
whenever,two,former,confederates,met,anywhere,there,was,never,but,one,topic,of,conversation,and,where,a,dozen,or,more,gathered,together,it,was,a,foregone,conclusion,that,the,war,would,be,spiritedly,refought
and,always,the,word,if,had,the,most,prominent,part,in,the,talk
if,england,had,recognized,us,if,jeff,davis,had,commandeered,all,the,cotton,and,gotten,it,to,england,before,the,blockade,tightened,if,longstreet,had,obeyed,orders,at,gettysburg,if,jeb,stuart,hadn't,been,away,on,that,raid,when,marse,bob,needed,him,if,we,hadn't,lost,stonewall,jackson,if,vicksburg,hadn't,fallen,if,we,could,have,held,on,another,year,and,always,if,they,hadn't,replaced,johnston,with,hood,or,if,they'd,put,hood,in,command,at,dalton,instead,of,johnston
if
if
the,soft,drawling,voices,quickened,with,an,old,excitement,as,they,talked,in,the,quiet,darkness,infantryman,cavalryman,cannoneer,evoking,memories,of,the,days,when,life,was,ever,at,high,tide,recalling,the,fierce,heat,of,their,midsummer,in,this,forlorn,sunset,of,their,winter
they,don't,talk,of,anything,else,thought,scarlett
nothing,but,the,war
always,the,war
and,they'll,never,talk,of,anything,but,the,war
no,not,until,they,die
she,looked,about,seeing,little,boys,lying,in,the,crooks,of,their,fathers',arms,breath,coming,fast,eyes,glowing,as,they,heard,of,midnight,stories,and,wild,cavalry,dashes,and,flags,planted,on,enemy,breastworks
they,were,hearing,drums,and,bugles,and,the,rebel,yell,seeing,footsore,men,going,by,in,the,rain,with,torn,flags,slanting
and,these,children,will,never,talk,of,anything,else,either
they'll,think,it,was,wonderful,and,glorious,to,fight,the,yankees,and,come,home,blind,and,crippled,or,not,come,home,at,all
they,all,like,to,remember,the,war,to,talk,about,it
but,i,don't
i,don't,even,like,to,think,about,it
i'd,forget,it,all,if,i,could,oh,if,i,only,could
she,listened,with,flesh,crawling,as,melanie,told,tales,of,tara,making,scarlett,a,heroine,as,she,faced,the,invaders,and,saved,charles',sword,bragging,how,scarlett,had,put,out,the,fire
scarlett,took,no,pleasure,or,pride,in,the,memory,of,these,things
she,did,not,want,to,think,of,them,at,all
oh,why,can't,they,forget
why,can't,they,look,forward,and,not,back
we,were,fools,to,fight,that,war
and,the,sooner,we,forget,it,the,better,we'll,be
but,no,one,wanted,to,forget,no,one,it,seemed,except,herself,so,scarlett,was,glad,when,she,could,truthfully,tell,melanie,that,she,was,embarrassed,at,appearing,even,in,the,darkness
this,explanation,was,readily,understood,by,melanie,who,was,hypersensitive,about,all,matters,relating,to,childbirth
melanie,wanted,another,baby,badly,but,both,dr,meade,and,dr,fontaine,had,said,another,child,would,cost,her,her,life
so,only,half,resigned,to,her,fate,she,spent,most,of,her,time,with,scarlett,vicariously,enjoying,a,pregnancy,not,her,own
to,scarlett,scarcely,wanting,her,coming,child,and,irritated,at,its,untimeliness,this,attitude,seemed,the,height,of,sentimental,stupidity
but,she,had,a,guilty,sense,of,pleasure,that,the,doctors',edict,had,made,impossible,any,real,intimacy,between,ashley,and,his,wife
scarlett,saw,ashley,frequently,now,but,she,never,saw,him,alone
he,came,by,the,house,every,night,on,his,way,home,from,the,mill,to,report,on,the,day's,work,but,frank,and,pitty,were,usually,present,or,worse,still,melanie,and,india
she,could,only,ask,businesslike,questions,and,make,suggestions,and,then,say,it,was,nice,of,you,to,come,by
good,night
if,only,she,wasn't,having,a,baby
here,was,a,god-given,opportunity,to,ride,out,to,the,mill,with,him,every,morning,through,the,lonely,woods,far,from,prying,eyes,where,they,could,imagine,themselves,back,in,the,county,again,in,the,unhurried,days,before,the,war
no,she,wouldn't,try,to,make,him,say,one,word,of,love
she,wouldn't,refer,to,love,in,any,way
she'd,sworn,an,oath,to,herself,that,she,would,never,do,that,again
but,perhaps,if,she,were,alone,with,him,once,more,he,might,drop,that,mask,of,impersonal,courtesy,he,had,worn,since,coming,to,atlanta
perhaps,he,might,be,his,old,self,again,be,the,ashley,she,had,known,before,the,barbecue,before,any,word,of,love,had,been,spoken,between,them
if,they,could,not,be,lovers,they,could,be,friends,again,and,she,could,warm,her,cold,and,lonely,heart,in,the,glow,of,his,friendship
if,only,i,could,get,this,baby,over,and,done,with,she,thought,impatiently,then,i,could,ride,with,him,every,day,and,we,could,talk
it,was,not,only,the,desire,to,be,with,him,that,made,her,writhe,with,helpless,impatience,at,her,confinement
the,mills,needed,her
the,mills,had,been,losing,money,ever,since,she,retired,from,active,supervision,leaving,hugh,and,ashley,in,charge
hugh,was,so,incompetent,for,all,that,he,tried,so,hard
he,was,a,poor,trader,and,a,poorer,boss,of,labor
anyone,could,jew,him,down,on,prices
if,any,slick,contractor,chose,to,say,that,the,lumber,was,of,an,inferior,grade,and,not,worth,the,price,asked,hugh,felt,that,all,a,gentleman,could,do,was,to,apologize,and,take,a,lower,price
when,she,heard,of,the,price,he,received,for,a,thousand,feet,of,flooring,she,burst,into,angry,tears
the,best,grade,of,flooring,the,mill,had,ever,turned,out,and,he,had,practically,given,it,away
and,he,couldn't,manage,his,labor,crews
the,negroes,insisted,on,being,paid,every,day,and,they,frequently,got,drunk,on,their,wages,and,did,not,turn,up,for,work,the,next,morning
on,these,occasions,hugh,was,forced,to,hunt,up,new,workmen,and,the,mill,was,late,in,starting
with,these,difficulties,hugh,didn't,get,into,town,to,sell,the,lumber,for,days,on,end
seeing,the,profits,slip,from,hugh's,fingers,scarlett,became,frenzied,at,her,impotence,and,his,stupidity
just,as,soon,as,the,baby,was,born,and,she,could,go,back,to,work,she,would,get,rid,of,hugh,and,hire,some,one,else
anyone,would,do,better
and,she,would,never,fool,with,free,niggers,again
how,could,anyone,get,any,work,done,with,free,niggers,quitting,all,the,time
frank,she,said,after,a,stormy,interview,with,hugh,over,his,missing,workmen,i've,about,made,up,my,mind,that,i'll,lease,convicts,to,work,the,mills
a,while,back,i,was,talking,to,johnnie,gallegher,tommy,wellburn's,foreman,about,the,trouble,we,were,having,getting,any,work,out,of,the,darkies,and,he,asked,me,why,i,didn't,get,convicts
it,sounds,like,a,good,idea,to,me
he,said,i,could,sublease,them,for,next,to,nothing,and,feed,them,dirt,cheap
and,he,said,i,could,get,work,out,of,them,in,any,way,i,liked,without,having,the,freedman's,bureau,swarming,down,on,me,like,hornets,sticking,their,bills,into,things,that,aren't,any,of,their,business
and,just,as,soon,as,johnnie,gallegher's,contract,with,tommy,is,up,i'm,going,to,hire,him,to,run,hugh's,mill
any,man,who,can,get,work,out,of,that,bunch,of,wild,irish,he,bosses,can,certainly,get,plenty,of,work,out,of,convicts
convicts
frank,was,speechless
leasing,convicts,was,the,very,worst,of,all,the,wild,schemes,scarlett,had,ever,suggested,worse,even,than,her,notion,of,building,a,saloon
at,least,it,seemed,worse,to,frank,and,the,conservative,circles,in,which,he,moved
this,new,system,of,leasing,convicts,had,come,into,being,because,of,the,poverty,of,the,state,after,the,war
unable,to,support,the,convicts,the,state,was,hiring,them,out,to,those,needing,large,labor,crews,in,the,building,of,railroads,in,turpentine,forests,and,lumber,camps
while,frank,and,his,quiet,churchgoing,friends,realized,the,necessity,of,the,system,they,deplored,it,just,the,same
many,of,them,had,not,even,believed,in,slavery,and,they,thought,this,was,far,worse,than,slavery,had,ever,been
and,scarlett,wanted,to,lease,convicts
frank,knew,that,if,she,did,he,could,never,hold,up,his,head,again
this,was,far,worse,than,owning,and,operating,the,mills,herself,or,anything,else,she,had,done
his,past,objections,had,always,been,coupled,with,the,question,what,will,people,say
but,this,this,went,deeper,than,fear,of,public,opinion
he,felt,that,it,was,a,traffic,in,human,bodies,on,a,par,with,prostitution,a,sin,that,would,be,on,his,soul,if,he,permitted,her,to,do,it
from,this,conviction,of,wrongness,frank,gathered,courage,to,forbid,scarlett,to,do,such,a,thing,and,so,strong,were,his,remarks,that,she,startled,relapsed,into,silence
finally,to,quiet,him,she,said,meekly,she,hadn't,really,meant,it
she,was,just,so,outdone,with,hugh,and,the,free,niggers,she,had,lost,her,temper
secretly,she,still,thought,about,it,and,with,some,longing
convict,labor,would,settle,one,of,her,hardest,problems,but,if,frank,was,going,to,take,on,so,about,it
she,sighed
if,even,one,of,the,mills,were,making,money,she,could,stand,it
but,ashley,was,faring,little,better,with,his,mill,than,hugh
at,first,scarlett,was,shocked,and,disappointed,that,ashley,did,not,immediately,take,hold,and,make,the,mill,pay,double,what,it,had,paid,under,her,management
he,was,so,smart,and,he,had,read,so,many,books,and,there,was,no,reason,at,all,why,he,should,not,make,a,brilliant,success,and,lots,of,money
but,he,was,no,more,successful,than,hugh
his,inexperience,his,errors,his,utter,lack,of,business,judgment,and,his,scruples,about,close,dealing,were,the,same,as,hugh's
scarlett's,love,hastily,found,excuses,for,him,and,she,did,not,consider,the,two,men,in,the,same,light
hugh,was,just,hopelessly,stupid,while,ashley,was,merely,new,at,the,business
still,unbidden,came,the,thought,that,ashley,could,never,make,a,quick,estimate,in,his,head,and,give,a,price,that,was,correct,as,she,could
and,she,sometimes,wondered,if,he'd,ever,learn,to,distinguish,between,planking,and,sills
and,because,he,was,a,gentleman,and,himself,trustworthy,he,trusted,every,scoundrel,who,came,along,and,several,times,would,have,lost,money,for,her,if,she,had,not,tactfully,intervened
and,if,he,liked,a,person,and,he,seemed,to,like,so,many,people,he,sold,them,lumber,on,credit,without,ever,thinking,to,find,out,if,they,had,money,in,the,bank,or,property
he,was,as,bad,as,frank,in,that,respect
but,surely,he,would,learn
and,while,he,was,learning,she,had,a,fond,and,maternal,indulgence,and,patience,for,his,errors
every,evening,when,he,called,at,her,house,weary,and,discouraged,she,was,tireless,in,her,tactful,helpful,suggestions
but,for,all,her,encouragement,and,cheer,there,was,a,queer,dead,look,in,his,eyes
she,could,not,understand,it,and,it,frightened,her
he,was,different,so,different,from,the,man,he,used,to,be
if,only,she,could,see,him,alone,perhaps,she,could,discover,the,reason
the,situation,gave,her,many,sleepless,nights
she,worried,about,ashley,both,because,she,knew,he,was,unhappy,and,because,she,knew,his,unhappiness,wasn't,helping,him,to,become,a,good,lumber,dealer
it,was,a,torture,to,have,her,mills,in,the,hands,of,two,men,with,no,more,business,sense,than,hugh,and,ashley,heartbreaking,to,see,her,competitors,taking,her,best,customers,away,when,she,had,worked,so,hard,and,planned,so,carefully,for,these,helpless,months
oh,if,she,could,only,get,back,to,work,again
she,would,take,ashley,in,hand,and,then,he,would,certainly,learn
and,johnnie,gallegher,could,run,the,other,mill,and,she,could,handle,the,selling,and,then,everything,would,be,fine
as,for,hugh,he,could,drive,a,delivery,wagon,if,he,still,wanted,to,work,for,her
that,was,all,he,was,good,for
of,course,gallegher,looked,like,an,unscrupulous,man,for,all,of,his,smartness,but,who,else,could,she,get
why,had,the,other,men,who,were,both,smart,and,honest,been,so,perverse,about,working,for,her
if,she,only,had,one,of,them,working,for,her,now,in,place,of,hugh,she,wouldn't,have,to,worry,so,much,but
tommy,wellburn,in,spite,of,his,crippled,back,was,the,busiest,contractor,in,town,and,coining,money,so,people,said
mrs,merriwether,and,rene,were,prospering,and,now,had,opened,a,bakery,downtown
rene,was,managing,it,with,true,french,thrift,and,grandpa,merriwether,glad,to,escape,from,his,chimney,corner,was,driving,rene's,pie,wagon
the,simmons,boys,were,so,busy,they,were,operating,their,brick,kiln,with,three,shifts,of,labor,a,day
and,kells,whiting,was,cleaning,up,money,with,his,hair,straightener,because,he,told,the,negroes,they,wouldn't,ever,be,permitted,to,vote,the,republican,ticket,if,they,had,kinky,hair
it,was,the,same,with,all,the,smart,young,men,she,knew,the,doctors,the,lawyers,the,storekeepers
the,apathy,which,had,clutched,them,immediately,after,the,war,had,completely,disappeared,and,they,were,too,busy,building,their,own,fortunes,to,help,her,build,hers
the,ones,who,were,not,busy,were,the,men,of,hugh's,type,or,ashley's
what,a,mess,it,was,to,try,to,run,a,business,and,have,a,baby,too
i'll,never,have,another,one,she,decided,firmly
i'm,not,going,to,be,like,other,women,and,have,a,baby,every,year
good,lord,that,would,mean,six,months,out,of,the,year,when,i'd,have,to,be,away,from,the,mills
and,i,see,now,i,can't,afford,to,be,away,from,them,even,one,day
i,shall,simply,tell,frank,that,i,won't,have,any,more,children
frank,wanted,a,big,family,but,she,could,manage,frank,somehow
her,mind,was,made,up
this,was,her,last,child
the,mills,were,far,more,important
chapter,xlii
scarlett's,child,was,a,girl,a,small,bald-headed,mite,ugly,as,a,hairless,monkey,and,absurdly,like,frank
no,one,except,the,doting,father,could,see,anything,beautiful,about,her,but,the,neighbors,were,charitable,enough,to,say,that,all,ugly,babies,turned,out,pretty,eventually
she,was,named,ella,lorena,ella,for,her,grandmother,ellen,and,lorena,because,it,was,the,most,fashionable,name,of,the,day,for,girls,even,as,robert,e,lee,and,stonewall,jackson,were,popular,for,boys,and,abraham,lincoln,and,emancipation,for,negro,children
she,was,born,in,the,middle,of,a,week,when,frenzied,excitement,gripped,atlanta,and,the,air,was,tense,with,expectation,of,disaster
a,negro,who,had,boasted,of,rape,had,actually,been,arrested,but,before,he,could,be,brought,to,trial,the,jail,had,been,raided,by,the,ku,klux,klan,and,he,had,been,quietly,hanged
the,klan,had,acted,to,save,the,as,yet,unnamed,victim,from,having,to,testify,in,open,court
rather,than,have,her,appear,and,advertise,her,shame,her,father,and,brother,would,have,shot,her,so,lynching,the,negro,seemed,a,sensible,solution,to,the,townspeople,in,fact,the,only,decent,solution,possible
but,the,military,authorities,were,in,a,fury
they,saw,no,reason,why,the,girl,should,mind,testifying,publicly
the,soldiers,made,arrests,right,and,left,swearing,to,wipe,out,the,klan,if,they,had,to,put,every,white,man,in,atlanta,in,jail
the,negroes,frightened,and,sullen,muttered,of,retaliatory,house,burnings
the,air,was,thick,with,rumors,of,wholesale,hangings,by,the,yankees,should,the,guilty,parties,be,found,and,of,a,concerted,uprising,against,the,whites,by,the,negroes
the,people,of,the,town,stayed,at,home,behind,locked,doors,and,shuttered,windows,the,men,fearing,to,go,to,their,businesses,and,leave,their,women,and,children,unprotected
scarlett,lying,exhausted,in,bed,feebly,and,silently,thanked,god,that,ashley,had,too,much,sense,to,belong,to,the,klan,and,frank,was,too,old,and,poor,spirited
how,dreadful,it,would,be,to,know,that,the,yankees,might,swoop,down,and,arrest,them,at,any,minute
why,didn't,the,crack-brained,young,fools,in,the,klan,leave,bad,enough,alone,and,not,stir,up,the,yankees,like,this
probably,the,girl,hadn't,been,raped,after,all
probably,she'd,just,been,frightened,silly,and,because,of,her,a,lot,of,men,might,lose,their,lives
in,this,atmosphere,as,nerve,straining,as,watching,a,slow,fuse,burn,toward,a,barrel,of,gunpowder,scarlett,came,rapidly,back,to,strength
the,healthy,vigor,which,had,carried,her,through,the,hard,days,at,tara,stood,her,in,good,stead,now,and,within,two,weeks,of,ella,lorena's,birth,she,was,strong,enough,to,sit,up,and,chafe,at,her,inactivity
in,three,weeks,she,was,up,declaring,she,had,to,see,to,the,mills
they,were,standing,idle,because,both,hugh,and,ashley,feared,to,leave,their,families,alone,all,day
then,the,blow,fell
frank,full,of,the,pride,of,new,fatherhood,summoned,up,courage,enough,to,forbid,scarlett,leaving,the,house,while,conditions,were,so,dangerous
his,commands,would,not,have,worried,her,at,all,and,she,would,have,gone,about,her,business,in,spite,of,them,if,he,had,not,put,her,horse,and,buggy,in,the,livery,stable,and,ordered,that,they,should,not,be,surrendered,to,anyone,except,himself
to,make,matters,worse,he,and,mammy,had,patiently,searched,the,house,while,she,was,ill,and,unearthed,her,hidden,store,of,money
and,frank,had,deposited,it,in,the,bank,in,his,own,name,so,now,she,could,not,even,hire,a,rig
scarlett,raged,at,both,frank,and,mammy,then,was,reduced,to,begging,and,finally,cried,all,one,morning,like,a,furious,thwarted,child
but,for,all,her,pains,she,heard,only,there,sugar
you're,just,a,sick,little,girl
and,miss,scarlett,ef,you,doan,quit,cahyin',on,so,you,gwine,sour,yo',milk,an',de,baby,have,colic,sho,as,gun's,iron
in,a,furious,temper,scarlett,charged,through,her,back,yard,to,melanie's,house,and,there,unburdened,herself,at,the,top,of,her,voice,declaring,she,would,walk,to,the,mills,she,would,go,about,atlanta,telling,everyone,what,a,varmint,she,had,married,she,would,not,be,treated,like,a,naughty,simple-minded,child
she,would,carry,a,pistol,and,shoot,anyone,who,threatened,her
she,had,shot,one,man,and,she,would,love,yes,love,to,shoot,another
she,would
melanie,who,feared,to,venture,onto,her,own,front,porch,was,appalled,by,such,threats
oh,you,must,not,risk,yourself
i,should,die,if,anything,happened,to,you
oh,please
i,will
i,will
i,will,walk
melanie,looked,at,her,and,saw,that,this,was,not,the,hysteria,of,a,woman,still,weak,from,childbirth
there,was,the,same,breakneck,headlong,determination,in,scarlett's,face,that,melanie,had,often,seen,in,gerald,o'hara's,face,when,his,mind,was,made,up
she,put,her,arms,around,scarlett's,waist,and,held,her,tightly
it's,all,my,fault,for,not,being,brave,like,you,and,for,keeping,ashley,at,home,with,me,all,this,time,when,he,should,have,been,at,the,mill
oh,dear
i'm,such,a,ninny
darling,i'll,tell,ashley,i'm,not,a,bit,frightened,and,i'll,come,over,and,stay,with,you,and,aunt,pitty,and,he,can,go,back,to,work,and
not,even,to,herself,would,scarlett,admit,that,she,did,not,think,ashley,could,cope,with,the,situation,alone,and,she,shouted,you'll,do,nothing,of,the,kind
what,earthly,good,would,ashley,do,at,work,if,he,was,worried,about,you,every,minute
everybody,is,just,so,hateful
even,uncle,peter,refuses,to,go,out,with,me
but,i,don't,care
i'll,go,alone
i'll,walk,every,step,of,the,way,and,pick,up,a,crew,of,darkies,somewhere
oh,no
you,mustn't,do,that
something,dreadful,might,happen,to,you
they,say,that,shantytown,settlement,on,the,decatur,road,is,just,full,of,mean,darkies,and,you'd,have,to,pass,right,by,it
let,me,think,darling,promise,me,you,won't,do,anything,today,and,i'll,think,of,something
promise,me,you'll,go,home,and,lie,down
you,look,right,peaked
promise,me
because,she,was,too,exhausted,by,her,anger,to,do,otherwise,scarlett,sulkily,promised,and,went,home,haughtily,refusing,any,overtures,of,peace,from,her,household
that,afternoon,a,strange,figure,stumped,through,melanie's,hedge,and,across,pitty's,back,yard
obviously,he,was,one,of,those,men,whom,mammy,and,dilcey,referred,to,as,de,riff-raff,whut,miss,melly,pick,up,off,de,streets,an',let,sleep,in,her,cellar
there,were,three,rooms,in,the,basement,of,melanie's,house,which,formerly,had,been,servants',quarters,and,a,wine,room
now,dilcey,occupied,one,and,the,other,two,were,in,constant,use,by,a,stream,of,miserable,and,ragged,transients
no,one,but,melanie,knew,whence,they,came,or,where,they,were,going,and,no,one,but,she,knew,where,she,collected,them
perhaps,the,negroes,were,right,and,she,did,pick,them,up,from,the,streets
but,even,as,the,great,and,the,near,great,gravitated,to,her,small,parlor,so,unfortunates,found,their,way,to,her,cellar,where,they,were,fed,bedded,and,sent,on,their,way,with,packages,of,food
usually,the,occupants,of,the,rooms,were,former,confederate,soldiers,of,the,rougher,illiterate,type,homeless,men,men,without,families,beating,their,way,about,the,country,in,hope,of,finding,work
frequently,brown,and,withered,country,women,with,broods,of,tow-,haired,silent,children,spent,the,night,there,women,widowed,by,the,war,dispossessed,of,their,farms,seeking,relatives,who,were,scattered,and,lost
sometimes,the,neighborhood,was,scandalized,by,the,presence,of,foreigners,speaking,little,or,no,english,who,had,been,drawn,south,by,glowing,tales,of,fortunes,easily,made
once,a,republican,had,slept,there
at,least,mammy,insisted,he,was,a,republican,saying,she,could,smell,a,republican,same,as,a,horse,could,smell,a,rattlesnake,but,no,one,believed,mammy's,story,for,there,must,be,some,limit,even,to,melanie's,charity
at,least,everyone,hoped,so
yes,thought,scarlett,sitting,on,the,side,porch,in,the,pale,november,sunshine,with,the,baby,on,her,lap,he,is,one,of,melanie's,lame,dogs
and,he's,really,lame,at,that
the,man,who,was,making,his,way,across,the,back,yard,stumped,like,will,benteen,on,a,wooden,leg
he,was,a,tall,thin,old,man,with,a,bald,head,which,shone,pinkishly,dirty,and,a,grizzled,beard,so,long,he,could,tuck,it,in,his,belt
he,was,over,sixty,to,judge,by,his,hard,seamed,face,but,there,was,no,sag,of,age,to,his,body
he,was,lank,and,ungainly,but,even,with,his,wooden,peg,he,moved,as,swiftly,as,a,snake
he,mounted,the,steps,and,came,toward,her,and,even,before,he,spoke,revealing,in,his,tones,a,twang,and,a,burring,of,r,s,unusual,in,the,lowlands,scarlett,knew,that,he,was,mountain,born
for,all,his,dirty,ragged,clothes,there,was,about,him,as,about,most,mountaineers,an,air,of,fierce,silent,pride,that,permitted,no,liberties,and,tolerated,no,foolishness
his,beard,was,stained,with,tobacco,juice,and,a,large,wad,in,his,jaw,made,his,face,look,deformed
his,nose,was,thin,and,craggy,his,eyebrows,bushy,and,twisted,into,witches',locks,and,a,lush,growth,of,hair,sprang,from,his,ears,giving,them,the,tufted,look,of,a,lynx's,ears
beneath,his,brow,was,one,hollow,socket,from,which,a,scar,ran,down,his,cheek,carving,a,diagonal,line,through,his,beard
the,other,eye,was,small,pale,and,cold,an,unwinking,and,remorseless,eye
there,was,a,heavy,pistol,openly,in,his,trouser,band,and,from,the,top,of,his,tattered,boot,protruded,the,hilt,of,a,bowie,knife
he,returned,scarlett's,stare,coldly,and,spat,across,the,rail,of,the,banister,before,he,spoke
there,was,contempt,in,his,one,eye,not,a,personal,contempt,for,her,but,for,her,whole,sex
miz,wilkes,sont,me,to,work,for,you,he,said,shortly
he,spoke,rustily,as,one,unaccustomed,to,speaking,the,words,coming,slowly,and,almost,with,difficulty
m',name's,archie
i'm,sorry,but,i,have,no,work,for,you,mr
archie
archie's,m'fuss,name
i,beg,your,pardon
what,is,your,last,name
he,spat,again
i,reckon,that's,my,bizness,he,said
archie'll,do
i,don't,care,what,your,last,name,is
i,have,nothing,for,you,to,do
i,reckon,you,have
miz,wilkes,was,upsot,about,yore,wantin',to,run,aroun',like,a,fool,by,yoreself,and,she,sont,me,over,here,to,drive,aroun',with,you
indeed
cried,scarlett,indignant,both,at,the,man's,rudeness,and,melly's,meddling
his,one,eye,met,hers,with,an,impersonal,animosity
yes
a,woman's,got,no,bizness,botherin',her,men,folks,when,they're,tryin',to,take,keer,of,her
if,you're,bound,to,gad,about,i'll,drive,you
i,hates,niggers,yankees,too
he,shifted,his,wad,of,tobacco,to,the,other,cheek,and,without,waiting,for,an,invitation,sat,down,on,the,top,step
i,ain't,sayin',i,like,drivin',women,aroun',but,miz,wilkes,been,good,to,me,lettin',me,sleep,in,her,cellar,and,she,sont,me,to,drive,you
but,began,scarlett,helplessly,and,then,she,stopped,and,looked,at,him
after,a,moment,she,began,to,smile
she,didn't,like,the,looks,of,this,elderly,desperado,but,his,presence,would,simplify,matters
with,him,beside,her,she,could,go,to,town,drive,to,the,mills,call,on,customers
no,one,could,doubt,her,safety,with,him,and,his,very,appearance,was,enough,to,keep,from,giving,rise,to,scandal
it's,a,bargain,she,said
that,is,if,my,husband,agrees
after,a,private,conversation,with,archie,frank,gave,his,reluctant,approval,and,sent,word,to,the,livery,stable,to,release,the,horse,and,buggy
he,was,hurt,and,disappointed,that,motherhood,had,not,changed,scarlett,as,he,had,hoped,it,would,but,if,she,was,determined,to,go,back,to,her,damnable,mills,then,archie,was,a,godsend
so,began,the,relationship,that,at,first,startled,atlanta
archie,and,scarlett,were,a,queerly,assorted,pair,the,truculent,dirty,old,man,with,his,wooden,peg,sticking,stiffly,out,over,the,dashboard,and,the,pretty,neatly,dressed,young,woman,with,forehead,puckered,in,an,abstracted,frown
they,could,be,seen,at,all,hours,and,at,all,places,in,and,near,atlanta,seldom,speaking,to,each,other,obviously,disliking,each,other,but,bound,together,by,mutual,need,he,of,money,she,of,protection
at,least,said,the,ladies,of,the,town,it's,better,than,riding,around,so,brazenly,with,that,butler,man
they,wondered,curiously,where,rhett,was,these,days,for,he,had,abruptly,left,town,three,months,before,and,no,one,not,even,scarlett,knew,where,he,was
archie,was,a,silent,man,never,speaking,unless,spoken,to,and,usually,answering,with,grunts
every,morning,he,came,from,melanie's,cellar,and,sat,on,the,front,steps,of,pitty's,house,chewing,and,spitting,until,scarlett,came,out,and,peter,brought,the,buggy,from,the,stable
uncle,peter,feared,him,only,a,little,less,than,the,devil,or,the,ku,klux,and,even,mammy,walked,silently,and,timorously,around,him
he,hated,negroes,and,they,knew,it,and,feared,him
he,reinforced,his,pistol,and,knife,with,another,pistol,and,his,fame,spread,far,among,the,black,population
he,never,once,had,to,draw,a,pistol,or,even,lay,his,hand,on,his,belt
the,moral,effect,was,sufficient
no,negro,dared,even,laugh,while,archie,was,in,hearing
once,scarlett,asked,him,curiously,why,he,hated,negroes,and,was,surprised,when,he,answered,for,generally,all,questions,were,answered,by,i,reckon,that's,my,bizness
i,hates,them,like,all,mountain,folks,hates,them
we,never,liked,them,and,we,never,owned,none
it,was,them,niggers,that,started,the,war
i,hates,them,for,that,too
but,you,fought,in,the,war
i,reckon,that's,a,man's,privilege
i,hates,yankees,too,more'n,i,hates,niggers
most,as,much,as,i,hates,talkative,women
it,was,such,outspoken,rudeness,as,this,that,threw,scarlett,into,silent,furies,and,made,her,long,to,be,rid,of,him
but,how,could,she,do,without,him
in,what,other,way,could,she,obtain,such,freedom
he,was,rude,and,dirty,and,occasionally,very,odorous,but,he,served,his,purpose
he,drove,her,to,and,from,the,mills,and,on,her,round,of,customers,spitting,and,staring,off,into,space,while,she,talked,and,gave,orders
if,she,climbed,down,from,the,buggy,he,climbed,after,her,and,dogged,her,footsteps
when,she,was,among,rough,laborers,negroes,or,yankee,soldiers,he,was,seldom,more,than,a,pace,from,her,elbow
soon,atlanta,became,accustomed,to,seeing,scarlett,and,her,bodyguard,and,from,being,accustomed,the,ladies,grew,to,envy,her,her,freedom,of,movement
since,the,ku,klux,lynching,the,ladies,had,been,practically,immured,not,even,going,to,town,to,shop,unless,there,were,half,a,dozen,in,their,group
naturally,social,minded,they,became,restless,and,putting,their,pride,in,their,pockets,they,began,to,beg,the,loan,of,archie,from,scarlett
and,whenever,she,did,not,need,him,she,was,gracious,enough,to,spare,him,for,the,use,of,other,ladies
soon,archie,became,an,atlanta,institution,and,the,ladies,competed,for,his,free,time
there,was,seldom,a,morning,when,a,child,or,a,negro,servant,did,not,arrive,at,breakfast,time,with,a,note,saying,if,you,aren't,using,archie,this,afternoon,do,let,me,have,him
i,want,to,drive,to,the,cemetery,with,flowers
i,must,go,to,the,milliners
i,should,like,archie,to,drive,aunt,nelly,for,an,airing
i,must,go,calling,on,peters,street,and,grandpa,is,not,feeling,well,enough,to,take,me
could,archie
he,drove,them,all,maids,matrons,and,widows,and,toward,all,he,evidenced,the,same,uncompromising,contempt
it,was,obvious,that,he,did,not,like,women,melanie,excepted,any,better,than,he,liked,negroes,and,yankees
shocked,at,first,by,his,rudeness,the,ladies,finally,became,accustomed,to,him,and,as,he,was,so,silent,except,for,intermittent,explosions,of,tobacco,juice,they,took,him,as,much,for,granted,as,the,horses,he,drove,and,forgot,his,very,existence
in,fact,mrs,merriwether,related,to,mrs,meade,the,complete,details,of,her,niece's,confinement,before,she,even,remembered,archie's,presence,on,the,front,seat,of,the,carriage
at,no,other,time,than,this,could,such,a,situation,have,been,possible
before,the,war,he,would,not,have,been,permitted,even,in,the,ladies',kitchens
they,would,have,handed,him,food,through,the,back,door,and,sent,him,about,his,business
but,now,they,welcomed,his,reassuring,presence
rude,illiterate,dirty,he,was,a,bulwark,between,the,ladies,and,the,terrors,of,reconstruction
he,was,neither,friend,nor,servant
he,was,a,hired,bodyguard,protecting,the,women,while,their,men,worked,by,day,or,were,absent,from,home,at,night
it,seemed,to,scarlett,that,after,archie,came,to,work,for,her,frank,was,away,at,night,very,frequently
he,said,the,books,at,the,store,had,to,be,balanced,and,business,was,brisk,enough,now,to,give,him,little,time,to,attend,to,this,in,working,hours
and,there,were,sick,friends,with,whom,he,had,to,sit
then,there,was,the,organization,of,democrats,who,forgathered,every,wednesday,night,to,devise,ways,of,regaining,the,ballot,and,frank,never,missed,a,meeting
scarlett,thought,this,organization,did,little,else,except,argue,the,merits,of,general,john,b,gordon,over,every,other,general,except,general,lee,and,refight,the,war
certainly,she,could,observe,no,progress,in,the,direction,of,the,recovery,of,the,ballot
but,frank,evidently,enjoyed,the,meetings,for,he,stayed,out,until,all,hours,on,those,nights
ashley,also,sat,up,with,the,sick,and,he,too,attended,the,democratic,meetings,and,he,was,usually,away,on,the,same,nights,as,frank
on,these,nights,archie,escorted,pitty,scarlett,wade,and,little,ella,though,the,back,yard,to,melanie's,house,and,the,two,families,spent,the,evenings,together
the,ladies,sewed,while,archie,lay,full,length,on,the,parlor,sofa,snoring,his,gray,whiskers,fluttering,at,each,rumble
no,one,had,invited,him,to,dispose,himself,on,the,sofa,and,as,it,was,the,finest,piece,of,furniture,in,the,house,the,ladies,secretly,moaned,every,time,he,lay,down,on,it,planting,his,boot,on,the,pretty,upholstery
but,none,of,them,had,the,courage,to,remonstrate,with,him
especially,after,he,remarked,that,it,was,lucky,he,went,to,sleep,easy,for,otherwise,the,sound,of,women,clattering,like,a,flock,of,guinea,hens,would,certainly,drive,him,crazy
scarlett,sometimes,wondered,where,archie,had,come,from,and,what,his,life,had,been,before,he,came,to,live,in,melly's,cellar,but,she,asked,no,questions
there,was,that,about,his,grim,one-eyed,face,which,discouraged,curiosity
all,she,knew,was,that,his,voice,bespoke,the,mountains,to,the,north,and,that,he,had,been,in,the,army,and,had,lost,both,leg,and,eye,shortly,before,the,surrender
it,was,words,spoken,in,a,fit,of,anger,against,hugh,elsing,which,brought,out,the,truth,of,archie's,past
one,morning,the,old,man,had,driven,her,to,hugh's,mill,and,she,had,found,it,idle,the,negroes,gone,and,hugh,sitting,despondently,under,a,tree
his,crew,had,not,made,their,appearance,that,morning,and,he,was,at,a,loss,as,to,what,to,do
scarlett,was,in,a,furious,temper,and,did,not,scruple,to,expend,it,on,hugh,for,she,had,just,received,an,order,for,a,large,amount,of,lumber,a,rush,order,at,that
she,had,used,energy,and,charm,and,bargaining,to,get,that,order,and,now,the,mill,was,quiet
drive,me,out,to,the,other,mill,she,directed,archie
yes,i,know,it'll,take,a,long,time,and,we,won't,get,any,dinner,but,what,am,i,paying,you,for
i'll,have,to,make,mr,wilkes,stop,what,he's,doing,and,run,me,off,this,lumber
like,as,not,his,crew,won't,be,working,either
great,balls,of,fire
i,never,saw,such,a,nincompoop,as,hugh,elsing
i'm,going,to,get,rid,of,him,just,as,soon,as,that,johnnie,gallegher,finishes,the,stores,he's,building
what,do,i,care,if,gallegher,was,in,the,yankee,army
he'll,work
i,never,saw,a,lazy,irishman,yet
and,i'm,through,with,free,issue,darkies
you,just,can't,depend,on,them
i'm,going,to,get,johnnie,gallegher,and,lease,me,some,convicts
he'll,get,work,out,of,them
he'll
archie,turned,to,her,his,eye,malevolent,and,when,he,spoke,there,was,cold,anger,in,his,rusty,voice
the,day,you,gits,convicts,is,the,day,i,quits,you,he,said
scarlett,was,startled
good,heavens
why

all,they,want,is,to,feed,them,cheap,and,git,all,the,work,they,can,out,of,them
hell,ma'm

scarlett,gasped,and,for,a,moment,shrank,back,against,the,cushions
this,then,was,the,answer,to,the,riddle,of,archie,his,unwillingness,to,tell,his,last,name,or,the,place,of,his,birth,or,any,scrap,of,his,past,life,the,answer,to,the,difficulty,with,which,he,spoke,and,his,cold,hatred,of,the,world
forty,years
he,must,have,gone,into,prison,a,young,man
forty,years
why,he,must,have,been,a,life,prisoner,and,lifers,were
was,it,murder
yes,answered,archie,briefly,as,he,flapped,the,reins
m',wife
scarlett's,eyelids,batted,rapidly,with,fright
the,mouth,beneath,the,beard,seemed,to,move,as,if,he,were,smiling,grimly,at,her,fear
i,ain't,goin',to,kill,you,ma'm,if,that's,what's,frettin',you
thar,ain't,but,one,reason,for,killin',a,woman

i,ain't,sorry,none,that,i,kilt,her
loose,women,ought,to,be,kilt
the,law,ain't,got,no,right,to,put,a,man,in,jail,for,that,but,i,was,sont
but,how,did,you,get,out
did,you,escape
were,you,pardoned
you,might,call,it,a,pardon
his,thick,gray,brows,writhed,together,as,though,the,effort,of,stringing,words,together,was,difficult
'long,in,'sixty-four,when,sherman,come,through,i,was,at,milledgeville,jail,like,i,had,been,for,forty,years
and,the,warden,he,called,all,us,prisoners,together,and,he,says,the,yankees,are,a-comin',a-burnin',and,a-killin'
now,if,thar's,one,thing,i,hates,worse,than,a,nigger,or,a,woman,it's,a,yankee
why
had,you,did,you,ever,know,any,yankees
no'm
but,i'd,hearn,tell,of,them
i'd,hearn,tell,they,couldn't,never,mind,their,own,bizness
i,hates,folks,who,can't,mind,their,own,bizness
what,was,they,doin',in,georgia,freein',our,niggers,and,burnin',our,houses,and,killin',our,stock
well,the,warden,he,said,the,army,needed,more,soldiers,bad,and,any,of,us,who'd,jine,up,would,be,free,at,the,end,of,the,war,if,we,come,out,alive
but,us,lifers,us,murderers,the,warden,he,said,the,army,didn't,want,us
we,was,to,be,sont,somewheres,else,to,another,jail
but,i,said,to,the,warden,i,ain't,like,most,lifers
i'm,just,in,for,killin',my,wife,and,she,needed,killin'
and,i,wants,to,fight,the,yankees
and,the,warden,he,saw,my,side,of,it,and,he,slipped,me,out,with,the,other,prisoners
he,paused,and,grunted
huh
that,was,right,funny
they,put,me,in,jail,for,killin',and,they,let,me,out,with,a,gun,in,my,hand,and,a,free,pardon,to,do,more,killin'
it,shore,was,good,to,be,a,free,man,with,a,rifle,in,my,hand,again
us,men,from,milledgeville,did,good,fightin',and,killin',and,a,lot,of,us,was,kilt
i,never,knowed,one,who,deserted
and,when,the,surrender,come,we,was,free
i,lost,this,here,leg,and,this,here,eye
but,i,ain't,sorry
oh,said,scarlett,weakly
she,tried,to,remember,what,she,had,heard,about,the,releasing,of,the,milledgeville,convicts,in,that,last,desperate,effort,to,stem,the,tide,of,sherman's,army
frank,had,mentioned,it,that,christmas,of,1864,what,had,he,said
but,her,memories,of,that,time,were,too,chaotic
again,she,felt,the,wild,terror,of,those,days,heard,the,siege,guns,saw,the,line,of,wagons,dripping,blood,into,the,red,roads,saw,the,home,guard,marching,off,the,little,cadets,and,the,children,like,phil,meade,and,the,old,men,like,uncle,henry,and,grandpa,merriwether
and,the,convicts,had,marched,out,too,to,die,in,the,twilight,of,the,confederacy,to,freeze,in,the,snow,and,sleet,of,that,last,campaign,in,tennessee
for,a,brief,moment,she,thought,what,a,fool,this,old,man,was,to,fight,for,a,state,which,had,taken,forty,years,from,his,life
georgia,had,taken,his,youth,and,his,middle,years,for,a,crime,that,was,no,crime,to,him,yet,he,had,freely,given,a,leg,and,an,eye,to,georgia
the,bitter,words,rhett,had,spoken,in,the,early,days,of,the,war,came,back,to,her,and,she,remembered,him,saying,he,would,never,fight,for,a,society,that,had,made,him,an,outcast
but,when,the,emergency,had,arisen,he,had,gone,off,to,fight,for,that,same,society,even,as,archie,had,done
it,seemed,to,her,that,all,southern,men,high,or,low,were,sentimental,fools,and,cared,less,for,their,hides,than,for,words,which,had,no,meaning
she,looked,at,archie's,gnarled,old,hands,his,two,pistols,and,his,knife,and,fear,pricked,her,again
were,there,other,ex-convicts,at,large,like,archie,murderers,desperadoes,thieves,pardoned,for,their,crimes,in,the,name,of,the,confederacy
why,any,stranger,on,the,street,might,be,a,murderer
if,frank,ever,learned,the,truth,about,archie,there,would,be,the,devil,to,pay
or,if,aunt,pitty,but,the,shock,would,kill,pitty
and,as,for,melanie,scarlett,almost,wished,she,could,tell,melanie,the,truth,about,archie
it,would,serve,her,right,for,picking,up,trash,and,foisting,it,off,on,her,friends,and,relatives
i'm,i'm,glad,you,told,me,archie
i,i,won't,tell,anyone
it,would,be,a,great,shock,to,mrs,wilkes,and,the,other,ladies,if,they,knew
huh
miz,wilkes,knows
i,told,her,the,night,she,fuss,let,me,sleep,in,her,cellar
you,don't,think,i'd,let,a,nice,lady,like,her,take,me,into,her,house,not,knowin'
saints,preserve,us
cried,scarlet,aghast
melanie,knew,this,man,was,a,murderer,and,a,woman,murderer,at,that,and,she,hadn't,ejected,him,from,her,house
she,had,trusted,her,son,with,him,and,her,aunt,and,sister-in-law,and,all,her,friends
and,she,the,most,timid,of,females,had,not,been,frightened,to,be,alone,with,him,in,her,house
miz,wilkes,is,right,sensible,for,a,woman
she,'lowed,that,i,was,all,right
she,'lowed,that,a,liar,allus,kept,on,lyin',and,a,thief,kept,on,stealin',but,folks,don't,do,more'n,one,murder,in,a,lifetime
and,she,reckoned,as,how,anybody,who'd,fought,for,the,confederacy,had,wiped,out,anything,bad,they'd,done
though,i,don't,hold,that,i,done,nothin',bad,killin',my,wife
yes,miz,wilkes,is,right,sensible,for,a,woman
and,i'm,tellin',you,the,day,you,leases,convicts,is,the,day,i,quits,you
scarlett,made,no,reply,but,she,thought
the,sooner,you,quit,me,the,better,it,will,suit,me
a,murderer
how,could,melly,have,been,so,so,well,there,was,no,word,for,melanie's,action,in,taking,in,this,old,ruffian,and,not,telling,her,friends,he,was,a,jailbird
so,service,in,the,army,wiped,out,past,sins
melanie,had,that,mixed,up,with,baptism
but,then,melly,was,utterly,silly,about,the,confederacy,its,veterans,and,anything,pertaining,to,them
scarlett,silently,damned,the,yankees,and,added,another,mark,on,her,score,against,them
they,were,responsible,for,a,situation,that,forced,a,woman,to,keep,a,murderer,at,her,side,to,protect,her
driving,home,with,archie,in,the,chill,twilight,scarlett,saw,a,clutter,of,saddle,horses,buggies,and,wagons,outside,the,girl,of,the,period,saloon
ashley,was,sitting,on,his,horse,a,strained,alert,look,on,his,face,the,simmons,boys,were,leaning,from,their,buggy,making,emphatic,gestures,hugh,elsing,his,lock,of,brown,hair,falling,in,his,eyes,was,waving,his,hands
grandpa,merriwether's,pie,wagon,was,in,the,center,of,the,tangle,and,as,she,came,closer,scarlett,saw,that,tommy,wellburn,and,uncle,henry,hamilton,were,crowded,on,the,seat,with,him
i,wish,thought,scarlett,irritably,that,uncle,henry,wouldn't,ride,home,in,that,contraption
he,ought,to,be,ashamed,to,be,seen,in,it
it,isn't,as,though,he,didn't,have,a,horse,of,his,own
he,just,does,it,so,he,and,grandpa,can,go,to,the,saloon,together,every,night
as,she,came,abreast,the,crowd,something,of,their,tenseness,reached,her,insensitive,though,she,was,and,made,fear,clutch,at,her,heart
oh
she,thought
i,hope,no,one,else,has,been,raped
if,the,ku,klux,lynch,just,one,more,darky,the,yankees,will,wipe,us,out
and,she,spoke,to,archie
pull,up
something's,wrong
you,ain't,goin',to,stop,outside,a,saloon,said,archie
you,heard,me
pull,up
good,evening,everybody
ashley,uncle,henry,is,something,wrong
you,all,look,so
the,crowd,turned,to,her,tipping,their,hats,and,smiling,but,there,was,a,driving,excitement,in,their,eyes
something's,right,and,something's,wrong,barked,uncle,henry
depends,on,how,you,look,at,it
the,way,i,figure,is,the,legislature,couldn't,have,done,different
the,legislature
thought,scarlett,in,relief
she,had,little,interest,in,the,legislature,feeling,that,its,doings,could,hardly,affect,her
it,was,the,prospect,of,the,yankee,soldiers,on,a,rampage,again,that,frightened,her
what's,the,legislature,been,up,to,now
they've,flatly,refused,to,ratify,the,amendment,said,grandpa,merriwether,and,there,was,pride,in,his,voice
that'll,show,the,yankees
and,there'll,be,hell,to,pay,for,it,i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett,said,ashley
oh,the,amendment
questioned,scarlett,trying,to,look,intelligent
politics,were,beyond,her,and,she,seldom,wasted,time,thinking,about,them
there,had,been,a,thirteenth,amendment,ratified,sometime,before,or,maybe,it,had,been,the,sixteenth,amendment,but,what,ratification,meant,she,had,no,idea
men,were,always,getting,excited,about,such,things
something,of,her,lack,of,comprehension,showed,in,her,face,and,ashley,smiled
it's,the,amendment,letting,the,darkies,vote,you,know,he,explained
it,was,submitted,to,the,legislature,and,they,refused,to,ratify,it
how,silly,of,them
you,know,the,yankees,are,going,to,force,it,down,our,throats
that's,what,i,meant,by,saying,there'd,be,hell,to,pay,said,ashley
i'm,proud,of,the,legislature,proud,of,their,gumption
shouted,uncle,henry
the,yankees,can't,force,it,down,our,throats,if,we,won't,have,it
they,can,and,they,will
ashley's,voice,was,calm,but,there,was,worry,in,his,eyes
and,it'll,make,things,just,that,much,harder,for,us
oh,ashley,surely,not
things,couldn't,be,any,harder,than,they,are,now
yes,things,can,get,worse,even,worse,than,they,are,now
suppose,we,have,a,darky,legislature
a,darky,governor
suppose,we,have,a,worse,military,rule,than,we,now,have
scarlett's,eyes,grew,large,with,fear,as,some,understanding,entered,her,mind
i've,been,trying,to,think,what,would,be,best,for,georgia,best,for,all,of,us
ashley's,face,was,drawn
whether,it's,wisest,to,fight,this,thing,like,the,legislature,has,done,rouse,the,north,against,us,and,bring,the,whole,yankee,army,on,us,to,cram,the,darky,vote,down,us,whether,we,want,it,or,not
or,swallow,our,pride,as,best,we,can,submit,gracefully,and,get,the,whole,matter,over,with,as,easily,as,possible
it,will,amount,to,the,same,thing,in,the,end
we're,helpless
we've,got,to,take,the,dose,they're,determined,to,give,us
maybe,it,would,be,better,for,us,to,take,it,without,kicking
scarlett,hardly,heard,his,words,certainly,their,full,import,went,over,her,head
she,knew,that,ashley,as,usual,was,seeing,both,sides,of,a,question
she,was,seeing,only,one,side,how,this,slap,in,the,yankees',faces,might,affect,her
going,to,turn,radical,and,vote,the,republican,ticket,ashley
jeered,grandpa,merriwether,harshly
there,was,a,tense,silence
scarlett,saw,archie's,hand,make,a,swift,move,toward,his,pistol,and,then,stop
archie,thought,and,frequently,said,that,grandpa,was,an,old,bag,of,wind,and,archie,had,no,intention,of,letting,him,insult,miss,melanie's,husband,even,if,miss,melanie's,husband,was,talking,like,a,fool
the,perplexity,vanished,suddenly,from,ashley's,eyes,and,hot,anger,flared
but,before,he,could,speak,uncle,henry,charged,grandpa
you,god,you,blast,i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett,grandpa,you,jackass,don't,you,say,that,to,ashley
ashley,can,take,care,of,himself,without,you,defending,him,said,grandpa,coldly
and,he,is,talking,like,a,scallawag
submit,hell
i,beg,your,pardon,scarlett
i,didn't,believe,in,secession,said,ashley,and,his,voice,shook,with,anger
but,when,georgia,seceded,i,went,with,her
and,i,didn't,believe,in,war,but,i,fought,in,the,war
and,i,don't,believe,in,making,the,yankees,madder,than,they,already,are
but,if,the,legislature,has,decided,to,do,it,i'll,stand,by,the,legislature
i
archie,said,uncle,henry,abruptly,drive,miss,scarlett,on,home
this,isn't,any,place,for,her
politics,aren't,for,women,folks,anyway,and,there's,going,to,be,cussing,in,a,minute
go,on,archie
good,night,scarlett
as,they,drove,off,down,peachtree,street,scarlett's,heart,was,beating,fast,with,fear
would,this,foolish,action,of,the,legislature,have,any,effect,on,her,safety
would,it,so,enrage,the,yankees,that,she,might,lose,her,mills
well,sir,rumbled,archie,i've,hearn,tell,of,rabbits,spittin',in,bulldogs',faces,but,i,ain't,never,seen,it,till,now
them,legislatures,might,just,as,well,have,hollered,'hurray,for,jeff,davis,and,the,southern,confederacy',for,all,the,good,it'll,do,them,and,us
them,nigger-lovin',yankees,have,made,up,their,mind,to,make,the,niggers,our,bosses
but,you,got,to,admire,them,legislatures',sperrit
admire,them
great,balls,of,fire
admire,them
they,ought,to,be,shot
it'll,bring,the,yankees,down,on,us,like,a,duck,on,a,june,bug
why,couldn't,they,have,rati,radi,whatever,they,were,supposed,to,do,to,it,and,smoothed,the,yankees,down,instead,of,stirring,them,up,again
they're,going,to,make,us,knuckle,under,and,we,may,as,well,knuckle,now,as,later
archie,fixed,her,with,a,cold,eye
knuckle,under,without,a,fight
women,ain't,got,no,more,pride,than,goats
when,scarlett,leased,ten,convicts,five,for,each,of,her,mills,archie,made,good,his,threat,and,refused,to,have,anything,further,to,do,with,her
not,all,melanie's,pleading,or,frank's,promises,of,higher,pay,would,induce,him,to,take,up,the,reins,again
he,willingly,escorted,melanie,and,pitty,and,india,and,their,friends,about,the,town,but,not,scarlett
he,would,not,even,drive,for,the,other,ladies,if,scarlett,was,in,the,carriage
it,was,an,embarrassing,situation,having,the,old,desperado,sitting,in,judgment,upon,her,and,it,was,still,more,embarrassing,to,know,that,her,family,and,friends,agreed,with,the,old,man
frank,pleaded,with,her,against,taking,the,step
ashley,at,first,refused,to,work,convicts,and,was,persuaded,against,his,will,only,after,tears,and,supplications,and,promises,that,when,times,were,better,she,would,hire,free,darkies
neighbors,were,so,outspoken,in,their,disapproval,that,frank,pitty,and,melanie,found,it,hard,to,hold,up,their,heads
even,peter,and,mammy,declared,that,it,was,bad,luck,to,work,convicts,and,no,good,would,come,of,it
everyone,said,it,was,wrong,to,take,advantage,of,the,miseries,and,misfortunes,of,others
you,didn't,have,any,objections,to,working,slaves
scarlett,cried,indignantly
ah,but,that,was,different
slaves,were,neither,miserable,nor,unfortunate
the,negroes,were,far,better,off,under,slavery,than,they,were,now,under,freedom,and,if,she,didn't,believe,it,just,look,about,her
but,as,usual,opposition,had,the,effect,of,making,scarlett,more,determined,on,her,course
she,removed,hugh,from,the,management,of,the,mill,put,him,to,driving,a,lumber,wagon,and,closed,the,final,details,of,hiring,johnnie,gallegher
he,seemed,to,be,the,only,person,she,knew,who,approved,of,the,convicts
he,nodded,his,bullet,head,briefly,and,said,it,was,a,smart,move
scarlett,looking,at,the,little,ex-jockey,planted,firmly,on,his,short,bowed,legs,his,gnomish,face,hard,and,businesslike,thought,whoever,let,him,ride,their,horses,didn't,care,much,for,horse,flesh
i,wouldn't,let,him,get,within,ten,feet,of,any,horse,of,mine
but,she,had,no,qualms,in,trusting,him,with,a,convict,gang
and,i'm,to,have,a,free,hand,with,the,gang
he,questioned,his,eyes,as,cold,as,gray,agates
a,free,hand
all,i,ask,is,that,you,keep,that,mill,running,and,deliver,my,lumber,when,i,want,it,and,as,much,as,i,want
i'm,your,man,said,johnnie,shortly
i'll,tell,mr,wellburn,i'm,leaving,him
as,he,rolled,off,through,the,crowd,of,masons,and,carpenters,and,hod,carriers,scarlett,felt,relieved,and,her,spirits,rose
johnnie,was,indeed,her,man
he,was,tough,and,hard,and,there,was,no,nonsense,about,him
shanty,irish,on,the,make,frank,had,contemptuously,called,him,but,for,that,very,reason,scarlett,valued,him
she,knew,that,an,irishman,with,a,determination,to,get,somewhere,was,a,valuable,man,to,have,regardless,of,what,his,personal,characteristics,might,be
and,she,felt,a,closer,kinship,with,him,than,with,many,men,of,her,own,class,for,johnnie,knew,the,value,of,money
the,first,week,he,took,over,the,mill,he,justified,all,her,hopes,for,he,accomplished,more,with,five,convicts,than,hugh,had,ever,done,with,his,crew,of,ten,free,negroes
more,than,that,he,gave,scarlett,greater,leisure,than,she,had,had,since,she,came,to,atlanta,the,year,before,because,he,had,no,liking,for,her,presence,at,the,mill,and,said,so,frankly
you,tend,to,your,end,of,selling,and,let,me,tend,to,my,end,of,lumbering,he,said,shortly
a,convict,camp,ain't,any,place,for,a,lady,and,if,nobody,else'll,tell,you,so,johnnie,gallegher's,telling,you,now
i'm,delivering,your,lumber,ain't,i
well,i've,got,no,notion,to,be,pestered,every,day,like,mr,wilkes
he,needs,pestering
i,don't
so,scarlett,reluctantly,stayed,away,from,johnnie's,mill,fearing,that,if,she,came,too,often,he,might,quit,and,that,would,be,ruinous
his,remark,that,ashley,needed,pestering,stung,her,for,there,was,more,truth,in,it,than,she,liked,to,admit
ashley,was,doing,little,better,with,convicts,than,he,had,done,with,free,labor,although,why,he,was,unable,to,tell
moreover,he,looked,as,if,he,were,ashamed,to,be,working,convicts,and,he,had,little,to,say,to,her,these,days
scarlett,was,worried,by,the,change,that,was,coming,over,him
there,were,gray,hairs,in,his,bright,head,now,and,a,tired,slump,in,his,shoulders
and,he,seldom,smiled
he,no,longer,looked,the,debonaire,ashley,who,had,caught,her,fancy,so,many,years,before
he,looked,like,a,man,secretly,gnawed,by,a,scarcely,endurable,pain,and,there,was,a,grim,tight,look,about,his,mouth,that,baffled,and,hurt,her
she,wanted,to,drag,his,head,fiercely,down,on,her,shoulder,stroke,the,graying,hair,and,cry,tell,me,what's,worrying,you
i'll,fix,it
i'll,make,it,right,for,you
but,his,formal,remote,air,kept,her,at,arm's,length
chapter,xliii
it,was,one,of,those,rare,december,days,when,the,sun,was,almost,as,warm,as,indian,summer
dry,red,leaves,still,clung,to,the,oak,in,aunt,pitty's,yard,and,a,faint,yellow,green,still,persisted,in,the,dying,grass
scarlett,with,the,baby,in,her,arms,stepped,out,onto,the,side,porch,and,sat,down,in,a,rocking,chair,in,a,patch,of,sunshine
she,was,wearing,a,new,green,challis,dress,trimmed,with,yards,and,yards,of,black,rickrack,braid,and,a,new,lace,house,cap,which,aunt,pitty,had,made,for,her
both,were,very,becoming,to,her,and,she,knew,it,and,took,great,pleasure,in,them
how,good,it,was,to,look,pretty,again,after,the,long,months,of,looking,so,dreadful
as,she,sat,rocking,the,baby,and,humming,to,herself,she,heard,the,sound,of,hooves,coming,up,the,side,street,and,peering,curiously,through,the,tangle,of,dead,vines,on,the,porch,she,saw,rhett,butler,riding,toward,the,house
he,had,been,away,from,atlanta,for,months,since,just,after,gerald,died,since,long,before,ella,lorena,was,born
she,had,missed,him,but,she,now,wished,ardently,that,there,was,some,way,to,avoid,seeing,him
in,fact,the,sight,of,his,dark,face,brought,a,feeling,of,guilty,panic,to,her,breast
a,matter,in,which,ashley,was,concerned,lay,on,her,conscience,and,she,did,not,wish,to,discuss,it,with,rhett,but,she,knew,he,would,force,the,discussion,no,matter,how,disinclined,she,might,be
he,drew,up,at,the,gate,and,swung,lightly,to,the,ground,and,she,thought,staring,nervously,at,him,that,he,looked,just,like,an,illustration,in,a,book,wade,was,always,pestering,her,to,read,aloud
all,he,needs,is,earrings,and,a,cutlass,between,his,teeth,she,thought
well,pirate,or,no,he's,not,going,to,cut,my,throat,today,if,i,can,help,it
as,he,came,up,the,walk,she,called,a,greeting,to,him,summoning,her,sweetest,smile
how,lucky,that,she,had,on,her,new,dress,and,the,becoming,cap,and,looked,so,pretty
as,his,eyes,went,swiftly,over,her,she,knew,he,thought,her,pretty,too
a,new,baby
why,scarlett,this,is,a,surprise
he,laughed,leaning,down,to,push,the,blanket,away,from,ella,lorena's,small,ugly,face
don't,be,silly,she,said,blushing
how,are,you,rhett
you've,been,away,a,long,time
so,i,have
let,me,hold,the,baby,scarlett
oh,i,know,how,to,hold,babies
i,have,many,strange,accomplishments
well,he,certainly,looks,like,frank
all,except,the,whiskers,but,give,him,time
i,hope,not
it's,a,girl
a,girl
that's,better,still
boys,are,such,nuisances
don't,ever,have,any,more,boys,scarlett
it,was,on,the,tip,of,her,tongue,to,reply,tartly,that,she,never,intended,to,have,any,more,babies,boys,or,girls,but,she,caught,herself,in,time,and,smiled,casting,about,quickly,in,her,mind,for,some,topic,of,conversation,that,would,put,off,the,bad,moment,when,the,subject,she,feared,would,come,up,for,discussion
did,you,have,a,nice,trip,rhett
where,did,you,go,this,time
oh,cuba,new,orleans,other,places
here,scarlett,take,the,baby
she's,beginning,to,slobber,and,i,can't,get,to,my,handkerchief
she's,a,fine,baby,i'm,sure,but,she's,wetting,my,shirt,bosom
she,took,the,child,back,into,her,lap,and,rhett,settled,himself,lazily,on,the,banister,and,took,a,cigar,from,a,silver,case
you,are,always,going,to,new,orleans,she,said,and,pouted,a,little
and,you,never,will,tell,me,what,you,do,there
i,am,a,hard-working,man,scarlett,and,perhaps,my,business,takes,me,there
hard-working
you
she,laughed,impertinently
you,never,worked,in,your,life
you're,too,lazy
all,you,ever,do,is,finance,carpetbaggers,in,their,thieving,and,take,half,the,profits,and,bribe,yankee,officials,to,let,you,in,on,schemes,to,rob,us,taxpayers
he,threw,back,his,head,and,laughed
and,how,you,would,love,to,have,money,enough,to,bribe,officials,so,you,could,do,likewise
the,very,idea,she,began,to,ruffle
but,perhaps,you,will,make,enough,money,to,get,into,bribery,on,a,large,scale,some,day
maybe,you'll,get,rich,off,those,convicts,you,leased
oh,she,said,a,little,disconcerted,how,did,you,find,out,about,my,gang,so,soon
i,arrived,last,night,and,spent,the,evening,in,the,girl,of,the,period,saloon,where,one,hears,all,the,news,of,the,town
it's,a,clearing,house,for,gossip
better,than,a,ladies',sewing,circle
everyone,told,me,that,you'd,leased,a,gang,and,put,that,little,plug-,ugly,gallegher,in,charge,to,work,them,to,death
that's,a,lie,she,said,angrily
he,won't,work,them,to,death
i'll,see,to,that
will,you
of,course,i,will
how,can,you,even,insinuate,such,things
oh,i,do,beg,your,pardon,mrs,kennedy
i,know,your,motives,are,always,above,reproach
however,johnnie,gallegher,is,a,cold,little,bully,if,i,ever,saw,one
better,watch,him,or,you'll,be,having,trouble,when,the,inspector,comes,around
you,tend,to,your,business,and,i'll,tend,to,mine,she,said,indignantly
and,i,don't,want,to,talk,about,convicts,any,more
everybody's,been,hateful,about,them
my,gang,is,my,own,business,and,you,haven't,told,me,yet,what,you,do,in,new,orleans
you,go,there,so,often,that,everybody,says,she,paused
she,had,not,intended,to,say,so,much
what,do,they,say
well,that,you,have,a,sweetheart,there
that,you,are,going,to,get,married
are,you,rhett
she,had,been,curious,about,this,for,so,long,that,she,could,not,refrain,from,asking,the,point-blank,question
a,queer,little,pang,of,jealousy,jabbed,at,her,at,the,thought,of,rhett,getting,married,although,why,that,should,be,she,did,not,know
his,bland,eyes,grew,suddenly,alert,and,he,caught,her,gaze,and,held,it,until,a,little,blush,crept,up,into,her,cheeks
would,it,matter,much,to,you
well,i,should,hate,to,lose,your,friendship,she,said,primly,and,with,an,attempt,at,disinterestedness,bent,down,to,pull,the,blanket,closer,about,ella,lorena's,head
he,laughed,suddenly,shortly,and,said,look,at,me,scarlett
she,looked,up,unwillingly,her,blush,deepening
you,can,tell,your,curious,friends,that,when,i,marry,it,will,be,because,i,couldn't,get,the,woman,i,wanted,in,any,other,way
and,i've,never,yet,wanted,a,woman,bad,enough,to,marry,her
now,she,was,indeed,confused,and,embarrassed,for,she,remembered,the,night,on,this,very,porch,during,the,siege,when,he,had,said,i,am,not,a,marrying,man,and,casually,suggested,that,she,become,his,mistress,remembered,too,the,terrible,day,when,he,was,in,jail,and,was,shamed,by,the,memory
a,slow,malicious,smile,went,over,his,face,as,he,read,her,eyes
but,i,will,satisfy,your,vulgar,curiosity,since,you,ask,such,pointed,questions
it,isn't,a,sweetheart,that,takes,me,to,new,orleans
it's,a,child,a,little,boy
a,little,boy
the,shock,of,this,unexpected,information,wiped,out,her,confusion
yes,he,is,my,legal,ward,and,i,am,responsible,for,him
he's,in,school,in,new,orleans
i,go,there,frequently,to,see,him
and,take,him,presents
so,she,thought,that's,how,he,always,knows,what,kind,of,presents,wade,likes
yes,he,said,shortly,unwillingly
well,i,never
is,he,handsome
too,handsome,for,his,own,good
is,he,a,nice,little,boy
no
he's,a,perfect,hellion
i,wish,he,had,never,been,born
boys,are,troublesome,creatures
is,there,anything,else,you'd,like,to,know
he,looked,suddenly,angry,and,his,brow,was,dark,as,though,he,already,regretted,speaking,of,the,matter,at,all
well,not,if,you,don't,want,to,tell,me,any,more,she,said,loftily,though,she,was,burning,for,further,information
but,i,just,can't,see,you,in,the,role,of,a,guardian,and,she,laughed,hoping,to,disconcert,him
no,i,don't,suppose,you,can
your,vision,is,pretty,limited
he,said,no,more,and,smoked,his,cigar,in,silence,for,a,while
she,cast,about,for,some,remark,as,rude,as,his,but,could,think,of,none
i,would,appreciate,it,if,you'd,say,nothing,of,this,to,anyone,he,said,finally
though,i,suppose,that,asking,a,woman,to,keep,her,mouth,shut,is,asking,the,impossible
i,can,keep,a,secret,she,said,with,injured,dignity
can,you
it's,nice,to,learn,unsuspected,things,about,friends
now,stop,pouting,scarlett
i'm,sorry,i,was,rude,but,you,deserved,it,for,prying
give,me,a,smile,and,let's,be,pleasant,for,a,minute,or,two,before,i,take,up,an,unpleasant,subject
oh,dear
she,thought
now,he's,going,to,talk,about,ashley,and,the,mill
and,she,hastened,to,smile,and,show,her,dimple,to,divert,him
where,else,did,you,go,rhett
you,haven't,been,in,new,orleans,all,this,time,have,you
no,for,the,last,month,i've,been,in,charleston
my,father,died
oh,i'm,sorry
don't,be
i'm,sure,he,wasn't,sorry,to,die,and,i'm,sure,i'm,not,sorry,he's,dead
rhett,what,a,dreadful,thing,to,say
it,would,be,much,more,dreadful,if,i,pretended,to,be,sorry,when,i,wasn't,wouldn't,it
there,was,never,any,love,lost,between,us
i,cannot,remember,when,the,old,gentleman,did,not,disapprove,of,me
i,was,too,much,like,his,own,father,and,he,disapproved,heartily,of,his,father
and,as,i,grew,older,his,disapproval,of,me,became,downright,dislike,which,i,admit,i,did,little,to,change
all,the,things,father,wanted,me,to,do,and,be,were,such,boring,things
and,finally,he,threw,me,out,into,the,world,without,a,cent,and,no,training,whatsoever,to,be,anything,but,a,charleston,gentleman,a,good,pistol,shot,and,an,excellent,poker,player
and,he,seemed,to,take,it,as,a,personal,affront,that,i,did,not,starve,but,put,my,poker,playing,to,excellent,advantage,and,supported,myself,royally,by,gambling
he,was,so,affronted,at,a,butler,becoming,a,gambler,that,when,i,came,home,for,the,first,time,he,forbade,my,mother,to,see,me
and,all,during,the,war,when,i,was,blockading,out,of,charleston,mother,had,to,lie,and,slip,off,to,see,me
naturally,that,didn't,increase,my,love,for,him
oh,i,didn't,know,all,that
he,was,what,is,pointed,out,as,a,fine,old,gentleman,of,the,old,school,which,means,that,he,was,ignorant,thick,headed,intolerant,and,incapable,of,thinking,along,any,lines,except,what,other,gentlemen,of,the,old,school,thought
everyone,admired,him,tremendously,for,having,cut,me,off,and,counted,me,as,dead
'if,thy,right,eye,offend,thee,pluck,it,out,'
i,was,his,right,eye,his,oldest,son,and,he,plucked,me,out,with,a,vengeance
he,smiled,a,little,his,eyes,hard,with,amused,memory
well,i,could,forgive,all,that,but,i,can't,forgive,what,he's,done,to,mother,and,my,sister,since,the,war,ended
they've,been,practically,destitute
the,plantation,house,was,burned,and,the,rice,fields,have,gone,back,to,marsh,lands
and,the,town,house,went,for,taxes,and,they've,been,living,in,two,rooms,that,aren't,fit,for,darkies
i've,sent,money,to,mother,but,father,has,sent,it,back,tainted,money,you,see,and,several,times,i've,gone,to,charleston,and,given,money,on,the,sly,to,my,sister
but,father,always,found,out,and,raised,merry,hell,with,her,till,her,life,wasn't,worth,living,poor,girl
and,back,the,money,came,to,me
i,don't,know,how,they've,lived
yes,i,do,know
my,brother's,given,what,he,could,though,he,hasn't,much,to,give,and,he,won't,take,anything,from,me,either,speculator's,money,is,unlucky,money,you,see
and,the,charity,of,their,friends
your,aunt,eulalie,she's,been,very,kind
she's,one,of,mother's,best,friends,you,know
she's,given,them,clothes,and,good,god
my,mother,on,charity
it,was,one,of,the,few,times,she,had,ever,seen,him,with,his,mask,off,his,face,hard,with,honest,hatred,for,his,father,and,distress,for,his,mother
aunt,'lalie
but,good,heavens,rhett,she,hasn't,got,anything,much,above,what,i,send,her
ah,so,that's,where,it,comes,from
how,ill,bred,of,you,my,dear,to,brag,of,such,a,thing,in,the,face,of,my,humiliation
you,must,let,me,reimburse,you
with,pleasure,said,scarlett,her,mouth,suddenly,twisting,into,a,grin,and,he,smiled,back
ah,scarlett,how,the,thought,of,a,dollar,does,make,your,eyes,sparkle
are,you,sure,you,haven't,some,scotch,or,perhaps,jewish,blood,as,well,as,irish
don't,be,hateful
i,didn't,mean,to,throw,it,in,your,face,about,aunt,'lalie
but,honestly,she,thinks,i'm,made,of,money
she's,always,writing,me,for,more,and,god,knows,i've,got,enough,on,my,hands,without,supporting,all,of,charleston
what,did,your,father,die,of
genteel,starvation,i,think,and,hope
it,served,him,right
he,was,willing,to,let,mother,and,rosemary,starve,with,him
now,that,he's,dead,i,can,help,them
i've,bought,them,a,house,on,the,battery,and,they've,servants,to,look,after,them
but,of,course,they,couldn't,let,it,be,known,that,the,money,came,from,me
why,not
my,dear,surely,you,know,charleston
you've,visited,there
my,family,may,be,poor,but,they,have,a,position,to,uphold
and,they,couldn't,uphold,it,if,it,were,known,that,gambling,money,and,speculator's,money,and,carpetbag,money,was,behind,it
no,they,gave,it,out,that,father,left,an,enormous,life,insurance,that,he'd,beggared,himself,and,starved,himself,to,death,to,keep,up,the,payments,so,that,after,he,died,they'd,be,provided,for
so,he,is,looked,upon,as,an,even,greater,gentleman,of,the,old,school,than,before
in,fact,a,martyr,to,his,family
i,hope,he's,turning,in,his,grave,at,the,knowledge,that,mother,and,rosemary,are,comfortable,now,in,spite,of,his,efforts
in,a,way,i'm,sorry,he's,dead,because,he,wanted,to,die,was,so,glad,to,die
why
oh,he,really,died,when,lee,surrendered
you,know,the,type
he,never,could,adjust,himself,to,the,new,times,and,spent,his,time,talking,about,the,good,old,days
rhett,are,all,old,folks,like,that
she,was,thinking,of,gerald,and,what,will,had,said,about,him
heavens,no
just,look,at,your,uncle,henry,and,that,old,wild,cat,mr,merriwether,just,to,name,two
they,took,a,new,lease,on,life,when,they,marched,out,with,the,home,guard,and,it,seems,to,me,that,they've,gotten,younger,and,more,peppery,ever,since
i,met,old,man,merriwether,this,morning,driving,rene's,pie,wagon,and,cursing,the,horse,like,an,army,mule,skinner
he,told,me,he,felt,ten,years,younger,since,he,escaped,from,the,house,and,his,daughter-in-law's,coddling,and,took,to,driving,the,wagon
and,your,uncle,henry,enjoys,fighting,the,yankees,in,court,and,out,and,defending,the,widow,and,the,orphan,free,of,charge,i,fear,against,the,carpetbaggers
if,there,hadn't,been,a,war,he'd,have,retired,long,ago,and,nursed,his,rheumatism
they're,young,again,because,they,are,of,use,again,and,feel,that,they,are,needed
and,they,like,this,new,day,that,gives,old,men,another,chance
but,there,are,plenty,of,people,young,people,who,feel,like,my,father,and,your,father
they,can't,and,won't,adjust,and,that,brings,me,to,the,unpleasant,subject,i,want,to,discuss,with,you,scarlett
his,sudden,shift,so,disconcerted,her,that,she,stammered,what,what,and,inwardly,groaned,oh,lord
now,it's,coming
i,wonder,if,i,can,butter,him,down
i,shouldn't,have,expected,either,truth,or,honor,or,fair,dealing,from,you,knowing,you,as,i,do
but,foolishly,i,trusted,you
i,don't,know,what,you,mean
i,think,you,do
at,any,rate,you,look,very,guilty
as,i,was,riding,along,ivy,street,a,while,ago,on,my,way,to,call,on,you,who,should,hail,me,from,behind,a,hedge,but,mrs,ashley,wilkes
of,course,i,stopped,and,chatted,with,her
indeed
yes,we,had,an,enjoyable,talk
she,told,me,she,had,always,wanted,to,let,me,know,how,brave,she,thought,i,was,to,have,struck,a,blow,for,the,confederacy,even,at,the,eleventh,hour
oh,fiddle-dee-dee
melly's,a,fool
she,might,have,died,that,night,because,you,acted,so,heroic
i,imagine,she,would,have,thought,her,life,given,in,a,good,cause
and,when,i,asked,her,what,she,was,doing,in,atlanta,she,looked,quite,surprised,at,my,ignorance,and,told,me,that,they,were,living,here,now,and,that,you,had,been,kind,enough,to,make,mr,wilkes,a,partner,in,your,mill
well,what,of,it
questioned,scarlett,shortly
when,i,lent,you,the,money,to,buy,that,mill,i,made,one,stipulation,to,which,you,agreed,and,that,was,that,it,should,not,go,to,the,support,of,ashley,wilkes
you,are,being,very,offensive
i've,paid,you,back,your,money,and,i,own,the,mill,and,what,i,do,with,it,is,my,own,business
would,you,mind,telling,me,how,you,made,the,money,to,pay,back,my,loan
i,made,it,selling,lumber,of,course
you,made,it,with,the,money,i,lent,you,to,give,you,your,start
that's,what,you,mean
my,money,is,being,used,to,support,ashley
you,are,a,woman,quite,without,honor,and,if,you,hadn't,repaid,my,loan,i'd,take,great,pleasure,in,calling,it,in,now,and,selling,you,out,at,public,auction,if,you,couldn't,pay
he,spoke,lightly,but,there,was,anger,flickering,in,his,eyes
scarlett,hastily,carried,the,warfare,into,the,enemy's,territory
why,do,you,hate,ashley,so,much
i,believe,you're,jealous,of,him
after,she,had,spoken,she,could,have,bitten,her,tongue,for,he,threw,back,his,head,and,laughed,until,she,went,red,with,mortification
add,conceit,to,dishonor,he,said
you'll,never,get,over,being,the,belle,of,the,county,will,you
you'll,always,think,you're,the,cutest,little,trick,in,shoe,leather,and,that,every,man,you,meet,is,expiring,for,love,of,you
i,don't,either
she,cried,hotly
but,i,just,can't,see,why,you,hate,ashley,so,much,and,that's,the,only,explanation,i,can,think,of
well,think,something,else,pretty,charmer,for,that's,the,wrong,explanation
and,as,for,hating,ashley,i,don't,hate,him,any,more,than,i,like,him
in,fact,my,only,emotion,toward,him,and,his,kind,is,pity
pity
yes,and,a,little,contempt
now,swell,up,like,a,gobbler,and,tell,me,that,he,is,worth,a,thousand,blackguards,like,me,and,that,i,shouldn't,dare,to,be,so,presumptuous,as,to,feel,either,pity,or,contempt,for,him
and,when,you,have,finished,swelling,i'll,tell,you,what,i,mean,if,you're,interested
well,i'm,not
i,shall,tell,you,just,the,same,for,i,can't,bear,for,you,to,go,on,nursing,your,pleasant,delusion,of,my,jealousy
i,pity,him,because,he,ought,to,be,dead,and,he,isn't
and,i,have,a,contempt,for,him,because,he,doesn't,know,what,to,do,with,himself,now,that,his,world,is,gone
there,was,something,familiar,in,the,idea,he,expressed
she,had,a,confused,memory,of,having,heard,similar,words,but,she,could,not,remember,when,and,where
she,did,not,think,very,hard,about,it,for,her,anger,was,hot
if,you,had,your,way,all,the,decent,men,in,the,south,would,be,dead
and,if,they,had,their,way,i,think,ashley's,kind,would,prefer,to,be,dead
dead,with,neat,stones,above,them,saying,'here,lies,a,soldier,of,the,confederacy,dead,for,the,southland',or,'dulce,et,decorum,est,',or,any,of,the,other,popular,epitaphs
i,don't,see,why
you,never,see,anything,that,isn't,written,in,letters,a,foot,high,and,then,shoved,under,your,nose,do,you
if,they,were,dead,their,troubles,would,be,over,there'd,be,no,problems,to,face,problems,that,have,no,solutions
moreover,their,families,would,be,proud,of,them,through,countless,generations
and,i've,heard,the,dead,are,happy
do,you,suppose,ashley,wilkes,is,happy
why,of,course,she,began,and,then,she,remembered,the,look,in,ashley's,eyes,recently,and,stopped
is,he,happy,or,hugh,elsing,or,dr,meade
any,more,than,my,father,and,your,father,were,happy
well,perhaps,not,as,happy,as,they,might,be,because,they've,all,lost,their,money
he,laughed
it,isn't,losing,their,money,my,pet
i,tell,you,it's,losing,their,world,the,world,they,were,raised,in
they're,like,fish,out,of,water,or,cats,with,wings
they,were,raised,to,be,certain,persons,to,do,certain,things,to,occupy,certain,niches
and,those,persons,and,things,and,niches,disappeared,forever,when,general,lee,arrived,at,appomattox
oh,scarlett,don't,look,so,stupid
what,is,there,for,ashley,wilkes,to,do,now,that,his,home,is,gone,and,his,plantation,taken,up,for,taxes,and,fine,gentlemen,are,going,twenty,for,a,penny
can,he,work,with,his,head,or,his,hands
i'll,bet,you've,lost,money,hand,over,fist,since,he,took,over,that,mill
i,have,not
how,nice
may,i,look,over,your,books,some,sunday,evening,when,you,are,at,leisure
you,can,go,to,the,devil,and,not,at,your,leisure
you,can,go,now,for,all,i,care
my,pet,i've,been,to,the,devil,and,he's,a,very,dull,fellow
i,won't,go,there,again,even,for,you
you,took,my,money,when,you,needed,it,desperately,and,you,used,it
we,had,an,agreement,as,to,how,it,should,be,used,and,you,have,broken,that,agreement
just,remember,my,precious,little,cheat,the,time,will,come,when,you,will,want,to,borrow,more,money,from,me
you'll,want,me,to,bank,you,at,some,incredibly,low,interest,so,you,can,buy,more,mills,and,more,mules,and,build,more,saloons
and,you,can,whistle,for,the,money
when,i,need,money,i'll,borrow,it,from,the,bank,thank,you,she,said,coldly,but,her,breast,was,heaving,with,rage
will,you
try,to,do,it
i,own,plenty,of,stock,in,the,bank
you,do
yes,i,am,interested,in,some,honest,enterprises
there,are,other,banks
plenty,of,them
and,if,i,can,manage,it,you'll,play,hell,getting,a,cent,from,any,of,them
you,can,go,to,the,carpetbag,usurers,if,you,want,money
i'll,go,to,them,with,pleasure
you'll,go,but,with,little,pleasure,when,you,learn,their,rates,of,interest
my,pretty,there,are,penalties,in,the,business,world,for,crooked,dealing
you,should,have,played,straight,with,me
you're,a,fine,man,aren't,you
so,rich,and,powerful,yet,picking,on,people,who,are,down,like,ashley,and,me
don't,put,yourself,in,his,class
you,aren't,down
nothing,will,down,you
but,he,is,down,and,he'll,stay,there,unless,there's,some,energetic,person,behind,him,guiding,and,protecting,him,as,long,as,he,lives
i'm,of,no,mind,to,have,my,money,used,for,the,benefit,of,such,a,person
you,didn't,mind,helping,me,and,i,was,down,and
you,were,a,good,risk,my,dear,an,interesting,risk
why
because,you,didn't,plump,yourself,down,on,your,male,relatives,and,sob,for,the,old,days
you,got,out,and,hustled,and,now,your,fortunes,are,firmly,planted,on,money,stolen,from,a,dead,man's,wallet,and,money,stolen,from,the,confederacy
you've,got,murder,to,your,credit,and,husband,stealing,attempted,fornication,lying,and,sharp,dealing,and,any,amount,of,chicanery,that,won't,bear,close,inspection
admirable,things,all,of,them
they,show,you,to,be,a,person,of,energy,and,determination,and,a,good,money,risk
it's,entertaining,helping,people,who,help,themselves
i'd,lend,ten,thousand,dollars,without,even,a,note,to,that,old,roman,matron,mrs,merriwether
she,started,with,a,basket,of,pies,and,look,at,her,now
a,bakery,employing,half,a,dozen,people,old,grandpa,happy,with,his,delivery,wagon,and,that,lazy,little,creole,rene,working,hard,and,liking,it
or,that,poor,devil,tommy,wellburn,who,does,two,men's,work,with,half,a,man's,body,and,does,it,well,or,well,i,won't,go,on,and,bore,you
you,do,bore,me
you,bore,me,to,distraction,said,scarlett,coldly,hoping,to,annoy,him,and,divert,him,from,the,ever-,unfortunate,subject,of,ashley
but,he,only,laughed,shortly,and,refused,to,take,up,the,gauntlet
people,like,them,are,worth,helping
but,ashley,wilkes,bah
his,breed,is,of,no,use,or,value,in,an,upside-down,world,like,ours
whenever,the,world,up-ends,his,kind,is,the,first,to,perish
and,why,not
they,don't,deserve,to,survive,because,they,won't,fight,don't,know,how,to,fight
this,isn't,the,first,time,the,world's,been,upside,down,and,it,won't,be,the,last
it's,happened,before,and,it'll,happen,again
and,when,it,does,happen,everyone,loses,everything,and,everyone,is,equal
and,then,they,all,start,again,at,taw,with,nothing,at,all
that,is,nothing,except,the,cunning,of,their,brains,and,strength,of,their,hands
but,some,people,like,ashley,have,neither,cunning,nor,strength,or,having,them,scruple,to,use,them
and,so,they,go,under,and,they,should,go,under
it's,a,natural,law,and,the,world,is,better,off,without,them
but,there,are,always,a,hardy,few,who,come,through,and,given,time,they,are,right,back,where,they,were,before,the,world,turned,over
you've,been,poor
you,just,said,that,your,father,turned,you,out,without,a,penny
said,scarlett,furious
i,should,think,you'd,understand,and,sympathize,with,ashley
i,do,understand,said,rhett,but,i'm,damned,if,i,sympathize
after,the,surrender,ashley,had,much,more,than,i,had,when,i,was,thrown,out
at,least,he,had,friends,who,took,him,in,whereas,i,was,ishmael
but,what,has,ashley,done,with,himself
if,you,are,comparing,him,with,yourself,you,conceited,thing,why,he's,not,like,you,thank,god
he,wouldn't,soil,his,hands,as,you,do,making,money,with,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,and,yankees
he's,scrupulous,and,honorable
but,not,too,scrupulous,and,honorable,to,take,aid,and,money,from,a,woman
what,else,could,he,have,done
who,am,i,to,say
i,only,know,what,i,did,both,when,i,was,thrown,out,and,nowadays
i,only,know,what,other,men,have,done
we,saw,opportunity,in,the,ruin,of,a,civilization,and,we,made,the,most,of,our,opportunity,some,honestly,some,shadily,and,we,are,still,making,the,most,of,it
but,the,ashleys,of,this,world,have,the,same,chances,and,don't,take,them
they,just,aren't,smart,scarlett,and,only,the,smart,deserve,to,survive
she,hardly,heard,what,he,was,saying,for,now,there,was,coming,back,to,her,the,exact,memory,which,had,teased,her,a,few,minutes,before,when,he,first,began,speaking
she,remembered,the,cold,wind,that,swept,the,orchard,of,tara,and,ashley,standing,by,a,pile,of,rails,his,eyes,looking,beyond,her
and,he,had,said,what
some,funny,foreign,name,that,sounded,like,profanity,and,had,talked,of,the,end,of,the,world
she,had,not,known,what,he,meant,then,but,now,bewildered,comprehension,was,coming,to,her,and,with,it,a,sick,weary,feeling
why,ashley,said
yes
once,at,tara,he,said,something,about,the,a,dusk,of,the,gods,and,about,the,end,of,the,world,and,some,such,foolishness
ah,the,gotterdammerung
rhett's,eyes,were,sharp,with,interest
and,what,else
oh,i,don't,remember,exactly
i,wasn't,paying,much,mind
but,yes,something,about,the,strong,coming,through,and,the,weak,being,winnowed,out
ah,so,he,knows
then,that,makes,it,harder,for,him
most,of,them,don't,know,and,will,never,know
they'll,wonder,all,their,lives,where,the,lost,enchantment,has,vanished
they'll,simply,suffer,in,proud,and,incompetent,silence
but,he,understands
he,knows,he's,winnowed,out
oh,he,isn't
not,while,i've,got,breath,in,my,body
he,looked,at,her,quietly,and,his,brown,face,was,smooth
scarlett,how,did,you,manage,to,get,his,consent,to,come,to,atlanta,and,take,over,the,mill
did,he,struggle,very,hard,against,you
she,had,a,quick,memory,of,the,scene,with,ashley,after,gerald's,funeral,and,put,it,from,her
why,of,course,not,she,replied,indignantly
when,i,explained,to,him,that,i,needed,his,help,because,i,didn't,trust,that,scamp,who,was,running,the,mill,and,frank,was,too,busy,to,help,me,and,i,was,going,to,well,there,was,ella,lorena,you,see
he,was,very,glad,to,help,me,out
sweet,are,the,uses,of,motherhood
so,that's,how,you,got,around,him
well,you've,got,him,where,you,want,him,now,poor,devil,as,shackled,to,you,by,obligations,as,any,of,your,convicts,are,by,their,chains
and,i,wish,you,both,joy
but,as,i,said,at,the,beginning,of,this,discussion,you'll,never,get,another,cent,out,of,me,for,any,of,your,little,unladylike,schemes,my,double-dealing,lady
she,was,smarting,with,anger,and,with,disappointment,as,well
for,some,time,she,had,been,planning,to,borrow,more,money,from,rhett,to,buy,a,lot,downtown,and,start,a,lumber,yard,there
i,can,do,without,your,money,she,cried
i'm,making,money,out,of,johnnie,gallegher's,mill,plenty,of,it,now,that,i,don't,use,free,darkies,and,i,have,some,money,out,on,mortgages,and,we,are,coining,cash,at,the,store,from,the,darky,trade
yes,so,i,heard
how,clever,of,you,to,rook,the,helpless,and,the,widow,and,the,orphan,and,the,ignorant
but,if,you,must,steal,scarlett,why,not,steal,from,the,rich,and,strong,instead,of,the,poor,and,weak
from,robin,hood,on,down,to,now,that's,been,considered,highly,moral
because,said,scarlett,shortly,it's,a,sight,easier,and,safer,to,steal,as,you,call,it,from,the,poor
he,laughed,silently,his,shoulders,shaking
you're,a,fine,honest,rogue,scarlett
a,rogue
queer,that,that,term,should,hurt
she,wasn't,a,rogue,she,told,herself,vehemently
at,least,that,wasn't,what,she,wanted,to,be
she,wanted,to,be,a,great,lady
for,a,moment,her,mind,went,swiftly,down,the,years,and,she,saw,her,mother,moving,with,a,sweet,swish,of,skirts,and,a,faint,fragrance,of,sachet,her,small,busy,hands,tireless,in,the,service,of,others,loved,respected,cherished
and,suddenly,her,heart,was,sick
if,you,are,trying,to,devil,me,she,said,tiredly,it's,no,use
i,know,i'm,not,as,scrupulous,as,i,should,be,these,days
not,as,kind,and,as,pleasant,as,i,was,brought,up,to,be
but,i,can't,help,it,rhett
truly,i,can't
what,else,could,i,have,done
what,would,have,happened,to,me,to,wade,to,tara,and,all,of,us,if,i'd,been,gentle,when,that,yankee,came,to,tara
i,should,have,been,but,i,don't,even,want,to,think,of,that
and,when,jonas,wilkerson,was,going,to,take,the,home,place,suppose,i'd,been,kind,and,scrupulous
where,would,we,all,be,now
and,if,i'd,been,sweet,and,simple,minded,and,not,nagged,frank,about,bad,debts,we'd,oh,well
maybe,i,am,a,rogue,but,i,won't,be,a,rogue,forever,rhett
but,during,these,past,years,and,even,now,what,else,could,i,have,done
how,else,could,i,have,acted
i've,felt,that,i,was,trying,to,row,a,heavily,loaded,boat,in,a,storm
i've,had,so,much,trouble,just,trying,to,keep,afloat,that,i,couldn't,be,bothered,about,things,that,didn't,matter,things,i,could,part,with,easily,and,not,miss,like,good,manners,and,well,things,like,that
i've,been,too,afraid,my,boat,would,be,swamped,and,so,i've,dumped,overboard,the,things,that,seemed,least,important
pride,and,honor,and,truth,and,virtue,and,kindliness,he,enumerated,silkily
you,are,right,scarlett
they,aren't,important,when,a,boat,is,sinking
but,look,around,you,at,your,friends
either,they,are,bringing,their,boats,ashore,safely,with,cargoes,intact,or,they,are,content,to,go,down,with,all,flags,flying
they,are,a,passel,of,fools,she,said,shortly
there's,a,time,for,all,things
when,i've,got,plenty,of,money,i'll,be,nice,as,you,please,too
butter,won't,melt,in,my,mouth
i,can,afford,to,be,then
you,can,afford,to,be,but,you,won't
it's,hard,to,salvage,jettisoned,cargo,and,if,it,is,retrieved,it's,usually,irreparably,damaged
and,i,fear,that,when,you,can,afford,to,fish,up,the,honor,and,virtue,and,kindness,you've,thrown,overboard,you'll,find,they,have,suffered,a,sea,change,and,not,i,fear,into,something,rich,and,strange
he,rose,suddenly,and,picked,up,his,hat
you,are,going
yes
aren't,you,relieved
i,leave,you,to,what,remains,of,your,conscience
he,paused,and,looked,down,at,the,baby,putting,out,a,finger,for,the,child,to,grip
i,suppose,frank,is,bursting,with,pride
oh,of,course
has,a,lot,of,plans,for,this,baby,i,suppose
oh,well,you,know,how,silly,men,are,about,their,babies
then,tell,him,said,rhett,and,stopped,short,an,odd,look,on,his,face,tell,him,if,he,wants,to,see,his,plans,for,his,child,work,out,he'd,better,stay,home,at,night,more,often,than,he's,doing
what,do,you,mean
just,what,i,say
tell,him,to,stay,home
oh,you,vile,creature
to,insinuate,that,poor,frank,would
oh,good,lord
rhett,broke,into,a,roar,of,laughter
i,didn't,mean,he,was,running,around,with,women
frank
oh,good,lord
he,went,down,the,steps,still,laughing
chapter,xliv
the,march,afternoon,was,windy,and,cold,and,scarlett,pulled,the,lap,robe,high,under,her,arms,as,she,drove,out,the,decatur,road,toward,johnnie,gallegher's,mill
driving,alone,was,hazardous,these,days,and,she,knew,it,more,hazardous,than,ever,before,for,now,the,negroes,were,completely,out,of,hand
as,ashley,had,prophesied,there,had,been,hell,to,pay,since,the,legislature,refused,to,ratify,the,amendment
the,stout,refusal,had,been,like,a,slap,in,the,face,of,the,furious,north,and,retaliation,had,come,swiftly
the,north,was,determined,to,force,the,negro,vote,on,the,state,and,to,this,end,georgia,had,been,declared,in,rebellion,and,put,under,the,strictest,martial,law
georgia's,very,existence,as,a,state,had,been,wiped,out,and,it,had,become,with,florida,and,alabama,military,district,number,three,under,the,command,of,a,federal,general
if,life,had,been,insecure,and,frightening,before,this,it,was,doubly,so,now
the,military,regulations,which,had,seemed,so,stringent,the,year,before,were,now,mild,by,comparison,with,the,ones,issued,by,general,pope
confronted,with,the,prospect,of,negro,rule,the,future,seemed,dark,and,hopeless,and,the,embittered,state,smarted,and,writhed,helplessly
as,for,the,negroes,their,new,importance,went,to,their,heads,and,realizing,that,they,had,the,yankee,army,behind,them,their,outrages,increased
no,one,was,safe,from,them
in,this,wild,and,fearful,time,scarlett,was,frightened,frightened,but,determined,and,she,still,made,her,rounds,alone,with,frank's,pistol,tucked,in,the,upholstery,of,the,buggy
she,silently,cursed,the,legislature,for,bringing,this,worse,disaster,upon,them,all
what,good,had,it,done,this,fine,brave,stand,this,gesture,which,everyone,called,gallant
it,had,just,made,matters,so,much,worse
as,she,drew,near,the,path,that,led,down,through,the,bare,trees,into,the,creek,bottom,where,the,shantytown,settlement,was,she,clucked,to,the,horse,to,quicken,his,speed
she,always,felt,uneasy,driving,past,this,dirty,sordid,cluster,of,discarded,army,tents,and,slave,cabins
it,had,the,worst,reputation,of,any,spot,in,or,near,atlanta,for,here,lived,in,filth,outcast,negroes,black,prostitutes,and,a,scattering,of,poor,whites,of,the,lowest,order
it,was,rumored,to,be,the,refuge,of,negro,and,white,criminals,and,was,the,first,place,the,yankee,soldiers,searched,when,they,wanted,a,man
shootings,and,cuttings,went,on,here,with,such,regularity,that,the,authorities,seldom,troubled,to,investigate,and,generally,left,the,shantytowners,to,settle,their,own,dark,affairs
back,in,the,woods,there,was,a,still,that,manufactured,a,cheap,quality,of,corn,whisky,and,by,night,the,cabins,in,the,creek,bottoms,resounded,with,drunken,yells,and,curses
even,the,yankees,admitted,that,it,was,a,plague,spot,and,should,be,wiped,out,but,they,took,no,steps,in,this,direction
indignation,was,loud,among,the,inhabitants,of,atlanta,and,decatur,who,were,forced,to,use,the,road,for,travel,between,the,two,towns
men,went,by,shantytown,with,their,pistols,loosened,in,their,holsters,and,nice,women,never,willingly,passed,it,even,under,the,protection,of,their,men,for,usually,there,were,drunken,negro,slatterns,sitting,along,the,road,hurling,insults,and,shouting,coarse,words
as,long,as,she,had,archie,beside,her,scarlett,had,not,given,shantytown,a,thought,because,not,even,the,most,impudent,negro,woman,dared,laugh,in,her,presence
but,since,she,had,been,forced,to,drive,alone,there,had,been,any,number,of,annoying,maddening,incidents
the,negro,sluts,seemed,to,try,themselves,whenever,she,drove,by
there,was,nothing,she,could,do,except,ignore,them,and,boil,with,rage
she,could,not,even,take,comfort,in,airing,her,troubles,to,her,neighbors,or,family,because,the,neighbors,would,say,triumphantly,well,what,else,did,you,expect
and,her,family,would,take,on,dreadfully,again,and,try,to,stop,her
and,she,had,no,intention,of,stopping,her,trips
thank,heaven,there,were,no,ragged,women,along,the,roadside,today
as,she,passed,the,trail,leading,down,to,the,settlement,she,looked,with,distaste,at,the,group,of,shacks,squatting,in,the,hollow,in,the,dreary,slant,of,the,afternoon,sun
there,was,a,chill,wind,blowing,and,as,she,passed,there,came,to,her,nose,the,mingled,smells,of,wood,smoke,frying,pork,and,untended,privies
averting,her,nose,she,flapped,the,reins,smartly,across,the,horse's,back,and,hurried,him,past,and,around,the,bend,of,the,road
just,as,she,was,beginning,to,draw,a,breath,of,relief,her,heart,rose,in,her,throat,with,sudden,fright,for,a,huge,negro,slipped,silently,from,behind,a,large,oak,tree
she,was,frightened,but,not,enough,to,lose,her,wits,and,in,an,instant,the,horse,was,pulled,up,and,she,had,frank's,pistol,in,her,hand
what,do,you,want
she,cried,with,all,the,sternness,she,could,muster
the,big,negro,ducked,back,behind,the,oak,and,the,voice,that,answered,was,frightened
lawd,miss,scarlett,doan,shoot,big,sam

reluctantly,he,slid,out,of,his,hiding,place,a,giant,ragged,figure,bare-footed,clad,in,denim,breeches,and,a,blue,union,uniform,jacket,that,was,far,too,short,and,tight,for,his,big,frame
when,she,saw,it,was,really,big,sam,she,shoved,the,pistol,down,into,the,upholstery,and,smiled,with,pleasure
oh,sam
how,nice,to,see,you
sam,galloped,over,to,the,buggy,his,eyes,rolling,with,joy,and,his,white,teeth,flashing,and,clutched,her,outstretched,hand,with,two,black,hands,as,big,as,hams
his,watermelon-pink,tongue,lapped,out,his,whole,body,wiggled,and,his,joyful,contortions,were,as,ludicrous,as,the,gambolings,of,a,mastiff

his,face,glowed,with,relief,at,once,more,having,someone,to,tell,him,what,to,do
scarlett,drove,on,thoughtfully

pork,had,never,been,any,good,in,the,fields,and,never,would,be,any,good
with,sam,on,the,place,pork,could,come,to,atlanta,and,join,dilcey,as,she,had,promised,him,when,gerald,died
when,she,reached,the,mill,the,sun,was,setting,and,it,was,later,than,she,cared,to,be,out
johnnie,gallegher,was,standing,in,the,doorway,of,the,miserable,shack,that,served,as,cook,room,for,the,little,lumber,camp
sitting,on,a,log,in,front,of,the,slab-sided,shack,that,was,their,sleeping,quarters,were,four,of,the,five,convicts,scarlett,had,apportioned,to,johnnie's,mill
their,convict,uniforms,were,dirty,and,foul,with,sweat,shackles,clanked,between,their,ankles,when,they,moved,tiredly,and,there,was,an,air,of,apathy,and,despair,about,them
they,were,a,thin,unwholesome,lot,scarlett,thought,peering,sharply,at,them,and,when,she,had,leased,them,so,short,a,time,before,they,were,an,upstanding,crew
they,did,not,even,raise,their,eyes,as,she,dismounted,from,the,buggy,but,johnnie,turned,toward,her,carelessly,dragging,off,his,hat
his,little,brown,face,was,as,hard,as,a,nut,as,he,greeted,her
i,don't,like,the,look,of,the,men,she,said,abruptly
they,don't,look,well
where's,the,other,one
says,he's,sick,said,johnnie,laconically
he's,in,the,bunk,house
what,ails,him
laziness,mostly
i'll,go,see,him
don't,do,that
he's,probably,nekkid
i'll,tend,to,him
he'll,be,back,at,work,tomorrow
scarlett,hesitated,and,saw,one,of,the,convicts,raise,a,weary,head,and,give,johnnie,a,stare,of,intense,hatred,before,he,looked,at,the,ground,again
have,you,been,whipping,these,men
now,mrs,kennedy,begging,your,pardon,who's,running,this,mill
you,put,me,in,charge,and,told,me,to,run,it
you,said,i'd,have,a,free,hand
you,ain't,got,no,complaints,to,make,of,me,have,you
ain't,i,making,twice,as,much,for,you,as,mr,elsing,did
yes,you,are,said,scarlett,but,a,shiver,went,over,her,like,a,goose,walking,across,her,grave
there,was,something,sinister,about,this,camp,with,its,ugly,shacks,something,which,had,not,been,here,when,hugh,elsing,had,it
there,was,a,loneliness,an,isolation,about,it,that,chilled,her
these,convicts,were,so,far,away,from,everything,so,completely,at,the,mercy,of,johnnie,gallegher,and,if,he,chose,to,whip,them,or,otherwise,mistreat,them,she,would,probably,never,know,about,it
the,convicts,would,be,afraid,to,complain,to,her,for,fear,of,worse,punishment,after,she,was,gone
the,men,look,thin
are,you,giving,them,enough,to,eat
god,knows,i,spend,enough,money,on,their,food,to,make,them,fat,as,hogs
the,flour,and,pork,alone,cost,thirty,dollars,last,month
what,are,you,giving,them,for,supper
she,stepped,over,to,the,cook,shack,and,looked,in
a,fat,mulatto,woman,who,was,leaning,over,a,rusty,old,stove,dropped,a,half,curtsy,as,she,saw,scarlett,and,went,on,stirring,a,pot,in,which,black-eyed,peas,were,cooking
scarlett,knew,johnnie,gallegher,lived,with,her,but,thought,it,best,to,ignore,the,fact
she,saw,that,except,for,the,peas,and,a,pan,of,corn,pone,there,was,no,other,food,being,prepared
haven't,you,got,anything,else,for,these,men
no'm
haven't,you,got,any,side,meat,in,these,peas
no'm
no,boiling,bacon,in,the,peas
but,black-eyed,peas,are,no,good,without,bacon
there's,no,strength,to,them
why,isn't,there,any,bacon
mist',johnnie,he,say,dar,ain',no,use,puttin',in,no,side,meat
you'll,put,bacon,in
where,do,you,keep,your,supplies
the,negro,woman,rolled,frightened,eyes,toward,the,small,closet,that,served,as,a,pantry,and,scarlett,threw,the,door,open
there,was,an,open,barrel,of,cornmeal,on,the,floor,a,small,sack,of,flour,a,pound,of,coffee,a,little,sugar,a,gallon,jug,of,sorghum,and,two,hams
one,of,the,hams,sitting,on,the,shelf,had,been,recently,cooked,and,only,one,or,two,slices,had,been,cut,from,it
scarlett,turned,in,a,fury,on,johnnie,gallegher,and,met,his,coldly,angry,gaze
where,are,the,five,sacks,of,white,flour,i,sent,out,last,week
and,the,sugar,sack,and,the,coffee
and,i,had,five,hams,sent,and,ten,pounds,of,side,meat,and,god,knows,how,many,bushels,of,yams,and,irish,potatoes
well,where,are,they
you,can't,have,used,them,all,in,a,week,if,you,fed,the,men,five,meals,a,day
you've,sold,them
that's,what,you've,done,you,thief
sold,my,good,supplies,and,put,the,money,in,your,pocket,and,fed,these,men,on,dried,peas,and,corn,pone
no,wonder,they,look,so,thin
get,out,of,the,way
she,stormed,past,him,to,the,doorway
you,man,there,on,the,end,yes,you
come,here
the,man,rose,and,walked,awkwardly,toward,her,his,shackles,clanking,and,she,saw,that,his,bare,ankles,were,red,and,raw,from,the,chafing,of,the,iron
when,did,you,last,have,ham
the,man,looked,down,at,the,ground
speak,up
still,the,man,stood,silent,and,abject
finally,he,raised,his,eyes,looked,scarlett,in,the,face,imploringly,and,dropped,his,gaze,again
scared,to,talk,eh
well,go,in,the,pantry,and,get,that,ham,off,the,shelf
rebecca,give,him,your,knife
take,it,out,to,those,men,and,divide,it,up
rebecca,make,some,biscuits,and,coffee,for,the,men
and,serve,plenty,of,sorghum
start,now,so,i,can,see,you,do,it
dat's,mist',johnnie's,privut,flour,an',coffee,rebecca,muttered,frightenedly
mr,johnnie's,my,foot
i,suppose,it's,his,private,ham,too
you,do,what,i,say
get,busy
johnnie,gallegher,come,out,to,the,buggy,with,me
she,stalked,across,the,littered,yard,and,climbed,into,the,buggy,noticing,with,grim,satisfaction,that,the,men,were,tearing,at,the,ham,and,cramming,bits,into,their,mouths,voraciously
they,looked,as,if,they,feared,it,would,be,taken,from,them,at,any,minute
you,are,a,rare,scoundrel
she,cried,furiously,to,johnnie,as,he,stood,at,the,wheel,his,hat,pushed,back,from,his,lowering,brow
and,you,can,just,hand,over,to,me,the,price,of,my,supplies
in,the,future,i'll,bring,you,provisions,every,day,instead,of,ordering,them,by,the,month
then,you,can't,cheat,me
in,the,future,i,won't,be,here,said,johnnie,gallegher
you,mean,you,are,quitting
for,a,moment,it,was,on,scarlett's,hot,tongue,to,cry,go,and,good,riddance
but,the,cool,hand,of,caution,stopped,her
if,johnnie,should,quit,what,would,she,do
he,had,been,doubling,the,amount,of,lumber,hugh,turned,out
and,just,now,she,had,a,big,order,the,biggest,she,had,ever,had,and,a,rush,order,at,that
she,had,to,get,that,lumber,into,atlanta
if,johnnie,quit,whom,would,she,get,to,take,over,the,mill
yes,i'm,quitting
you,put,me,in,complete,charge,here,and,you,told,me,that,all,you,expected,of,me,was,as,much,lumber,as,i,could,possibly,get,out
you,didn't,tell,me,how,to,run,my,business,then,and,i'm,not,aiming,to,have,you,start,now
how,i,get,the,lumber,out,is,no,affair,of,yours
you,can't,complain,that,i've,fallen,down,on,my,bargain
i've,made,money,for,you,and,i've,earned,my,salary,and,what,i,could,pick,up,on,the,side,too
and,here,you,come,out,here,interfering,asking,questions,and,breaking,my,authority,in,front,of,the,men
how,can,you,expect,me,to,keep,discipline,after,this
what,if,the,men,do,get,an,occasional,lick
the,lazy,scum,deserve,worse
what,if,they,ain't,fed,up,and,pampered
they,don't,deserve,nothing,better
either,you,tend,to,your,business,and,let,me,tend,to,mine,or,i,quit,tonight
his,hard,little,face,looked,flintier,than,ever,and,scarlett,was,in,a,quandary
if,he,quit,tonight,what,would,she,do
she,couldn't,stay,here,all,night,guarding,the,convicts
something,of,her,dilemma,showed,in,her,eyes,for,johnnie's,expression,changed,subtly,and,some,of,the,hardness,went,out,of,his,face
there,was,an,easy,agreeable,note,in,his,voice,when,he,spoke
it's,getting,late,mrs,kennedy,and,you'd,better,be,getting,on,home
we,ain't,going,to,fall,out,over,a,little,thing,like,this,are,we
s'pose,you,take,ten,dollars,out,of,my,next,month's,wages,and,let's,call,it,square
scarlett's,eyes,went,unwillingly,to,the,miserable,group,gnawing,on,the,ham,and,she,thought,of,the,sick,man,lying,in,the,windy,shack
she,ought,to,get,rid,of,johnnie,gallegher
he,was,a,thief,and,a,brutal,man
there,was,no,telling,what,he,did,to,the,convicts,when,she,wasn't,there
but,on,the,other,hand,he,was,smart,and,god,knows,she,needed,a,smart,man
well,she,couldn't,part,with,him,now
he,was,making,money,for,her
she'd,just,have,to,see,to,it,that,the,convicts,got,their,proper,rations,in,the,future
i'll,take,twenty,dollars,out,of,your,wages,she,said,shortly,and,i'll,be,back,and,discuss,the,matter,further,in,the,morning
she,picked,up,the,reins
but,she,knew,there,would,be,no,further,discussion
she,knew,that,the,matter,had,ended,there,and,she,knew,johnnie,knew,it
as,she,drove,off,down,the,path,to,the,decatur,road,her,conscience,battled,with,her,desire,for,money
she,knew,she,had,no,business,exposing,human,lives,to,the,hard,little,man's,mercies
if,he,should,cause,the,death,of,one,of,them,she,would,be,as,guilty,as,he,was,for,she,had,kept,him,in,charge,after,learning,of,his,brutalities
but,on,the,other,hand,well,on,the,other,hand,men,had,no,business,getting,to,be,convicts
if,they,broke,laws,and,got,caught,then,they,deserved,what,they,got
this,partly,salved,her,conscience,but,as,she,drove,down,the,road,the,dull,thin,faces,of,the,convicts,would,keep,coming,back,into,her,mind
oh,i'll,think,of,them,later,she,decided,and,pushed,the,thought,into,the,lumber,room,of,her,mind,and,shut,the,door,upon,it
the,sun,had,completely,gone,when,she,reached,the,bend,in,the,road,above,shantytown,and,the,woods,about,her,were,dark
with,the,disappearance,of,the,sun,a,bitter,chill,had,fallen,on,the,twilight,world,and,a,cold,wind,blew,through,the,dark,woods,making,the,bare,boughs,crack,and,the,dead,leaves,rustle
she,had,never,been,out,this,late,by,herself,and,she,was,uneasy,and,wished,herself,home
big,sam,was,nowhere,to,be,seen,and,as,she,drew,rein,to,wait,for,him,she,worried,about,his,absence,fearing,the,yankees,might,have,already,picked,him,up
then,she,heard,footsteps,coming,up,the,path,from,the,settlement,and,a,sigh,of,relief,went,through,her,lips
she'd,certainly,dress,sam,down,for,keeping,her,waiting
but,it,wasn't,sam,who,came,round,the,bend
it,was,a,big,ragged,white,man,and,a,squat,black,negro,with,shoulders,and,chest,like,a,gorilla
swiftly,she,flapped,the,reins,on,the,horse's,back,and,clutched,the,pistol
the,horse,started,to,trot,and,suddenly,shied,as,the,white,man,threw,up,his,hand
lady,he,said,can,you,give,me,a,quarter
i'm,sure,hungry
get,out,of,the,way,she,answered,keeping,her,voice,as,steady,as,she,could
i,haven't,got,any,money
giddap
with,a,sudden,swift,movement,the,man's,hand,was,on,the,horse's,bridle
grab,her
he,shouted,to,the,negro
she's,probably,got,her,money,in,her,bosom
what,happened,next,was,like,a,nightmare,to,scarlett,and,it,all,happened,so,quickly
she,brought,up,her,pistol,swiftly,and,some,instinct,told,her,not,to,fire,at,the,white,man,for,fear,of,shooting,the,horse
as,the,negro,came,running,to,the,buggy,his,black,face,twisted,in,a,leering,grin,she,fired,point-blank,at,him
whether,or,not,she,hit,him,she,never,knew,but,the,next,minute,the,pistol,was,wrenched,from,her,hand,by,a,grasp,that,almost,broke,her,wrist
the,negro,was,beside,her,so,close,that,she,could,smell,the,rank,odor,of,him,as,he,tried,to,drag,her,over,the,buggy,side
with,her,one,free,hand,she,fought,madly,clawing,at,his,face,and,then,she,felt,his,big,hand,at,her,throat,and,with,a,ripping,noise,her,basque,was,torn,open,from,neck,to,waist
then,the,black,hand,fumbled,between,her,breasts,and,terror,and,revulsion,such,as,she,had,never,known,came,over,her,and,she,screamed,like,an,insane,woman
shut,her,up
drag,her,out
cried,the,white,man,and,the,black,hand,fumbled,across,scarlett's,face,to,her,mouth
she,bit,as,savagely,as,she,could,and,then,screamed,again,and,through,her,screaming,she,heard,the,white,man,swear,and,realized,that,there,was,a,third,man,in,the,dark,road

run,miss,scarlett
yelled,sam,grappling,with,the,negro,and,scarlett,shaking,and,screaming,clutched,up,the,reins,and,whip,and,laid,them,both,over,the,horse
it,went,off,at,a,jump,and,she,felt,the,wheels,pass,over,something,soft,something,resistant
it,was,the,white,man,who,lay,in,the,road,where,sam,had,knocked,him,down
maddened,by,terror,she,lashed,the,horse,again,and,again,and,it,struck,a,gait,that,made,the,buggy,rock,and,sway
through,her,terror,she,was,conscious,of,the,sound,of,feet,running,behind,her,and,she,screamed,at,the,horse,to,go,faster

that,night,when,frank,deposited,her,and,aunt,pitty,and,the,children,at,melanie's,and,rode,off,down,the,street,with,ashley,scarlett,could,have,burst,with,rage,and,hurt
how,could,he,go,off,to,a,political,meeting,on,this,of,all,nights,in,the,world
a,political,meeting
and,on,the,same,night,when,she,had,been,attacked,when,anything,might,have,happened,to,her
it,was,unfeeling,and,selfish,of,him
but,then,he,had,taken,the,whole,affair,with,maddening,calm,ever,since,sam,had,carried,her,sobbing,into,the,house,her,basque,gaping,to,the,waist
he,hadn't,clawed,his,beard,even,once,when,she,cried,out,her,story
he,had,just,questioned,gently,sugar,are,you,hurt,or,just,scared
wrath,mingling,with,her,tears,she,had,been,unable,to,answer,and,sam,had,volunteered,that,she,was,just,scared
ah,got,dar,fo',dey,done,mo'n,t'ar,her,dress

de,yankees,is,affer,me
frank,had,listened,to,this,statement,calmly,too,and,had,asked,no,questions
he,had,looked,very,much,as,he,did,the,night,tony,came,beating,on,their,door,as,though,this,was,an,exclusively,masculine,affair,and,one,to,be,handled,with,a,minimum,of,words,and,emotions
you,go,get,in,the,buggy
i'll,have,peter,drive,you,as,far,as,rough,and,ready,tonight,and,you,can,hide,in,the,woods,till,morning,and,then,catch,the,train,to,jonesboro

it's,all,over,now,and,you,aren't,really,hurt
miss,pitty,could,i,have,your,smelling,salts
and,mammy,fetch,miss,scarlett,a,glass,of,wine
scarlett,had,burst,into,renewed,tears,this,time,tears,of,rage
she,wanted,comforting,indignation,threats,of,vengeance
she,would,even,have,preferred,him,storming,at,her,saying,that,this,was,just,what,he,had,warned,her,would,happen,anything,rather,than,have,him,take,it,all,so,casually,and,treat,her,danger,as,a,matter,of,small,moment
he,was,nice,and,gentle,of,course,but,in,an,absent,way,as,if,he,had,something,far,more,important,on,his,mind
and,that,important,thing,had,turned,out,to,be,a,small,political,meeting
she,could,hardly,believe,her,ears,when,he,told,her,to,change,her,dress,and,get,ready,for,him,to,escort,her,over,to,melanie's,for,the,evening
he,must,know,how,harrowing,her,experience,had,been,must,know,she,did,not,want,to,spend,an,evening,at,melanie's,when,her,tired,body,and,jangled,nerves,cried,out,for,the,warm,relaxation,of,bed,and,blankets,with,a,hot,brick,to,make,her,toes,tingle,and,a,hot,toddy,to,soothe,her,fears
if,he,really,loved,her,nothing,could,have,forced,him,from,her,side,on,this,of,all,nights
he,would,have,stayed,home,and,held,her,hand,and,told,her,over,and,over,that,he,would,have,died,if,anything,had,happened,to,her
and,when,he,came,home,tonight,and,she,had,him,alone,she,would,certainly,tell,him,so
melanie's,small,parlor,looked,as,serene,as,it,usually,did,on,nights,when,frank,and,ashley,were,away,and,the,women,gathered,together,to,sew
the,room,was,warm,and,cheerful,in,the,firelight
the,lamp,on,the,table,shed,a,quiet,yellow,glow,on,the,four,smooth,heads,bent,to,their,needlework
four,skirts,billowed,modestly,eight,small,feet,were,daintily,placed,on,low,hassocks
the,quiet,breathing,of,wade,ella,and,beau,came,through,the,open,door,of,the,nursery
archie,sat,on,a,stool,by,the,hearth,his,back,against,the,fireplace,his,cheek,distended,with,tobacco,whittling,industriously,on,a,bit,of,wood
the,contrast,between,the,dirty,hairy,old,man,and,the,four,neat,fastidious,ladies,was,as,great,as,though,he,were,a,grizzled,vicious,old,watchdog,and,they,four,small,kittens
melanie's,soft,voice,tinged,with,indignation,went,on,and,on,as,she,told,of,the,recent,outburst,of,temperament,on,the,part,of,the,lady,harpists
unable,to,agree,with,the,gentlemen's,glee,club,as,to,the,program,for,their,next,recital,the,ladies,had,waited,on,melanie,that,afternoon,and,announced,their,intention,of,withdrawing,completely,from,the,musical,circle
it,had,taken,all,of,melanie's,diplomacy,to,persuade,them,to,defer,their,decision
scarlett,overwrought,could,have,screamed,oh,damn,the,lady,harpists
she,wanted,to,talk,about,her,dreadful,experience
she,was,bursting,to,relate,it,in,detail,so,she,could,ease,her,own,fright,by,frightening,the,others
she,wanted,to,tell,how,brave,she,had,been,just,to,assure,herself,by,the,sound,of,her,own,words,that,she,had,indeed,been,brave
but,every,time,she,brought,up,the,subject,melanie,deftly,steered,the,conversation,into,other,and,innocuous,channels
this,irritated,scarlett,almost,beyond,endurance
they,were,as,mean,as,frank
how,could,they,be,so,calm,and,placid,when,she,had,just,escaped,so,terrible,a,fate
they,weren't,even,displaying,common,courtesy,in,denying,her,the,relief,of,talking,about,it
the,events,of,the,afternoon,had,shaken,her,more,than,she,cared,to,admit,even,to,herself
every,time,she,thought,of,that,malignant,black,face,peering,at,her,from,the,shadows,of,the,twilight,forest,road,she,fell,to,trembling
when,she,thought,of,the,black,hand,at,her,bosom,and,what,would,have,happened,if,big,sam,had,not,appeared,she,bent,her,head,lower,and,squeezed,her,eyes,tightly,shut
the,longer,she,sat,silent,in,the,peaceful,room,trying,to,sew,listening,to,melanie's,voice,the,tighter,her,nerves,stretched
she,felt,that,at,any,moment,she,would,actually,hear,them,break,with,the,same,pinging,sound,a,banjo,string,makes,when,it,snaps
archie's,whittling,annoyed,her,and,she,frowned,at,him
suddenly,it,seemed,odd,that,he,should,be,sitting,there,occupying,himself,with,a,piece,of,wood
usually,he,lay,flat,on,the,sofa,during,the,evenings,when,he,was,on,guard,and,slept,and,snored,so,violently,that,his,long,beard,leaped,into,the,air,with,each,rumbling,breath
it,was,odder,still,that,neither,melanie,nor,india,hinted,to,him,that,he,should,spread,a,paper,on,the,floor,to,catch,his,litter,of,shavings
he,had,already,made,a,perfect,mess,on,the,hearth,rug,but,they,did,not,seem,to,have,noticed,it
while,she,watched,him,archie,turned,suddenly,toward,the,fire,and,spat,a,stream,of,tobacco,juice,on,it,with,such,vehemence,that,india,melanie,and,pitty,leaped,as,though,a,bomb,had,exploded
need,you,expectorate,so,loudly
cried,india,in,a,voice,that,cracked,with,nervous,annoyance
scarlett,looked,at,her,in,surprise,for,india,was,always,so,self-contained
archie,gave,her,look,for,look
i,reckon,i,do,he,answered,coldly,and,spat,again
melanie,gave,a,little,frowning,glance,at,india
i,was,always,so,glad,dear,papa,didn't,chew,began,pitty,and,melanie,her,frown,creasing,deeper,swung,on,her,and,spoke,sharper,words,than,scarlett,had,ever,heard,her,speak
oh,do,hush,auntie
you're,so,tactless
oh,dear
pitty,dropped,her,sewing,in,her,lap,and,her,mouth,pressed,up,in,hurt
i,declare,i,don't,know,what,ails,you,all,tonight
you,and,india,are,just,as,jumpy,and,cross,as,two,old,sticks
no,one,answered,her
melanie,did,not,even,apologize,for,her,crossness,but,went,back,to,her,sewing,with,small,violence
you're,taking,stitches,an,inch,long,declared,pitty,with,some,satisfaction
you'll,have,to,take,every,one,of,them,out
what's,the,matter,with,you
but,melanie,still,did,not,answer
was,there,anything,the,matter,with,them,scarlett,wondered
had,she,been,too,absorbed,with,her,own,fears,to,notice
yes,despite,melanie's,attempts,to,make,the,evening,appear,like,any,one,of,fifty,they,had,all,spent,together,there,was,a,difference,due,to,their,alarm,and,shock,at,what,had,happened,that,afternoon
scarlett,stole,glances,at,her,companions,and,intercepted,a,look,from,india
it,discomforted,her,because,it,was,a,long,measuring,glance,that,carried,in,its,cold,depths,something,stronger,than,hate,something,more,insulting,than,contempt
as,though,she,thought,i,was,to,blame,for,what,happened,scarlett,thought,indignantly
india,turned,from,her,to,archie,and,all,annoyance,at,him,gone,from,her,face,gave,him,a,look,of,veiled,anxious,inquiry
but,he,did,not,meet,her,eyes
he,did,however,look,at,scarlett,staring,at,her,in,the,same,cold,hard,way,india,had,done
silence,fell,dully,in,the,room,as,melanie,did,not,take,up,the,conversation,again,and,in,the,silence,scarlett,heard,the,rising,wind,outside
it,suddenly,began,to,be,a,most,unpleasant,evening
now,she,began,to,feel,the,tension,in,the,air,and,she,wondered,if,it,had,been,present,all,during,the,evening,and,she,too,upset,to,notice,it
about,archie's,face,there,was,an,alert,waiting,look,and,his,tufted,hairy,old,ears,seemed,pricked,up,like,a,lynx's
there,was,a,severely,repressed,uneasiness,about,melanie,and,india,that,made,them,raise,their,heads,from,their,sewing,at,each,sound,of,hooves,in,the,road,at,each,groan,of,bare,branches,under,the,wailing,wind,at,each,scuffing,sound,of,dry,leaves,tumbling,across,the,lawn
they,started,at,each,soft,snap,of,burning,logs,on,the,hearth,as,if,they,were,stealthy,footsteps
something,was,wrong,and,scarlett,wondered,what,it,was
something,was,afoot,and,she,did,not,know,about,it
a,glance,at,aunt,pitty's,plump,guileless,face,screwed,up,in,a,pout,told,her,that,the,old,lady,was,as,ignorant,as,she
but,archie,and,melanie,and,india,knew
in,the,silence,she,could,almost,feel,the,thoughts,of,india,and,melanie,whirling,as,madly,as,squirrels,in,a,cage
they,knew,something,were,waiting,for,something,despite,their,efforts,to,make,things,appear,as,usual
and,their,inner,unease,communicated,itself,to,scarlett,making,her,more,nervous,than,before
handling,her,needle,awkwardly,she,jabbed,it,into,her,thumb,and,with,a,little,scream,of,pain,and,annoyance,that,made,them,all,jump,she,squeezed,it,until,a,bright,red,drop,appeared
i'm,just,too,nervous,to,sew,she,declared,throwing,her,mending,to,the,floor
i'm,nervous,enough,to,scream
i,want,to,go,home,and,go,to,bed
and,frank,knew,it,and,he,oughtn't,to,have,gone,out
he,talks,talks,talks,about,protecting,women,against,darkies,and,carpetbaggers,and,when,the,time,comes,for,him,to,do,some,protecting,where,is,he
at,home,taking,care,of,me
no,indeed,he's,gallivanting,around,with,a,lot,of,other,men,who,don't,do,anything,but,talk,and
her,snapping,eyes,came,to,rest,on,india's,face,and,she,paused
india,was,breathing,fast,and,her,pale,lashless,eyes,were,fastened,on,scarlett's,face,with,a,deadly,coldness
if,it,won't,pain,you,too,much,india,she,broke,off,sarcastically,i'd,be,much,obliged,if,you'd,tell,me,why,you've,been,staring,at,me,all,evening
has,my,face,turned,green,or,something
it,won't,pain,me,to,tell,you
i'll,do,it,with,pleasure,said,india,and,her,eyes,glittered
i,hate,to,see,you,underrate,a,fine,man,like,mr,kennedy,when,if,you,knew
india
said,melanie,warningly,her,hands,clenching,on,her,sewing
i,think,i,know,my,husband,better,than,you,do,said,scarlett,the,prospect,of,a,quarrel,the,first,open,quarrel,she,had,ever,had,with,india,making,her,spirits,rise,and,her,nervousness,depart
melanie's,eyes,caught,india's,and,reluctantly,india,closed,her,lips
but,almost,instantly,she,spoke,again,and,her,voice,was,cold,with,hate
you,make,me,sick,scarlett,o'hara,talking,about,being,protected
you,don't,care,about,being,protected
if,you,did,you'd,never,have,exposed,yourself,as,you,have,done,all,these,months,prissing,yourself,about,this,town,showing,yourself,off,to,strange,men,hoping,they'll,admire,you
what,happened,to,you,this,afternoon,was,just,what,you,deserved,and,if,there,was,any,justice,you'd,have,gotten,worse
oh,india,hush
cried,melanie
let,her,talk,cried,scarlett
i'm,enjoying,it
i,always,knew,she,hated,me,and,she,was,too,much,of,a,hypocrite,to,admit,it
if,she,thought,anyone,would,admire,her,she'd,be,walking,the,streets,naked,from,dawn,till,dark
india,was,on,her,feet,her,lean,body,quivering,with,insult
i,do,hate,you,she,said,in,a,clear,but,trembling,voice
but,it,hasn't,been,hypocrisy,that's,kept,me,quiet
it's,something,you,can't,understand,not,possessing,any,any,common,courtesy,common,good,breeding
it's,the,realization,that,if,all,of,us,don't,hang,together,and,submerge,our,own,small,hates,we,can't,expect,to,beat,the,yankees
but,you,you,you've,done,all,you,could,to,lower,the,prestige,of,decent,people,working,and,bringing,shame,on,a,good,husband,giving,yankees,and,riffraff,the,right,to,laugh,at,us,and,make,insulting,remarks,about,our,lack,of,gentility
yankees,don't,know,that,you,aren't,one,of,us,and,have,never,been
yankees,haven't,sense,enough,to,know,that,you,haven't,any,gentility
and,when,you've,ridden,about,the,woods,exposing,yourself,to,attack,you've,exposed,every,well-behaved,woman,in,town,to,attack,by,putting,temptation,in,the,ways,of,darkies,and,mean,white,trash
and,you've,put,our,men,folks',lives,in,danger,because,they've,got,to
my,god,india
cried,melanie,and,even,in,her,wrath,scarlett,was,stunned,to,hear,melanie,take,the,lord's,name,in,vain
you,must,hush
she,doesn't,know,and,she,you,must,hush
you,promised
oh,girls
pleaded,miss,pittypat,her,lips,trembling
what,don't,i,know
scarlett,was,on,her,feet,furious,facing,the,coldly,blazing,india,and,the,imploring,melanie
guinea,hens,said,archie,suddenly,and,his,voice,was,contemptuous
before,anyone,could,rebuke,him,his,grizzled,head,went,up,sharply,and,he,rose,swiftly
somebody,comin',up,the,walk
'tain't,mr,wilkes,neither
cease,your,cackle
there,was,male,authority,in,his,voice,and,the,women,stood,suddenly,silent,anger,fading,swiftly,from,their,faces,as,he,stumped,across,the,room,to,the,door
who's,thar
he,questioned,before,the,caller,even,knocked
captain,butler
let,me,in
melanie,was,across,the,floor,so,swiftly,that,her,hoops,swayed,up,violently,revealing,her,pantalets,to,the,knees,and,before,archie,could,put,his,hand,on,the,knob,she,flung,the,door,open
rhett,butler,stood,in,the,doorway,his,black,slouch,hat,low,over,his,eyes,the,wild,wind,whipping,his,cape,about,him,in,snapping,folds
for,once,his,good,manners,had,deserted,him
he,neither,took,off,his,hat,nor,spoke,to,the,others,in,the,room
he,had,eyes,for,no,one,but,melanie,and,he,spoke,abruptly,without,greeting
where,have,they,gone
tell,me,quickly
it's,life,or,death
scarlett,and,pitty,startled,and,bewildered,looked,at,each,other,in,wonderment,and,like,a,lean,old,cat,india,streaked,across,the,room,to,melanie's,side
don't,tell,him,anything,she,cried,swiftly
he's,a,spy,a,scallawag
rhett,did,not,even,favor,her,with,a,glance
quickly,mrs,wilkes
there,may,still,be,time
melanie,seemed,in,a,paralysis,of,terror,and,only,stared,into,his,face

git,the,hell,out,of,here,you,damned,scallawag

what,has,happened
how,did,how,did,you,know
on,rhett's,dark,face,impatience,fought,with,courtesy
good,god,mrs,wilkes,they've,all,been,under,suspicion,since,the,beginning,only,they've,been,too,clever,until,tonight

the,yankees,knew,there'd,be,trouble,tonight,and,they've,prepared,for,it
the,fools,have,walked,into,a,trap
for,a,moment,it,was,as,though,melanie,swayed,under,the,impact,of,a,heavy,blow,and,rhett's,arm,went,around,her,waist,to,steady,her
don't,tell,him
he's,trying,to,trap,you
cried,india,glaring,at,rhett
didn't,you,hear,him,say,he'd,been,with,yankee,officers,tonight
still,rhett,did,not,look,at,her
his,eyes,were,bent,insistently,on,melanie's,white,face
tell,me
where,did,they,go
have,they,a,meeting,place
despite,her,fear,and,incomprehension,scarlett,thought,she,had,never,seen,a,blanker,more,expressionless,face,than,rhett's,but,evidently,melanie,saw,something,else,something,that,made,her,give,her,trust
she,straightened,her,small,body,away,from,the,steadying,arm,and,said,quietly,but,with,a,voice,that,shook
out,the,decatur,road,near,shantytown
they,meet,in,the,cellar,of,the,old,sullivan,plantation,the,one,that's,half-burned
thank,you
i'll,ride,fast
when,the,yankees,come,here,none,of,you,know,anything
he,was,gone,so,swiftly,his,black,cape,melting,into,the,night,that,they,could,hardly,realize,he,had,been,there,at,all,until,they,heard,the,spattering,of,gravel,and,the,mad,pounding,of,a,horse,going,off,at,full,gallop
the,yankees,coming,here
cried,pitty,and,her,small,feet,turning,under,her,she,collapsed,on,the,sofa,too,frightened,for,tears
what's,it,all,about
what,did,he,mean
if,you,don't,tell,me,i'll,go,crazy
scarlett,laid,hands,on,melanie,and,shook,her,violently,as,if,by,force,she,could,shake,an,answer,from,her
mean
it,means,you've,probably,been,the,cause,of,ashley's,and,mr,kennedy's,death
in,spite,of,the,agony,of,fear,there,was,a,note,of,triumph,in,india's,voice
stop,shaking,melly

melanie,had,mastered,her,voice,but,her,white,shaken,face,and,tortured,eyes,showed,the,strain,under,which,she,was,laboring
scarlett,perhaps,we,should,have,told,you,but,but,you,had,been,through,so,much,this,afternoon,that,we,that,frank,didn't,think,and,you,were,always,so,outspoken,against,the,klan
the,klan
at,first,scarlett,spoke,the,word,as,if,she,had,never,heard,it,before,and,had,no,comprehension,of,its,meaning,and,then
the,klan
she,almost,screamed,it
ashley,isn't,in,the,klan

you,all,have,known,all,along,and,i,didn't
we,were,afraid,it,would,upset,you,said,melanie,sorrowfully
then,that's,where,they,go,when,they're,supposed,to,be,at,the,political,meetings
oh,he,promised,me
now,the,yankees,will,come,and,take,my,mills,and,the,store,and,put,him,in,jail,oh,what,did,rhett,butler,mean
india's,eyes,met,melanie's,in,wild,fear
scarlett,rose,flinging,her,sewing,down
if,you,don't,tell,me,i'm,going,downtown,and,find,out
i'll,ask,everybody,i,see,until,i,find

i'll,tell,you

and,if,what,that,scallawag,said,is,true,the,yankees,suspected,sumpin',or,got,wind,somehow,and,they've,sont,out,troops,to,lay,for,them
and,our,men,have,walked,into,a,trap
and,if,what,butler,said,warn't,true,then,he's,a,spy,and,he,is,goin',to,turn,them,up,to,the,yankees,and,they'll,git,kilt,just,the,same
and,if,he,does,turn,them,up,then,i'll,kill,him,if,it's,the,last,deed,of,m',life

it's,all,yore,fault,and,thar's,blood,on,yore,hands
anger,wiped,out,the,fear,from,melanie's,face,as,she,saw,comprehension,come,slowly,across,scarlett's,face,and,then,horror,follow,swiftly
she,rose,and,put,her,hand,on,scarlett's,shoulder
another,such,word,and,you,go,out,of,this,house,archie,she,said,sternly
it's,not,her,fault
she,only,did,did,what,she,felt,she,had,to,do
and,our,men,did,what,they,felt,they,had,to,do
people,must,do,what,they,must,do
we,don't,all,think,alike,or,act,alike,and,it's,wrong,to,to,judge,others,by,ourselves
how,can,you,and,india,say,such,cruel,things,when,her,husband,as,well,as,mine,may,be,may,be
hark
interrupted,archie,softly
set,ma'm
thar's,horses
melanie,sank,into,a,chair,picked,up,one,of,ashley's,shirts,and,bowing,her,head,over,it,unconsciously,began,to,tear,the,frills,into,small,ribbons
the,sound,of,hooves,grew,louder,as,horses,trotted,up,to,the,house
there,was,the,jangling,of,bits,and,the,strain,of,leather,and,the,sound,of,voices
as,the,hooves,stopped,in,front,of,the,house,one,voice,rose,above,the,others,in,a,command,and,the,listeners,heard,feet,going,through,the,side,yard,toward,the,back,porch
they,felt,that,a,thousand,inimical,eyes,looked,at,them,through,the,unshaded,front,window,and,the,four,women,with,fear,in,their,hearts,bent,their,heads,and,plied,their,needles
scarlett's,heart,screamed,in,her,breast,i've,killed,ashley
i've,killed,him
and,in,that,wild,moment,she,did,not,even,think,that,she,might,have,killed,frank,too
she,had,no,room,in,her,mind,for,any,picture,save,that,of,ashley,lying,at,the,feet,of,yankee,cavalrymen,his,fair,hair,dappled,with,blood
as,the,harsh,rapid,knocking,sounded,at,the,door,she,looked,at,melanie,and,saw,come,over,the,small,strained,face,a,new,expression,an,expression,as,blank,as,she,had,just,seen,on,rhett,butler's,face,the,bland,blank,look,of,a,poker,player,bluffing,a,game,with,only,two,deuces
archie,open,the,door,she,said,quietly
slipping,his,knife,into,his,boot,top,and,loosening,the,pistol,in,his,trouser,band,archie,stumped,over,to,the,door,and,flung,it,open
pitty,gave,a,little,squeak,like,a,mouse,who,feels,the,trap,snap,down,as,she,saw,massed,in,the,doorway,a,yankee,captain,and,a,squad,of,bluecoats
but,the,others,said,nothing
scarlett,saw,with,the,faintest,feeling,of,relief,that,she,knew,this,officer
he,was,captain,tom,jaffery,one,of,rhett's,friends
she,had,sold,him,lumber,to,build,his,house
she,knew,him,to,be,a,gentleman
perhaps,as,he,was,a,gentleman,he,wouldn't,drag,them,away,to,prison
he,recognized,her,instantly,and,taking,off,his,hat,bowed,somewhat,embarrassed
good,evening,mrs,kennedy
and,which,of,you,ladies,is,mrs
wilkes
i,am,mrs,wilkes,answered,melanie,rising,and,for,all,her,smallness,dignity,flowed,from,her
and,to,what,do,i,owe,this,intrusion
the,eyes,of,the,captain,flickered,quickly,about,the,room,resting,for,an,instant,on,each,face,passing,quickly,from,their,faces,to,the,table,and,the,hat,rack,as,though,looking,for,signs,of,male,occupancy
i,should,like,to,speak,to,mr,wilkes,and,mr,kennedy,if,you,please
they,are,not,here,said,melanie,a,chill,in,her,soft,voice
are,you,sure
don't,you,question,miz,wilkes',word,said,archie,his,beard,bristling
i,beg,your,pardon,mrs,wilkes
i,meant,no,disrespect
if,you,give,me,your,word,i,will,not,search,the,house
you,have,my,word
but,search,if,you,like
they,are,at,a,meeting,downtown,at,mr,kennedy's,store
they,are,not,at,the,store
there,was,no,meeting,tonight,answered,the,captain,grimly
we,will,wait,outside,until,they,return
he,bowed,briefly,and,went,out,closing,the,door,behind,him
those,in,the,house,heard,a,sharp,order,muffled,by,the,wind,surround,the,house
a,man,at,each,window,and,door
there,was,a,tramping,of,feet
scarlett,checked,a,start,of,terror,as,she,dimly,saw,bearded,faces,peering,in,the,windows,at,them
melanie,sat,down,and,with,a,hand,that,did,not,tremble,reached,for,a,book,on,the,table
it,was,a,ragged,copy,of,les,miserables,that,book,which,caught,the,fancy,of,the,confederate,soldiers
they,had,read,it,by,camp-fire,light,and,took,some,grim,pleasure,in,calling,it,lee's,miserables
she,opened,it,at,the,middle,and,began,to,read,in,a,clear,monotonous,voice
sew,commanded,archie,in,a,hoarse,whisper,and,the,three,women,nerved,by,melanie's,cool,voice,picked,up,their,sewing,and,bowed,their,heads
how,long,melanie,read,beneath,that,circle,of,watching,eyes,scarlett,never,knew,but,it,seemed,hours
she,did,not,even,hear,a,word,that,melanie,read
now,she,was,beginning,to,think,of,frank,as,well,as,ashley
so,this,was,the,explanation,of,his,apparent,calm,this,evening
he,had,promised,her,he,would,have,nothing,to,do,with,the,klan
oh,this,was,just,the,kind,of,trouble,she,had,feared,would,come,upon,them
all,the,work,of,this,last,year,would,go,for,nothing
all,her,struggles,and,fears,and,labors,in,rain,and,cold,had,been,wasted
and,who,would,have,thought,that,spiritless,old,frank,would,get,himself,mixed,up,in,the,hot-headed,doings,of,the,klan
even,at,this,minute,he,might,be,dead
and,if,he,wasn't,dead,and,the,yankees,caught,him,he'd,be,hanged
and,ashley,too
her,nails,dug,into,her,palms,until,four,bright-red,crescents,showed
how,could,melanie,read,on,and,on,so,calmly,when,ashley,was,in,danger,of,being,hanged
when,he,might,be,dead
but,something,in,the,cool,soft,voice,reading,the,sorrows,of,jean,valjean,steadied,her,kept,her,from,leaping,to,her,feet,and,screaming
her,mind,fled,back,to,the,night,tony,fontaine,had,come,to,them,hunted,exhausted,without,money
if,he,had,not,reached,their,house,and,received,money,and,a,fresh,horse,he,would,have,been,hanged,long,since
if,frank,and,ashley,were,not,dead,at,this,very,minute,they,were,in,tony's,position,only,worse
with,the,house,surrounded,by,soldiers,they,couldn't,come,home,and,get,money,and,clothes,without,being,captured
and,probably,every,house,up,and,down,the,street,had,a,similar,guard,of,yankees,so,they,could,not,apply,to,friends,for,aid
even,now,they,might,be,riding,wildly,through,the,night,bound,for,texas
but,rhett,perhaps,rhett,had,reached,them,in,time
rhett,always,had,plenty,of,cash,in,his,pocket
perhaps,he,would,lend,them,enough,to,see,them,through
but,that,was,queer
why,should,rhett,bother,himself,about,ashley's,safety
certainly,he,disliked,him,certainly,he,professed,a,contempt,for,him
then,why,but,this,riddle,was,swallowed,up,in,a,renewed,fear,for,the,safety,of,ashley,and,frank
oh,it's,all,my,fault
she,wailed,to,herself
india,and,archie,spoke,the,truth
it's,all,my,fault
but,i,never,thought,either,of,them,was,foolish,enough,to,join,the,klan
and,i,never,thought,anything,would,really,happen,to,me
but,i,couldn't,have,done,otherwise
melly,spoke,the,truth
people,have,to,do,what,they,have,to,do
and,i,had,to,keep,the,mills,going
i,had,to,have,money
and,now,i'll,probably,lose,it,all,and,somehow,it's,all,my,fault
after,a,long,time,melanie's,voice,faltered,trailed,off,and,was,silent
she,turned,her,head,toward,the,window,and,stared,as,though,no,yankee,soldier,stared,back,from,behind,the,glass
the,others,raised,their,heads,caught,by,her,listening,pose,and,they,too,listened
there,was,a,sound,of,horses',feet,and,of,singing,deadened,by,the,closed,windows,and,doors,borne,away,by,the,wind,but,still,recognizable
it,was,the,most,hated,and,hateful,of,all,songs,the,song,about,sherman's,men,marching,through,georgia,and,rhett,butler,was,singing,it
hardly,had,he,finished,the,first,lines,when,two,other,voices,drunken,voices,assailed,him,enraged,foolish,voices,that,stumbled,over,words,and,blurred,them,together
there,was,a,quick,command,from,captain,jaffery,on,the,front,porch,and,the,rapid,tramp,of,feet
but,even,before,these,sounds,arose,the,ladies,looked,at,one,another,stunned
for,the,drunken,voices,expostulating,with,rhett,were,those,of,ashley,and,hugh,elsing
voices,rose,louder,on,the,front,walk,captain,jaffery's,curt,and,questioning,hugh's,shrill,with,foolish,laughter,rhett's,deep,and,reckless,and,ashley's,queer,unreal,shouting,what,the,hell
what,the,hell
that,can't,be,ashley
thought,scarlett,wildly
he,never,gets,drunk
and,rhett,why,when,rhett's,drunk,he,gets,quieter,and,quieter,never,loud,like,that
melanie,rose,and,with,her,archie,rose
they,heard,the,captain's,sharp,voice,these,two,men,are,under,arrest
and,archie's,hand,closed,over,his,pistol,butt
no,whispered,melanie,firmly
no
leave,it,to,me
there,was,in,her,face,the,same,look,scarlett,had,seen,that,day,at,tara,when,melanie,had,stood,at,the,top,of,the,steps,looking,down,at,the,dead,yankee,her,weak,wrist,weighed,down,by,the,heavy,saber,a,gentle,and,timid,soul,nerved,by,circumstances,to,the,caution,and,fury,of,a,tigress
she,threw,the,front,door,open
bring,him,in,captain,butler,she,called,in,a,clear,tone,that,bit,with,venom
i,suppose,you've,gotten,him,intoxicated,again
bring,him,in
from,the,dark,windy,walk,the,yankee,captain,spoke,i'm,sorry,mrs,wilkes,but,your,husband,and,mr,elsing,are,under,arrest
arrest
for,what
for,drunkenness
if,everyone,in,atlanta,was,arrested,for,drunkenness,the,whole,yankee,garrison,would,be,in,jail,continually
well,bring,him,in,captain,butler,that,is,if,you,can,walk,yourself
scarlett's,mind,was,not,working,quickly,and,for,a,brief,moment,nothing,made,sense
she,knew,neither,rhett,nor,ashley,was,drunk,and,she,knew,melanie,knew,they,were,not,drunk
yet,here,was,melanie,usually,so,gentle,and,refined,screaming,like,a,shrew,and,in,front,of,yankees,too,that,both,of,them,were,too,drunk,to,walk
there,was,a,short,mumbled,argument,punctuated,with,curses,and,uncertain,feet,ascended,the,stairs
in,the,doorway,appeared,ashley,white,faced,his,head,lolling,his,bright,hair,tousled,his,long,body,wrapped,from,neck,to,knees,in,rhett's,black,cape
hugh,elsing,and,rhett,none,too,steady,on,their,feet,supported,him,on,either,side,and,it,was,obvious,he,would,have,fallen,to,the,floor,but,for,their,aid
behind,them,came,the,yankee,captain,his,face,a,study,of,mingled,suspicion,and,amusement
he,stood,in,the,open,doorway,with,his,men,peering,curiously,over,his,shoulders,and,the,cold,wind,swept,the,house
scarlett,frightened,puzzled,glanced,at,melanie,and,back,to,the,sagging,ashley,and,then,half-comprehension,came,to,her
she,started,to,cry,out,but,he,can't,be,drunk
and,bit,back,the,words
she,realized,she,was,witnessing,a,play,a,desperate,play,on,which,lives,hinged
she,knew,she,was,not,part,of,it,nor,was,aunt,pitty,but,the,others,were,and,they,were,tossing,cues,to,one,another,like,actors,in,an,oft-rehearsed,drama
she,understood,only,half,but,she,understood,enough,to,keep,silent
put,him,in,the,chair,cried,melanie,indignantly
and,you,captain,butler,leave,this,house,immediately
how,dare,you,show,your,face,here,after,getting,him,in,this,condition,again
the,two,men,eased,ashley,into,a,rocker,and,rhett,swaying,caught,hold,of,the,back,of,the,chair,to,steady,himself,and,addressed,the,captain,with,pain,in,his,voice
that's,fine,thanks,i,get,isn't,it
for,keeping,the,police,from,getting,him,and,bringing,him,home,and,him,yelling,and,trying,to,claw,me
and,you,hugh,elsing,i'm,ashamed,of,you
what,will,your,poor,mother,say
drunk,and,out,with,a,a,yankee-loving,scallawag,like,captain,butler
and,oh,mr,wilkes,how,could,you,do,such,a,thing
melly,i,ain't,so,very,drunk,mumbled,ashley,and,with,the,words,fell,forward,and,lay,face,down,on,the,table,his,head,buried,in,his,arms
archie,take,him,to,his,room,and,put,him,to,bed,as,usual,ordered,melanie
aunt,pitty,please,run,and,fix,the,bed,and,oo-,oh,she,suddenly,burst,into,tears
oh,how,could,he
after,he,promised
archie,already,had,his,arm,under,ashley's,shoulder,and,pitty,frightened,and,uncertain,was,on,her,feet,when,the,captain,interposed
don't,touch,him
he's,under,arrest
sergeant
as,the,sergeant,stepped,into,the,room,his,rifle,at,trail,rhett,evidently,trying,to,steady,himself,put,a,hand,on,the,captain's,arm,and,with,difficulty,focused,his,eyes
tom,what,you,arresting,him,for

a,nigger,and,a,white,man,were,killed
mr,wilkes,was,the,ringleader,in,it
tonight
rhett,began,to,laugh
he,laughed,so,hard,that,he,sat,down,on,the,sofa,and,put,his,head,in,his,hands
not,tonight,tom,he,said,when,he,could,speak
these,two,have,been,with,me,tonight,ever,since,eight,o'clock,when,they,were,supposed,to,be,at,the,meeting
with,you,rhett
but,a,frown,came,over,the,captain's,forehead,and,he,looked,uncertainly,at,the,snoring,ashley,and,his,weeping,wife
but,where,were,you
i,don't,like,to,say,and,rhett,shot,a,look,of,drunken,cunning,at,melanie
you'd,better,say
le's,go,out,on,the,porch,and,i'll,tell,you,where,we,were
you'll,tell,me,now
hate,to,say,it,in,front,of,ladies
if,you,ladies'll,step,out,of,the,room

girls
at,at,belle,watling's
melanie's,voice,rose,until,it,cracked,with,such,pain,that,all,eyes,turned,frightenedly,to,her
her,hand,went,clutching,at,her,bosom,and,before,archie,could,catch,her,she,had,fainted
then,a,hubbub,ensued,archie,picking,her,up,india,running,to,the,kitchen,for,water,pitty,and,scarlett,fanning,her,and,slapping,her,wrists,while,hugh,elsing,shouted,over,and,over,now,you've,done,it

i,hope,you're,satisfied,tom
there,won't,be,a,wife,in,atlanta,who'll,speak,to,her,husband,tomorrow
rhett,i,had,no,idea,though,the,chill,wind,was,blowing,through,the,open,door,on,his,back,the,captain,was,perspiring
look,here

pitty's,hand,trembled,so,that,the,lamp,was,a,menace,to,the,safety,of,the,house,but,she,held,it,and,trotted,ahead,toward,the,dark,bedroom
archie,with,a,grunt,got,an,arm,under,ashley,and,raised,him
but,i've,got,to,arrest,these,men

the,captain,and,the,sergeant,backed,out,hugh,elsing,with,them,and,she,slammed,the,door,behind,them
without,even,looking,at,scarlett,she,went,swiftly,to,each,window,and,drew,down,the,shade
scarlett,her,knees,shaking,caught,hold,of,the,chair,in,which,ashley,had,been,sitting,to,steady,herself
looking,down,at,it,she,saw,that,there,was,a,dark,moist,spot,larger,than,her,hand,on,the,cushion,in,the,back,of,the,chair
puzzled,her,hand,went,over,it,and,to,her,horror,a,sticky,red,wetness,appeared,on,her,palm
india,she,whispered,india,ashley's,he's,hurt
you,fool
did,you,think,he,was,really,drunk
india,snapped,down,the,last,shade,and,started,on,flying,feet,for,the,bedroom,with,scarlett,close,behind,her,her,heart,in,her,throat
rhett's,big,body,barred,the,doorway,but,past,his,shoulder,scarlett,saw,ashley,lying,white,and,still,on,the,bed
melanie,strangely,quick,for,one,so,recently,in,a,faint,was,rapidly,cutting,off,his,blood-soaked,shirt,with,embroidery,scissors
archie,held,the,lamp,low,over,the,bed,to,give,light,and,one,of,his,gnarled,fingers,was,on,ashley's,wrist
is,he,dead
cried,both,girls,together
no,just,fainted,from,loss,of,blood
it's,through,his,shoulder,said,rhett
why,did,you,bring,him,here,you,fool
cried,india
let,me,get,to,him
let,me,pass
why,did,you,bring,him,here,to,be,arrested
he,was,too,weak,to,travel

i'm,deeply,grateful,for,what,you've,done,for,ashley,but,i,despise,you,just,the,same
i,appreciate,frankness,and,i,thank,you,for,it
rhett,bowed,and,his,lip,curled,down,in,an,amused,smile
now,go,quickly,and,by,back,ways,and,when,you,return,do,not,come,in,this,house,if,you,see,signs,of,soldiers,about
india,shot,one,more,quick,anguished,look,at,ashley,and,wrapping,her,cape,about,her,ran,lightly,down,the,hall,to,the,back,door,and,let,herself,out,quietly,into,the,night
scarlett,straining,her,eyes,past,rhett,felt,her,heart,beat,again,as,she,saw,ashley's,eyes,open
melanie,snatched,a,folded,towel,from,the,washstand,rack,and,pressed,it,against,his,streaming,shoulder,and,he,smiled,up,weakly,reassuringly,into,her,face
scarlett,felt,rhett's,hard,penetrating,eyes,upon,her,knew,that,her,heart,was,plain,upon,her,face,but,she,did,not,care
ashley,was,bleeding,perhaps,dying,and,she,who,loved,him,had,torn,that,hole,through,his,shoulder
she,wanted,to,run,to,the,bed,sink,down,beside,it,and,clasp,him,to,her,but,her,knees,trembled,so,that,she,could,not,enter,the,room
hand,at,her,mouth,she,stared,while,melanie,packed,a,fresh,towel,against,his,shoulder,pressing,it,hard,as,though,she,could,force,back,the,blood,into,his,body
but,the,towel,reddened,as,though,by,magic
how,could,a,man,bleed,so,much,and,still,live
but,thank,god,there,was,no,bubble,of,blood,at,his,lips,oh,those,frothy,red,bubbles,forerunners,of,death,that,she,knew,so,well,from,the,dreadful,day,of,the,battle,at,peachtree,creek,when,the,wounded,had,died,on,aunt,pitty's,lawn,with,bloody,mouths
brace,up,said,rhett,and,there,was,a,hard,faintly,jeering,note,in,his,voice
he,won't,die
now,go,take,the,lamp,and,hold,it,for,mrs,wilkes
i,need,archie,to,run,errands
archie,looked,across,the,lamp,at,rhett
i,ain't,takin',no,orders,from,you,he,said,briefly,shifting,his,wad,of,tobacco,to,the,other,cheek
you,do,what,he,says,said,melanie,sternly,and,do,it,quickly
do,everything,captain,butler,says
scarlett,take,the,lamp
scarlett,went,forward,and,took,the,lamp,holding,it,in,both,hands,to,keep,from,dropping,it
ashley's,eyes,had,closed,again
his,bare,chest,heaved,up,slowly,and,sank,quickly,and,the,red,stream,seeped,from,between,melanie's,small,frantic,fingers
dimly,she,heard,archie,stump,across,the,room,to,rhett,and,heard,rhett's,low,rapid,words
her,mind,was,so,fixed,upon,ashley,that,of,the,first,half-whispered,words,of,rhett,she,only,heard,take,my,horse
tied,outside
ride,like,hell
archie,mumbled,some,question,and,scarlett,heard,rhett,reply,the,old,sullivan,plantation
you'll,find,the,robes,pushed,up,the,biggest,chimney
burn,them
um,grunted,archie
and,there's,two,men,in,the,cellar
pack,them,over,the,horse,as,best,you,can,and,take,them,to,that,vacant,lot,behind,belle's,the,one,between,her,house,and,the,railroad,tracks
be,careful
if,anyone,sees,you,you'll,hang,as,well,as,the,rest,of,us
put,them,in,that,lot,and,put,pistols,near,them,in,their,hands
here,take,mine
scarlett,looking,across,the,room,saw,rhett,reach,under,his,coat,tails,and,produce,two,revolvers,which,archie,took,and,shoved,into,his,waist,band
fire,one,shot,from,each
it's,got,to,appear,like,a,plain,case,of,shooting
you,understand
archie,nodded,as,if,he,understood,perfectly,and,an,unwilling,gleam,of,respect,shone,in,his,cold,eye
but,understanding,was,far,from,scarlett
the,last,half-hour,had,been,so,nightmarish,that,she,felt,nothing,would,ever,be,plain,and,clear,again
however,rhett,seemed,in,perfect,command,of,the,bewildering,situation,and,that,was,a,small,comfort
archie,turned,to,go,and,then,swung,about,and,his,one,eye,went,questioningly,to,rhett's,face
him
yes
archie,grunted,and,spat,on,the,floor
hell,to,pay,he,said,as,he,stumped,down,the,hall,to,the,back,door
something,in,the,last,low,interchange,of,words,made,a,new,fear,and,suspicion,rise,up,in,scarlett's,breast,like,a,chill,ever-swelling,bubble
when,that,bubble,broke
where's,frank
she,cried
rhett,came,swiftly,across,the,room,to,the,bed,his,big,body,swinging,as,lightly,and,noiselessly,as,a,cat's
all,in,good,time,he,said,and,smiled,briefly
steady,that,lamp,scarlett
you,don't,want,to,burn,mr,wilkes,up
miss,melly
melanie,looked,up,like,a,good,little,soldier,awaiting,a,command,and,so,tense,was,the,situation,it,did,not,occur,to,her,that,for,the,first,time,rhett,was,calling,her,familiarly,by,the,name,which,only,family,and,old,friends,used
i,beg,your,pardon,i,mean,mrs,wilkes
oh,captain,butler,do,not,ask,my,pardon
i,should,feel,honored,if,you,called,me,'melly',without,the,miss
i,feel,as,though,you,were,my,my,brother,or,or,my,cousin
how,kind,you,are,and,how,clever
how,can,i,ever,thank,you,enough
thank,you,said,rhett,and,for,a,moment,he,looked,almost,embarrassed
i,should,never,presume,so,far,but,miss,melly,and,his,voice,was,apologetic,i'm,sorry,i,had,to,say,that,mr,wilkes,was,in,belle,watling's,house
i'm,sorry,to,have,involved,him,and,the,others,in,such,a,a,but,i,had,to,think,fast,when,i,rode,away,from,here,and,that,was,the,only,plan,that,occurred,to,me
i,knew,my,word,would,be,accepted,because,i,have,so,many,friends,among,the,yankee,officers
they,do,me,the,dubious,honor,of,thinking,me,almost,one,of,them,because,they,know,my,shall,we,call,it,my,'unpopularity',among,my,townsmen
and,you,see,i,was,playing,poker,in,belle's,bar,earlier,in,the,evening
there,are,a,dozen,yankee,soldiers,who,can,testify,to,that
and,belle,and,her,girls,will,gladly,lie,themselves,black,in,the,face,and,say,mr,wilkes,and,the,others,were,upstairs,all,evening
and,the,yankees,will,believe,them
yankees,are,queer,that,way
it,won't,occur,to,them,that,women,of,their,profession,are,capable,of,intense,loyalty,or,patriotism
the,yankees,wouldn't,take,the,word,of,a,single,nice,atlanta,lady,as,to,the,whereabouts,of,the,men,who,were,supposed,to,be,at,the,meeting,tonight,but,they,will,take,the,word,of,fancy,ladies
and,i,think,that,between,the,word,of,honor,of,a,scallawag,and,a,dozen,fancy,ladies,we,may,have,a,chance,of,getting,the,men,off
there,was,a,sardonic,grin,on,his,face,at,the,last,words,but,it,faded,as,melanie,turned,up,to,him,a,face,that,blazed,with,gratitude
captain,butler,you,are,so,smart
i,wouldn't,have,cared,if,you'd,said,they,were,in,hell,itself,tonight,if,it,saves,them
for,i,know,and,every,one,else,who,matters,knows,that,my,husband,was,never,in,a,dreadful,place,like,that
well,began,rhett,awkwardly,as,a,matter,of,fact,he,was,at,belle's,tonight
melanie,drew,herself,up,coldly
you,can,never,make,me,believe,such,a,lie
please,miss,melly
let,me,explain
when,i,got,out,to,the,old,sullivan,place,tonight,i,found,mr,wilkes,wounded,and,with,him,were,hugh,elsing,and,dr,meade,and,old,man,merriwether
not,the,old,gentleman
cried,scarlett
men,are,never,too,old,to,be,fools
and,your,uncle,henry
oh,mercy
cried,aunt,pitty
the,others,had,scattered,after,the,brush,with,the,troops,and,the,crowd,that,stuck,together,had,come,to,the,sullivan,place,to,hide,their,robes,in,the,chimney,and,to,see,how,badly,mr,wilkes,was,hurt
but,for,his,wound,they'd,be,headed,for,texas,by,now,all,of,them,but,he,couldn't,ride,far,and,they,wouldn't,leave,him
it,was,necessary,to,prove,that,they,had,been,somewhere,instead,of,where,they,had,been,and,so,i,took,them,by,back,ways,to,belle,watling's
oh,i,see
i,do,beg,your,pardon,for,my,rudeness,captain,butler
i,see,now,it,was,necessary,to,take,them,there,but,oh,captain,butler,people,must,have,seen,you,going,in
no,one,saw,us
we,went,in,through,a,private,back,entrance,that,opens,on,the,railroad,tracks
it's,always,dark,and,locked
then,how
i,have,a,key,said,rhett,laconically,and,his,eyes,met,melanie's,evenly
as,the,full,impact,of,the,meaning,smote,her,melanie,became,so,embarrassed,that,she,fumbled,with,the,bandage,until,it,slid,off,the,wound,entirely
i,did,not,mean,to,pry,she,said,in,a,muffled,voice,her,white,face,reddening,as,she,hastily,pressed,the,towel,back,into,place
i,regret,having,to,tell,a,lady,such,a,thing
then,it's,true
thought,scarlett,with,an,odd,pang
then,he,does,live,with,that,dreadful,watling,creature
he,does,own,her,house
i,saw,belle,and,explained,to,her
we,gave,her,a,list,of,the,men,who,were,out,tonight,and,she,and,her,girls,will,testify,that,they,were,all,in,her,house,tonight
then,to,make,our,exit,more,conspicuous,she,called,the,two,desperadoes,who,keep,order,at,her,place,and,had,us,dragged,downstairs,fighting,and,through,the,barroom,and,thrown,out,into,the,street,as,brawling,drunks,who,were,disturbing,the,place
he,grinned,reminiscently
dr,meade,did,not,make,a,very,convincing,drunk
it,hurt,his,dignity,to,even,be,in,such,a,place
but,your,uncle,henry,and,old,man,merriwether,were,excellent
the,stage,lost,two,great,actors,when,they,did,not,take,up,the,drama
they,seemed,to,enjoy,the,affair
i'm,afraid,your,uncle,henry,has,a,black,eye,due,to,mr,merriwether's,zeal,for,his,part
he
the,back,door,swung,open,and,india,entered,followed,by,old,dr,dean,his,long,white,hair,tumbled,his,worn,leather,bag,bulging,under,his,cape
he,nodded,briefly,but,without,words,to,those,present,and,quickly,lifted,the,bandage,from,ashley's,shoulder
too,high,for,the,lung,he,said
if,it,hasn't,splintered,his,collar,bone,it's,not,so,serious
get,me,plenty,of,towels,ladies,and,cotton,if,you,have,it,and,some,brandy
rhett,took,the,lamp,from,scarlett,and,set,it,on,the,table,as,melanie,and,india,sped,about,obeying,the,doctor's,orders
you,can't,do,anything,here
come,into,the,parlor,by,the,fire
he,took,her,arm,and,propelled,her,from,the,room
there,was,a,gentleness,foreign,to,him,in,both,hand,and,voice
you've,had,a,rotten,day,haven't,you
she,allowed,herself,to,be,led,into,the,front,room,and,though,she,stood,on,the,hearth,rug,in,front,of,the,fire,she,began,to,shiver
the,bubble,of,suspicion,in,her,breast,was,swelling,larger,now
it,was,more,than,a,suspicion
it,was,almost,a,certainty,and,a,terrible,certainty
she,looked,up,into,rhett's,immobile,face,and,for,a,moment,she,could,not,speak
then
was,frank,at,belle,watling's
no
rhett's,voice,was,blunt
archie's,carrying,him,to,the,vacant,lot,near,belle's
he's,dead
shot,through,the,head
chapter,xlvi
few,families,in,the,north,end,of,town,slept,that,night,for,the,news,of,the,disaster,to,the,klan,and,rhett's,stratagem,spread,swiftly,on,silent,feet,as,the,shadowy,form,of,india,wilkes,slipped,through,back,yards,whispered,urgently,through,kitchen,doors,and,slipped,away,into,the,windy,darkness
and,in,her,path,she,left,fear,and,desperate,hope
from,without,houses,looked,black,and,silent,and,wrapped,in,sleep,but,within,voices,whispered,vehemently,into,the,dawn
not,only,those,involved,in,the,night's,raid,but,every,member,of,the,klan,was,ready,for,flight,and,in,almost,every,stable,along,peachtree,street,horses,stood,saddled,in,the,darkness,pistols,in,holsters,and,food,in,saddlebags
all,that,prevented,a,wholesale,exodus,was,india's,whispered,message,captain,butler,says,not,to,run
the,roads,will,be,watched
he,has,arranged,with,that,watling,creature,in,dark,rooms,men,whispered,but,why,should,i,trust,that,damned,scallawag,butler
it,may,be,a,trap
and,women's,voices,implored,don't,go
if,he,saved,ashley,and,hugh,he,may,save,everybody
if,india,and,melanie,trust,him,and,they,half,trusted,and,stayed,because,there,was,no,other,course,open,to,them
earlier,in,the,night,the,soldiers,had,knocked,at,a,dozen,doors,and,those,who,could,not,or,would,not,tell,where,they,had,been,that,night,were,marched,off,under,arrest
rene,picard,and,one,of,mrs,merriwether's,nephews,and,the,simmons,boys,and,andy,bonnell,were,among,those,who,spent,the,night,in,jail
they,had,been,in,the,ill-,starred,foray,but,had,separated,from,the,others,after,the,shooting
riding,hard,for,home,they,were,arrested,before,they,learned,of,rhett's,plan
fortunately,they,all,replied,to,questions,that,where,they,had,been,that,night,was,their,own,business,and,not,that,of,any,damned,yankees
they,had,been,locked,up,for,further,questioning,in,the,morning
old,man,merriwether,and,uncle,henry,hamilton,declared,shamelessly,that,they,had,spent,the,evening,at,belle,watling's,sporting,house,and,when,captain,jaffery,remarked,irritably,that,they,were,too,old,for,such,goings,on,they,wanted,to,fight,him
belle,watling,herself,answered,captain,jaffery's,summons,and,before,he,could,make,known,his,mission,she,shouted,that,the,house,was,closed,for,the,night
a,passel,of,quarrelsome,drunks,had,called,in,the,early,part,of,the,evening,and,had,fought,one,another,torn,the,place,up,broken,her,finest,mirrors,and,so,alarmed,the,young,ladies,that,all,business,had,been,suspended,for,the,night
but,if,captain,jaffery,wanted,a,drink,the,bar,was,still,open
captain,jaffery,acutely,conscious,of,the,grins,of,his,men,and,feeling,helplessly,that,he,was,fighting,a,mist,declared,angrily,that,he,wanted,neither,the,young,ladies,nor,a,drink,and,demanded,if,belle,knew,the,names,of,her,destructive,customers
oh,yes,belle,knew,them
they,were,her,regulars
they,came,every,wednesday,night,and,called,themselves,the,wednesday,democrats,though,what,they,meant,by,that,she,neither,knew,or,cared
and,if,they,didn't,pay,for,the,damage,to,the,mirrors,in,the,upper,hall,she,was,going,to,have,the,law,on,them
she,kept,a,respectable,house,and,oh,their,names
belle,unhesitatingly,reeled,off,the,names,of,twelve,under,suspicion,captain,jaffery,smiled,sourly
these,damned,rebels,are,as,efficiently,organized,as,our,secret,service,he,said
you,and,your,girls,will,have,to,appear,before,the,provost,marshal,tomorrow
will,the,provost,make,them,pay,for,my,mirrors
to,hell,with,your,mirrors
make,rhett,butler,pay,for,them
he,owns,the,place,doesn't,he
before,dawn,every,ex-confederate,family,in,town,knew,everything
and,their,negroes,who,had,been,told,nothing,knew,everything,too,by,that,black,grapevine,telegraph,system,which,defies,white,understanding
everyone,knew,the,details,of,the,raid,the,killing,of,frank,kennedy,and,crippled,tommy,wellburn,and,how,ashley,was,wounded,in,carrying,frank's,body,away
some,of,the,feeling,of,bitter,hatred,the,women,bore,scarlett,for,her,share,in,the,tragedy,was,mitigated,by,the,knowledge,that,her,husband,was,dead,and,she,knew,it,and,could,not,admit,it,and,have,the,poor,comfort,of,claiming,his,body
until,morning,light,disclosed,the,bodies,and,the,authorities,notified,her,she,must,know,nothing
frank,and,tommy,pistols,in,cold,hands,lay,stiffening,among,the,dead,weeds,in,a,vacant,lot
and,the,yankees,would,say,they,killed,each,other,in,a,common,drunken,brawl,over,a,girl,in,belle's,house
sympathy,ran,high,for,fanny,tommy's,wife,who,had,just,had,a,baby,but,no,one,could,slip,through,the,darkness,to,see,her,and,comfort,her,because,a,squad,of,yankees,surrounded,the,house,waiting,for,tommy,to,return
and,there,was,another,squad,about,aunt,pitty's,house,waiting,for,frank
before,dawn,the,news,had,trickled,about,that,the,military,inquiry,would,take,place,that,day
the,townspeople,heavy,eyed,from,sleeplessness,and,anxious,waiting,knew,that,the,safety,of,some,of,their,most,prominent,citizens,rested,on,three,things,the,ability,of,ashley,wilkes,to,stand,on,his,feet,and,appear,before,the,military,board,as,though,he,suffered,nothing,more,serious,than,a,morning-after,headache,the,word,of,belle,watling,that,these,men,had,been,in,her,house,all,evening,and,the,word,of,rhett,butler,that,he,had,been,with,them
the,town,writhed,at,these,last,two
belle,watling
to,owe,their,men's,lives,to,her
it,was,intolerable
women,who,had,ostentatiously,crossed,the,street,when,they,saw,belle,coming,wondered,if,she,remembered,and,trembled,for,fear,she,did
the,men,felt,less,humiliation,at,taking,their,lives,from,belle,than,the,women,did,for,many,of,them,thought,her,a,good,sort
but,they,were,stung,that,they,must,owe,lives,and,freedom,to,rhett,butler,a,speculator,and,a,scallawag
belle,and,rhett,the,town's,best-known,fancy,woman,and,the,town's,most,hated,man
and,they,must,be,under,obligation,to,them
another,thought,that,stung,them,to,impotent,wrath,was,the,knowledge,that,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,would,laugh
oh,how,they,would,laugh
twelve,of,the,town's,most,prominent,citizens,revealed,as,habitual,frequenters,of,belle,watling's,sporting,house
two,of,them,killed,in,a,fight,over,a,cheap,little,girl,others,ejected,from,the,place,as,too,drunk,to,be,tolerated,even,by,belle,and,some,under,arrest,refusing,to,admit,they,were,there,when,everyone,knew,they,were,there
atlanta,was,right,in,fearing,that,the,yankees,would,laugh
they,had,squirmed,too,long,beneath,southern,coldness,and,contempt,and,now,they,exploded,with,hilarity
officers,woke,comrades,and,retailed,the,news
husbands,roused,wives,at,dawn,and,told,them,as,much,as,could,be,decently,told,to,women
and,the,women,dressing,hastily,knocked,on,their,neighbors',doors,and,spread,the,story
the,yankee,ladies,were,charmed,with,it,all,and,laughed,until,tears,ran,down,their,faces
this,was,southern,chivalry,and,gallantry,for,you
maybe,those,women,who,carried,their,heads,so,high,and,snubbed,all,attempts,at,friendliness,wouldn't,be,so,uppity,now,that,everyone,knew,where,their,husbands,spent,their,time,when,they,were,supposed,to,be,at,political,meetings
political,meetings
well,that,was,funny
but,even,as,they,laughed,they,expressed,regret,for,scarlett,and,her,tragedy
after,all,scarlett,was,a,lady,and,one,of,the,few,ladies,in,atlanta,who,were,nice,to,yankees
she,had,already,won,their,sympathy,by,the,fact,that,she,had,to,work,because,her,husband,couldn't,or,wouldn't,support,her,properly
even,though,her,husband,was,a,sorry,one,it,was,dreadful,that,the,poor,thing,should,discover,he,had,been,untrue,to,her
and,it,was,doubly,dreadful,that,his,death,should,occur,simultaneously,with,the,discovery,of,his,infidelity
after,all,a,poor,husband,was,better,than,no,husband,at,all,and,the,yankee,ladies,decided,they'd,be,extra,nice,to,scarlett
but,the,others,mrs,meade,mrs,merriwether,mrs,elsing,tommy,wellburn's,widow,and,most,of,all,mrs,ashley,wilkes,they'd,laugh,in,their,faces,every,time,they,saw,them
that,would,teach,them,a,little,courtesy
much,of,the,whispering,that,went,on,in,the,dark,rooms,on,the,north,side,of,town,that,night,was,on,this,same,subject
atlanta,ladies,vehemently,told,their,husbands,that,they,did,not,care,a,rap,what,the,yankees,thought
but,inwardly,they,felt,that,running,an,indian,gantlet,would,be,infinitely,preferable,to,suffering,the,ordeal,of,yankee,grins,and,not,being,able,to,tell,the,truth,about,their,husbands
dr,meade,beside,himself,with,outraged,dignity,at,the,position,into,which,rhett,had,jockeyed,him,and,the,others,told,mrs,meade,that,but,for,the,fact,that,it,would,implicate,the,others,he,would,rather,confess,and,be,hanged,than,say,he,had,been,at,belle's,house
it,is,an,insult,to,you,mrs,meade,he,fumed
but,everyone,will,know,you,weren't,there,for,for
the,yankees,won't,know
they'll,have,to,believe,it,if,we,save,our,necks
and,they'll,laugh
the,very,thought,that,anyone,will,believe,it,and,laugh,infuriates,me
and,it,insults,you,because,my,dear,i,have,always,been,faithful,to,you
i,know,that,and,in,the,darkness,mrs,meade,smiled,and,slipped,a,thin,hand,into,the,doctor's
but,i'd,rather,it,were,really,true,than,have,one,hair,of,your,head,in,danger
mrs,meade,do,you,know,what,you,are,saying
cried,the,doctor,aghast,at,the,unsuspected,realism,of,his,wife
yes,i,know
i've,lost,darcy,and,i've,lost,phil,and,you,are,all,i,have,and,rather,than,lose,you,i'd,have,you,take,up,your,permanent,abode,at,that,place
you,are,distrait
you,cannot,know,what,you,are,saying
you,old,fool,said,mrs,meade,tenderly,and,laid,her,head,against,his,sleeve
dr,meade,fumed,into,silence,and,stroked,her,cheek,and,then,exploded,again
and,to,be,under,obligation,to,that,butler,man
hanging,would,be,easy,compared,to,that
no,not,even,if,i,owe,him,my,life,can,i,be,polite,to,him
his,insolence,is,monumental,and,his,shamelessness,about,his,profiteering,makes,me,boil
to,owe,my,life,to,a,man,who,never,went,in,the,army
melly,said,he,enlisted,after,atlanta,fell
it's,a,lie
miss,melly,will,believe,any,plausible,scoundrel
and,what,i,can't,understand,is,why,he,is,doing,all,this,going,to,all,this,trouble
i,hate,to,say,it,but,well,there's,always,been,talk,about,him,and,mrs,kennedy
i've,seen,them,coming,in,from,rides,together,too,often,this,last,year
he,must,have,done,it,because,of,her
if,it,was,because,of,scarlett,he,wouldn't,have,lifted,his,hand
he'd,have,been,glad,to,see,frank,kennedy,hanged
i,think,it's,because,of,melly
mrs,meade,you,can't,be,insinuating,that,there's,ever,been,anything,between,those,two
oh,don't,be,silly
but,she's,always,been,unaccountably,fond,of,him,ever,since,he,tried,to,get,ashley,exchanged,during,the,war
and,i,must,say,this,for,him,he,never,smiles,in,that,nasty-nice,way,when,he's,with,her
he's,just,as,pleasant,and,thoughtful,as,can,be,really,a,different,man
you,can,tell,by,the,way,he,acts,with,melly,that,he,could,be,decent,if,he,wanted,to
now,my,idea,of,why,he's,doing,all,this,is,she,paused
doctor,you,won't,like,my,idea
i,don't,like,anything,about,this,whole,affair
well,i,think,he,did,it,partly,for,melly's,sake,but,mostly,because,he,thought,it,would,be,a,huge,joke,on,us,all
we've,hated,him,so,much,and,showed,it,so,plainly,and,now,he's,got,us,in,a,fix,where,all,of,you,have,your,choice,of,saying,you,were,at,that,watling,woman's,house,and,shaming,yourself,and,wives,before,the,yankees,or,telling,the,truth,and,getting,hanged
and,he,knows,we'll,all,be,under,obligation,to,him,and,his,mistress,and,that,we'd,almost,rather,be,hanged,than,be,obliged,to,them
oh,i'll,wager,he's,enjoying,it
the,doctor,groaned
he,did,look,amused,when,he,took,us,upstairs,in,that,place
doctor,mrs,meade,hesitated,what,did,it,look,like
what,are,you,saying,mrs
meade
her,house
what,did,it,look,like
are,there,cut-glass,chandeliers
and,red,plush,curtains,and,dozens,of,full-length,gilt,mirrors
and,were,the,girls,were,they,unclothed
good,god
cried,the,doctor,thunderstruck,for,it,had,never,occurred,to,him,that,the,curiosity,of,a,chaste,woman,concerning,her,unchaste,sisters,was,so,devouring
how,can,you,ask,such,immodest,questions
you,are,not,yourself
i,will,mix,you,a,sedative
i,don't,want,a,sedative
i,want,to,know
oh,dear,this,is,my,only,chance,to,know,what,a,bad,house,looks,like,and,now,you,are,mean,enough,not,to,tell,me
i,noticed,nothing
i,assure,you,i,was,too,embarrassed,at,finding,myself,in,such,a,place,to,take,note,of,my,surroundings,said,the,doctor,formally,more,upset,at,this,unsuspected,revelation,of,his,wife's,character,than,he,had,been,by,all,the,previous,events,of,the,evening
if,you,will,excuse,me,now,i,will,try,to,get,some,sleep
well,go,to,sleep,then,she,answered,disappointment,in,her,tones
then,as,the,doctor,leaned,over,to,remove,his,boots,her,voice,spoke,from,the,darkness,with,renewed,cheerfulness
i,imagine,dolly,has,gotten,it,all,out,of,old,man,merriwether,and,she,can,tell,me,about,it
good,heavens,mrs,meade
do,you,mean,to,tell,me,that,nice,women,talk,about,such,things,among,them
oh,go,to,bed,said,mrs,meade
it,sleeted,the,next,day,but,as,the,wintry,twilight,drew,on,the,icy,particles,stopped,falling,and,a,cold,wind,blew
wrapped,in,her,cloak,melanie,went,bewilderedly,down,her,front,walk,behind,a,strange,negro,coachman,who,had,summoned,her,mysteriously,to,a,closed,carriage,waiting,in,front,of,the,house
as,she,came,up,to,the,carriage,the,door,was,opened,and,she,saw,a,woman,in,the,dim,interior
leaning,closer,peering,inside,melanie,questioned,who,is,it
won't,you,come,in,the,house
it's,so,cold
please,come,in,here,and,set,with,me,a,minute,miz,wilkes,came,a,faintly,familiar,voice,an,embarrassed,voice,from,the,depths,of,the,carriage
oh,you're,miss,mrs,watling
cried,melanie
i,did,so,want,to,see,you
you,must,come,in,the,house
i,can't,do,that,miz,wilkes
belle,watling's,voice,sounded,scandalized
you,come,in,here,and,set,a,minute,with,me
melanie,entered,the,carriage,and,the,coachman,closed,the,door,behind,her
she,sat,down,beside,belle,and,reached,for,her,hand
how,can,i,ever,thank,you,enough,for,what,you,did,today
how,can,any,of,us,thank,you,enough
miz,wilkes,you,hadn't,ought,of,sent,me,that,note,this,mornin'
not,that,i,wasn't,proud,to,have,a,note,from,you,but,the,yankees,might,have,got,it
and,as,for,sayin',you,was,goin',to,call,on,me,to,thank,me,why,miz,wilkes,you,must,of,lost,your,mind
the,very,idea
i,come,up,here,as,soon,as,'twas,dark,to,tell,you,you,mustn't,think,of,any,sech,thing
why,i,why,you,it,wouldn't,be,fittin',at,all
it,wouldn't,be,fitting,for,me,to,call,and,thank,a,kind,woman,who,saved,my,husband's,life
oh,shucks,miz,wilkes
you,know,what,i,mean
melanie,was,silent,for,a,moment,embarrassed,by,the,implication
somehow,this,handsome,sedately,dressed,woman,sitting,in,the,darkness,of,the,carriage,didn't,look,and,talk,as,she,imagined,a,bad,woman,the,madam,of,a,house,should,look,and,talk
she,sounded,like,well,a,little,common,and,countrified,but,nice,and,warm,hearted
you,were,wonderful,before,the,provost,marshal,today,mrs,watling
you,and,the,other,your,the,young,ladies,certainly,saved,our,men's,lives
mr,wilkes,was,the,wonderful,one
i,don't,know,how,he,even,stood,up,and,told,his,story,much,less,look,as,cool,as,he,done
he,was,sure,bleedin',like,a,pig,when,i,seen,him,last,night
is,he,goin',to,be,all,right,miz,wilkes
yes,thank,you
the,doctor,says,it's,just,a,flesh,wound,though,he,did,lose,a,tremendous,lot,of,blood
this,morning,he,was,well,he,was,pretty,well,laced,with,brandy,or,he'd,never,have,had,the,strength,to,go,through,with,it,all,so,well
but,it,was,you,mrs,watling,who,saved,them
when,you,got,mad,and,talked,about,the,broken,mirrors,you,sounded,so,so,convincing
thank,you,ma'm

oh,he,was,wonderful
cried,melanie,warmly
the,yankees,couldn't,help,but,believe,his,testimony

i,can,never,thank,him,enough,or,you,either
how,good,and,kind,you,are

i,got,a,boy,myself,and,so,i

but,i,wouldn't,of,did,it,for,just,anybody
if,it,had,been,that,miz,kennedy's,husband,by,hisself,i,wouldn't,of,lifted,a,finger,no,matter,what,captain,butler,said
why
well,miz,wilkes,people,in,my,business,knows,a,heap,of,things
it'd,surprise,and,shock,a,heap,of,fine,ladies,if,they,had,any,notion,how,much,we,knows,about,them
and,she,ain't,no,good,miz,wilkes
she,kilt,her,husband,and,that,nice,wellburn,boy,same,as,if,she,shot,them
she,caused,it,all,prancin',about,atlanta,by,herself,enticin',niggers,and,trash
why,not,one,of,my,girls
you,must,not,say,unkind,things,about,my,sister-in-law
melanie,stiffened,coldly
belle,put,an,eager,placating,hand,on,melanie's,arm,and,then,hastily,withdrew,it

good,night
chapter,xlvii
scarlett,sat,in,her,bedroom,picking,at,the,supper,tray,mammy,had,brought,her,listening,to,the,wind,hurling,itself,out,of,the,night
the,house,was,frighteningly,still,quieter,even,than,when,frank,had,lain,in,the,parlor,just,a,few,hours,before
then,there,had,been,tiptoeing,feet,and,hushed,voices,muffled,knocks,on,the,door,neighbors,rustling,in,to,whisper,sympathy,and,occasional,sobs,from,frank's,sister,who,had,come,up,from,jonesboro,for,the,funeral
but,now,the,house,was,cloaked,in,silence
although,her,door,was,open,she,could,hear,no,sounds,from,below,stairs
wade,and,the,baby,had,been,at,melanie's,since,frank's,body,was,brought,home,and,she,missed,the,sound,of,the,boy's,feet,and,ella's,gurgling
there,was,a,truce,in,the,kitchen,and,no,sound,of,quarreling,from,peter,mammy,and,cookie,floated,up,to,her
even,aunt,pitty,downstairs,in,the,library,was,not,rocking,her,creaking,chair,in,deference,to,scarlett's,sorrow
no,one,intruded,upon,her,believing,that,she,wished,to,be,left,alone,with,her,grief,but,to,be,left,alone,was,the,last,thing,scarlett,desired
had,it,only,been,grief,that,companioned,her,she,could,have,borne,it,as,she,had,borne,other,griefs
but,added,to,her,stunned,sense,of,loss,at,frank's,death,were,fear,and,remorse,and,the,torment,of,a,suddenly,awakened,conscience
for,the,first,time,in,her,life,she,was,regretting,things,she,had,done,regretting,them,with,a,sweeping,superstitious,fear,that,made,her,cast,sidelong,glances,at,the,bed,upon,which,she,had,lain,with,frank
she,had,killed,frank
she,had,killed,him,just,as,surely,as,if,it,had,been,her,finger,that,pulled,the,trigger
he,had,begged,her,not,to,go,about,alone,but,she,had,not,listened,to,him
and,now,he,was,dead,because,of,her,obstinacy
god,would,punish,her,for,that
but,there,lay,upon,her,conscience,another,matter,that,was,heavier,and,more,frightening,even,than,causing,his,death,a,matter,which,had,never,troubled,her,until,she,looked,upon,his,coffined,face
there,had,been,something,helpless,and,pathetic,in,that,still,face,which,had,accused,her
god,would,punish,her,for,marrying,him,when,he,really,loved,suellen
she,would,have,to,cower,at,the,seat,of,judgment,and,answer,for,that,lie,she,told,him,coming,back,from,the,yankee,camp,in,his,buggy
useless,for,her,to,argue,now,that,the,end,justified,the,means,that,she,was,driven,into,trapping,him,that,the,fate,of,too,many,people,hung,on,her,for,her,to,consider,either,his,or,suellen's,rights,and,happiness
the,truth,stood,out,boldly,and,she,cowered,away,from,it
she,had,married,him,coldly,and,used,him,coldly
and,she,had,made,him,unhappy,during,the,last,six,months,when,she,could,have,made,him,very,happy
god,would,punish,her,for,not,being,nicer,to,him,punish,her,for,all,her,bullyings,and,proddings,and,storms,of,temper,and,cutting,remarks,for,alienating,his,friends,and,shaming,him,by,operating,the,mills,and,building,the,saloon,and,leasing,convicts
she,had,made,him,very,unhappy,and,she,knew,it,but,he,had,borne,it,all,like,a,gentleman
the,only,thing,she,had,ever,done,that,gave,him,any,real,happiness,was,to,present,him,with,ella
and,she,knew,if,she,could,have,kept,from,having,ella,ella,would,never,have,been,born
she,shivered,frightened,wishing,frank,were,alive,so,she,could,be,nice,to,him,so,very,nice,to,him,to,make,up,for,it,all
oh,if,only,god,did,not,seem,so,furious,and,vengeful
oh,if,only,the,minutes,did,not,go,by,so,slowly,and,the,house,were,not,so,still
if,only,she,were,not,so,alone
if,only,melanie,were,with,her,melanie,could,calm,her,fears
but,melanie,was,at,home,nursing,ashley
for,a,moment,scarlett,thought,of,summoning,pittypat,to,stand,between,her,and,her,conscience,but,she,hesitated
pitty,would,probably,make,matters,worse,for,she,honestly,mourned,frank
he,had,been,more,her,contemporary,than,scarlett's,and,she,had,been,devoted,to,him
he,had,filled,to,perfection,pitty's,need,for,a,man,in,the,house,for,he,brought,her,little,presents,and,harmless,gossip,jokes,and,stories,read,the,paper,to,her,at,night,and,explained,topics,of,the,day,to,her,while,she,mended,his,socks
she,had,fussed,over,him,and,planned,special,dishes,for,him,and,coddled,him,during,his,innumerable,colds
now,she,missed,him,acutely,and,repeated,over,and,over,as,she,dabbed,at,her,red,swollen,eyes,if,only,he,hadn't,gone,out,with,the,klan
if,there,were,only,someone,who,could,comfort,her,quiet,her,fears,explain,to,her,just,what,were,these,confused,fears,which,made,her,heart,sink,with,such,cold,sickness
if,only,ashley,but,she,shrank,from,the,thought
she,had,almost,killed,ashley,just,as,she,had,killed,frank
and,if,ashley,ever,knew,the,real,truth,about,how,she,lied,to,frank,to,get,him,knew,how,mean,she,had,been,to,frank,he,could,never,love,her,any,more
ashley,was,so,honorable,so,truthful,so,kind,and,he,saw,so,straightly,so,clearly
if,he,knew,the,whole,truth,he,would,understand
oh,yes,he,would,understand,only,too,well
but,he,would,never,love,her,any,more
so,he,must,never,know,the,truth,because,he,must,keep,on,loving,her
how,could,she,live,if,that,secret,source,of,her,strength,his,love,were,taken,from,her
but,what,a,relief,it,would,be,to,put,her,head,on,his,shoulder,and,cry,and,unburden,her,guilty,heart
the,still,house,with,the,sense,of,death,heavy,upon,it,pressed,about,her,loneliness,until,she,felt,she,could,not,bear,it,unaided,any,longer
she,arose,cautiously,pushed,her,door,half-closed,and,then,dug,about,in,the,bottom,bureau,drawer,beneath,her,underwear
she,produced,aunt,pitty's,swoon,bottle,of,brandy,which,she,had,hidden,there,and,held,it,up,to,the,lamp
it,was,nearly,half-empty
surely,she,hadn't,drunk,that,much,since,last,night
she,poured,a,generous,amount,into,her,water,glass,and,gulped,it,down
she,would,have,to,put,the,bottle,back,in,the,cellaret,before,morning,filled,to,the,top,with,water
mammy,had,hunted,for,it,just,before,the,funeral,when,the,pallbearers,wanted,a,drink,and,already,the,air,in,the,kitchen,was,electric,with,suspicion,between,mammy,cookie,and,peter
the,brandy,burned,with,fiery,pleasantness
there,was,nothing,like,it,when,you,needed,it
in,fact,brandy,was,good,almost,any,time,so,much,better,than,insipid,wine
why,on,earth,should,it,be,proper,for,a,woman,to,drink,wine,and,not,spirits
mrs,merriwether,and,mrs,meade,had,sniffed,her,breath,most,obviously,at,the,funeral,and,she,had,seen,the,triumphant,look,they,had,exchanged
the,old,cats
she,poured,another,drink
it,wouldn't,matter,if,she,did,get,a,little,tipsy,tonight,for,she,was,going,to,bed,soon,and,she,could,gargle,cologne,before,mammy,came,up,to,unlace,her
she,wished,she,could,get,as,completely,and,thoughtlessly,drunk,as,gerald,used,to,get,on,court,day
then,perhaps,she,could,forget,frank's,sunken,face,accusing,her,of,ruining,his,life,and,then,killing,him
she,wondered,if,everyone,in,town,thought,she,had,killed,him
certainly,the,people,at,the,funeral,had,been,cold,to,her
the,only,people,who,had,put,any,warmth,into,their,expressions,of,sympathy,were,the,wives,of,the,yankee,officers,with,whom,she,did,business
well,she,didn't,care,what,the,town,said,about,her
how,unimportant,that,seemed,beside,what,she,would,have,to,answer,for,to,god
she,took,another,drink,at,the,thought,shuddering,as,the,hot,brandy,went,down,her,throat
she,felt,very,warm,now,but,still,she,couldn't,get,the,thought,of,frank,out,of,her,mind
what,fools,men,were,when,they,said,liquor,made,people,forget
unless,she,drank,herself,into,insensibility,she'd,still,see,frank's,face,as,it,had,looked,the,last,time,he,begged,her,not,to,drive,alone,timid,reproachful,apologetic
the,knocker,on,the,front,door,hammered,with,a,dull,sound,that,made,the,still,house,echo,and,she,heard,aunt,pitty's,waddling,steps,crossing,the,hall,and,the,door,opening
there,was,the,sound,of,greeting,and,an,indistinguishable,murmur
some,neighbor,calling,to,discuss,the,funeral,or,to,bring,a,blanc,mange
pitty,would,like,that
she,had,taken,an,important,and,melancholy,pleasure,in,talking,to,the,condolence,callers
she,wondered,incuriously,who,it,was,and,when,a,man's,voice,resonant,and,drawling,rose,above,pitty's,funereal,whispering,she,knew
gladness,and,relief,flooded,her
it,was,rhett
she,had,not,seen,him,since,he,broke,the,news,of,frank's,death,to,her,and,now,she,knew,deep,in,her,heart,that,he,was,the,one,person,who,could,help,her,tonight
i,think,she'll,see,me,rhett's,voice,floated,up,to,her
but,she,is,lying,down,now,captain,butler,and,won't,see,anyone
poor,child,she,is,quite,prostrated
she
i,think,she,will,see,me
please,tell,her,i,am,going,away,tomorrow,and,may,be,gone,some,time
it's,very,important
but,fluttered,aunt,pittypat
scarlett,ran,out,into,the,hall,observing,with,some,astonishment,that,her,knees,were,a,little,unsteady,and,leaned,over,the,banisters
i'll,be,down,terrectly,rhett,she,called
she,had,a,glimpse,of,aunt,pittypat's,plump,upturned,face,her,eyes,owlish,with,surprise,and,disapproval
now,it'll,be,all,over,town,that,i,conducted,myself,most,improperly,on,the,day,of,my,husband's,funeral,thought,scarlett,as,she,hurried,back,to,her,room,and,began,smoothing,her,hair
she,buttoned,her,black,basque,up,to,the,chin,and,pinned,down,the,collar,with,pittypat's,mourning,brooch
i,don't,look,very,pretty,she,thought,leaning,toward,the,mirror,too,white,and,scared
for,a,moment,her,hand,went,toward,the,lock,box,where,she,kept,her,rouge,hidden,but,she,decided,against,it
poor,pittypat,would,be,upset,in,earnest,if,she,came,downstairs,pink,and,blooming
she,picked,up,the,cologne,bottle,and,took,a,large,mouthful,carefully,rinsed,her,mouth,and,then,spit,into,the,slop,jar
she,rustled,down,the,stairs,toward,the,two,who,still,stood,in,the,hall,for,pittypat,had,been,too,upset,by,scarlett's,action,to,ask,rhett,to,sit,down
he,was,decorously,clad,in,black,his,linen,frilly,and,starched,and,his,manner,was,all,that,custom,demanded,from,an,old,friend,paying,a,call,of,sympathy,on,one,bereaved
in,fact,it,was,so,perfect,that,it,verged,on,the,burlesque,though,pittypat,did,not,see,it
he,was,properly,apologetic,for,disturbing,scarlett,and,regretted,that,in,his,rush,of,closing,up,business,before,leaving,town,he,had,been,unable,to,be,present,at,the,funeral
whatever,possessed,him,to,come
wondered,scarlett
he,doesn't,mean,a,word,he's,saying
i,hate,to,intrude,on,you,at,this,time,but,i,have,a,matter,of,business,to,discuss,that,will,not,wait
something,that,mr,kennedy,and,i,were,planning
i,didn't,know,you,and,mr,kennedy,had,business,dealings,said,aunt,pittypat,almost,indignant,that,some,of,frank's,activities,were,unknown,to,her
mr,kennedy,was,a,man,of,wide,interests,said,rhett,respectfully
shall,we,go,into,the,parlor
no
cried,scarlett,glancing,at,the,closed,folding,doors
she,could,still,see,the,coffin,in,that,room
she,hoped,she,never,had,to,enter,it,again
pitty,for,once,took,a,hint,although,with,none,too,good,grace
do,use,the,library
i,must,i,must,go,upstairs,and,get,out,the,mending
dear,me,i've,neglected,it,so,this,last,week
i,declare
she,went,up,the,stairs,with,a,backward,look,of,reproach,which,was,noticed,by,neither,scarlett,nor,rhett
he,stood,aside,to,let,her,pass,before,him,into,the,library
what,business,did,you,and,frank,have
she,questioned,abruptly
he,came,closer,and,whispered
none,at,all
i,just,wanted,to,get,miss,pitty,out,of,the,way
he,paused,as,he,leaned,over,her
it's,no,good,scarlett
what
the,cologne
i'm,sure,i,don't,know,what,you,mean
i'm,sure,you,do
you've,been,drinking,pretty,heavily
well,what,if,i,have
is,it,any,of,your,business
the,soul,of,courtesy,even,in,the,depths,of,sorrow
don't,drink,alone,scarlett
people,always,find,it,out,and,it,ruins,the,reputation
and,besides,it's,a,bad,business,this,drinking,alone
what's,the,matter,honey
he,led,her,to,the,rosewood,sofa,and,she,sat,down,in,silence
may,i,close,the,doors
she,knew,if,mammy,saw,the,closed,doors,she,would,be,scandalized,and,would,lecture,and,grumble,about,it,for,days,but,it,would,be,still,worse,if,mammy,should,overhear,this,discussion,of,drinking,especially,in,light,of,the,missing,brandy,bottle
she,nodded,and,rhett,drew,the,sliding,doors,together
when,he,came,back,and,sat,down,beside,her,his,dark,eyes,alertly,searching,her,face,the,pall,of,death,receded,before,the,vitality,he,radiated,and,the,room,seemed,pleasant,and,homelike,again,the,lamps,rosy,and,warm
what's,the,matter,honey
no,one,in,the,world,could,say,that,foolish,word,of,endearment,as,caressingly,as,rhett,even,when,he,was,joking,but,he,did,not,look,as,if,he,were,joking,now
she,raised,tormented,eyes,to,his,face,and,somehow,found,comfort,in,the,blank,inscrutability,she,saw,there
she,did,not,know,why,this,should,be,for,he,was,such,an,unpredictable,callous,person
perhaps,it,was,because,as,he,often,said,they,were,so,much,alike
sometimes,she,thought,that,all,the,people,she,had,ever,known,were,strangers,except,rhett
can't,you,tell,me
he,took,her,hand,oddly,gentle
it's,more,than,old,frank,leaving,you
do,you,need,money
money
god,no
oh,rhett,i'm,so,afraid
don't,be,a,goose,scarlett,you've,never,been,afraid,in,your,life
oh,rhett,i,am,afraid
the,words,bubbled,up,faster,than,she,could,speak,them
she,could,tell,him
she,could,tell,rhett,anything
he'd,been,so,bad,himself,that,he,wouldn't,sit,in,judgment,on,her
how,wonderful,to,know,someone,who,was,bad,and,dishonorable,and,a,cheat,and,a,liar,when,all,the,world,was,filled,with,people,who,would,not,lie,to,save,their,souls,and,who,would,rather,starve,than,do,a,dishonorable,deed
i'm,afraid,i'll,die,and,go,to,hell
if,he,laughed,at,her,she,would,die,right,then
but,he,did,not,laugh
you,are,pretty,healthy,and,maybe,there,isn't,any,hell,after,all
oh,but,there,is,rhett
you,know,there,is
i,know,there,is,but,it's,right,here,on,earth
not,after,we,die
there's,nothing,after,we,die,scarlett
you,are,having,your,hell,now
oh,rhett,that's,blasphemous
but,singularly,comforting
tell,me,why,are,you,going,to,hell
he,was,teasing,now,she,could,see,the,glint,in,his,eyes,but,she,did,not,mind
his,hands,felt,so,warm,and,strong,so,comforting,to,cling,to
rhett,i,oughtn't,to,have,married,frank
it,was,wrong
he,was,suellen's,beau,and,he,loved,her,not,me
but,i,lied,to,him,and,told,him,she,was,going,to,marry,tony,fontaine
oh,how,could,i,have,done,it
ah,so,that,was,how,it,came,about
i,always,wondered
and,then,i,made,him,so,miserable
i,made,him,do,all,sorts,of,things,he,didn't,want,to,do,like,making,people,pay,their,bills,when,they,really,couldn't,afford,to,pay,them
and,it,hurt,him,so,when,i,ran,the,mills,and,built,the,saloon,and,leased,convicts
he,could,hardly,hold,up,his,head,for,shame
and,rhett,i,killed,him
yes,i,did
i,didn't,know,he,was,in,the,klan
i,never,dreamed,he,had,that,much,gumption
but,i,ought,to,have,known
and,i,killed,him
'will,all,great,neptune's,ocean,wash,this,blood,clean,from,my,hand,'
what
no,matter
go,on
go,on
that's,all
isn't,it,enough
i,married,him,i,made,him,unhappy,and,i,killed,him
oh,my,god
i,don't,see,how,i,could,have,done,it
i,lied,to,him,and,i,married,him
it,all,seemed,so,right,when,i,did,it,but,now,i,see,how,wrong,it,was
rhett,it,doesn't,seem,like,it,was,me,who,did,all,these,things
i,was,so,mean,to,him,but,i'm,not,really,mean
i,wasn't,raised,that,way
mother,she,stopped,and,swallowed
she,had,avoided,thinking,of,ellen,all,day,but,she,could,no,longer,blot,out,her,image
i,often,wondered,what,she,was,like
you,seemed,to,me,so,like,your,father
mother,was,oh,rhett,for,the,first,time,i'm,glad,she's,dead,so,she,can't,see,me
she,didn't,raise,me,to,be,mean
she,was,so,kind,to,everybody,so,good
she'd,rather,i'd,have,starved,than,done,this
and,i,so,wanted,to,be,just,like,her,in,every,way,and,i'm,not,like,her,one,bit
i,hadn't,thought,of,that,there's,been,so,much,else,to,think,about,but,i,wanted,to,be,like,her
i,didn't,want,to,be,like,pa,i,loved,him,but,he,was,so,so,thoughtless
rhett,sometimes,i,did,try,so,hard,to,be,nice,to,people,and,kind,to,frank,but,then,the,nightmare,would,come,back,and,scare,me,so,bad,i'd,want,to,rush,out,and,just,grab,money,away,from,people,whether,it,was,mine,or,not
tears,were,streaming,unheeded,down,her,face,and,she,clutched,his,hand,so,hard,that,her,nails,dug,into,his,flesh
what,nightmare
his,voice,was,calm,and,soothing
oh,i,forgot,you,didn't,know
well,just,when,i,would,try,to,be,nice,to,folks,and,tell,myself,that,money,wasn't,everything,i'd,go,to,bed,and,dream,that,i,was,back,at,tara,right,after,mother,died,right,after,the,yankees,went,through
rhett,you,can't,imagine,i,get,cold,when,i,think,about,it
i,can,see,how,everything,is,burned,and,so,still,and,there's,nothing,to,eat
oh,rhett,in,my,dream,i'm,hungry,again
go,on
i'm,hungry,and,everybody,pa,and,the,girls,and,the,darkies,are,starving,and,they,keep,saying,over,and,over,'we're,hungry',and,i'm,so,empty,it,hurts,and,so,frightened
my,mind,keeps,saying,'if,i,ever,get,out,of,this,i'll,never,never,be,hungry,again',and,then,the,dream,goes,off,into,a,gray,mist,and,i'm,running,running,in,the,mist,running,so,hard,my,heart's,about,to,burst,and,something,is,chasing,me,and,i,can't,breathe,but,i,keep,thinking,that,if,i,can,just,get,there,i'll,be,safe
but,i,don't,know,where,i'm,trying,to,get,to
and,then,i'd,wake,up,and,i'd,be,cold,with,fright,and,so,afraid,that,i'd,be,hungry,again
when,i,wake,up,from,that,dream,it,seems,like,there's,not,enough,money,in,the,world,to,keep,me,from,being,afraid,of,being,hungry,again
and,then,frank,would,be,so,mealy,mouthed,and,slow,poky,that,he,would,make,me,mad,and,i'd,lose,my,temper
he,didn't,understand,i,guess,and,i,couldn't,make,him,understand
i,kept,thinking,that,i'd,make,it,up,to,him,some,day,when,we,had,money,and,i,wasn't,so,afraid,of,being,hungry
and,now,he's,dead,and,it's,too,late
oh,it,seemed,so,right,when,i,did,it,but,it,was,all,so,wrong
if,i,had,it,to,do,over,again,i'd,do,it,so,differently
hush,he,said,disentangling,her,frantic,grip,and,pulling,a,clean,handkerchief,from,his,pocket
wipe,your,face
there,is,no,sense,in,your,tearing,yourself,to,pieces,this,way
she,took,the,handkerchief,and,wiped,her,damp,cheeks,a,little,relief,stealing,over,her,as,if,she,had,shifted,some,of,her,burden,to,his,broad,shoulders
he,looked,so,capable,and,calm,and,even,the,slight,twist,of,his,mouth,was,comforting,as,though,it,proved,her,agony,and,confusion,unwarranted
feel,better,now
then,let's,get,to,the,bottom,of,this
you,say,if,you,had,it,to,do,over,again,you'd,do,it,differently
but,would,you
think,now
would,you
well
no,you'd,do,the,same,things,again
did,you,have,any,other,choice
no
then,what,are,you,sorry,about
i,was,so,mean,and,now,he's,dead
and,if,he,wasn't,dead,you'd,still,be,mean
as,i,understand,it,you,are,not,really,sorry,for,marrying,frank,and,bullying,him,and,inadvertently,causing,his,death
you,are,only,sorry,because,you,are,afraid,of,going,to,hell
is,that,right
well,that,sounds,so,mixed,up
your,ethics,are,considerably,mixed,up,too
you,are,in,the,exact,position,of,a,thief,who's,been,caught,red,handed,and,isn't,sorry,he,stole,but,is,terribly,terribly,sorry,he's,going,to,jail
a,thief
oh,don't,be,so,literal
in,other,words,if,you,didn't,have,this,silly,idea,that,you,were,damned,to,hell,fire,eternal,you'd,think,you,were,well,rid,of,frank
oh,rhett
oh,come
you,are,confessing,and,you,might,as,well,confess,the,truth,as,a,decorous,lie
did,your,er,conscience,bother,you,much,when,you,offered,to,shall,we,say,part,with,that,jewel,which,is,dearer,than,life,for,three,hundred,dollars
the,brandy,was,spinning,in,her,head,now,and,she,felt,giddy,and,a,little,reckless
what,was,the,use,in,lying,to,him
he,always,seemed,to,read,her,mind
i,really,didn't,think,about,god,much,then,or,hell
and,when,i,did,think,well,i,just,reckoned,god,would,understand
but,you,don't,credit,god,with,understanding,why,you,married,frank
rhett,how,can,you,talk,so,about,god,when,you,know,you,don't,believe,there,is,one
but,you,believe,in,a,god,of,wrath,and,that's,what's,important,at,present
why,shouldn't,the,lord,understand
are,you,sorry,you,still,own,tara,and,there,aren't,carpetbaggers,living,there
are,you,sorry,you,aren't,hungry,and,ragged
oh,no
well,did,you,have,any,alternative,except,marrying,frank
no
he,didn't,have,to,marry,you,did,he
men,are,free,agents
and,he,didn't,have,to,let,you,bully,him,into,doing,things,he,didn't,want,to,did,he
well
scarlett,why,worry,about,it
if,you,had,it,to,do,over,again,you,would,be,driven,to,the,lie,and,he,to,marrying,you
you,would,still,have,run,yourself,into,danger,and,he,would,have,had,to,avenge,you
if,he,had,married,sister,sue,she,might,not,have,caused,his,death,but,she'd,probably,have,made,him,twice,as,unhappy,as,you,did
it,couldn't,have,happened,differently
but,i,could,have,been,nicer,to,him
you,could,have,been,if,you'd,been,somebody,else
but,you,were,born,to,bully,anyone,who'll,let,you,do,it
the,strong,were,made,to,bully,and,the,weak,to,knuckle,under
it's,all,frank's,fault,for,not,beating,you,with,a,buggy,whip
i'm,surprised,at,you,scarlett,for,sprouting,a,conscience,this,late,in,life
opportunists,like,you,shouldn't,have,them
what,is,an,oppor,what,did,you,call,it
a,person,who,takes,advantage,of,opportunities
is,that,wrong
it,has,always,been,held,in,disrepute,especially,by,those,who,had,the,same,opportunities,and,didn't,take,them
oh,rhett,you,are,joking,and,i,thought,you,were,going,to,be,nice
i,am,being,nice,for,me
scarlett,darling,you,are,tipsy
that's,what's,the,matter,with,you
you,dare
yes,i,dare
you,are,on,the,verge,of,what,is,vulgarly,called,a,'crying,jag',and,so,i,shall,change,the,subject,and,cheer,you,up,by,telling,you,some,news,that,will,amuse,you
in,fact,that's,why,i,came,here,this,evening,to,tell,you,my,news,before,i,went,away
where,are,you,going
to,england,and,i,may,be,gone,for,months
forget,your,conscience,scarlett
i,have,no,intention,of,discussing,your,soul's,welfare,any,further
don't,you,want,to,hear,my,news
but,she,began,feebly,and,paused
between,the,brandy,which,was,smoothing,out,the,harsh,contours,of,remorse,and,rhett's,mocking,but,comforting,words,the,pale,specter,of,frank,was,receding,into,shadows
perhaps,rhett,was,right
perhaps,god,did,understand
she,recovered,enough,to,push,the,idea,from,the,top,of,her,mind,and,decide,i'll,think,about,it,all,tomorrow
what's,your,news
she,said,with,an,effort,blowing,her,nose,on,his,handkerchief,and,pushing,back,the,hair,that,had,begun,to,straggle
my,news,is,this,he,answered,grinning,down,at,her
i,still,want,you,more,than,any,woman,i've,ever,seen,and,now,that,frank's,gone,i,thought,you'd,be,interested,to,know,it
scarlett,jerked,her,hands,away,from,his,grasp,and,sprang,to,her,feet
i,you,are,the,most,ill-bred,man,in,the,world,coming,here,at,this,time,of,all,times,with,your,filthy,i,should,have,known,you'd,never,change
and,frank,hardly,cold
if,you,had,any,decency,will,you,leave,this
do,be,quiet,or,you'll,have,miss,pittypat,down,here,in,a,minute,he,said,not,rising,but,reaching,up,and,taking,both,her,fists
i'm,afraid,you,miss,my,point
miss,your,point
i,don't,miss,anything
she,pulled,against,his,grip
turn,me,loose,and,get,out,of,here
i,never,heard,of,such,bad,taste
i
hush,he,said
i,am,asking,you,to,marry,me
would,you,be,convinced,if,i,knelt,down
she,said,oh,breathlessly,and,sat,down,hard,on,the,sofa
she,stared,at,him,her,mouth,open,wondering,if,the,brandy,were,playing,tricks,on,her,mind,remembering,senselessly,his,jibing,my,dear,i'm,not,a,marrying,man
she,was,drunk,or,he,was,crazy
but,he,did,not,look,crazy
he,looked,as,calm,as,though,he,were,discussing,the,weather,and,his,smooth,drawl,fell,on,her,ears,with,no,particular,emphasis
i,always,intended,having,you,scarlett,since,that,first,day,i,saw,you,at,twelve,oaks,when,you,threw,that,vase,and,swore,and,proved,that,you,weren't,a,lady
i,always,intended,having,you,one,way,or,another
but,as,you,and,frank,have,made,a,little,money,i,know,you'll,never,be,driven,to,me,again,with,any,interesting,propositions,of,loans,and,collaterals
so,i,see,i'll,have,to,marry,you
rhett,butler,is,this,one,of,your,vile,jokes
i,bare,my,soul,and,you,are,suspicious
no,scarlett,this,is,a,bona,fide,honorable,declaration
i,admit,that,it's,not,in,the,best,of,taste,coming,at,this,time,but,i,have,a,very,good,excuse,for,my,lack,of,breeding
i'm,going,away,tomorrow,for,a,long,time,and,i,fear,that,if,i,wait,till,i,return,you'll,have,married,some,one,else,with,a,little,money
so,i,thought,why,not,me,and,my,money
really,scarlett,i,can't,go,all,my,life,waiting,to,catch,you,between,husbands
he,meant,it
there,was,no,doubt,about,it
her,mouth,was,dry,as,she,assimilated,this,knowledge,and,she,swallowed,and,looked,into,his,eyes,trying,to,find,some,clue
they,were,full,of,laughter,but,there,was,something,else,deep,in,them,which,she,had,never,seen,before,a,gleam,that,defied,analysis
he,sat,easily,carelessly,but,she,felt,that,he,was,watching,her,as,alertly,as,a,cat,watches,a,mouse,hole
there,was,a,sense,of,leashed,power,straining,beneath,his,calm,that,made,her,draw,back,a,little,frightened
he,was,actually,asking,her,to,marry,him,he,was,committing,the,incredible
once,she,had,planned,how,she,would,torment,him,should,he,ever,propose
once,she,had,thought,that,if,he,ever,spoke,those,words,she,would,humble,him,and,make,him,feel,her,power,and,take,a,malicious,pleasure,in,doing,it
now,he,had,spoken,and,the,plans,did,not,even,occur,to,her,for,he,was,no,more,in,her,power,than,he,had,ever,been
in,fact,he,held,the,whip,hand,of,the,situation,so,completely,that,she,was,as,flustered,as,a,girl,at,her,first,proposal,and,she,could,only,blush,and,stammer
i,i,shall,never,marry,again
oh,yes,you,will
you,were,born,to,be,married
why,not,me
but,rhett,i,i,don't,love,you
that,should,be,no,drawback
i,don't,recall,that,love,was,prominent,in,your,other,two,ventures
oh,how,can,you
you,know,i,was,fond,of,frank
he,said,nothing
i,was
i,was
well,we,won't,argue,that
will,you,think,over,my,proposition,while,i'm,gone
rhett,i,don't,like,for,things,to,drag,on
i'd,rather,tell,you,now
i'm,going,home,to,tara,soon,and,india,wilkes,will,stay,with,aunt,pittypat
i,want,to,go,home,for,a,long,spell,and,i,i,don't,ever,want,to,get,married,again
nonsense
why
oh,well,never,mind,why
i,just,don't,like,being,married
but,my,poor,child,you've,never,really,been,married
how,can,you,know
i'll,admit,you've,had,bad,luck,once,for,spite,and,once,for,money
did,you,ever,think,of,marrying,just,for,the,fun,of,it
fun
don't,talk,like,a,fool
there's,no,fun,being,married
no
why,not
a,measure,of,calm,had,returned,and,with,it,all,the,natural,bluntness,which,brandy,brought,to,the,surface
it's,fun,for,men,though,god,knows,why
i,never,could,understand,it
but,all,a,woman,gets,out,of,it,is,something,to,eat,and,a,lot,of,work,and,having,to,put,up,with,a,man's,foolishness,and,a,baby,every,year
he,laughed,so,loudly,that,the,sound,echoed,in,the,stillness,and,scarlett,heard,the,kitchen,door,open
hush

and,into,the,bargain,i'll,bet,your,mother,told,you,that,women,must,bear,'these,things',because,of,the,compensating,joys,of,motherhood

i'll,wager,you,never,discussed,the,marital,relation,with,a,man,before,even,charles,or,frank
she,scowled,at,him

i'm,not,urging,instant,matrimony,because,of,your,reputation
we'll,wait,the,decent,interval
by,the,way,just,how,long,is,a,'decent,interval'
i,haven't,said,i'd,marry,you
it,isn't,decent,to,even,talk,of,such,things,at,such,a,time
i've,told,you,why,i'm,talking,of,them
i'm,going,away,tomorrow,and,i'm,too,ardent,a,lover,to,restrain,my,passion,any,longer
but,perhaps,i've,been,too,precipitate,in,my,wooing
with,a,suddenness,that,startled,her,he,slid,off,the,sofa,onto,his,knees,and,with,one,hand,placed,delicately,over,his,heart,he,recited,rapidly
forgive,me,for,startling,you,with,the,impetuosity,of,my,sentiments,my,dear,scarlett,i,mean,my,dear,mrs,kennedy
it,cannot,have,escaped,your,notice,that,for,some,time,past,the,friendship,i,have,had,in,my,heart,for,you,has,ripened,into,a,deeper,feeling,a,feeling,more,beautiful,more,pure,more,sacred
dare,i,name,it,you
ah

do,get,up,she,entreated
you,look,such,a,fool,and,suppose,mammy,should,come,in,and,see,you
she,would,be,stunned,and,incredulous,at,the,first,signs,of,my,gentility,said,rhett,arising,lightly
come,scarlett,you,are,no,child,no,schoolgirl,to,put,me,off,with,foolish,excuses,about,decency,and,so,forth
say,you'll,marry,me,when,i,come,back,or,before,god,i,won't,go
i'll,stay,around,here,and,play,a,guitar,under,your,window,every,night,and,sing,at,the,top,of,my,voice,and,compromise,you,so,you'll,have,to,marry,me,to,save,your,reputation
rhett,do,be,sensible
i,don't,want,to,marry,anybody
no
you,aren't,telling,me,the,real,reason
it,can't,be,girlish,timidity
what,is,it
suddenly,she,thought,of,ashley,saw,him,as,vividly,as,though,he,stood,beside,her,sunny,haired,drowsy,eyed,full,of,dignity,so,utterly,different,from,rhett
he,was,the,real,reason,she,did,not,want,to,marry,again,although,she,had,no,objections,to,rhett,and,at,times,was,genuinely,fond,of,him
she,belonged,to,ashley,forever,and,ever
she,had,never,belonged,to,charles,or,frank,could,never,really,belong,to,rhett
every,part,of,her,almost,everything,she,had,ever,done,striven,after,attained,belonged,to,ashley,were,done,because,she,loved,him
ashley,and,tara,she,belonged,to,them
the,smiles,the,laughter,the,kisses,she,had,given,charles,and,frank,were,ashley's,even,though,he,had,never,claimed,them,would,never,claim,them
somewhere,deep,in,her,was,the,desire,to,keep,herself,for,him,although,she,knew,he,would,never,take,her
she,did,not,know,that,her,face,had,changed,that,reverie,had,brought,a,softness,to,her,face,which,rhett,had,never,seen,before
he,looked,at,the,slanting,green,eyes,wide,and,misty,and,the,tender,curve,of,her,lips,and,for,a,moment,his,breath,stopped
then,his,mouth,went,down,violently,at,one,corner,and,he,swore,with,passionate,impatience
scarlett,o'hara,you're,a,fool
before,she,could,withdraw,her,mind,from,its,far,places,his,arms,were,around,her,as,sure,and,hard,as,on,the,dark,road,to,tara,so,long,ago
she,felt,again,the,rush,of,helplessness,the,sinking,yielding,the,surging,tide,of,warmth,that,left,her,limp
and,the,quiet,face,of,ashley,wilkes,was,blurred,and,drowned,to,nothingness
he,bent,back,her,head,across,his,arm,and,kissed,her,softly,at,first,and,then,with,a,swift,gradation,of,intensity,that,made,her,cling,to,him,as,the,only,solid,thing,in,a,dizzy,swaying,world
his,insistent,mouth,was,parting,her,shaking,lips,sending,wild,tremors,along,her,nerves,evoking,from,her,sensations,she,had,never,known,she,was,capable,of,feeling
and,before,a,swimming,giddiness,spun,her,round,and,round,she,knew,that,she,was,kissing,him,back
stop,please,i'm,faint
she,whispered,trying,to,turn,her,head,weakly,from,him
he,pressed,her,head,back,hard,against,his,shoulder,and,she,had,a,dizzy,glimpse,of,his,face
his,eyes,were,wide,and,blazing,queerly,and,the,tremor,in,his,arms,frightened,her
i,want,to,make,you,faint
i,will,make,you,faint
you've,had,this,coming,to,you,for,years
none,of,the,fools,you've,known,have,kissed,you,like,this,have,they
your,precious,charles,or,frank,or,your,stupid,ashley
please
i,said,your,stupid,ashley
gentlemen,all,what,do,they,know,about,women
what,did,they,know,about,you
i,know,you
his,mouth,was,on,hers,again,and,she,surrendered,without,a,struggle,too,weak,even,to,turn,her,head,without,even,the,desire,to,turn,it,her,heart,shaking,her,with,its,poundings,fear,of,his,strength,and,her,nerveless,weakness,sweeping,her
what,was,he,going,to,do
she,would,faint,if,he,did,not,stop
if,he,would,only,stop,if,he,would,never,stop
say,yes
his,mouth,was,poised,above,hers,and,his,eyes,were,so,close,that,they,seemed,enormous,filling,the,world
say,yes,damn,you,or
she,whispered,yes,before,she,even,thought
it,was,almost,as,if,he,had,willed,the,word,and,she,had,spoken,it,without,her,own,volition
but,even,as,she,spoke,it,a,sudden,calm,fell,on,her,spirit,her,head,began,to,stop,spinning,and,even,the,giddiness,of,the,brandy,was,lessened
she,had,promised,to,marry,him,when,she,had,had,no,intention,of,promising
she,hardly,knew,how,it,had,all,come,about,but,she,was,not,sorry
it,now,seemed,very,natural,that,she,had,said,yes,almost,as,if,by,divine,intervention,a,hand,stronger,than,hers,was,about,her,affairs,settling,her,problems,for,her
he,drew,a,quick,breath,as,she,spoke,and,bent,as,if,to,kiss,her,again,and,her,eyes,closed,and,her,head,fell,back
but,he,drew,back,and,she,was,faintly,disappointed
it,made,her,feel,so,strange,to,be,kissed,like,this,and,yet,there,was,something,exciting,about,it
he,sat,very,still,for,a,while,holding,her,head,against,his,shoulder,and,as,if,by,effort,the,trembling,of,his,arms,ceased
he,moved,away,from,her,a,little,and,looked,down,at,her
she,opened,her,eyes,and,saw,that,the,frightening,glow,had,gone,from,his,face
but,somehow,she,could,not,meet,his,gaze,and,she,dropped,her,eyes,in,a,rush,of,tingling,confusion
when,he,spoke,his,voice,was,very,calm
you,meant,it
you,don't,want,to,take,it,back
no
it's,not,just,because,i've,what,is,the,phrase,'swept,you,off,your,feet',by,my,er,ardor
she,could,not,answer,for,she,did,not,know,what,to,say,nor,could,she,meet,his,eyes
he,put,a,hand,under,her,chin,and,lifted,her,face
i,told,you,once,that,i,could,stand,anything,from,you,except,a,lie
and,now,i,want,the,truth
just,why,did,you,say,yes
still,the,words,would,not,come,but,a,measure,of,poise,returning,she,kept,her,eyes,demurely,down,and,tucked,the,corners,of,her,mouth,into,a,little,smile
look,at,me
is,it,my,money
why,rhett
what,a,question
look,up,and,don't,try,to,sweet,talk,me
i'm,not,charles,or,frank,or,any,of,the,county,boys,to,be,taken,in,by,your,fluttering,lids
is,it,my,money
well,yes,a,part
a,part
he,did,not,seem,annoyed
he,drew,a,swift,breath,and,with,an,effort,wiped,from,his,eyes,the,eagerness,her,words,had,brought,an,eagerness,which,she,was,too,confused,to,see
well,she,floundered,helplessly,money,does,help,you,know,rhett,and,god,knows,frank,didn't,leave,any,too,much
but,then,well,rhett,we,do,get,on,you,know
and,you,are,the,only,man,i,ever,saw,who,could,stand,the,truth,from,a,woman,and,it,would,be,nice,having,a,husband,who,didn't,think,me,a,silly,fool,and,expect,me,to,tell,lies,and,well,i,am,fond,of,you
fond,of,me
well,she,said,fretfully,if,i,said,i,was,madly,in,love,with,you,i'd,be,lying,and,what's,more,you'd,know,it
sometimes,i,think,you,carry,your,truth,telling,too,far,my,pet
don't,you,think,even,if,it,was,a,lie,that,it,would,be,appropriate,for,you,to,say,'i,love,you,rhett,',even,if,you,didn't,mean,it
what,was,he,driving,at,she,wondered,becoming,more,confused
he,looked,so,queer,eager,hurt,mocking
he,took,his,hands,from,her,and,shoved,them,deep,in,his,trousers,pockets,and,she,saw,him,ball,his,fists
if,it,costs,me,a,husband,i'll,tell,the,truth,she,thought,grimly,her,blood,up,as,always,when,he,baited,her
rhett,it,would,be,a,lie,and,why,should,we,go,through,all,that,foolishness
i'm,fond,of,you,like,i,said
you,know,how,it,is
you,told,me,once,that,you,didn't,love,me,but,that,we,had,a,lot,in,common
both,rascals,was,the,way,you
oh,god
he,whispered,rapidly,turning,his,head,away
to,be,taken,in,my,own,trap
what,did,you,say
nothing,and,he,looked,at,her,and,laughed,but,it,was,not,a,pleasant,laugh
name,the,day,my,dear,and,he,laughed,again,and,bent,and,kissed,her,hands
she,was,relieved,to,see,his,mood,pass,and,good,humor,apparently,return,so,she,smiled,too
he,played,with,her,hand,for,a,moment,and,grinned,up,at,her
did,you,ever,in,your,novel,reading,come,across,the,old,situation,of,the,disinterested,wife,falling,in,love,with,her,own,husband
you,know,i,don't,read,novels,she,said,and,trying,to,equal,his,jesting,mood,went,on,besides,you,once,said,it,was,the,height,of,bad,form,for,husbands,and,wives,to,love,each,other
i,once,said,too,god,damn,many,things,he,retorted,abruptly,and,rose,to,his,feet
don't,swear
you'll,have,to,get,used,to,it,and,learn,to,swear,too
you'll,have,to,get,used,to,all,my,bad,habits
that'll,be,part,of,the,price,of,being,fond,of,me,and,getting,your,pretty,paws,on,my,money
well,don't,fly,off,the,handle,so,because,i,didn't,lie,and,make,you,feel,conceited
you,aren't,in,love,with,me,are,you
why,should,i,be,in,love,with,you
no,my,dear,i'm,not,in,love,with,you,no,more,than,you,are,with,me,and,if,i,were,you,would,be,the,last,person,i'd,ever,tell
god,help,the,man,who,ever,really,loves,you
you'd,break,his,heart,my,darling,cruel,destructive,little,cat,who,is,so,careless,and,confident,she,doesn't,even,trouble,to,sheathe,her,claws
he,jerked,her,to,her,feet,and,kissed,her,again,but,this,time,his,lips,were,different,for,he,seemed,not,to,care,if,he,hurt,her,seemed,to,want,to,hurt,her,to,insult,her
his,lips,slid,down,to,her,throat,and,finally,he,pressed,them,against,the,taffeta,over,her,breast,so,hard,and,so,long,that,his,breath,burnt,to,her,skin
her,hands,struggled,up,pushing,him,away,in,outraged,modesty
you,mustn't
how,dare,you
your,heart's,going,like,a,rabbit's,he,said,mockingly
all,too,fast,for,mere,fondness,i,would,think,if,i,were,conceited
smooth,your,ruffled,feathers
you,are,just,putting,on,these,virginal,airs
tell,me,what,i,shall,bring,you,from,england
a,ring
what,kind,would,you,like
she,wavered,momentarily,between,interest,in,his,last,words,and,a,feminine,desire,to,prolong,the,scene,with,anger,and,indignation
oh,a,diamond,ring,and,rhett,do,buy,a,great,big,one
so,you,can,flaunt,it,before,your,poverty-stricken,friends,and,say,'see,what,i,caught,'
very,well,you,shall,have,a,big,one,one,so,big,that,your,less-fortunate,friends,can,comfort,themselves,by,whispering,that,it's,really,vulgar,to,wear,such,large,stones
he,abruptly,started,off,across,the,room,and,she,followed,him,bewildered,to,the,closed,doors
what,is,the,matter
where,are,you,going
to,my,rooms,to,finish,packing
oh,but
but,what
nothing
i,hope,you,have,a,nice,trip
thank,you
he,opened,the,door,and,walked,into,the,hall
scarlett,trailed,after,him,somewhat,at,a,loss,a,trifle,disappointed,as,at,an,unexpected,anticlimax
he,slipped,on,his,coat,and,picked,up,his,gloves,and,hat
i'll,write,you
let,me,know,if,you,change,your,mind
aren't,you
well
he,seemed,impatient,to,be,off
aren't,you,going,to,kiss,me,good-by
she,whispered,mindful,of,the,ears,of,the,house
don't,you,think,you've,had,enough,kissing,for,one,evening
he,retorted,and,grinned,down,at,her
to,think,of,a,modest,well-,brought-up,young,woman,well,i,told,you,it,would,be,fun,didn't,i
oh,you,are,impossible
she,cried,in,wrath,not,caring,if,mammy,did,hear
and,i,don't,care,if,you,never,come,back
she,turned,and,flounced,toward,the,stairs,expecting,to,feel,his,warm,hand,on,her,arm,stopping,her
but,he,only,pulled,open,the,front,door,and,a,cold,draft,swept,in
but,i,will,come,back,he,said,and,went,out,leaving,her,on,the,bottom,step,looking,at,the,closed,door
the,ring,rhett,brought,back,from,england,was,large,indeed,so,large,it,embarrassed,scarlett,to,wear,it
she,loved,gaudy,and,expensive,jewelry,but,she,had,an,uneasy,feeling,that,everyone,was,saying,with,perfect,truth,that,this,ring,was,vulgar
the,central,stone,was,a,four-carat,diamond,and,surrounding,it,were,a,number,of,emeralds
it,reached,to,the,knuckle,of,her,finger,and,gave,her,hand,the,appearance,of,being,weighted,down
scarlett,had,a,suspicion,that,rhett,had,gone,to,great,pains,to,have,the,ring,made,up,and,for,pure,meanness,had,ordered,it,made,as,ostentatious,as,possible
until,rhett,was,back,in,atlanta,and,the,ring,on,her,finger,she,told,no,one,not,even,her,family,of,her,intentions,and,when,she,did,announce,her,engagement,a,storm,of,bitter,gossip,broke,out
since,the,klan,affair,rhett,and,scarlett,had,been,with,the,exception,of,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,the,town's,most,unpopular,citizens
everyone,had,disapproved,of,scarlett,since,the,far-away,day,when,she,abandoned,the,weeds,worn,for,charlie,hamilton
their,disapproval,had,grown,stronger,because,of,her,unwomanly,conduct,in,the,matter,of,the,mills,her,immodesty,in,showing,herself,when,she,was,pregnant,and,so,many,other,things
but,when,she,brought,about,the,death,of,frank,and,tommy,and,jeopardized,the,lives,of,a,dozen,other,men,their,dislike,flamed,into,public,condemnation
as,for,rhett,he,had,enjoyed,the,town's,hatred,since,his,speculations,during,the,war,and,he,had,not,further,endeared,himself,to,his,fellow,citizens,by,his,alliances,with,the,republicans,since,then
but,oddly,enough,the,fact,that,he,had,saved,the,lives,of,some,of,atlanta's,most,prominent,men,was,what,aroused,the,hottest,hate,of,atlanta's,ladies
it,was,not,that,they,regretted,their,men,were,still,alive
it,was,that,they,bitterly,resented,owing,the,men's,lives,to,such,a,man,as,rhett,and,to,such,an,embarrassing,trick
for,months,they,had,writhed,under,yankee,laughter,and,scorn,and,the,ladies,felt,and,said,that,if,rhett,really,had,the,good,of,the,klan,at,heart,he,would,have,managed,the,affair,in,a,more,seemly,fashion
they,said,he,had,deliberately,dragged,in,belle,watling,to,put,the,nice,people,of,the,town,in,a,disgraceful,position
and,so,he,deserved,neither,thanks,for,rescuing,the,men,nor,forgiveness,for,his,past,sins
these,women,so,swift,to,kindness,so,tender,to,the,sorrowing,so,untiring,in,times,of,stress,could,be,as,implacable,as,furies,to,any,renegade,who,broke,one,small,law,of,their,unwritten,code
this,code,was,simple
reverence,for,the,confederacy,honor,to,the,veterans,loyalty,to,old,forms,pride,in,poverty,open,hands,to,friends,and,undying,hatred,to,yankees
between,them,scarlett,and,rhett,had,outraged,every,tenet,of,this,code
the,men,whose,lives,rhett,had,saved,attempted,out,of,decency,and,a,sense,of,gratitude,to,keep,their,women,silent,but,they,had,little,success
before,the,announcement,of,their,coming,marriage,the,two,had,been,unpopular,enough,but,people,could,still,be,polite,to,them,in,a,formal,way
now,even,that,cold,courtesy,was,no,longer,possible
the,news,of,their,engagement,came,like,an,explosion,unexpected,and,shattering,rocking,the,town,and,even,the,mildest-,mannered,women,spoke,their,minds,heatedly
marrying,barely,a,year,after,frank's,death,and,she,had,killed,him
and,marrying,that,butler,man,who,owned,a,brothel,and,who,was,in,with,the,yankees,and,carpetbaggers,in,all,kinds,of,thieving,schemes
separately,the,two,of,them,could,be,endured,but,the,brazen,combination,of,scarlett,and,rhett,was,too,much,to,be,borne
common,and,vile,both,of,them
they,ought,to,be,run,out,of,town
atlanta,might,perhaps,have,been,more,tolerant,toward,the,two,if,the,news,of,their,engagement,had,not,come,at,a,time,when,rhett's,carpetbagger,and,scallawag,cronies,were,more,odious,in,the,sight,of,respectable,citizens,than,they,had,ever,been,before
public,feeling,against,the,yankees,and,all,their,allies,was,at,fever,heat,at,the,very,time,when,the,town,learned,of,the,engagement,for,the,last,citadel,of,georgia's,resistance,to,yankee,rule,had,just,fallen
the,long,campaign,which,had,begun,when,sherman,moved,southward,from,above,dalton,four,years,before,had,finally,reached,its,climax,and,the,state's,humiliation,was,complete
three,years,of,reconstruction,had,passed,and,they,had,been,three,years,of,terrorism
everyone,had,thought,that,conditions,were,already,as,bad,as,they,could,ever,be
but,now,georgia,was,discovering,that,reconstruction,at,its,worst,had,just,begun
for,three,years,the,federal,government,had,been,trying,to,impose,alien,ideas,and,an,alien,rule,upon,georgia,and,with,an,army,to,enforce,its,commands,it,had,largely,succeeded
but,only,the,power,of,the,military,upheld,the,new,regime
the,state,was,under,the,yankee,rule,but,not,by,the,state's,consent
georgia's,leaders,had,kept,on,battling,for,the,state's,right,to,govern,itself,according,to,its,own,ideas
they,had,continued,resisting,all,efforts,to,force,them,to,bow,down,and,accept,the,dictates,of,washington,as,their,own,state,law
officially,georgia's,government,had,never,capitulated,but,it,had,been,a,futile,fight,an,ever-losing,fight
it,was,a,fight,that,could,not,win,but,it,had,at,least,postponed,the,inevitable
already,many,other,southern,states,had,illiterate,negroes,in,high,public,office,and,legislatures,dominated,by,negroes,and,carpetbaggers
but,georgia,by,its,stubborn,resistance,had,so,far,escaped,this,final,degradation
for,the,greater,part,of,three,years,the,state's,capitol,had,remained,in,the,control,of,white,men,and,democrats
with,yankee,soldiers,everywhere,the,state,officials,could,do,little,but,protest,and,resist
their,power,was,nominal,but,they,had,at,least,been,able,to,keep,the,state,government,in,the,hands,of,native,georgians
now,even,that,last,stronghold,had,fallen
just,as,johnston,and,his,men,had,been,driven,back,step,by,step,from,dalton,to,atlanta,four,years,before,so,had,the,georgia,democrats,been,driven,back,little,by,little,from,1865,on
the,power,of,the,federal,government,over,the,state's,affairs,and,the,lives,of,its,citizens,had,been,steadily,made,greater,and,greater
force,had,been,piled,on,top,of,force,and,military,edicts,in,increasing,numbers,had,rendered,the,civil,authority,more,and,more,impotent
finally,with,georgia,in,the,status,of,a,military,province,the,polls,had,been,ordered,thrown,open,to,the,negroes,whether,the,state's,laws,permitted,it,or,not
a,week,before,scarlett,and,rhett,announced,their,engagement,an,election,for,governor,had,been,held
the,southern,democrats,had,general,john,b,gordon,one,of,georgia's,best,loved,and,most,honored,citizens,as,their,candidate
opposing,him,was,a,republican,named,bullock
the,election,had,lasted,three,days,instead,of,one
trainloads,of,negroes,had,been,rushed,from,town,to,town,voting,at,every,precinct,along,the,way
of,course,bullock,had,won
if,the,capture,of,georgia,by,sherman,had,caused,bitterness,the,final,capture,of,the,state's,capitol,by,the,carpetbaggers,yankees,and,negroes,caused,an,intensity,of,bitterness,such,as,the,state,had,never,known,before
atlanta,and,georgia,seethed,and,raged
and,rhett,butler,was,a,friend,of,the,hated,bullock
scarlett,with,her,usual,disregard,of,all,matters,not,directly,under,her,nose,had,scarcely,known,an,election,was,being,held
rhett,had,taken,no,part,in,the,election,and,his,relations,with,the,yankees,were,no,different,from,what,they,had,always,been
but,the,fact,remained,that,rhett,was,a,scallawag,and,a,friend,of,bullock
and,if,the,marriage,went,through,scarlett,also,would,be,turning,scallawag
atlanta,was,in,no,mood,to,be,tolerant,or,charitable,toward,anyone,in,the,enemy,camp,and,the,news,of,the,engagement,coming,when,it,did,the,town,remembered,all,of,the,evil,things,about,the,pair,and,none,of,the,good
scarlett,knew,the,town,was,rocking,but,she,did,not,realize,the,extent,of,public,feeling,until,mrs,merriwether,urged,on,by,her,church,circle,took,it,upon,herself,to,speak,to,her,for,her,own,good
because,your,own,dear,mother,is,dead,and,miss,pitty,not,being,a,matron,is,not,qualified,to,er,well,to,talk,to,you,upon,such,a,subject,i,feel,that,i,must,warn,you,scarlett,captain,butler,is,not,the,kind,of,a,man,for,any,woman,of,good,family,to,marry
he,is,a
he,managed,to,save,grandpa,merriwether's,neck,and,your,nephew's,too
mrs,merriwether,swelled
hardly,an,hour,before,she,had,had,an,irritating,talk,with,grandpa
the,old,man,had,remarked,that,she,must,not,value,his,hide,very,much,if,she,did,not,feel,some,gratitude,to,rhett,butler,even,if,the,man,was,a,scallawag,and,a,scoundrel
he,only,did,that,as,a,dirty,trick,on,us,all,scarlett,to,embarrass,us,in,front,of,the,yankees,mrs,merriwether,continued
you,know,as,well,as,i,do,that,the,man,is,a,rogue
he,always,has,been,and,now,he's,unspeakable
he,is,simply,not,the,kind,of,man,decent,people,receive
no
that's,strange,mrs,merriwether
he,was,in,your,parlor,often,enough,during,the,war
and,he,gave,maybelle,her,white,satin,wedding,dress,didn't,he
or,is,my,memory,wrong
things,are,so,different,during,the,war,and,nice,people,associated,with,many,men,who,were,not,quite,it,was,all,for,the,cause,and,very,proper,too
surely,you,can't,be,thinking,of,marrying,a,man,who,wasn't,in,the,army,who,jeered,at,men,who,did,enlist
he,was,too,in,the,army
he,was,in,the,army,eight,months
he,was,in,the,last,campaign,and,fought,at,franklin,and,was,with,general,johnston,when,he,surrendered
i,had,not,heard,that,said,mrs,merriwether,and,she,looked,as,if,she,did,not,believe,it,either
but,he,wasn't,wounded,she,added,triumphantly
lots,of,men,weren't
everybody,who,was,anybody,got,wounded
_i_,know,no,one,who,wasn't,wounded
scarlett,was,goaded
then,i,guess,all,the,men,you,knew,were,such,fools,they,didn't,know,when,to,come,in,out,of,a,shower,of,rain,or,of,minie,balls
now,let,me,tell,you,this,mrs,merriwether,and,you,can,take,it,back,to,your,busybody,friends
i'm,going,to,marry,captain,butler,and,i,wouldn't,care,if,he'd,fought,on,the,yankee,side
when,that,worthy,matron,went,out,of,the,house,with,her,bonnet,jerking,with,rage,scarlett,knew,she,had,an,open,enemy,now,instead,of,a,disapproving,friend
but,she,did,not,care
nothing,mrs,merriwether,could,say,or,do,could,hurt,her
she,did,not,care,what,anyone,said,anyone,except,mammy
scarlett,had,borne,with,pitty's,swooning,at,the,news,and,had,steeled,herself,to,see,ashley,look,suddenly,old,and,avoid,her,eyes,as,he,wished,her,happiness
she,had,been,amused,and,irritated,at,the,letters,from,aunt,pauline,and,aunt,eulalie,in,charleston,horror,struck,at,the,news,forbidding,the,marriage,telling,her,it,would,not,only,ruin,her,social,position,but,endanger,theirs
she,had,even,laughed,when,melanie,with,a,worried,pucker,in,her,brows,said,loyally,of,course,captain,butler,is,much,nicer,than,most,people,realize,and,he,was,so,kind,and,clever,the,way,he,saved,ashley
and,after,all,he,did,fight,for,the,confederacy
but,scarlett,don't,you,think,you'd,better,not,decide,so,hastily
no,she,didn't,mind,what,anybody,said,except,mammy
mammy's,words,were,the,ones,that,made,her,most,angry,and,brought,the,greatest,hurt

while,they,were,honeymooning,in,new,orleans,scarlett,told,rhett,of,mammy's,words
to,her,surprise,and,indignation,he,laughed,at,mammy's,statement,about,mules,in,horse,harness
i,have,never,heard,a,profound,truth,expressed,so,succinctly,he,said
mammy's,a,smart,old,soul,and,one,of,the,few,people,i,know,whose,respect,and,good,will,i'd,like,to,have
but,being,a,mule,i,suppose,i'll,never,get,either,from,her
she,even,refused,the,ten-,dollar,gold,piece,which,i,in,my,groomlike,fervor,wished,to,present,her,after,the,wedding
i've,seen,so,few,people,who,did,not,melt,at,the,sight,of,cash
but,she,looked,me,in,the,eye,and,thanked,me,and,said,she,wasn't,a,free,issue,nigger,and,didn't,need,my,money
why,should,she,take,on,so
why,should,everybody,gabble,about,me,like,a,bunch,of,guinea,hens
it's,my,own,affair,whom,i,marry,and,how,often,i,marry
i've,always,minded,my,own,business
why,don't,other,people,mind,theirs
my,pet,the,world,can,forgive,practically,anything,except,people,who,mind,their,own,business
but,why,should,you,squall,like,a,scalded,cat
you've,said,often,enough,that,you,didn't,mind,what,people,said,about,you
why,not,prove,it
you,know,you've,laid,yourself,open,to,criticism,so,often,in,small,matters,you,can't,expect,to,escape,gossip,in,this,large,matter
you,knew,there'd,be,talk,if,you,married,a,villain,like,me
if,i,were,a,low-bred,poverty-stricken,villain,people,wouldn't,be,so,mad
but,a,rich,flourishing,villain,of,course,that's,unforgivable
i,wish,you'd,be,serious,sometimes
i,am,serious
it's,always,annoying,to,the,godly,when,the,ungodly,flourish,like,the,green,bay,tree
cheer,up,scarlett,didn't,you,tell,me,once,that,the,main,reason,you,wanted,a,lot,of,money,was,so,you,could,tell,everybody,to,go,to,hell
now's,your,chance
but,you,were,the,main,one,i,wanted,to,tell,to,go,to,hell,said,scarlett,and,laughed
do,you,still,want,to,tell,me,to,go,to,hell
well,not,as,often,as,i,used,to
do,it,whenever,you,like,if,it,makes,you,happy
it,doesn't,make,me,especially,happy,said,scarlett,and,bending,she,kissed,him,carelessly
his,dark,eyes,flickered,quickly,over,her,face,hunting,for,something,in,her,eyes,which,he,did,not,find,and,he,laughed,shortly
forget,about,atlanta
forget,about,the,old,cats
i,brought,you,to,new,orleans,to,have,fun,and,i,intend,that,you,shall,have,it
part,five
chapter,xlviii
she,did,have,fun,more,fun,than,she,had,had,since,the,spring,before,the,war
new,orleans,was,such,a,strange,glamorous,place,and,scarlett,enjoyed,it,with,the,headlong,pleasure,of,a,pardoned,life,prisoner
the,carpetbaggers,were,looting,the,town,many,honest,folk,were,driven,from,their,homes,and,did,not,know,where,to,look,for,their,next,meal,and,a,negro,sat,in,the,lieutenant,governor's,chair
but,the,new,orleans,rhett,showed,her,was,the,gayest,place,she,had,ever,seen
the,people,she,met,seemed,to,have,all,the,money,they,wanted,and,no,cares,at,all
rhett,introduced,her,to,dozens,of,women,pretty,women,in,bright,gowns,women,who,had,soft,hands,that,showed,no,signs,of,hard,work,women,who,laughed,at,everything,and,never,talked,of,stupid,serious,things,or,hard,times
and,the,men,she,met,how,thrilling,they,were
and,how,different,from,atlanta,men,and,how,they,fought,to,dance,with,her,and,paid,her,the,most,extravagant,compliments,as,though,she,were,a,young,belle
these,men,had,the,same,hard,reckless,look,rhett,wore
their,eyes,were,always,alert,like,men,who,have,lived,too,long,with,danger,to,be,ever,quite,careless
they,seemed,to,have,no,pasts,or,futures,and,they,politely,discouraged,scarlett,when,to,make,conversation,she,asked,what,or,where,they,were,before,they,came,to,new,orleans
that,in,itself,was,strange,for,in,atlanta,every,respectable,newcomer,hastened,to,present,his,credentials,to,tell,proudly,of,his,home,and,family,to,trace,the,tortuous,mazes,of,relationship,that,stretched,over,the,entire,south
but,these,men,were,a,taciturn,lot,picking,their,words,carefully
sometimes,when,rhett,was,alone,with,them,and,scarlett,in,the,next,room,she,heard,laughter,and,caught,fragments,of,conversation,that,meant,nothing,to,her,scraps,of,words,puzzling,names,cuba,and,nassau,in,the,blockade,days,the,gold,rush,and,claim,jumping,gun,running,and,filibustering,nicaragua,and,william,walker,and,how,he,died,against,a,wall,at,truxillo
once,her,sudden,entrance,abruptly,terminated,a,conversation,about,what,had,happened,to,the,members,of,quantrill's,band,of,guerillas,and,she,caught,the,names,of,frank,and,jesse,james
but,they,were,all,well,mannered,beautifully,tailored,and,they,evidently,admired,her,so,it,mattered,little,to,scarlett,that,they,chose,to,live,utterly,in,the,present
what,really,mattered,was,that,they,were,rhett's,friends,and,had,large,houses,and,fine,carriages,and,they,took,her,and,rhett,driving,invited,them,to,suppers,gave,parties,in,their,honor
and,scarlett,like,them,very,well
rhett,was,amused,when,she,told,him,so
i,thought,you,would,he,said,and,laughed
why,not
her,suspicions,aroused,as,always,by,his,laughter
they're,all,second-raters,black,sheep,rascals
they're,all,adventurers,or,carpetbag,aristocrats
they,all,made,their,money,speculating,in,food,like,your,loving,husband,or,out,of,dubious,government,contracts,or,in,shady,ways,that,won't,bear,investigation
i,don't,believe,it
you're,teasing
they're,the,nicest,people
the,nicest,people,in,town,are,starving,said,rhett
and,living,politely,in,hovels,and,i,doubt,if,i'd,be,received,in,those,hovels
you,see,my,dear,i,was,engaged,in,some,of,my,nefarious,schemes,here,during,the,war,and,these,people,have,devilish,long,memories
scarlett,you,are,a,constant,joy,to,me
you,unerringly,manage,to,pick,the,wrong,people,and,the,wrong,things
but,they,are,your,friends
oh,but,i,like,rascals
my,early,youth,was,spent,as,a,gambler,on,a,river,boat,and,i,can,understand,people,like,that
but,i'm,not,blind,to,what,they,are
whereas,you,he,laughed,again,you,have,no,instinct,about,people,no,discrimination,between,the,cheap,and,the,great
sometimes,i,think,that,the,only,great,ladies,you've,ever,associated,with,were,your,mother,and,miss,melly,and,neither,seems,to,have,made,any,impression,on,you
melly
why,she's,as,plain,as,an,old,shoe,and,her,clothes,always,look,tacky,and,she,never,has,two,words,to,say,for,herself
spare,me,your,jealousy,madam
beauty,doesn't,make,a,lady,nor,clothes,a,great,lady
oh,don't,they
just,you,wait,rhett,butler,and,i'll,show,you
now,that,i've,we've,got,money,i'm,going,to,be,the,greatest,lady,you,ever,saw
i,shall,wait,with,interest,he,said
more,exciting,than,the,people,she,met,were,the,frocks,rhett,bought,her,superintending,the,choice,of,colors,materials,and,designs,himself
hoops,were,out,now,and,the,new,styles,were,charming,with,the,skirts,pulled,back,from,the,front,and,draped,over,bustles,and,on,the,bustles,were,wreaths,of,flowers,and,bows,and,cascades,of,lace
she,thought,of,the,modest,hoops,of,the,war,years,and,she,felt,a,little,embarrassed,at,these,new,skirts,which,undeniably,outlined,her,abdomen
and,the,darling,little,bonnets,that,were,not,really,bonnets,at,all,but,flat,little,affairs,worn,over,one,eye,and,laden,with,fruits,and,flowers,dancing,plumes,and,fluttering,ribbons
if,only,rhett,had,not,been,so,silly,and,burned,the,false,curls,she,bought,to,augment,her,knot,of,indian-straight,hair,that,peeked,from,the,rear,of,these,little,hats
and,the,delicate,convent-made,underwear
how,lovely,it,was,and,how,many,sets,she,had
chemises,and,nightgowns,and,petticoats,of,the,finest,linen,trimmed,with,dainty,embroidery,and,infinitesimal,tucks
and,the,satin,slippers,rhett,bought,her
they,had,heels,three,inches,high,and,huge,glittering,paste,buckles,on,them
and,silk,stockings,a,dozen,pairs,and,not,a,one,had,cotton,tops
what,riches
she,recklessly,bought,gifts,for,the,family
a,furry,st,bernard,puppy,for,wade,who,had,always,longed,for,one,a,persian,kitten,for,beau,a,coral,bracelet,for,little,ella,a,heavy,necklace,with,moonstone,pendants,for,aunt,pitty,a,complete,set,of,shakespeare,for,melanie,and,ashley,an,elaborate,livery,for,uncle,peter,including,a,high,silk,coachman's,hat,with,a,brush,upon,it,dress,lengths,for,dilcey,and,cookie,expensive,gifts,for,everyone,at,tara
but,what,have,you,bought,for,mammy
questioned,rhett,looking,over,the,pile,of,gifts,spread,out,on,the,bed,in,their,hotel,room,and,removing,the,puppy,and,kitten,to,the,dressing,room
not,a,thing
she,was,hateful
why,should,i,bring,her,a,present,when,she,called,us,mules
why,should,you,so,resent,hearing,the,truth,my,pet
you,must,bring,mammy,a,present
it,would,break,her,heart,if,you,didn't,and,hearts,like,hers,are,too,valuable,to,be,broken
i,won't,take,her,a,thing
she,doesn't,deserve,it
then,i'll,buy,her,one
i,remember,my,mammy,always,said,that,when,she,went,to,heaven,she,wanted,a,taffeta,petticoat,so,stiff,that,it,would,stand,by,itself,and,so,rustly,that,the,lord,god,would,think,it,was,made,of,angels',wings
i'll,buy,mammy,some,red,taffeta,and,have,an,elegant,petticoat,made
she,won't,take,it,from,you
she'd,die,rather,than,wear,it
i,don't,doubt,it
but,i'll,make,the,gesture,just,the,same
the,shops,of,new,orleans,were,so,rich,and,exciting,and,shopping,with,rhett,was,an,adventure
dining,with,him,was,an,adventure,too,and,one,more,thrilling,than,shopping,for,he,knew,what,to,order,and,how,it,should,be,cooked
the,wines,and,liqueurs,and,champagnes,of,new,orleans,were,new,and,exhilarating,to,her,acquainted,with,only,homemade,blackberry,and,scuppernong,vintages,and,aunt,pitty's,swoon,brandy,but,oh,the,food,rhett,ordered
best,of,all,things,in,new,orleans,was,the,food
remembering,the,bitter,hungry,days,at,tara,and,her,more,recent,penury,scarlett,felt,that,she,could,never,eat,enough,of,these,rich,dishes
gumboes,and,shrimp,creole,doves,in,wine,and,oysters,in,crumbly,patties,full,of,creamy,sauce,mushrooms,and,sweetbreads,and,turkey,livers,fish,baked,cunningly,in,oiled,paper,and,limes
her,appetite,never,dulled,for,whenever,she,remembered,the,everlasting,goobers,and,dried,peas,and,sweet,potatoes,at,tara,she,felt,an,urge,to,gorge,herself,anew,of,creole,dishes
you,eat,as,though,each,meal,were,your,last,said,rhett
don't,scrape,the,plate,scarlett
i'm,sure,there's,more,in,the,kitchen
you,have,only,to,ask,the,waiter
if,you,don't,stop,being,such,a,glutton,you'll,be,as,fat,as,the,cuban,ladies,and,then,i,shall,divorce,you
but,she,only,put,out,her,tongue,at,him,and,ordered,another,pastry,thick,with,chocolate,and,stuffed,with,meringue
what,fun,it,was,to,be,able,to,spend,as,much,money,as,you,liked,and,not,count,pennies,and,feel,that,you,should,save,them,to,pay,taxes,or,buy,mules
what,fun,to,be,with,people,who,were,gay,and,rich,and,not,genteelly,poor,like,atlanta,people
what,fun,to,wear,rustling,brocade,dresses,that,showed,your,waist,and,all,your,neck,and,arms,and,more,than,a,little,of,your,breast,and,know,that,men,were,admiring,you
and,what,fun,to,eat,all,you,wanted,without,having,censorious,people,say,you,weren't,ladylike
and,what,fun,to,drink,all,the,champagne,you,pleased
the,first,time,she,drank,too,much,she,was,embarrassed,when,she,awoke,the,next,morning,with,a,splitting,headache,and,an,awful,memory,of,singing,bonnie,blue,flag,all,the,way,back,to,the,hotel,through,the,streets,of,new,orleans,in,an,open,carriage
she,had,never,seen,a,lady,even,tipsy,and,the,only,drunken,woman,she,had,ever,seen,had,been,that,watling,creature,on,the,day,when,atlanta,fell
she,hardly,knew,how,to,face,rhett,so,great,was,her,humiliation,but,the,affair,seemed,only,to,amuse,him
everything,she,did,seemed,to,amuse,him,as,though,she,were,a,gamboling,kitten
it,was,exciting,to,go,out,with,him,for,he,was,so,handsome
somehow,she,had,never,given,his,looks,a,thought,before,and,in,atlanta,everyone,had,been,too,preoccupied,with,his,shortcomings,ever,to,talk,about,his,appearance
but,here,in,new,orleans,she,could,see,how,the,eyes,of,other,women,followed,him,and,how,they,fluttered,when,he,bent,over,their,hands
the,realization,that,other,women,were,attracted,by,her,husband,and,perhaps,envied,her,made,her,suddenly,proud,to,be,seen,by,his,side
why,we're,a,handsome,people,thought,scarlett,with,pleasure
yes,as,rhett,had,prophesied,marriage,could,be,a,lot,of,fun
not,only,was,it,fun,but,she,was,learning,many,things
that,was,odd,in,itself,because,scarlett,had,thought,life,could,teach,her,no,more
now,she,felt,like,a,child,every,day,on,the,brink,of,a,new,discovery
first,she,learned,that,marriage,with,rhett,was,a,far,different,matter,from,marriage,with,either,charles,or,frank
they,had,respected,her,and,been,afraid,of,her,temper
they,had,begged,for,favors,and,if,it,pleased,her,she,had,bestowed,them
rhett,did,not,fear,her,and,she,often,thought,did,not,respect,her,very,much,either
what,he,wanted,to,do,he,did,and,if,she,did,not,like,it,he,laughed,at,her
she,did,not,love,him,but,he,was,undoubtedly,an,exciting,person,to,live,with
the,most,exciting,thing,about,him,was,that,even,in,his,outbursts,of,passion,which,were,flavored,sometimes,with,cruelty,sometimes,with,irritating,amusement,he,seemed,always,to,be,holding,himself,under,restraint,always,riding,his,emotions,with,a,curb,bit
i,guess,that's,because,he,isn't,really,in,love,with,me,she,thought,and,was,content,enough,with,the,state,of,affairs
i,should,hate,for,him,to,ever,turn,completely,loose,in,any,way
but,still,the,thought,of,the,possibility,teased,her,curiosity,in,an,exciting,way
living,with,rhett,she,learned,many,new,things,about,him,and,she,had,thought,she,knew,him,so,well
she,learned,that,his,voice,could,be,as,silky,as,a,cat's,fur,one,moment,and,crisp,and,crackling,with,oaths,the,next
he,could,tell,with,apparent,sincerity,and,approval,stories,of,courage,and,honor,and,virtue,and,love,in,the,odd,places,he,had,been,and,follow,them,with,ribald,stories,of,coldest,cynicism
she,knew,no,man,should,tell,such,stories,to,his,wife,but,they,were,entertaining,and,they,appealed,to,something,coarse,and,earthy,in,her
he,could,be,an,ardent,almost,a,tender,lover,for,a,brief,while,and,almost,immediately,a,mocking,devil,who,ripped,the,lid,from,her,gunpowder,temper,fired,it,and,enjoyed,the,explosion
she,learned,that,his,compliments,were,always,two,edged,and,his,tenderest,expressions,open,to,suspicion
in,fact,in,those,two,weeks,in,new,orleans,she,learned,everything,about,him,except,what,he,really,was
some,mornings,he,dismissed,the,maid,and,brought,her,the,breakfast,tray,himself,and,fed,her,as,though,she,were,a,child,took,the,hairbrush,from,her,hand,and,brushed,her,long,dark,hair,until,it,snapped,and,crackled
yet,other,mornings,she,was,torn,rudely,out,of,deep,slumber,when,he,snatched,all,the,bed,covers,from,her,and,tickled,her,bare,feet
sometimes,he,listened,with,dignified,interest,to,details,of,her,businesses,nodding,approval,at,her,sagacity,and,at,other,times,he,called,her,somewhat,dubious,tradings,scavenging,highway,robbery,and,extortion
he,took,her,to,plays,and,annoyed,her,by,whispering,that,god,probably,didn't,approve,of,such,amusements,and,to,churches,and,sotto,voce,retailed,funny,obscenities,and,then,reproved,her,for,laughing
he,encouraged,her,to,speak,her,mind,to,be,flippant,and,daring
she,picked,up,from,him,the,gift,of,stinging,words,and,sardonic,phrases,and,learned,to,relish,using,them,for,the,power,they,gave,her,over,other,people
but,she,did,not,possess,his,sense,of,humor,which,tempered,his,malice,nor,his,smile,that,jeered,at,himself,even,while,he,was,jeering,others
he,made,her,play,and,she,had,almost,forgotten,how
life,had,been,so,serious,and,so,bitter
he,knew,how,to,play,and,swept,her,along,with,him
but,he,never,played,like,a,boy,he,was,a,man,and,no,matter,what,he,did,she,could,never,forget,it
she,could,not,look,down,on,him,from,the,heights,of,womanly,superiority,smiling,as,women,have,always,smiled,at,the,antics,of,men,who,are,boys,at,heart
this,annoyed,her,a,little,whenever,she,thought,of,it
it,would,be,pleasant,to,feel,superior,to,rhett
all,the,other,men,she,had,known,she,could,dismiss,with,a,half-contemptuous,what,a,child
her,father,the,tarleton,twins,with,their,love,of,teasing,and,their,elaborate,practical,jokes,the,hairy,little,fontaines,with,their,childish,rages,charles,frank,all,the,men,who,had,paid,court,to,her,during,the,war,everyone,in,fact,except,ashley
only,ashley,and,rhett,eluded,her,understanding,and,her,control,for,they,were,both,adults,and,the,elements,of,boyishness,were,lacking,in,them
she,did,not,understand,rhett,nor,did,she,trouble,to,understand,him,though,there,were,things,about,him,which,occasionally,puzzled,her
there,was,the,way,he,looked,at,her,sometimes,when,he,thought,she,was,unaware
turning,quickly,she,frequently,caught,him,watching,her,an,alert,eager,waiting,look,in,his,eyes
why,do,you,look,at,me,like,that
she,once,asked,irritably
like,a,cat,at,a,mouse,hole
but,his,face,had,changed,swiftly,and,he,only,laughed
soon,she,forgot,it,and,did,not,puzzle,her,head,about,it,any,more,or,about,anything,concerning,rhett
he,was,too,unpredictable,to,bother,about,and,life,was,very,pleasant,except,when,she,thought,of,ashley
rhett,kept,her,too,busy,to,think,of,ashley,often
ashley,was,hardly,ever,in,her,thoughts,during,the,day,but,at,night,when,she,was,tired,from,dancing,or,her,head,was,spinning,from,too,much,champagne,then,she,thought,of,ashley
frequently,when,she,lay,drowsily,in,rhett's,arms,with,the,moonlight,streaming,over,the,bed,she,thought,how,perfect,life,would,be,if,it,were,only,ashley's,arms,which,held,her,so,closely,if,it,were,only,ashley,who,drew,her,black,hair,across,his,face,and,wrapped,it,about,his,throat
once,when,she,was,thinking,this,she,sighed,and,turned,her,head,toward,the,window,and,after,a,moment,she,felt,the,heavy,arm,beneath,her,neck,become,like,iron,and,rhett's,voice,spoke,in,the,stillness,may,god,damn,your,cheating,little,soul,to,hell,for,all,eternity
and,getting,up,he,put,on,his,clothes,and,left,the,room,despite,her,startled,protests,and,questions
he,reappeared,the,next,morning,as,she,was,breakfasting,in,her,room,disheveled,quite,drunk,and,in,his,worst,sarcastic,mood,and,neither,made,excuses,nor,gave,an,account,of,his,absence
scarlett,asked,no,questions,and,was,quite,cool,to,him,as,became,an,injured,wife,and,when,she,had,finished,the,meal,she,dressed,under,his,bloodshot,gaze,and,went,shopping
he,was,gone,when,she,returned,and,did,not,appear,again,until,time,for,supper
it,was,a,silent,meal,and,scarlett's,temper,was,straining,because,it,was,her,last,supper,in,new,orleans,and,she,wanted,to,do,justice,to,the,crawfish
and,she,could,not,enjoy,it,under,his,gaze
nevertheless,she,ate,a,large,one,and,drank,a,quantity,of,champagne
perhaps,it,was,this,combination,that,brought,back,her,old,nightmare,that,evening,for,she,awoke,cold,with,sweat,sobbing,brokenly
she,was,back,at,tara,again,and,tara,was,desolate
mother,was,dead,and,with,her,all,the,strength,and,wisdom,of,the,world
nowhere,in,the,world,was,there,anyone,to,turn,to,anyone,to,rely,upon
and,something,terrifying,was,pursuing,her,and,she,was,running,running,till,her,heart,was,bursting,running,in,a,thick,swimming,fog,crying,out,blindly,seeking,that,nameless,unknown,haven,of,safety,that,was,somewhere,in,the,mist,about,her
rhett,was,leaning,over,her,when,she,woke,and,without,a,word,he,picked,her,up,in,his,arms,like,a,child,and,held,her,close,his,hard,muscles,comforting,his,wordless,murmuring,soothing,until,her,sobbing,ceased
oh,rhett
i,was,so,cold,and,so,hungry,and,so,tired,and,i,couldn't,find,it
i,ran,through,the,mist,and,i,ran,but,i,couldn't,find,it
find,what,honey
i,don't,know
i,wish,i,did,know
is,it,your,old,dream
oh,yes
he,gently,placed,her,on,the,bed,fumbled,in,the,darkness,and,lit,a,candle
in,the,light,his,face,with,bloodshot,eyes,and,harsh,lines,was,as,unreadable,as,stone
his,shirt,opened,to,the,waist,showed,a,brown,chest,covered,with,thick,black,hair
scarlett,still,shaking,with,fright,thought,how,strong,and,unyielding,that,chest,was,and,she,whispered,hold,me,rhett
darling
he,said,swiftly,and,picking,her,up,he,sat,down,in,a,large,chair,cradling,her,body,against,him
oh,rhett,it's,awful,to,be,hungry
it,must,be,awful,to,dream,of,starvation,after,a,seven-course,dinner,including,that,enormous,crawfish
he,smiled,but,his,eyes,were,kind
oh,rhett,i,just,run,and,run,and,hunt,and,i,can't,ever,find,what,it,is,i'm,hunting,for
it's,always,hidden,in,the,mist
i,know,if,i,could,find,it,i'd,be,safe,forever,and,ever,and,never,be,cold,or,hungry,again
is,it,a,person,or,a,thing,you're,hunting
i,don't,know
i,never,thought,about,it
rhett,do,you,think,i'll,ever,dream,that,i,get,there,to,safety
no,he,said,smoothing,her,tumbled,hair,i,don't
dreams,aren't,like,that
but,i,do,think,that,if,you,get,used,to,being,safe,and,warm,and,well,fed,in,your,everyday,life,you'll,stop,dreaming,that,dream
and,scarlett,i'm,going,to,see,that,you,are,safe
rhett,you,are,so,nice
thanks,for,the,crumbs,from,your,table,mrs,dives
scarlett,i,want,you,to,say,to,yourself,every,morning,when,you,wake,up,'i,can't,ever,be,hungry,again,and,nothing,can,ever,touch,me,so,long,as,rhett,is,here,and,the,united,states,government,holds,out,'
the,united,states,government
she,questioned,sitting,up,startled,tears,still,on,her,cheeks
the,ex-confederate,money,has,now,become,an,honest,woman
i,invested,most,of,it,in,government,bonds
god's,nightgown
cried,scarlett,sitting,up,in,his,lap,forgetful,of,her,recent,terror
do,you,mean,to,tell,me,you've,loaned,your,money,to,the,yankees
at,a,fair,per,cent
i,don't,care,if,it's,a,hundred,percent
you,must,sell,them,immediately
the,idea,of,letting,the,yankees,have,the,use,of,your,money
and,what,must,i,do,with,it
he,questioned,with,a,smile,noting,that,her,eyes,were,no,longer,wide,with,fright
why,why,buy,property,at,five,points
i'll,bet,you,could,buy,all,of,five,points,with,the,money,you,have
thank,you,but,i,wouldn't,have,five,points
now,that,the,carpetbagger,government,has,really,gotten,control,of,georgia,there's,no,telling,what,may,happen
i,wouldn't,put,anything,beyond,the,swarm,of,buzzards,that's,swooping,down,on,georgia,now,from,north,east,south,and,west
i'm,playing,along,with,them,you,understand,as,a,good,scallawag,should,do,but,i,don't,trust,them
and,i'm,not,putting,my,money,in,real,estate
i,prefer,bonds
you,can,hide,them
you,can't,hide,real,estate,very,easily
do,you,think,she,began,paling,as,she,thought,of,the,mills,and,store
i,don't,know
but,don't,look,so,frightened,scarlett
our,charming,new,governor,is,a,good,friend,of,mine
it's,just,that,times,are,too,uncertain,now,and,i,don't,want,much,of,my,money,tied,up,in,real,estate
he,shifted,her,to,one,knee,and,leaning,back,reached,for,a,cigar,and,lit,it
she,sat,with,her,bare,feet,dangling,watching,the,play,of,muscles,on,his,brown,chest,her,terrors,forgotten
and,while,we,are,on,the,subject,of,real,estate,scarlett,he,said,i,am,going,to,build,a,house
you,might,have,bullied,frank,into,living,in,miss,pitty's,house,but,not,me
i,don't,believe,i,could,bear,her,vaporings,three,times,a,day,and,moreover,i,believe,uncle,peter,would,assassinate,me,before,he,would,let,me,live,under,the,sacred,hamilton,roof
miss,pitty,can,get,miss,india,wilkes,to,stay,with,her,and,keep,the,bogyman,away
when,we,get,back,to,atlanta,we,are,going,to,stay,in,the,bridal,suite,of,the,national,hotel,until,our,house,is,finished
before,we,left,atlanta,i,was,dickering,for,that,big,lot,on,peachtree,the,one,near,the,leyden,house
you,know,the,one,i,mean
oh,rhett,how,lovely
i,do,so,want,a,house,of,my,own
a,great,big,one
then,at,last,we,are,agreed,on,something
what,about,a,white,stucco,with,wrought-iron,work,like,these,creole,houses,here
oh,no,rhett
not,anything,old,fashioned,like,these,new,orleans,houses
i,know,just,what,i,want
it's,the,newest,thing,because,i,saw,a,picture,of,it,in,let,me,see,it,was,in,that,harper's,weekly,i,was,looking,at

it,was,lovely
it,had,a,high,mansard,roof,with,a,picket,fence,on,top,and,a,tower,made,of,fancy,shingles,at,each,end
and,the,towers,had,windows,with,red,and,blue,glass,in,them
it,was,so,stylish,looking
i,suppose,it,had,jigsaw,work,on,the,porch,banisters
yes
and,a,fringe,of,wooden,scrollwork,hanging,from,the,roof,of,the,porch
yes
you,must,have,seen,one,like,it
i,have,but,not,in,switzerland
the,swiss,are,a,very,intelligent,race,and,keenly,alive,to,architectural,beauty
do,you,really,want,a,house,like,that
oh,yes
i,had,hoped,that,association,with,me,might,improve,your,taste
why,not,a,creole,house,or,a,colonial,with,six,white,columns
i,tell,you,i,don't,want,anything,tacky,and,old-fashioned,looking
and,inside,let's,have,red,wall,paper,and,red,velvet,portieres,over,all,the,folding,doors,and,oh,lots,of,expensive,walnut,furniture,and,grand,thick,carpets,and,oh,rhett,everybody,will,be,pea,green,when,they,see,our,house
it,is,very,necessary,that,everyone,shall,be,envious
well,if,you,like,they,shall,be,green
but,scarlett,has,it,occurred,to,you,that,it's,hardly,in,good,taste,to,furnish,the,house,on,so,lavish,a,scale,when,everyone,is,so,poor
i,want,it,that,way,she,said,obstinately
i,want,to,make,everybody,who's,been,mean,to,me,feel,bad
and,we'll,give,big,receptions,that'll,make,the,whole,town,wish,they,hadn't,said,such,nasty,things
but,who,will,come,to,our,receptions
why,everybody,of,course
i,doubt,it
the,old,guard,dies,but,it,never,surrenders
oh,rhett,how,you,run,on
if,you've,got,money,people,always,like,you
not,southerners
it's,harder,for,speculators',money,to,get,into,the,best,parlors,than,for,the,camel,to,go,through,the,needle's,eye
and,as,for,scallawags,that's,you,and,me,my,pet,we'll,be,lucky,if,we,aren't,spit,upon
but,if,you'd,like,to,try,i'll,back,you,my,dear,and,i'm,sure,i,shall,enjoy,your,campaign,intensely

you're,very,generous
but,listen,closely
not,one,cent,for,the,store,and,not,one,cent,for,that,kindling,factory,of,yours
oh,said,scarlett,her,face,falling
all,during,the,honeymoon,she,had,been,thinking,how,she,could,bring,up,the,subject,of,the,thousand,dollars,she,needed,to,buy,fifty,feet,more,of,land,to,enlarge,her,lumber,yard
i,thought,you,always,bragged,about,being,broad,minded,and,not,caring,what,people,said,about,my,running,a,business,and,you're,just,like,every,other,man,so,afraid,people,will,say,i,wear,the,pants,in,the,family
there's,never,going,to,be,any,doubt,in,anybody's,mind,about,who,wears,the,pants,in,the,butler,family,drawled,rhett
i,don't,care,what,fools,say

i,want,you,to,keep,on,running,the,store,and,the,mills
they,are,your,children's
when,wade,grows,up,he,won't,feel,right,about,being,supported,by,his,stepfather,and,then,he,can,take,over,the,management
but,not,one,cent,of,mine,goes,into,either,business

i'm,riding,you,with,a,slack,rein,my,pet,but,don't,forget,that,i'm,riding,with,curb,and,spurs,just,the,same
chapter,xlix
mrs,elsing,cocked,her,ear,toward,the,hall
hearing,melanie's,steps,die,away,into,the,kitchen,where,rattling,dishes,and,clinking,silverware,gave,promise,of,refreshments,she,turned,and,spoke,softly,to,the,ladies,who,sat,in,a,circle,in,the,parlor,their,sewing,baskets,in,their,laps
personally,i,do,not,intend,to,call,on,scarlett,now,or,ever,she,said,the,chill,elegance,of,her,face,colder,than,usual
the,other,members,of,the,ladies',sewing,circle,for,the,widows,and,orphans,of,the,confederacy,eagerly,laid,down,their,needles,and,edged,their,rocking,chairs,closer
all,the,ladies,had,been,bursting,to,discuss,scarlett,and,rhett,but,melanie's,presence,prevented,it
just,the,day,before,the,couple,had,returned,from,new,orleans,and,they,were,occupying,the,bridal,suite,at,the,national,hotel
hugh,says,that,i,must,call,out,of,courtesy,for,the,way,captain,butler,saved,his,life,mrs,elsing,continued

i'm,calling,on,captain,butler

he,was,bad,enough,when,he,was,a,speculator,during,the,war,and,making,money,out,of,our,hunger,but,now,that,he,is,hand,in,glove,with,the,carpetbaggers,and,scallawags,and,a,friend,actually,a,friend,of,that,odious,wretch,governor,bullock,call,indeed
mrs,bonnell,sighed
she,was,a,plump,brown,wren,of,a,woman,with,a,cheerful,face
they'll,only,call,once,for,courtesy,dolly
i,don't,know,that,i,blame,them
i've,heard,that,all,the,men,who,were,out,that,night,intend,to,call,and,i,think,they,should
somehow,it's,hard,for,me,to,think,that,scarlett,is,her,mother's,child
i,went,to,school,with,ellen,robillard,in,savannah,and,there,was,never,a,lovelier,girl,than,she,was,and,she,was,very,dear,to,me
if,only,her,father,had,not,opposed,her,match,with,her,cousin,philippe,robillard
there,was,nothing,really,wrong,with,the,boy,boys,must,sow,their,wild,oats
but,ellen,must,run,off,and,marry,old,man,o'hara,and,have,a,daughter,like,scarlett
but,really,i,feel,that,i,must,call,once,out,of,memory,to,ellen
sentimental,nonsense
snorted,mrs,merriwether,with,vigor
kitty,bonnell,are,you,going,to,call,on,a,woman,who,married,a,bare,year,after,her,husband's,death
a,woman
and,she,really,killed,mr,kennedy,interrupted,india
her,voice,was,cool,but,acid
whenever,she,thought,of,scarlett,it,was,hard,for,her,even,to,be,polite,remembering,always,remembering,stuart,tarleton
and,i,have,always,thought,there,was,more,between,her,and,that,butler,man,before,mr,kennedy,was,killed,than,most,people,suspected
before,the,ladies,could,recover,from,their,shocked,astonishment,at,her,statement,and,at,a,spinster,mentioning,such,a,matter,melanie,was,standing,in,the,doorway
so,engrossed,had,they,been,in,their,gossip,that,they,had,not,heard,her,light,tread,and,now,confronted,by,their,hostess,they,looked,like,whispering,schoolgirls,caught,by,a,teacher
alarm,was,added,to,consternation,at,the,change,in,melanie's,face
she,was,pink,with,righteous,anger,her,gentle,eyes,snapping,fire,her,nostrils,quivering
no,one,had,ever,seen,melanie,angry,before
not,a,lady,present,thought,her,capable,of,wrath
they,all,loved,her,but,they,thought,her,the,sweetest,most,pliable,of,young,women,deferential,to,her,elders,and,without,any,opinions,of,her,own
how,dare,you,india
she,questioned,in,a,low,voice,that,shook
where,will,your,jealousy,lead,you
for,shame
india's,face,went,white,but,her,head,was,high
i,retract,nothing,she,said,briefly
but,her,mind,was,seething
jealous,am,i
she,thought
with,the,memory,of,stuart,tarleton,and,of,honey,and,charles,didn't,she,have,good,reason,to,be,jealous,of,scarlett
didn't,she,have,good,reason,to,hate,her,especially,now,that,she,had,a,suspicion,that,scarlett,had,somehow,entangled,ashley,in,her,web
she,thought,there's,plenty,i,could,tell,you,about,ashley,and,your,precious,scarlett
india,was,torn,between,the,desire,to,shield,ashley,by,her,silence,and,to,extricate,him,by,telling,all,her,suspicions,to,melanie,and,the,whole,world
that,would,force,scarlett,to,release,whatever,hold,she,had,on,ashley
but,this,was,not,the,time
she,had,nothing,definite,only,suspicions
i,retract,nothing,she,repeated
then,it,is,fortunate,that,you,are,no,longer,living,under,my,roof,said,melanie,and,her,words,were,cold
india,leaped,to,her,feet,red,flooding,her,sallow,face
melanie,you,my,sister-in-law,you,aren't,going,to,quarrel,with,me,over,that,fast,piece
scarlett,is,my,sister-in-law,too,said,melanie,meeting,india's,eyes,squarely,as,though,they,were,strangers
and,dearer,to,me,than,any,blood,sister,could,ever,be
if,you,are,so,forgetful,of,my,favors,at,her,hands,i,am,not
she,stayed,with,me,through,the,whole,siege,when,she,could,have,gone,home,when,even,aunt,pitty,had,run,away,to,macon
she,brought,my,baby,for,me,when,the,yankees,were,almost,in,atlanta,and,she,burdened,herself,with,me,and,beau,all,that,dreadful,trip,to,tara,when,she,could,have,left,me,here,in,a,hospital,for,the,yankees,to,get,me
and,she,nursed,and,fed,me,even,if,she,was,tired,and,even,if,she,went,hungry
because,i,was,sick,and,weak,i,had,the,best,mattress,at,tara
when,i,could,walk,i,had,the,only,whole,pair,of,shoes
you,can,forget,those,things,she,did,for,me,india,but,i,cannot
and,when,ashley,came,home,sick,discouraged,without,a,home,without,a,cent,in,his,pockets,she,took,him,in,like,a,sister
and,when,we,thought,we,would,have,to,go,north,and,it,was,breaking,our,hearts,to,leave,georgia,scarlett,stepped,in,and,gave,him,the,mill,to,run
and,captain,butler,saved,ashley's,life,out,of,the,kindness,of,his,heart
certainly,ashley,had,no,claim,on,him
and,i,am,grateful,grateful,to,scarlett,and,to,captain,butler
but,you,india
how,can,you,forget,the,favors,scarlett,has,done,me,and,ashley
how,can,you,hold,your,brother's,life,so,cheap,as,to,cast,slurs,on,the,man,who,saved,him
if,you,went,down,on,your,knees,to,captain,butler,and,scarlett,it,would,not,be,enough
now,melly,began,mrs,merriwether,briskly,for,she,had,recovered,her,composure,that's,no,way,to,talk,to,india
i,heard,what,you,said,about,scarlett,too,cried,melanie,swinging,on,the,stout,old,lady,with,the,air,of,a,duelist,who,having,withdrawn,a,blade,from,one,prostrate,opponent,turns,hungrily,toward,another
and,you,too,mrs,elsing
what,you,think,of,her,in,your,own,petty,minds,i,do,not,care,for,that,is,your,business
but,what,you,say,about,her,in,my,own,house,or,in,my,own,hearing,ever,is,my,business
but,how,can,you,even,think,such,dreadful,things,much,less,say,them
are,your,men,so,cheap,to,you,that,you,would,rather,see,them,dead,than,alive
have,you,no,gratitude,to,the,man,who,saved,them,and,saved,them,at,risk,of,his,own,life
the,yankees,might,easily,have,thought,him,a,member,of,the,klan,if,the,whole,truth,had,come,out
they,might,have,hanged,him
but,he,risked,himself,for,your,men
for,your,father-in-law,mrs,merriwether,and,your,son-in-law,and,your,two,nephews,too
and,your,brother,mrs,bonnell,and,your,son,and,son-in-law,mrs,elsing
ingrates,that's,what,you,are
i,ask,an,apology,from,all,of,you
mrs,elsing,was,on,her,feet,cramming,her,sewing,into,her,box,her,mouth,set
if,anyone,had,ever,told,me,that,you,could,be,so,ill,bred,melly,no,i,will,not,apologize
india,is,right
scarlett,is,a,flighty,fast,bit,of,baggage
i,can't,forget,how,she,acted,during,the,war
and,i,can't,forget,how,poor,white,trashy,she's,acted,since,she,got,a,little,money
what,you,can't,forget,cut,in,melanie,clenching,her,small,fists,against,her,sides,is,that,she,demoted,hugh,because,he,wasn't,smart,enough,to,run,her,mill
melly
moaned,a,chorus,of,voices
mrs,elsing's,head,jerked,up,and,she,started,toward,the,door
with,her,hand,on,the,knob,of,the,front,door,she,stopped,and,turned
melly,she,said,and,her,voice,softened,honey,this,breaks,my,heart
i,was,your,mother's,best,friend,and,i,helped,dr,meade,bring,you,into,this,world,and,i've,loved,you,like,you,were,mine
if,it,were,something,that,mattered,it,wouldn't,be,so,hard,to,hear,you,talk,like,this
but,about,a,woman,like,scarlett,o'hara,who'd,just,as,soon,do,you,a,dirty,turn,as,the,next,of,us
tears,had,started,in,melanie's,eyes,at,the,first,words,mrs,elsing,spoke,but,her,face,hardened,when,the,old,lady,had,finished
i,want,it,understood,she,said,that,any,of,you,who,do,not,call,on,scarlett,need,never,never,call,on,me
there,was,a,loud,murmur,of,voices,confusion,as,the,ladies,got,to,their,feet
mrs,elsing,dropped,her,sewing,box,on,the,floor,and,came,back,into,the,room,her,false,fringe,jerking,awry
i,won't,have,it
she,cried
i,won't,have,it
you,are,beside,yourself,melly,and,i,don't,hold,you,responsible
you,shall,be,my,friend,and,i,shall,be,yours
i,refuse,to,let,this,come,between,us
she,was,crying,and,somehow,melanie,was,in,her,arms,crying,too,but,declaring,between,sobs,that,she,meant,every,word,she,said
several,of,the,other,ladies,burst,into,tears,and,mrs,merriwether,trumpeting,loudly,into,her,handkerchief,embraced,both,mrs,elsing,and,melanie
aunt,pitty,who,had,been,a,petrified,witness,to,the,whole,scene,suddenly,slid,to,the,floor,in,what,was,one,of,the,few,real,fainting,spells,she,had,ever,had
amid,the,tears,and,confusion,and,kissing,and,scurrying,for,smelling,salts,and,brandy,there,was,only,one,calm,face,one,dry,pair,of,eyes
india,wilkes,took,her,departure,unnoticed,by,anyone
grandpa,merriwether,meeting,uncle,henry,hamilton,in,the,girl,of,the,period,saloon,several,hours,later,related,the,happenings,of,the,morning,which,he,had,heard,from,mrs,merriweather
he,told,it,with,relish,for,he,was,delighted,that,someone,had,the,courage,to,face,down,his,redoubtable,daughter-in-law
certainly,he,had,never,had,such,courage
well,what,did,the,pack,of,silly,fools,finally,decide,to,do
asked,uncle,henry,irritably
i,dunno,for,sure,said,grandpa,but,it,looks,to,me,like,melly,won,hands,down,on,this,go-round
i'll,bet,they'll,all,call,at,least,once
folks,set,a,store,by,that,niece,of,yours,henry
melly's,a,fool,and,the,ladies,are,right
scarlett,is,a,slick,piece,of,baggage,and,i,don't,see,why,charlie,ever,married,her,said,uncle,henry,gloomily
but,melly,was,right,too,in,a,way
it's,only,decent,that,the,families,of,the,men,captain,butler,saved,should,call
when,you,come,right,down,to,it,i,haven't,got,so,much,against,butler
he,showed,himself,a,fine,man,that,night,he,saved,our,hides
it's,scarlett,who,sticks,under,my,tail,like,a,cocklebur
she's,a,sight,too,smart,for,her,own,good
well,i've,got,to,call

dolly,will,be,fit,to,be,tied,when,she,hears,i've,gone
wait,till,i,get,one,more,drink
no,we'll,get,a,drink,off,captain,butler
i'll,say,this,for,him,he,always,has,good,licker
rhett,had,said,that,the,old,guard,would,never,surrender,and,he,was,right
he,knew,how,little,significance,there,was,to,the,few,calls,made,upon,them,and,he,knew,why,the,calls,were,made
the,families,of,the,men,who,had,been,in,the,ill-starred,klan,foray,did,call,first,but,called,with,obvious,infrequency,thereafter
and,they,did,not,invite,the,rhett,butlers,to,their,homes
rhett,said,they,would,not,have,come,at,all,except,for,fear,of,violence,at,the,hands,of,melanie
where,he,got,this,idea,scarlett,did,not,know,but,she,dismissed,it,with,the,contempt,it,deserved
for,what,possible,influence,could,melanie,have,on,people,like,mrs,elsing,and,mrs,merriwether
that,they,did,not,call,again,worried,her,very,little,in,fact,their,absence,was,hardly,noticed,for,her,suite,was,crowded,with,guests,of,another,type
new,people,established,atlantians,called,them,when,they,were,not,calling,them,something,less,polite
there,were,many,new,people,staying,at,the,national,hotel,who,like,rhett,and,scarlett,were,waiting,for,their,houses,to,be,completed
they,were,gay,wealthy,people,very,much,like,rhett's,new,orleans,friends,elegant,of,dress,free,with,their,money,vague,as,to,their,antecedents
all,the,men,were,republicans,and,were,in,atlanta,on,business,connected,with,the,state,government
just,what,the,business,was,scarlett,did,not,know,and,did,not,trouble,to,learn
rhett,could,have,told,her,exactly,what,it,was,the,same,business,that,buzzards,have,with,dying,animals
they,smelled,death,from,afar,and,were,drawn,unerringly,to,it,to,gorge,themselves
government,of,georgia,by,its,own,citizens,was,dead,the,state,was,helpless,and,the,adventurers,were,swarming,in
the,wives,of,rhett's,scallawag,and,carpetbagger,friends,called,in,droves,and,so,did,the,new,people,she,had,met,when,she,sold,lumber,for,their,homes
rhett,said,that,having,done,business,with,them,she,should,receive,them,and,having,received,them,she,found,them,pleasant,company
they,wore,lovely,clothes,and,never,talked,about,the,war,or,hard,times,but,confined,the,conversation,to,fashions,scandals,and,whist
scarlett,had,never,played,cards,before,and,she,took,to,whist,with,joy,becoming,a,good,player,in,a,short,time
whenever,she,was,at,the,hotel,there,was,a,crowd,of,whist,players,in,her,suite
but,she,was,not,often,in,her,suite,these,days,for,she,was,too,busy,with,the,building,of,her,new,house,to,be,bothered,with,callers
these,days,she,did,not,much,care,whether,she,had,callers,or,not
she,wanted,to,delay,her,social,activities,until,the,day,when,the,house,was,finished,and,she,could,emerge,as,the,mistress,of,atlanta's,largest,mansion,the,hostess,of,the,town's,most,elaborate,entertainments
through,the,long,warm,days,she,watched,her,red,stone,and,gray,shingle,house,rise,grandly,to,tower,above,any,other,house,on,peachtree,street
forgetful,of,the,store,and,the,mills,she,spent,her,time,on,the,lot,arguing,with,carpenters,bickering,with,masons,harrying,the,contractor
as,the,walls,went,swiftly,up,she,thought,with,satisfaction,that,when,finished,it,would,be,larger,and,finer,looking,than,any,other,house,in,town
it,would,be,even,more,imposing,than,the,near-by,james,residence,which,had,just,been,purchased,for,the,official,mansion,of,governor,bullock
the,governor's,mansion,was,brave,with,jigsaw,work,on,banisters,and,eaves,but,the,intricate,scrollwork,on,scarlett's,house,put,the,mansion,to,shame
the,mansion,had,a,ballroom,but,it,looked,like,a,billiard,table,compared,with,the,enormous,room,that,covered,the,entire,third,floor,of,scarlett's,house
in,fact,her,house,had,more,of,everything,than,the,mansion,or,any,other,house,in,town,for,that,matter,more,cupolas,and,turrets,and,towers,and,balconies,and,lightning,rods,and,far,more,windows,with,colored,panes
a,veranda,encircled,the,entire,house,and,four,flights,of,steps,on,the,four,sides,of,the,building,led,up,to,it
the,yard,was,wide,and,green,and,scattered,about,it,were,rustic,iron,benches,an,iron,summerhouse,fashionably,called,a,gazebo,which,scarlett,had,been,assured,was,of,pure,gothic,design,and,two,large,iron,statues,one,a,stag,and,the,other,a,mastiff,as,large,as,a,shetland,pony
to,wade,and,ella,a,little,dazzled,by,the,size,splendor,and,fashionable,dark,gloom,of,their,new,home,these,two,metal,animals,were,the,only,cheerful,notes
within,the,house,was,furnished,as,scarlett,had,desired,with,thick,red,carpeting,which,ran,from,wall,to,wall,red,velvet,portieres,and,the,newest,of,highly,varnished,black-walnut,furniture,carved,wherever,there,was,an,inch,for,carving,and,upholstered,in,such,slick,horsehair,that,ladies,had,to,deposit,themselves,thereon,with,great,care,for,fear,of,sliding,off
everywhere,on,the,walls,were,gilt-framed,mirrors,and,long,pier,glasses,as,many,rhett,said,idly,as,there,were,in,belle,watling's,establishment
interspread,were,steel,engravings,in,heavy,frames,some,of,them,eight,feet,long,which,scarlett,had,ordered,especially,from,new,york
the,walls,were,covered,with,rich,dark,paper,the,ceilings,were,high,and,the,house,was,always,dim,for,the,windows,were,overdraped,with,plum-colored,plush,hangings,that,shut,out,most,of,the,sunlight
all,in,all,it,was,an,establishment,to,take,one's,breath,away,and,scarlett,stepping,on,the,soft,carpets,and,sinking,into,the,embrace,of,the,deep,feather,beds,remembered,the,cold,floors,and,the,straw-,stuffed,bedticks,of,tara,and,was,satisfied
she,thought,it,the,most,beautiful,and,most,elegantly,furnished,house,she,had,ever,seen,but,rhett,said,it,was,a,nightmare
however,if,it,made,her,happy,she,was,welcome,to,it
a,stranger,without,being,told,a,word,about,us,would,know,this,house,was,built,with,ill-gotten,gains,he,said
you,know,scarlett,money,ill,come,by,never,comes,to,good,and,this,house,is,proof,of,the,axiom
it's,just,the,kind,of,house,a,profiteer,would,build
but,scarlett,abrim,with,pride,and,happiness,and,full,of,plans,for,the,entertainments,she,would,give,when,they,were,thoroughly,settled,in,the,house,only,pinched,his,ear,playfully,and,said,fiddle-,dee-dee
how,you,do,run,on
she,knew,by,now,that,rhett,loved,to,take,her,down,a,peg,and,would,spoil,her,fun,whenever,he,could,if,she,lent,an,attentive,ear,to,his,jibes
should,she,take,him,seriously,she,would,be,forced,to,quarrel,with,him,and,she,did,not,care,to,match,swords,for,she,always,came,off,second,best
so,she,hardly,ever,listened,to,anything,he,said,and,what,she,was,forced,to,hear,she,tried,to,turn,off,as,a,joke
at,least,she,tried,for,a,while
during,their,honeymoon,and,for,the,greater,part,of,their,stay,at,the,national,hotel,they,had,lived,together,with,amiability
but,scarcely,had,they,moved,into,the,new,house,and,scarlett,gathered,her,new,friends,about,her,when,sudden,sharp,quarrels,sprang,up,between,them
they,were,brief,quarrels,short,lived,because,it,was,impossible,to,keep,a,quarrel,going,with,rhett,who,remained,coolly,indifferent,to,her,hot,words,and,waited,his,chance,to,pink,her,in,an,unguarded,spot
she,quarreled,rhett,did,not
he,only,stated,his,unequivocal,opinion,of,herself,her,actions,her,house,and,her,new,friends
and,some,of,his,opinions,were,of,such,a,nature,that,she,could,no,longer,ignore,them,and,treat,them,as,jokes
for,instance,when,she,decided,to,change,the,name,of,kennedy's,general,store,to,something,more,edifying,she,asked,him,to,think,of,a,title,that,would,include,the,word,emporium
rhett,suggested,caveat,emptorium,assuring,her,that,it,would,be,a,title,most,in,keeping,with,the,type,of,goods,sold,in,the,store
she,thought,it,had,an,imposing,sound,and,even,went,so,far,as,to,have,the,sign,painted,when,ashley,wilkes,embarrassed,translated,the,real,meaning
and,rhett,had,roared,at,her,rage
and,there,was,the,way,he,treated,mammy
mammy,had,never,yielded,an,inch,from,her,stand,that,rhett,was,a,mule,in,horse,harness
she,was,polite,but,cold,to,rhett
she,always,called,him,cap'n,butler,never,mist',rhett
she,never,even,dropped,a,curtsy,when,rhett,presented,her,with,the,red,petticoat,and,she,never,wore,it,either
she,kept,ella,and,wade,out,of,rhett's,way,whenever,she,could,despite,the,fact,that,wade,adored,uncle,rhett,and,rhett,was,obviously,fond,of,the,boy
but,instead,of,discharging,mammy,or,being,short,and,stern,with,her,rhett,treated,her,with,the,utmost,deference,with,far,more,courtesy,than,he,treated,any,of,the,ladies,of,scarlett's,recent,acquaintance
in,fact,with,more,courtesy,than,he,treated,scarlett,herself
he,always,asked,mammy's,permission,to,take,wade,riding,and,consulted,with,her,before,he,bought,ella,dolls
and,mammy,was,hardly,polite,to,him
scarlett,felt,that,rhett,should,be,firm,with,mammy,as,became,the,head,of,the,house,but,rhett,only,laughed,and,said,that,mammy,was,the,real,head,of,the,house
he,infuriated,scarlett,by,saying,coolly,that,he,was,preparing,to,be,very,sorry,for,her,some,years,hence,when,the,republican,rule,was,gone,from,georgia,and,the,democrats,back,in,power
when,the,democrats,get,a,governor,and,a,legislature,of,their,own,all,your,new,vulgar,republican,friends,will,be,wiped,off,the,chess,board,and,sent,back,to,minding,bars,and,emptying,slops,where,they,belong
and,you'll,be,left,out,on,the,end,of,a,limb,with,never,a,democratic,friend,or,a,republican,either
well,take,no,thought,of,the,morrow
scarlett,laughed,and,with,some,justice,for,at,that,time,bullock,was,safe,in,the,governor's,chair,twenty-seven,negroes,were,in,the,legislature,and,thousands,of,the,democratic,voters,of,georgia,were,disfranchised
the,democrats,will,never,get,back
all,they,do,is,make,yankees,madder,and,put,off,the,day,when,they,could,get,back
all,they,do,is,talk,big,and,run,around,at,night,ku,kluxing
they,will,get,back
i,know,southerners
i,know,georgians
they,are,a,tough,and,bullheaded,lot
if,they've,got,to,fight,another,war,to,get,back,they'll,fight,another,war
if,they've,got,to,buy,black,votes,like,the,yankees,have,done,then,they,will,buy,black,votes
if,they've,got,to,vote,ten,thousand,dead,men,like,the,yankees,did,every,corpse,in,every,cemetery,in,georgia,will,be,at,the,polls
things,are,going,to,get,so,bad,under,the,benign,rule,of,our,good,friend,rufus,bullock,that,georgia,is,going,to,vomit,him,up
rhett,don't,use,such,vulgar,words
cried,scarlett
you,talk,like,i,wouldn't,be,glad,to,see,the,democrats,come,back
and,you,know,that,isn't,so
i'd,be,very,glad,to,see,them,back
do,you,think,i,like,to,see,these,soldiers,hanging,around,reminding,me,of,do,you,think,i,like,why,i'm,a,georgian,too
i'd,like,to,see,the,democrats,get,back
but,they,won't
not,ever
and,even,if,they,did,how,would,that,affect,my,friends
they'd,still,have,their,money,wouldn't,they
if,they,kept,their,money
but,i,doubt,the,ability,of,any,of,them,to,keep,money,more,than,five,years,at,the,rate,they're,spending
easy,come,easy,go
their,money,won't,do,them,any,good
any,more,than,my,money,has,done,you,any,good
it,certainly,hasn't,made,a,horse,out,of,you,yet,has,it,my,pretty,mule
the,quarrel,which,sprang,from,this,last,remark,lasted,for,days
after,the,fourth,day,of,scarlett's,sulks,and,obvious,silent,demands,for,an,apology,rhett,went,to,new,orleans,taking,wade,with,him,over,mammy's,protests,and,he,stayed,away,until,scarlett's,tantrum,had,passed
but,the,sting,of,not,humbling,him,remained,with,her
when,he,came,back,from,new,orleans,cool,and,bland,she,swallowed,her,anger,as,best,she,could,pushing,it,into,the,back,of,her,mind,to,be,thought,of,at,some,later,date
she,did,not,want,to,bother,with,anything,unpleasant,now
she,wanted,to,be,happy,for,her,mind,was,full,of,the,first,party,she,would,give,in,the,new,house
it,would,be,an,enormous,night,reception,with,palms,and,an,orchestra,and,all,the,porches,shrouded,in,canvas,and,a,collation,that,made,her,mouth,water,in,anticipation
to,it,she,intended,to,invite,everyone,she,had,ever,known,in,atlanta,all,the,old,friends,and,all,the,new,and,charming,ones,she,had,met,since,returning,from,her,honeymoon
the,excitement,of,the,party,banished,for,the,most,part,the,memory,of,rhett's,barbs,and,she,was,happy,happier,than,she,had,been,in,years,as,she,planned,her,reception
oh,what,fun,it,was,to,be,rich
to,give,parties,and,never,count,the,cost
to,buy,the,most,expensive,furniture,and,dresses,and,food,and,never,think,about,the,bills
how,marvelous,to,be,able,to,send,tidy,checks,to,aunt,pauline,and,aunt,eulalie,in,charleston,and,to,will,at,tara
oh,the,jealous,fools,who,said,money,wasn't,everything
how,perverse,of,rhett,to,say,that,it,had,done,nothing,for,her
scarlett,issued,cards,of,invitation,to,all,her,friends,and,acquaintances,old,and,new,even,those,she,did,not,like
she,did,not,except,even,mrs,merriwether,who,had,been,almost,rude,when,she,called,on,her,at,the,national,hotel,or,mrs,elsing,who,had,been,cool,to,frigidness
she,invited,mrs,meade,and,mrs,whiting,who,she,knew,disliked,her,and,who,she,knew,would,be,embarrassed,because,they,did,not,have,the,proper,clothes,to,wear,to,so,elegant,a,function
for,scarlett's,housewarming,or,crush,as,it,was,fashionable,to,call,such,evening,parties,half-reception,half-,ball,was,by,far,the,most,elaborate,affair,atlanta,had,ever,seen
that,night,the,house,and,canvas-covered,veranda,were,filled,with,guests,who,drank,her,champagne,punch,and,ate,her,patties,and,creamed,oysters,and,danced,to,the,music,of,the,orchestra,that,was,carefully,screened,by,a,wall,of,palms,and,rubber,plants
but,none,of,those,whom,rhett,had,termed,the,old,guard,were,present,except,melanie,and,ashley,aunt,pitty,and,uncle,henry,dr,and,mrs,meade,and,grandpa,merriwether
many,of,the,old,guard,had,reluctantly,decided,to,attend,the,crush
some,had,accepted,because,of,melanie's,attitude,others,because,they,felt,they,owed,rhett,a,debt,for,saving,their,lives,and,those,of,their,relatives
but,two,days,before,the,function,a,rumor,went,about,atlanta,that,governor,bullock,had,been,invited
the,old,guard,signified,their,disapproval,by,a,sheaf,of,cards,regretting,their,inability,to,accept,scarlett's,kind,invitation
and,the,small,group,of,old,friends,who,did,attend,took,their,departure,embarrassed,but,firm,as,soon,as,the,governor,entered,scarlett's,house
scarlett,was,so,bewildered,and,infuriated,at,these,slights,that,the,party,was,utterly,ruined,for,her
her,elegant,crush
she,had,planned,it,so,lovingly,and,so,few,old,friends,and,no,old,enemies,had,been,there,to,see,how,wonderful,it,was
after,the,last,guest,had,gone,home,at,dawn,she,would,have,cried,and,stormed,had,she,not,been,afraid,that,rhett,would,roar,with,laughter,afraid,that,she,would,read,i,told,you,so,in,his,dancing,black,eyes,even,if,he,did,not,speak,the,words
so,she,swallowed,her,wrath,with,poor,grace,and,pretended,indifference
only,to,melanie,the,next,morning,did,she,permit,herself,the,luxury,of,exploding
you,insulted,me,melly,wilkes,and,you,made,ashley,and,the,others,insult,me
you,know,they'd,have,never,gone,home,so,soon,if,you,hadn't,dragged,them
oh,i,saw,you
just,when,i,started,to,bring,governor,bullock,over,to,present,him,to,you,you,ran,like,a,rabbit
i,did,not,believe,i,could,not,believe,that,he,would,really,be,present,answered,melanie,unhappily
even,though,everybody,said
everybody
so,everybody's,been,clacking,and,blabbing,about,me,have,they
cried,scarlett,furiously
do,you,mean,to,tell,me,if,you'd,known,the,governor,was,going,to,be,present,you,wouldn't,have,come,either
no,said,melanie,in,a,low,voice,her,eyes,on,the,floor
darling,i,just,wouldn't,have,come
great,balls,of,fire
so,you'd,have,insulted,me,like,everybody,else,did
oh,mercy
cried,melly,in,real,distress
i,didn't,mean,to,hurt,you
you're,my,own,sister,darling,my,own,charlie's,widow,and,i
she,put,a,timid,hand,on,scarlett's,arm
but,scarlett,flung,it,off,wishing,fervently,that,she,could,roar,as,loudly,as,gerald,used,to,roar,when,in,a,temper
but,melanie,faced,her,wrath
and,as,she,looked,into,scarlett's,stormy,green,eyes,her,slight,shoulders,straightened,and,a,mantle,of,dignity,strangely,at,variance,with,her,childish,face,and,figure,fell,upon,her
i'm,sorry,you're,hurt,my,dear,but,i,cannot,meet,governor,bullock,or,any,republican,or,any,scallawag
i,will,not,meet,them,in,your,house,or,any,other,house
no,not,even,if,i,have,to,if,i,have,to,melanie,cast,about,her,for,the,worst,thing,she,could,think,of,not,even,if,i,have,to,be,rude
are,you,criticizing,my,friends
no,dear
but,they,are,your,friends,and,not,mine
are,you,criticizing,me,for,having,the,governor,at,my,house
cornered,melanie,still,met,scarlett's,eyes,unwaveringly
darling,what,you,do,you,always,do,for,a,good,reason,and,i,love,you,and,trust,you,and,it,is,not,for,me,to,criticize
and,i,will,not,permit,anyone,to,criticize,you,in,my,hearing
but,oh,scarlett
suddenly,words,began,to,bubble,out,swift,hot,words,and,there,was,inflexible,hate,in,the,low,voice
can,you,forget,what,these,people,did,to,us
can,you,forget,darling,charlie,dead,and,ashley's,health,ruined,and,twelve,oaks,burned
oh,scarlett,you,can't,forget,that,terrible,man,you,shot,with,your,mother's,sewing,box,in,his,hands
you,can't,forget,sherman's,men,at,tara,and,how,they,even,stole,our,underwear
and,tried,to,burn,the,place,down,and,actually,handled,my,father's,sword
oh,scarlett,it,was,these,same,people,who,robbed,us,and,tortured,us,and,left,us,to,starve,that,you,invited,to,your,party
the,same,people,who,have,set,the,darkies,up,to,lord,it,over,us,who,are,robbing,us,and,keeping,our,men,from,voting
i,can't,forget
i,won't,forget
i,won't,let,my,beau,forget,and,i'll,teach,my,grandchildren,to,hate,these,people,and,my,grandchildren's,grandchildren,if,god,lets,me,live,that,long
scarlett,how,can,you,forget
melanie,paused,for,breath,and,scarlett,stared,at,her,startled,out,of,her,own,anger,by,the,quivering,note,of,violence,in,melanie's,voice
do,you,think,i'm,a,fool
she,questioned,impatiently
of,course,i,remember
but,all,that's,past,melly
it's,up,to,us,to,make,the,best,of,things,and,i'm,trying,to,do,it
governor,bullock,and,some,of,the,nicer,republicans,can,help,us,a,lot,if,we,handle,them,right
there,are,no,nice,republicans,said,melanie,flatly
and,i,don't,want,their,help
and,i,don't,intend,to,make,the,best,of,things,if,they,are,yankee,things
good,heaven,melly,why,get,in,such,a,pet
oh
cried,melanie,looking,conscience,stricken
how,i,have,run,on
scarlett,i,didn't,mean,to,hurt,your,feelings,or,to,criticize
everybody,thinks,differently,and,everybody's,got,a,right,to,their,own,opinion
now,dear,i,love,you,and,you,know,i,love,you,and,nothing,you,could,ever,do,would,make,me,change
and,you,still,love,me,don't,you
i,haven't,made,you,hate,me,have,i
scarlett,i,couldn't,stand,it,if,anything,ever,came,between,us,after,all,we've,been,through,together
say,it's,all,right
fiddle-dee-dee,melly,what,a,tempest,you,make,in,a,teapot,said,scarlett,grudgingly,but,she,did,not,throw,off,the,hand,that,stole,around,her,waist
now,we're,all,right,again,said,melanie,pleasedly,but,she,added,softly,i,want,us,to,visit,each,other,just,like,we,always,did,darling
just,you,let,me,know,what,days,republicans,and,scallawags,are,coming,to,see,you,and,i'll,stay,at,home,on,those,days
it's,a,matter,of,supreme,indifference,to,me,whether,you,come,or,not,said,scarlett,putting,on,her,bonnet,and,going,home,in,a,huff
there,was,some,satisfaction,to,her,wounded,vanity,in,the,hurt,look,on,melanie's,face
in,the,weeks,that,followed,her,first,party,scarlett,was,hard,put,to,keep,up,her,pretense,of,supreme,indifference,to,public,opinion
when,she,did,not,receive,calls,from,old,friends,except,melanie,and,pitty,and,uncle,henry,and,ashley,and,did,not,get,cards,to,their,modest,entertainments,she,was,genuinely,puzzled,and,hurt
had,she,not,gone,out,of,her,way,to,bury,old,hatchets,and,show,these,people,that,she,bore,them,no,ill,will,for,their,gossiping,and,backbiting
surely,they,must,know,that,she,didn't,like,governor,bullock,any,more,than,they,did,but,that,it,was,expedient,to,be,nice,to,him
the,idiots
if,everybody,would,be,nice,to,the,republicans,georgia,would,get,out,of,the,fix,she,was,in,very,quickly
she,did,not,realize,then,that,with,one,stroke,she,had,cut,forever,any,fragile,tie,that,still,bound,her,to,the,old,days,to,old,friends
not,even,melanie's,influence,could,repair,the,break,of,that,gossamer,thread
and,melanie,bewildered,broken,hearted,but,still,loyal,did,not,try,to,repair,it
even,had,scarlett,wanted,to,turn,back,to,old,ways,old,friends,there,was,no,turning,back,possible,now
the,face,of,the,town,was,set,against,her,as,stonily,as,granite
the,hate,that,enveloped,the,bullock,regime,enveloped,her,too,a,hate,that,had,little,fire,and,fury,in,it,but,much,cold,implacability
scarlett,had,cast,her,lot,with,the,enemy,and,whatever,her,birth,and,family,connections,she,was,now,in,the,category,of,a,turncoat,a,nigger,lover,a,traitor,a,republican,and,a,scallawag
after,a,miserable,while,scarlett's,pretended,indifference,gave,way,to,the,real,thing
she,had,never,been,one,to,worry,long,over,the,vagaries,of,human,conduct,or,to,be,cast,down,for,long,if,one,line,of,action,failed
soon,she,did,not,care,what,the,merriwethers,the,elsings,the,whitings,the,bonnells,the,meades,and,others,thought,of,her
at,least,melanie,called,bringing,ashley,and,ashley,was,the,one,who,mattered,the,most
and,there,were,other,people,in,atlanta,who,would,come,to,her,parties,other,people,far,more,congenial,than,those,hide-bound,old,hens
any,time,she,wanted,to,fill,her,house,with,guests,she,could,do,so,and,these,guests,would,be,far,more,entertaining,far,more,handsomely,dressed,than,those,prissy,strait-laced,old,fools,who,disapproved,of,her
these,people,were,newcomers,to,atlanta
some,of,them,were,acquaintances,of,rhett,some,associated,with,him,in,those,mysterious,affairs,which,he,referred,to,as,mere,business,my,pet
some,were,couples,scarlett,had,met,when,she,was,living,at,the,national,hotel,and,some,were,governor,bullock's,appointees
the,set,with,which,she,was,now,moving,was,a,motley,crew
among,them,were,the,gelerts,who,had,lived,in,a,dozen,different,states,and,who,apparently,had,left,each,one,hastily,upon,detection,of,their,swindling,schemes,the,conningtons,whose,connection,with,the,freedmen's,bureau,in,a,distant,state,had,been,highly,lucrative,at,the,expense,of,the,ignorant,blacks,they,were,supposed,to,protect,the,deals,who,had,sold,cardboard,shoes,to,the,confederate,government,until,it,became,necessary,for,them,to,spend,the,last,year,of,the,war,in,europe,the,hundons,who,had,police,records,in,many,cities,but,nevertheless,were,often,successful,bidders,on,state,contracts,the,carahans,who,had,gotten,their,start,in,a,gambling,house,and,now,were,gambling,for,bigger,stakes,in,the,building,of,nonexistent,railroads,with,the,state's,money,the,flahertys,who,had,bought,salt,at,one,cent,a,pound,in,1861,and,made,a,fortune,when,salt,went,to,fifty,cents,in,1863,and,the,barts,who,had,owned,the,largest,brothel,in,a,northern,metropolis,during,the,war,and,now,were,moving,in,the,best,circles,of,carpetbagger,society
such,people,were,scarlett's,intimates,now,but,those,who,attended,her,larger,receptions,included,others,of,some,culture,and,refinement,many,of,excellent,families
in,addition,to,the,carpetbag,gentry,substantial,people,from,the,north,were,moving,into,atlanta,attracted,by,the,never,ceasing,business,activity,of,the,town,in,this,period,of,rebuilding,and,expansion
yankee,families,of,wealth,sent,young,sons,to,the,south,to,pioneer,on,the,new,frontier,and,yankee,officers,after,their,discharge,took,up,permanent,residence,in,the,town,they,had,fought,so,hard,to,capture
at,first,strangers,in,a,strange,town,they,were,glad,to,accept,invitations,to,the,lavish,entertainments,of,the,wealthy,and,hospitable,mrs,butler,but,they,soon,drifted,out,of,her,set
they,were,good,people,and,they,needed,only,a,short,acquaintance,with,carpetbaggers,and,carpetbag,rule,to,become,as,resentful,of,them,as,the,native,georgians,were
many,became,democrats,and,more,southern,than,the,southerners
other,misfits,in,scarlett's,circle,remained,there,only,because,they,were,not,welcome,elsewhere
they,would,have,much,preferred,the,quiet,parlors,of,the,old,guard,but,the,old,guard,would,have,none,of,them
among,these,were,the,yankee,schoolmarms,who,had,come,south,imbued,with,the,desire,to,uplift,the,negro,and,the,scallawags,who,had,been,born,good,democrats,but,had,turned,republican,after,the,surrender
it,was,hard,to,say,which,class,was,more,cordially,hated,by,the,settled,citizenry,the,impractical,yankee,schoolmarms,or,the,scallawags,but,the,balance,probably,fell,with,the,latter
the,schoolmarms,could,be,dismissed,with,well,what,can,you,expect,of,nigger-loving,yankees
of,course,they,think,the,nigger,is,just,as,good,as,they,are
but,for,those,georgians,who,had,turned,republican,for,personal,gain,there,was,no,excuse
starving,is,good,enough,for,us
it,ought,to,be,good,enough,for,you,was,the,way,the,old,guard,felt
many,ex-confederate,soldiers,knowing,the,frantic,fear,of,men,who,saw,their,families,in,want,were,more,tolerant,of,former,comrades,who,had,changed,political,colors,in,order,that,their,families,might,eat
but,not,the,women,of,the,old,guard,and,the,women,were,the,implacable,and,inflexible,power,behind,the,social,throne
the,lost,cause,was,stronger,dearer,now,in,their,hearts,than,it,had,ever,been,at,the,height,of,its,glory
it,was,a,fetish,now
everything,about,it,was,sacred,the,graves,of,the,men,who,had,died,for,it,the,battle,fields,the,torn,flags,the,crossed,sabres,in,their,halls,the,fading,letters,from,the,front,the,veterans
these,women,gave,no,aid,comfort,or,quarter,to,the,late,enemy,and,now,scarlett,was,numbered,among,the,enemy
in,this,mongrel,society,thrown,together,by,the,exigencies,of,the,political,situation,there,was,but,one,thing,in,common
that,was,money
as,most,of,them,had,never,had,twenty-five,dollars,at,one,time,in,their,whole,lives,previous,to,the,war,they,were,now,embarked,on,an,orgy,of,spending,such,as,atlanta,had,never,seen,before
with,the,republicans,in,the,political,saddle,the,town,entered,into,an,era,of,waste,and,ostentation,with,the,trappings,of,refinement,thinly,veneering,the,vice,and,vulgarity,beneath
never,before,had,the,cleavage,of,the,very,rich,and,the,very,poor,been,so,marked
those,on,top,took,no,thought,for,those,less,fortunate
except,for,the,negroes,of,course
they,must,have,the,very,best
the,best,of,schools,and,lodgings,and,clothes,and,amusements,for,they,were,the,power,in,politics,and,every,negro,vote,counted
but,as,for,the,recently,impoverished,atlanta,people,they,could,starve,and,drop,in,the,streets,for,all,the,newly,rich,republicans,cared
on,the,crest,of,this,wave,of,vulgarity,scarlett,rode,triumphantly,newly,a,bride,dashingly,pretty,in,her,fine,clothes,with,rhett's,money,solidly,behind,her
it,was,an,era,that,suited,her,crude,garish,showy,full,of,over-dressed,women,over-furnished,houses,too,many,jewels,too,many,horses,too,much,food,too,much,whisky
when,scarlett,infrequently,stopped,to,think,about,the,matter,she,knew,that,none,of,her,new,associates,could,be,called,ladies,by,ellen's,strict,standards
but,she,had,broken,with,ellen's,standards,too,many,times,since,that,far-away,day,when,she,stood,in,the,parlor,at,tara,and,decided,to,be,rhett's,mistress,and,she,did,not,often,feel,the,bite,of,conscience,now
perhaps,these,new,friends,were,not,strictly,speaking,ladies,and,gentlemen,but,like,rhett's,new,orleans,friends,they,were,so,much,fun
so,very,much,more,fun,than,the,subdued,churchgoing,shakespeare-reading,friends,of,her,earlier,atlanta,days
and,except,for,her,brief,honeymoon,interlude,she,had,not,had,fun,in,so,long
nor,had,she,had,any,sense,of,security
now,secure,she,wanted,to,dance,to,play,to,riot,to,gorge,on,foods,and,fine,wine,to,deck,herself,in,silks,and,satins,to,wallow,on,soft,feather,beds,and,fine,upholstery
and,she,did,all,these,things
encouraged,by,rhett's,amused,tolerance,freed,now,from,the,restraints,of,her,childhood,freed,even,from,that,last,fear,of,poverty,she,was,permitting,herself,the,luxury,she,had,often,dreamed,of,doing,exactly,what,she,pleased,and,telling,people,who,didn't,like,it,to,go,to,hell
to,her,had,come,that,pleasant,intoxication,peculiar,to,those,whose,lives,are,a,deliberate,slap,in,the,face,of,organized,society,the,gambler,the,confidence,man,the,polite,adventuress,all,those,who,succeed,by,their,wits
she,said,and,did,exactly,what,she,pleased,and,in,practically,no,time,her,insolence,knew,no,bounds
she,did,not,hesitate,to,display,arrogance,to,her,new,republican,and,scallawag,friends,but,to,no,class,was,she,ruder,or,more,insolent,than,the,yankee,officers,of,the,garrison,and,their,families
of,all,the,heterogeneous,mass,of,people,who,had,poured,into,atlanta,the,army,people,alone,she,refused,to,receive,or,tolerate
she,even,went,out,of,her,way,to,be,bad,mannered,to,them
melanie,was,not,alone,in,being,unable,to,forget,what,a,blue,uniform,meant
to,scarlett,that,uniform,and,those,gold,buttons,would,always,mean,the,fears,of,the,siege,the,terror,of,flight,the,looting,and,burning,the,desperate,poverty,and,the,grinding,work,at,tara
now,that,she,was,rich,and,secure,in,the,friendship,of,the,governor,and,many,prominent,republicans,she,could,be,insulting,to,every,blue,uniform,she,saw
and,she,was,insulting
rhett,once,lazily,pointed,out,to,her,that,most,of,the,male,guests,who,assembled,under,their,roof,had,worn,that,same,blue,uniform,not,so,long,ago,but,she,retorted,that,a,yankee,didn't,seem,like,a,yankee,unless,he,had,on,a,blue,uniform
to,which,rhett,replied,consistency,thou,art,a,jewel,and,shrugged
scarlett,hating,the,bright,hard,blue,they,wore,enjoyed,snubbing,them,all,the,more,because,it,so,bewildered,them
the,garrison,families,had,a,right,to,be,bewildered,for,most,of,them,were,quiet,well-bred,folk,lonely,in,a,hostile,land,anxious,to,go,home,to,the,north,a,little,ashamed,of,the,riffraff,whose,rule,they,were,forced,to,uphold,an,infinitely,better,class,than,that,of,scarlett's,associates
naturally,the,officers',wives,were,puzzled,that,the,dashing,mrs,butler,took,to,her,bosom,such,women,as,the,common,red-,haired,bridget,flaherty,and,went,out,of,her,way,to,slight,them
but,even,the,ladies,whom,scarlett,took,to,her,bosom,had,to,endure,much,from,her
however,they,did,it,gladly
to,them,she,not,only,represented,wealth,and,elegance,but,the,old,regime,with,its,old,names,old,families,old,traditions,with,which,they,wished,ardently,to,identify,themselves
the,old,families,they,yearned,after,might,have,cast,scarlett,out,but,the,ladies,of,the,new,aristocracy,did,not,know,it
they,only,knew,that,scarlett's,father,had,been,a,great,slave,owner,her,mother,a,robillard,of,savannah,and,her,husband,was,rhett,butler,of,charleston
and,this,was,enough,for,them
she,was,their,opening,wedge,into,the,old,society,they,wished,to,enter,the,society,which,scorned,them,would,not,return,calls,and,bowed,frigidly,in,churches
in,fact,she,was,more,than,their,wedge,into,society
to,them,fresh,from,obscure,beginnings,she,was,society
pinchbeck,ladies,themselves,they,no,more,saw,through,scarlett's,pinchbeck,pretensions,than,she,herself,did
they,took,her,at,her,own,valuation,and,endured,much,at,her,hands,her,airs,her,graces,her,tempers,her,arrogance,her,downright,rudeness,and,her,frankness,about,their,shortcomings
they,were,so,lately,come,from,nothing,and,so,uncertain,of,themselves,they,were,doubly,anxious,to,appear,refined,and,feared,to,show,their,temper,or,make,retorts,in,kind,lest,they,be,considered,unladylike
at,all,costs,they,must,be,ladies
they,pretended,to,great,delicacy,modesty,and,innocence
to,hear,them,talk,one,would,have,thought,they,had,no,legs,natural,functions,or,knowledge,of,the,wicked,world
no,one,would,have,thought,that,red-haired,bridget,flaherty,who,had,a,sun-defying,white,skin,and,a,brogue,that,could,be,cut,with,a,butter,knife,had,stolen,her,father's,hidden,hoard,to,come,to,america,to,be,chambermaid,in,a,new,york,hotel
and,to,observe,the,delicate,vapors,of,sylvia,formerly,sadie,belle,connington,and,mamie,bart,no,one,would,have,suspected,that,the,first,grew,up,above,her,father's,saloon,in,the,bowery,and,waited,on,the,bar,at,rush,times,and,that,the,latter,so,it,was,said,had,come,out,of,one,of,her,husband's,own,brothels
no,they,were,delicate,sheltered,creatures,now
the,men,though,they,had,made,money,learned,new,ways,less,easily,or,were,perhaps,less,patient,with,the,demands,of,the,new,gentility
they,drank,heavily,at,scarlett's,parties,far,too,heavily,and,usually,after,a,reception,there,were,one,or,more,unexpected,guests,who,stayed,the,night
they,did,not,drink,like,the,men,of,scarlett's,girlhood
they,became,sodden,stupid,ugly,or,obscene
moreover,no,matter,how,many,spittoons,she,might,put,out,in,view,the,rugs,always,showed,signs,of,tobacco,juice,on,the,mornings,after
she,had,a,contempt,for,these,people,but,she,enjoyed,them
because,she,enjoyed,them,she,filled,the,house,with,them
and,because,of,her,contempt,she,told,them,to,go,to,hell,as,often,as,they,annoyed,her
but,they,stood,it
they,even,stood,rhett,a,more,difficult,matter,for,rhett,saw,through,them,and,they,knew,it
he,had,no,hesitation,about,stripping,them,verbally,even,under,his,own,roof,always,in,a,manner,that,left,them,no,reply
unashamed,of,how,he,came,by,his,fortune,he,pretended,that,they,too,were,unashamed,of,their,beginnings,and,he,seldom,missed,an,opportunity,to,remark,upon,matters,which,by,common,consent,everyone,felt,were,better,left,in,polite,obscurity
there,was,never,any,knowing,when,he,would,remark,affably,over,a,punch,cup,ralph,if,i'd,had,any,sense,i'd,have,made,my,money,selling,gold-mine,stocks,to,widows,and,orphans,like,you,instead,of,blockading
it's,so,much,safer
well,bill,i,see,you,have,a,new,span,of,horses
been,selling,a,few,thousand,more,bonds,for,nonexistent,railroads
good,work,boy
congratulations,amos,on,landing,that,state,contract
too,bad,you,had,to,grease,so,many,palms,to,get,it
the,ladies,felt,that,he,was,odiously,unendurably,vulgar
the,men,said,behind,his,back,that,he,was,a,swine,and,a,bastard
new,atlanta,liked,rhett,no,better,than,old,atlanta,had,done,and,he,made,as,little,attempt,to,conciliate,the,one,as,he,had,the,other
he,went,his,way,amused,contemptuous,impervious,to,the,opinions,of,those,about,him,so,courteous,that,his,courtesy,was,an,affront,in,itself
to,scarlett,he,was,still,an,enigma,but,an,enigma,about,which,she,no,longer,bothered,her,head
she,was,convinced,that,nothing,ever,pleased,him,or,ever,would,please,him,that,he,either,wanted,something,badly,and,didn't,have,it,or,never,had,wanted,anything,and,so,didn't,care,about,anything
he,laughed,at,everything,she,did,encouraged,her,extravagances,and,insolences,jeered,at,her,pretenses,and,paid,the,bills
chapter,l
rhett,never,deviated,from,his,smooth,imperturbable,manners,even,in,their,most,intimate,moments
but,scarlett,never,lost,the,old,feeling,that,he,was,watching,her,covertly,knew,that,if,she,turned,her,head,suddenly,she,would,surprise,in,his,eyes,that,speculative,waiting,look,that,look,of,almost,terrible,patience,that,she,did,not,understand
sometimes,he,was,a,very,comfortable,person,to,live,with,for,all,his,unfortunate,habit,of,not,permitting,anyone,in,his,presence,to,act,a,lie,palm,off,a,pretense,or,indulge,in,bombast
he,listened,to,her,talk,of,the,store,and,the,mills,and,the,saloon,the,convicts,and,the,cost,of,feeding,them,and,gave,shrewd,hard-headed,advice
he,had,untiring,energy,for,the,dancing,and,parties,she,loved,and,an,unending,supply,of,coarse,stories,with,which,he,regaled,her,on,their,infrequent,evenings,alone,when,the,table,was,cleared,and,brandy,and,coffee,before,them
she,found,that,he,would,give,her,anything,she,desired,answer,any,question,she,asked,as,long,as,she,was,forthright,and,refuse,her,anything,she,attempted,to,gain,by,indirection,hints,and,feminine,angling
he,had,a,disconcerting,habit,of,seeing,through,her,and,laughing,rudely
contemplating,the,suave,indifference,with,which,he,generally,treated,her,scarlett,frequently,wondered,but,with,no,real,curiosity,why,he,had,married,her
men,married,for,love,or,a,home,and,children,or,money,but,she,knew,he,had,married,her,for,none,of,these,things
he,certainly,did,not,love,her
he,referred,to,her,lovely,house,as,an,architectural,horror,and,said,he,would,rather,live,in,a,well-regulated,hotel,than,a,home
and,he,never,once,hinted,about,children,as,charles,and,frank,had,done
once,when,trying,to,coquet,with,him,she,asked,why,he,married,her,and,was,infuriated,when,he,replied,with,an,amused,gleam,in,his,eyes,i,married,you,to,keep,you,for,a,pet,my,dear
no,he,hadn't,married,her,for,any,of,the,usual,reasons,men,marry,women
he,had,married,her,solely,because,he,wanted,her,and,couldn't,get,her,any,other,way
he,had,admitted,as,much,the,night,he,proposed,to,her
he,had,wanted,her,just,as,he,had,wanted,belle,watling
this,was,not,a,pleasant,thought
in,fact,it,was,a,barefaced,insult
but,she,shrugged,it,off,as,she,had,learned,to,shrug,off,all,unpleasant,facts
they,had,made,a,bargain,and,she,was,quite,pleased,with,her,side,of,the,bargain
she,hoped,he,was,equally,pleased,but,she,did,not,care,very,much,whether,he,was,or,not
but,one,afternoon,when,she,was,consulting,dr,meade,about,a,digestive,upset,she,learned,an,unpleasant,fact,which,she,could,not,shrug,off
it,was,with,real,hate,in,her,eyes,that,she,stormed,into,her,bedroom,at,twilight,and,told,rhett,that,she,was,going,to,have,a,baby
he,was,lounging,in,a,silk,dressing,gown,in,a,cloud,of,smoke,and,his,eyes,went,sharply,to,her,face,as,she,spoke
but,he,said,nothing
he,watched,her,in,silence,but,there,was,a,tenseness,about,his,pose,as,he,waited,for,her,next,words,that,was,lost,on,her
indignation,and,despair,had,claimed,her,to,the,exclusion,of,all,other,thoughts
you,know,i,don't,want,any,more,children
i,never,wanted,any,at,all
every,time,things,are,going,right,with,me,i,have,to,have,a,baby
oh,don't,sit,there,and,laugh
you,don't,want,it,either
oh,mother,of,god
if,he,was,waiting,for,words,from,her,these,were,not,the,words,he,wanted
his,face,hardened,slightly,and,his,eyes,became,blank
well,why,not,give,it,to,miss,melly
didn't,you,tell,me,she,was,so,misguided,as,to,want,another,baby
oh,i,could,kill,you
i,won't,have,it,i,tell,you,i,won't

oh,there,are,things,to,do
i'm,not,the,stupid,country,fool,i,used,to,be
now,i,know,that,a,woman,doesn't,have,to,have,children,if,she,doesn't,want,them
there,are,things
he,was,on,his,feet,and,had,her,by,the,wrist,and,there,was,a,hard,driving,fear,in,his,face
scarlett,you,fool,tell,me,the,truth
you,haven't,done,anything
no,i,haven't,but,i'm,going,to
do,you,think,i'm,going,to,have,my,figure,ruined,all,over,again,just,when,i've,gotten,my,waist,line,down,and,am,having,a,good,time
where,did,you,get,this,idea
who's,been,telling,you,things
mamie,bart,she
the,madam,of,a,whore,house,would,know,such,tricks
that,woman,never,puts,foot,in,this,house,again,do,you,understand
after,all,it,is,my,house,and,i'm,the,master,of,it
i,do,not,even,want,you,to,speak,to,her,again
i'll,do,as,i,please
turn,me,loose
why,should,you,care
i,don't,care,whether,you,have,one,child,or,twenty,but,i,do,care,if,you,die
die

yes,die
i,don't,suppose,mamie,bart,told,you,the,chances,a,woman,takes,when,she,does,a,thing,like,that
no,said,scarlett,reluctantly
she,just,said,it,would,fix,things,up,fine
by,god,i,will,kill,her
cried,rhett,and,his,face,was,black,with,rage
he,looked,down,into,scarlett's,tear-stained,face,and,some,of,the,wrath,faded,but,it,was,still,hard,and,set
suddenly,he,picked,her,up,in,his,arms,and,sat,down,in,the,chair,holding,her,close,to,him,tightly,as,if,he,feared,she,would,get,away,from,him
listen,my,baby,i,won't,have,you,take,your,life,in,your,hands
do,you,hear
good,god,i,don't,want,children,any,more,than,you,do,but,i,can,support,them
i,don't,want,to,hear,any,more,foolishness,out,of,you,and,if,you,dare,try,to,scarlett,i,saw,a,girl,die,that,way,once
she,was,only,a,well,but,she,was,a,pretty,sort,at,that
it's,not,an,easy,way,to,die
i
why,rhett
she,cried,startled,out,of,her,misery,at,the,emotion,in,his,voice
she,had,never,seen,him,so,moved
where,who
in,new,orleans,oh,years,ago
i,was,young,and,impressionable
he,bent,his,head,suddenly,and,buried,his,lips,in,her,hair
you'll,have,your,baby,scarlett,if,i,have,to,handcuff,you,to,my,wrist,for,the,next,nine,months
she,sat,up,in,his,lap,and,stared,into,his,face,with,frank,curiosity
under,her,gaze,it,was,suddenly,smooth,and,bland,as,though,wiped,clear,by,magic
his,eyebrows,were,up,and,the,corner,of,his,mouth,was,down
do,i,mean,so,much,to,you
she,questioned,dropping,her,eyelids
he,gave,her,a,level,look,as,though,estimating,how,much,coquetry,was,behind,the,question
reading,the,true,meaning,of,her,demeanor,he,made,casual,answer
well,yes
you,see,i've,invested,a,good,deal,of,money,in,you,and,i'd,hate,to,lose,it
melanie,came,out,of,scarlett's,room,weary,from,the,strain,but,happy,to,tears,at,the,birth,of,scarlett's,daughter
rhett,stood,tensely,in,the,hall,surrounded,by,cigar,butts,which,had,burned,holes,in,the,fine,carpet
you,can,go,in,now,captain,butler,she,said,shyly
rhett,went,swiftly,past,her,into,the,room,and,melanie,had,a,brief,glimpse,of,him,bending,over,the,small,naked,baby,in,mammy's,lap,before,dr,meade,shut,the,door
melanie,sank,into,a,chair,her,face,pinkening,with,embarrassment,that,she,had,unintentionally,witnessed,so,intimate,a,scene
ah
she,thought
how,sweet
how,worried,poor,captain,butler,has,been
and,he,did,not,take,a,single,drink,all,this,time
how,nice,of,him
so,many,gentlemen,are,so,intoxicated,by,the,time,their,babies,are,born
i,fear,he,needs,a,drink,badly
dare,i,suggest,it
no,that,would,be,very,forward,of,me
she,sank,gratefully,into,a,chair,her,back,which,always,ached,these,days,feeling,as,though,it,would,break,in,two,at,the,waist,line
oh,how,fortunate,scarlett,was,to,have,captain,butler,just,outside,her,door,while,the,baby,was,being,born
if,only,she,had,had,ashley,with,her,that,dreadful,day,beau,came,she,would,not,have,suffered,half,so,much
if,only,that,small,girl,behind,those,closed,doors,were,hers,and,not,scarlett's
oh,how,wicked,i,am,she,thought,guiltily
i,am,coveting,her,baby,and,scarlett,has,been,so,good,to,me
forgive,me,lord
i,wouldn't,really,want,scarlett's,baby,but,but,i,would,so,like,a,baby,of,my,own
she,pushed,a,small,cushion,behind,her,aching,back,and,thought,hungrily,of,a,daughter,of,her,own
but,dr,meade,had,never,changed,his,opinion,on,that,subject
and,though,she,was,quite,willing,to,risk,her,life,for,another,child,ashley,would,not,hear,of,it
a,daughter
how,ashley,would,love,a,daughter
a,daughter
mercy
she,sat,up,in,alarm
i,never,told,captain,butler,it,was,a,girl
and,of,course,he,was,expecting,a,boy
oh,how,dreadful
melanie,knew,that,to,a,woman,a,child,of,either,sex,was,equally,welcome,but,to,a,man,and,especially,such,a,self-willed,man,as,captain,butler,a,girl,would,be,a,blow,a,reflection,upon,his,manhood
oh,how,thankful,she,was,that,god,had,permitted,her,only,child,to,be,a,boy
she,knew,that,had,she,been,the,wife,of,the,fearsome,captain,butler,she,would,have,thankfully,died,in,childbirth,rather,than,present,him,with,a,daughter,as,his,first-,born
but,mammy,waddling,grinning,from,the,room,set,her,mind,at,ease,and,at,the,same,time,made,her,wonder,just,what,kind,of,man,captain,butler,really,was

the,happiest,days,are,the,days,when,babies,come
to,one,person,in,the,house,it,was,not,a,happy,day
scolded,and,for,the,most,part,ignored,wade,hampton,idled,miserably,about,the,dining,room
early,that,morning,mammy,had,waked,him,abruptly,dressed,him,hurriedly,and,sent,him,with,ella,to,aunt,pitty's,house,for,breakfast
the,only,explanation,he,received,was,that,his,mother,was,sick,and,the,noise,of,his,playing,might,upset,her
aunt,pitty's,house,was,in,an,uproar,for,the,news,of,scarlett's,sickness,had,sent,the,old,lady,to,bed,in,a,state,with,cookie,in,attendance,and,breakfast,was,a,scant,meal,that,peter,concocted,for,the,children
as,the,morning,wore,on,fear,began,to,possess,wade's,soul
suppose,mother,died
other,boys',mothers,had,died
he,had,seen,the,hearses,move,away,from,the,house,and,heard,his,small,friends,sobbing
suppose,mother,should,die
wade,loved,his,mother,very,much,almost,as,much,as,he,feared,her,and,the,thought,of,her,being,carried,away,in,a,black,hearse,behind,black,horses,with,plumes,on,their,bridles,made,his,small,chest,ache,so,that,he,could,hardly,breathe
when,noon,came,and,peter,was,busy,in,the,kitchen,wade,slipped,out,the,front,door,and,hurried,home,as,fast,as,his,short,legs,could,carry,him,fear,speeding,him
uncle,rhett,or,aunt,melly,or,mammy,surely,would,tell,him,the,truth
but,uncle,rhett,and,aunt,melly,were,not,to,be,seen,and,mammy,and,dilcey,sped,up,and,down,the,back,stairs,with,towels,and,basins,of,hot,water,and,did,not,once,notice,him,in,the,front,hall
from,upstairs,he,could,hear,occasionally,the,curt,tones,of,dr,meade,whenever,a,door,opened
once,he,heard,his,mother,groan,and,he,burst,into,sobbing,hiccoughs
he,knew,she,was,going,to,die
for,comfort,he,made,overtures,to,the,honey-,colored,cat,which,lay,on,the,sunny,window,sill,in,the,front,hall
but,tom,full,of,years,and,irritable,at,disturbances,switched,his,tail,and,spat,softly
finally,mammy,coming,down,the,front,stairs,her,apron,rumpled,and,spotted,her,head,rag,awry,saw,him,and,scowled
mammy,had,always,been,wade's,mainstay,and,her,frown,made,him,tremble

the,remark,about,the,troublesomeness,of,boys,stung,for,he,had,always,tried,his,best,to,be,good
aunt,melly,hurried,down,the,stairs,half,an,hour,later,pale,and,tired,but,smiling,to,herself
she,looked,thunderstruck,when,she,saw,his,woebegone,face,in,the,shadows,of,the,drapery
usually,aunt,melly,had,all,the,time,in,the,world,to,give,him
she,never,said,as,mother,so,often,did,don't,bother,me,now
i'm,in,a,hurry,or,run,away,wade

now,run,out,and,play,and,don't,make,any,noise
wade,slipped,into,the,quiet,dining,room,his,small,and,insecure,world,tottering
was,there,no,place,for,a,worried,little,seven-,year-old,boy,on,this,sunshiny,day,when,the,grown-ups,acted,so,curiously
he,sat,down,on,the,window,still,in,the,alcove,and,nibbled,a,bit,of,the,elephant's,ear,which,grew,in,a,box,in,the,sun
it,was,so,peppery,that,it,stung,his,eyes,to,tears,and,he,began,to,cry
mother,was,probably,dying,nobody,paid,him,any,heed,and,one,and,all,they,rushed,about,because,of,a,new,baby,a,girl,baby
wade,had,little,interest,in,babies,still,less,in,girls
the,only,little,girl,he,knew,intimately,was,ella,and,so,far,she,had,done,nothing,to,command,his,respect,or,liking
after,a,long,interval,dr,meade,and,uncle,rhett,came,down,the,stairs,and,stood,talking,in,the,hall,in,low,voices
after,the,door,shut,behind,the,doctor,uncle,rhett,came,swiftly,into,the,dining,room,and,poured,himself,a,large,drink,from,the,decanter,before,he,saw,wade
wade,shrank,back,expecting,to,be,told,again,that,he,was,naughty,and,must,return,to,aunt,pitty's,but,instead,uncle,rhett,smiled
wade,had,never,seen,him,smile,like,that,or,look,so,happy,and,encouraged,he,leaped,from,the,sill,and,ran,to,him
you've,got,a,sister,said,rhett,squeezing,him
by,god,the,most,beautiful,baby,you,ever,saw
now,why,are,you,crying
mother
your,mother's,eating,a,great,big,dinner,chicken,and,rice,and,gravy,and,coffee,and,we're,going,to,make,her,some,ice,cream,in,a,little,while,and,you,can,have,two,plates,if,you,want,them
and,i'll,show,you,your,sister,too
weak,with,relief,wade,tried,to,be,polite,about,his,new,sister,but,failed
everyone,was,interested,in,this,girl
no,one,cared,anything,about,him,any,more,not,even,aunt,melly,or,uncle,rhett
uncle,rhett,he,began,do,people,like,girls,better,than,boys
rhett,set,down,his,glass,and,looked,sharply,into,the,small,face,and,instant,comprehension,came,into,his,eyes
no,i,can't,say,they,do,he,answered,seriously,as,though,giving,the,matter,due,thought
it's,just,that,girls,are,more,trouble,than,boys,and,people,are,apt,to,worry,more,about,troublesome,people,than,those,who,aren't
mammy,just,said,boys,were,troublesome
well,mammy,was,upset
she,didn't,mean,it
uncle,rhett,wouldn't,you,rather,have,had,a,little,boy,than,a,little,girl
questioned,wade,hopefully
no,answered,rhett,swiftly,and,seeing,the,boy's,face,fall,he,continued,now,why,should,i,want,a,boy,when,i've,already,got,one
you,have
cried,wade,his,mouth,falling,open,at,this,information
where,is,he
right,here,answered,rhett,and,picking,the,child,up,drew,him,to,his,knee
you,are,boy,enough,for,me,son
for,a,moment,the,security,and,happiness,of,being,wanted,was,so,great,that,wade,almost,cried,again
his,throat,worked,and,he,ducked,his,head,against,rhett's,waistcoat
you,are,my,boy,aren't,you
can,you,be,well,two,men's,boy
questioned,wade,loyalty,to,the,father,he,had,never,known,struggling,with,love,for,the,man,who,held,him,so,understandingly
yes,said,rhett,firmly
just,like,you,can,be,your,mother's,boy,and,aunt,melly's,too
wade,digested,this,statement
it,made,sense,to,him,and,he,smiled,and,wriggled,against,rhett's,arm,shyly
you,understand,little,boys,don't,you,uncle,rhett
rhett's,dark,face,fell,into,its,old,harsh,lines,and,his,lip,twisted
yes,he,said,bitterly,i,understand,little,boys
for,a,moment,fear,came,back,to,wade,fear,and,a,sudden,sense,of,jealousy
uncle,rhett,was,not,thinking,of,him,but,of,some,one,else
you,haven't,got,any,other,little,boys,have,you
rhett,set,him,on,his,feet
i'm,going,to,have,a,drink,and,so,are,you,wade,your,first,drink,a,toast,to,your,new,sister
you,haven't,got,any,other,began,wade,and,then,seeing,rhett,reach,for,the,decanter,of,claret,the,excitement,at,being,included,in,this,grown-up,ceremony,diverted,him
oh,i,can't,uncle,rhett
i,promised,aunt,melly,i,wouldn't,drink,till,i,graduated,from,the,university,and,she's,going,to,give,me,a,watch,if,i,don't
and,i'll,give,you,a,chain,for,it,this,one,i'm,wearing,now,if,you,want,it,said,rhett,and,he,was,smiling,again
aunt,melly's,quite,right
but,she,was,talking,about,spirits,not,wine
you,must,learn,to,drink,wine,like,a,gentleman,son,and,there's,no,time,like,the,present,to,learn
skillfully,he,diluted,the,claret,with,water,from,the,carafe,until,the,liquid,was,barely,pink,and,handed,the,glass,to,wade
at,that,moment,mammy,entered,the,dining,room
she,had,changed,to,her,best,sunday,black,and,her,apron,and,head,rag,were,fresh,and,crisp
as,she,waddled,she,switched,herself,and,from,her,skirts,came,the,whisper,and,rustle,of,silk
the,worried,look,had,gone,from,her,face,and,her,almost,toothless,gums,showed,in,a,wide,smile
burfday,gif',mist',rhett
she,said
wade,stopped,with,his,glass,at,his,lips
he,knew,mammy,had,never,liked,his,stepfather
he,had,never,heard,her,call,him,anything,except,cap'n,butler,and,her,conduct,toward,him,had,been,dignified,but,cold
and,here,she,was,beaming,and,sidling,and,calling,him,mist',rhett
what,a,topsy-turvy,day
you'd,rather,have,rum,than,claret,i,suppose,said,rhett,reaching,into,the,cellaret,and,producing,a,squat,bottle
she,is,a,beautiful,baby,isn't,she,mammy
she,sho,is,answered,mammy,smacking,her,lips,as,she,took,the,glass
did,you,ever,see,a,prettier,one
well,suh,miss,scarlett,wuz,mout,nigh,as,pretty,w'en,she,come,but,not,quite
have,another,glass,mammy
and,mammy,his,tone,was,stern,but,his,eyes,twinkled,what's,that,rustling,noise,i,hear
lawd,mist',rhett,dat,ain',nuthin',but,mah,red,silk,petticoat
mammy,giggled,and,switched,till,her,huge,bulk,shook
nothing,but,your,petticoat
i,don't,believe,it
you,sound,like,a,peck,of,dried,leaves,rubbing,together
let,me,see
pull,up,your,skirt
mist',rhett,you,is,bad
yeah-o,lawd
mammy,gave,a,little,shriek,and,retreated,and,from,a,distance,of,a,yard,modestly,elevated,her,dress,a,few,inches,and,showed,the,ruffle,of,a,red,taffeta,petticoat
you,took,long,enough,about,wearing,it,grumbled,rhett,but,his,black,eyes,laughed,and,danced
yassuh,too,long
then,rhett,said,something,that,wade,did,not,understand
no,more,mule,in,horse,harness
mist',rhett,miss,scarlett,wuz,bad,ter,tell,you,dat
you,ain',holin',dat,again',dis,ole,nigger
no
i'm,not,holding,it
i,just,wanted,to,know
have,another,drink,mammy
have,the,whole,bottle
drink,up,wade
give,us,a,toast
to,sissy,cried,wade,and,gulped,the,liquid,down
choking,he,began,to,cough,and,hiccough,and,the,other,two,laughed,and,beat,him,on,the,back
from,the,moment,his,daughter,was,born,rhett's,conduct,was,puzzling,to,all,observers,and,he,upset,many,settled,notions,about,himself,notions,which,both,the,town,and,scarlett,were,loath,to,surrender
whoever,would,have,thought,that,he,of,all,people,would,be,so,shamelessly,so,openly,proud,of,fatherhood
especially,in,view,of,the,embarrassing,circumstance,that,his,first-born,was,a,girl,and,not,a,boy
the,novelty,of,fatherhood,did,not,wear,off
this,caused,some,secret,envy,among,women,whose,husbands,took,offspring,for,granted,long,before,the,children,were,christened
he,buttonholed,people,on,the,street,and,related,details,of,his,child's,miraculous,progress,without,even,prefacing,his,remarks,with,the,hypocritical,but,polite,i,know,everyone,thinks,their,own,child,is,smart,but,he,thought,his,daughter,marvelous,not,to,be,compared,with,lesser,brats,and,he,did,not,care,who,knew,it
when,the,new,nurse,permitted,the,baby,to,suck,a,bit,of,fat,pork,thereby,bringing,on,the,first,attack,of,colic,rhett's,conduct,sent,seasoned,fathers,and,mothers,into,gales,of,laughter
he,hurriedly,summoned,dr,meade,and,two,other,doctors,and,with,difficulty,he,was,restrained,from,beating,the,unfortunate,nurse,with,his,crop
the,nurse,was,discharged,and,thereafter,followed,a,series,of,nurses,who,remained,at,the,most,a,week
none,of,them,was,good,enough,to,satisfy,the,exacting,requirements,rhett,laid,down
mammy,likewise,viewed,with,displeasure,the,nurses,that,came,and,went,for,she,was,jealous,of,any,strange,negro,and,saw,no,reason,why,she,could,not,care,for,the,baby,and,wade,and,ella,too
but,mammy,was,showing,her,age,and,rheumatism,was,slowing,her,lumbering,tread
rhett,lacked,the,courage,to,cite,these,reasons,for,employing,another,nurse
he,told,her,instead,that,a,man,of,his,position,could,not,afford,to,have,only,one,nurse
it,did,not,look,well
he,would,hire,two,others,to,do,the,drudgery,and,leave,her,as,mammy-in-chief
this,mammy,understood,very,well
more,servants,were,a,credit,to,her,position,as,well,as,rhett's
but,she,would,not,she,told,him,firmly,have,any,trashy,free,issue,niggers,in,her,nursery
so,rhett,sent,to,tara,for,prissy
he,knew,her,shortcomings,but,after,all,she,was,a,family,darky
and,uncle,peter,produced,a,great-niece,named,lou,who,had,belonged,to,one,of,miss,pitty's,burr,cousins
even,before,scarlett,was,able,to,be,about,again,she,noticed,rhett's,pre-occupation,with,the,baby,and,was,somewhat,nettled,and,embarrassed,at,his,pride,in,her,in,front,of,callers
it,was,all,very,well,for,a,man,to,love,his,child,but,she,felt,there,was,something,unmanly,in,the,display,of,such,love
he,should,be,offhand,and,careless,as,other,men,were
you,are,making,a,fool,of,yourself,she,said,irritably,and,i,don't,see,why
no
well,you,wouldn't
the,reason,is,that,she's,the,first,person,who's,ever,belonged,utterly,to,me
she,belongs,to,me,too
no,you,have,two,other,children
she's,mine
great,balls,of,fire
said,scarlett
i,had,the,baby,didn't,i
besides,honey,i,belong,to,you
rhett,looked,at,her,over,the,black,head,of,the,child,and,smiled,oddly
do,you,my,dear
only,the,entrance,of,melanie,stopped,one,of,those,swift,hot,quarrels,which,seemed,to,spring,up,so,easily,between,them,these,days
scarlett,swallowed,her,wrath,and,watched,melanie,take,the,baby
the,name,agreed,upon,for,the,child,was,eugenie,victoria,but,that,afternoon,melanie,unwittingly,bestowed,a,name,that,clung,even,as,pittypat,had,blotted,out,all,memory,of,sarah,jane
rhett,leaning,over,the,child,had,said,her,eyes,are,going,to,be,pea,green
indeed,they,are,not,cried,melanie,indignantly,forgetting,that,scarlett's,eyes,were,almost,that,shade
they,are,going,to,be,blue,like,mr,o'hara's,eyes,as,blue,as,as,blue,as,the,bonnie,blue,flag
bonnie,blue,butler,laughed,rhett,taking,the,child,from,her,and,peering,more,closely,into,the,small,eyes
and,bonnie,she,became,until,even,her,parents,did,not,recall,that,she,had,been,named,for,two,queens
chapter,li
when,she,was,finally,able,to,go,out,again,scarlett,had,lou,lace,her,into,stays,as,tightly,as,the,strings,would,pull
then,she,passed,the,tape,measure,about,her,waist
twenty,inches
she,groaned,aloud
that,was,what,having,babies,did,to,your,figure
her,waist,was,a,large,as,aunt,pitty's,as,large,as,mammy's
pull,them,tighter,lou
see,if,you,can't,make,it,eighteen,and,a,half,inches,or,i,can't,get,into,any,of,my,dresses
it'll,bust,de,strings,said,lou
yo',wais',jes',done,got,bigger,miss,scarlett,an',dar,ain',nuthin',ter,do,'bout,it
there,is,something,to,do,about,it,thought,scarlett,as,she,ripped,savagely,at,the,seams,of,her,dress,to,let,out,the,necessary,inches
i,just,won't,have,any,more,babies
of,course,bonnie,was,pretty,and,a,credit,to,her,and,rhett,adored,the,child,but,she,would,not,have,another,baby
just,how,she,would,manage,this,she,did,not,know,for,she,couldn't,handle,rhett,as,she,had,frank
rhett,wasn't,afraid,of,her
it,would,probably,be,difficult,with,rhett,acting,so,foolishly,about,bonnie,and,probably,wanting,a,son,next,year,for,all,that,he,said,he'd,drown,any,boy,she,gave,him
well,she,wouldn't,give,him,a,boy,or,girl,either
three,children,were,enough,for,any,woman,to,have
when,lou,had,stitched,up,the,ripped,seams,pressed,them,smooth,and,buttoned,scarlett,into,the,dress,she,called,the,carriage,and,scarlett,set,out,for,the,lumber,yard
her,spirits,rose,as,she,went,and,she,forgot,about,her,waist,line,for,she,was,going,to,meet,ashley,at,the,yard,to,go,over,the,books,with,him
and,if,she,was,lucky,she,might,see,him,alone
she,hadn't,seen,him,since,long,before,bonnie,was,born
she,hadn't,wanted,to,see,him,at,all,when,she,was,so,obviously,pregnant
and,she,had,missed,the,daily,contact,with,him,even,if,there,was,always,someone,around
she,had,missed,the,importance,and,activity,of,her,lumber,business,while,she,was,immured
of,course,she,did,not,have,to,work,now
she,could,easily,sell,the,mills,and,invest,the,money,for,wade,and,ella
but,that,would,mean,she,would,hardly,ever,see,ashley,except,in,a,formal,social,way,with,crowds,of,people,around
and,working,by,ashley's,side,was,her,greatest,pleasure
when,she,drove,up,to,the,yard,she,saw,with,interest,how,high,the,piles,of,lumber,were,and,how,many,customers,were,standing,among,them,talking,to,hugh,elsing
and,there,were,six,mule,teams,and,wagons,being,loaded,by,the,negro,drivers
six,teams,she,thought,with,pride
and,i,did,all,this,by,myself
ashley,came,to,the,door,of,the,little,office,his,eyes,joyful,with,the,pleasure,of,seeing,her,again,and,he,handed,her,out,of,her,carriage,and,into,the,office,as,if,she,were,a,queen
but,some,of,her,pleasure,was,dimmed,when,she,went,over,the,books,of,his,mill,and,compared,them,with,johnnie,gallegher's,books
ashley,had,barely,made,expenses,and,johnnie,had,a,remarkable,sum,to,his,credit
she,forbore,to,say,anything,as,she,looked,at,the,two,sheets,but,ashley,read,her,face
scarlett,i'm,sorry
all,i,can,say,is,that,i,wish,you'd,let,me,hire,free,darkies,instead,of,using,convicts
i,believe,i,could,do,better
darkies
why,their,pay,would,break,us
convicts,are,dirt,cheap
if,johnnie,can,make,this,much,with,them
ashley's,eyes,went,over,her,shoulder,looking,at,something,she,could,not,see,and,the,glad,light,went,out,of,his,eyes
i,can't,work,convicts,like,johnnie,gallegher
i,can't,drive,men
god's,nightgown
johnnie's,a,wonder,at,it
ashley,you,are,just,too,soft,hearted
you,ought,to,get,more,work,out,of,them
johnnie,told,me,that,any,time,a,malingerer,wanted,to,get,out,of,work,he,told,you,he,was,sick,and,you,gave,him,a,day,off
good,lord,ashley
that's,no,way,to,make,money
a,couple,of,licks,will,cure,most,any,sickness,short,of,a,broken,leg
scarlett
scarlett
stop
i,can't,bear,to,hear,you,talk,that,way,cried,ashley,his,eyes,coming,back,to,her,with,a,fierceness,that,stopped,her,short
don't,you,realize,that,they,are,men,some,of,them,sick,underfed,miserable,and,oh,my,dear,i,can't,bear,to,see,the,way,he,has,brutalized,you,you,who,were,always,so,sweet
who,has,whatted,me
i've,got,to,say,it,and,i,haven't,any,right
but,i've,got,to,say,it
your,rhett,butler
everything,he,touches,he,poisons
and,he,has,taken,you,who,were,so,sweet,and,generous,and,gentle,for,all,your,spirited,ways,and,he,has,done,this,to,you,hardened,you,brutalized,you,by,his,contact
oh,breathed,scarlett,guilt,struggling,with,joy,that,ashley,should,feel,so,deeply,about,her,should,still,think,her,sweet
thank,god,he,thought,rhett,to,blame,for,her,penny-pinching,ways
of,course,rhett,had,nothing,to,do,with,it,and,the,guilt,was,hers,but,after,all,another,black,mark,on,rhett,could,do,him,no,harm
if,it,were,any,other,man,in,the,world,i,wouldn't,care,so,much,but,rhett,butler
i've,seen,what,he's,done,to,you
without,your,realizing,it,he's,twisted,your,thoughts,into,the,same,hard,path,his,own,run,in
oh,yes,i,know,i,shouldn't,say,this,he,saved,my,life,and,i,am,grateful,but,i,wish,to,god,it,had,been,any,other,man,but,him
and,i,haven't,the,right,to,talk,to,you,like
oh,ashley,you,have,the,right,no,one,else,has
i,tell,you,i,can't,bear,it,seeing,your,fineness,coarsened,by,him,knowing,that,your,beauty,and,your,charm,are,in,the,keeping,of,a,man,who,when,i,think,of,him,touching,you,i
he's,going,to,kiss,me
thought,scarlett,ecstatically
and,it,won't,be,my,fault
she,swayed,toward,him
but,he,drew,back,suddenly,as,if,realizing,he,had,said,too,much,said,things,he,never,intended,to,say
i,apologize,most,humbly,scarlett
i,i've,been,insinuating,that,your,husband,is,not,a,gentleman,and,my,own,words,have,proved,that,i'm,not,one
no,one,has,a,right,to,criticize,a,husband,to,a,wife
i,haven't,any,excuse,except,except,he,faltered,and,his,face,twisted
she,waited,breathless
i,haven't,any,excuse,at,all
all,the,way,home,in,the,carriage,scarlett's,mind,raced
no,excuse,at,all,except,except,that,he,loved,her
and,the,thought,of,her,lying,in,rhett's,arms,roused,a,fury,in,him,that,she,did,not,think,possible
well,she,could,understand,that
if,it,wasn't,for,the,knowledge,that,his,relations,with,melanie,were,necessarily,those,of,brother,and,sister,her,own,life,would,be,a,torment
and,rhett's,embraces,coarsened,her,brutalized,her
well,if,ashley,thought,that,she,could,do,very,well,without,those,embraces
she,thought,how,sweet,and,romantic,it,would,be,for,them,both,to,be,physically,true,to,each,other,even,though,married,to,other,people
the,idea,possessed,her,imagination,and,she,took,pleasure,in,it
and,then,too,there,was,the,practical,side,of,it
it,would,mean,that,she,would,not,have,to,have,any,more,children
when,she,reached,home,and,dismissed,the,carriage,some,of,the,exaltation,which,had,filled,her,at,ashley's,words,began,to,fade,as,she,faced,the,prospect,of,telling,rhett,that,she,wanted,separate,bedrooms,and,all,which,that,implied
it,would,be,difficult
moreover,how,could,she,tell,ashley,that,she,had,denied,herself,to,rhett,because,of,his,wishes
what,earthly,good,was,a,sacrifice,if,no,one,knew,about,it
what,a,burden,modesty,and,delicacy,were
if,she,could,only,talk,to,ashley,as,frankly,as,she,could,to,rhett
well,no,matter
she'd,insinuate,the,truth,to,ashley,somehow
she,went,up,the,stairs,and,opening,the,nursery,door,found,rhett,sitting,beside,bonnie's,crib,with,ella,upon,his,lap,and,wade,displaying,the,contents,of,his,pocket,to,him
what,a,blessing,rhett,liked,children,and,made,much,of,them
some,stepfathers,were,so,bitter,about,children,of,former,marriages
i,want,to,talk,to,you,she,said,and,passed,on,into,their,bedroom
better,have,this,over,now,while,her,determination,not,to,have,any,more,children,was,hot,within,her,and,while,ashley's,love,was,giving,her,strength
rhett,she,said,abruptly,when,he,had,closed,the,bedroom,door,behind,him,i've,decided,that,i,don't,want,any,more,children
if,he,was,startled,at,her,unexpected,statement,he,did,not,show,it
he,lounged,to,a,chair,and,sitting,down,tilted,it,back
my,pet,as,i,told,you,before,bonnie,was,born,it,is,immaterial,to,me,whether,you,have,one,child,or,twenty
how,perverse,of,him,to,evade,the,issue,so,neatly,as,if,not,caring,whether,children,came,had,anything,to,do,with,their,actual,arrival
i,think,three,are,enough
i,don't,intend,to,have,one,every,year
three,seems,an,adequate,number
you,know,very,well,she,began,embarrassment,making,her,cheeks,red
you,know,what,i,mean
i,do
do,you,realize,that,i,can,divorce,you,for,refusing,me,my,marital,rights
you,are,just,low,enough,to,think,of,something,like,that,she,cried,annoyed,that,nothing,was,going,as,she,planned,it
if,you,had,any,chivalry,you'd,you'd,be,nice,like,well,look,at,ashley,wilkes
melanie,can't,have,any,children,and,he
quite,the,little,gentleman,ashley,said,rhett,and,his,eyes,began,to,gleam,oddly
pray,go,on,with,your,discourse
scarlett,choked,for,her,discourse,was,at,its,end,and,she,had,nothing,more,to,say
now,she,saw,how,foolish,had,been,her,hope,of,amicably,settling,so,important,a,matter,especially,with,a,selfish,swine,like,rhett
you've,been,to,the,lumber,office,this,afternoon,haven't,you
what,has,that,to,do,with,it
you,like,dogs,don't,you,scarlett
do,you,prefer,them,in,kennels,or,mangers
the,allusion,was,lost,on,her,as,the,tide,of,her,anger,and,disappointment,rose
he,got,lightly,to,his,feet,and,coming,to,her,put,his,hand,under,her,chin,and,jerked,her,face,up,to,his
what,a,child,you,are
you,have,lived,with,three,men,and,still,know,nothing,of,men's,natures
you,seem,to,think,they,are,like,old,ladies,past,the,change,of,life
he,pinched,her,chin,playfully,and,his,hand,dropped,away,from,her
one,black,eyebrow,went,up,as,he,bent,a,cool,long,look,on,her
scarlett,understand,this
if,you,and,your,bed,still,held,any,charms,for,me,no,looks,and,no,entreaties,could,keep,me,away

he,turned,as,though,the,subject,were,closed,and,left,the,room
scarlett,heard,him,going,back,to,the,nursery,where,he,was,welcomed,by,the,children
she,sat,down,abruptly
she,had,had,her,way
this,was,what,she,wanted,and,ashley,wanted
but,it,was,not,making,her,happy
her,vanity,was,sore,and,she,was,mortified,at,the,thought,that,rhett,had,taken,it,all,so,lightly,that,he,didn't,want,her,that,he,put,her,on,the,level,of,other,women,in,other,beds
she,wished,she,could,think,of,some,delicate,way,to,tell,ashley,that,she,and,rhett,were,no,longer,actually,man,and,wife
but,she,knew,now,she,could,not
it,all,seemed,a,terrible,mess,now,and,she,half,heartedly,wished,she,had,said,nothing,about,it
she,would,miss,the,long,amusing,conversations,in,bed,with,rhett,when,the,ember,of,his,cigar,glowed,in,the,dark
she,would,miss,the,comfort,of,his,arms,when,she,woke,terrified,from,the,dreams,that,she,was,running,through,cold,mist
suddenly,she,felt,very,unhappy,and,leaning,her,head,on,the,arm,of,the,chair,she,cried
chapter,lii
one,rainy,afternoon,when,bonnie,was,barely,past,her,first,birthday,wade,moped,about,the,sitting,room,occasionally,going,to,the,window,and,flattening,his,nose,on,the,dripping,pane
he,was,a,slender,weedy,boy,small,for,his,eight,years,quiet,almost,to,shyness,never,speaking,unless,spoken,to

buy,yourself,some,candy,a,lot,enough,to,give,you,a,wonderful,stomach,ache
wade,beaming,pocketed,the,bill,and,looked,anxiously,toward,his,mother,for,confirmation
but,she,with,a,pucker,in,her,brows,was,watching,rhett
he,had,picked,bonnie,from,the,floor,and,was,cradling,her,to,him,her,small,face,against,his,cheek
she,could,not,read,his,face,but,there,was,something,in,his,eyes,almost,like,fear,fear,and,self-accusation
wade,encouraged,by,his,stepfather's,generosity,came,shyly,toward,him
uncle,rhett,can,i,ask,you,sumpin'
of,course
rhett's,look,was,anxious,absent,as,he,held,bonnie's,head,closer
what,is,it,wade
uncle,rhett,were,you,did,you,fight,in,the,war
rhett's,eyes,came,alertly,back,and,they,were,sharp,but,his,voice,was,casual
why,do,you,ask,son
well,joe,whiting,said,you,didn't,and,so,did,frankie,bonnell
ah,said,rhett,and,what,did,you,tell,them

were,you,in,the,war,uncle,rhett
yes,said,rhett,suddenly,violent
i,was,in,the,war
i,was,in,the,army,for,eight,months
i,fought,all,the,way,from,lovejoy,up,to,franklin,tennessee
and,i,was,with,johnston,when,he,surrendered
wade,wriggled,with,pride,but,scarlett,laughed
i,thought,you,were,ashamed,of,your,war,record,she,said
didn't,you,tell,me,to,keep,it,quiet
hush,he,said,briefly
does,that,satisfy,you,wade
oh,yes,sir
i,knew,you,were,in,the,war
i,knew,you,weren't,scared,like,they,said
but,why,weren't,you,with,the,other,little,boys',fathers
because,the,other,little,boys',fathers,were,such,fools,they,had,to,put,them,in,the,infantry
i,was,a,west,pointer,and,so,i,was,in,the,artillery
in,the,regular,artillery,wade,not,the,home,guard
it,takes,a,pile,of,sense,to,be,in,the,artillery,wade
i,bet,said,wade,his,face,shining
did,you,get,wounded,uncle,rhett
rhett,hesitated
tell,him,about,your,dysentery,jeered,scarlett
rhett,carefully,set,the,baby,on,the,floor,and,pulled,his,shirt,and,undershirt,out,of,his,trouser,band
come,here,wade,and,i'll,show,you,where,i,was,wounded
wade,advanced,excited,and,gazed,where,rhett's,finger,pointed
a,long,raised,scar,ran,across,his,brown,chest,and,down,into,his,heavily,muscled,abdomen
it,was,the,souvenir,of,a,knife,fight,in,the,california,gold,fields,but,wade,did,not,know,it
he,breathed,heavily,and,happily
i,guess,you're,'bout,as,brave,as,my,father,uncle,rhett
almost,but,not,quite,said,rhett,stuffing,his,shirt,into,his,trousers
now,go,on,and,spend,your,dollar,and,whale,hell,out,of,any,boy,who,says,i,wasn't,in,the,army
wade,went,dancing,out,happily,calling,to,pork,and,rhett,picked,up,the,baby,again
now,why,all,these,lies,my,gallant,soldier,laddie
asked,scarlett
a,boy,has,to,be,proud,of,his,father,or,stepfather
i,can't,let,him,be,ashamed,before,the,other,little,brutes
cruel,creatures,children
oh,fiddle-dee-dee
i,never,thought,about,what,it,meant,to,wade,said,rhett,slowly
i,never,thought,how,he's,suffered
and,it's,not,going,to,be,that,way,for,bonnie
what,way
do,you,think,i'm,going,to,have,my,bonnie,ashamed,of,her,father
have,her,left,out,of,parties,when,she's,nine,or,ten
do,you,think,i'm,going,to,have,her,humiliated,like,wade,for,things,that,aren't,her,fault,but,yours,and,mine
oh,children's,parties
out,of,children's,parties,grow,young,girls',debut,parties
do,you,think,i'm,going,to,let,my,daughter,grow,up,outside,of,everything,decent,in,atlanta
i'm,not,going,to,send,her,north,to,school,and,to,visit,because,she,won't,be,accepted,here,or,in,charleston,or,savannah,or,new,orleans
and,i'm,not,going,to,see,her,forced,to,marry,a,yankee,or,a,foreigner,because,no,decent,southern,family,will,have,her,because,her,mother,was,a,fool,and,her,father,a,blackguard
wade,who,had,come,back,to,the,door,was,an,interested,but,puzzled,listener
bonnie,can,marry,beau,uncle,rhett
the,anger,went,from,rhett's,face,as,he,turned,to,the,little,boy,and,he,considered,his,words,with,apparent,seriousness,as,he,always,did,when,dealing,with,the,children
that's,true,wade
bonnie,can,marry,beau,wilkes,but,who,will,you,marry
oh,i,shan't,marry,anyone,said,wade,confidently,luxuriating,in,a,man-to-man,talk,with,the,one,person,except,aunt,melly,who,never,reproved,and,always,encouraged,him
i'm,going,to,go,to,harvard,and,be,a,lawyer,like,my,father,and,then,i'm,going,to,be,a,brave,soldier,just,like,him
i,wish,melly,would,keep,her,mouth,shut,cried,scarlett
wade,you,are,not,going,to,harvard
it's,a,yankee,school,and,i,won't,have,you,going,to,a,yankee,school
you,are,going,to,the,university,of,georgia,and,after,you,graduate,you,are,going,to,manage,the,store,for,me
and,as,for,your,father,being,a,brave,soldier
hush,said,rhett,curtly,not,missing,the,shining,light,in,wade's,eyes,when,he,spoke,of,the,father,he,had,never,known
you,grow,up,and,be,a,brave,man,like,your,father,wade
try,to,be,just,like,him,for,he,was,a,hero,and,don't,let,anyone,tell,you,differently
he,married,your,mother,didn't,he
well,that's,proof,enough,of,heroism
and,i'll,see,that,you,go,to,harvard,and,become,a,lawyer
now,run,along,and,tell,pork,to,take,you,to,town
i'll,thank,you,to,let,me,manage,my,children,cried,scarlett,as,wade,obediently,trotted,from,the,room
you're,a,damned,poor,manager
you've,wrecked,whatever,chances,ella,and,wade,had,but,i,won't,permit,you,to,do,bonnie,that,way
bonnie's,going,to,be,a,little,princess,and,everyone,in,the,world,is,going,to,want,her
there's,not,going,to,be,any,place,she,can't,go
good,god,do,you,think,i'm,going,to,let,her,grow,up,and,associate,with,the,riffraff,that,fills,this,house
they,are,good,enough,for,you
and,a,damned,sight,too,good,for,you,my,pet
but,not,for,bonnie
do,you,think,i'd,let,her,marry,any,of,this,runagate,gang,you,spend,your,time,with
irishmen,on,the,make,yankees,white,trash,carpetbag,parvenus,my,bonnie,with,her,butler,blood,and,her,robillard,strain
the,o'haras
the,o'haras,might,have,been,kings,of,ireland,once,but,your,father,was,nothing,but,a,smart,mick,on,the,make
and,you,are,no,better,but,then,i'm,at,fault,too
i've,gone,through,life,like,a,bat,out,of,hell,never,caring,what,i,did,because,nothing,ever,mattered,to,me
but,bonnie,matters
god,what,a,fool,i've,been
bonnie,wouldn't,be,received,in,charleston,no,matter,what,my,mother,or,your,aunt,eulalie,or,aunt,pauline,did,and,it's,obvious,that,she,won't,be,received,here,unless,we,do,something,quickly
oh,rhett,you,take,it,so,seriously,you're,funny
with,our,money
damn,our,money
all,our,money,can't,buy,what,i,want,for,her
i'd,rather,bonnie,was,invited,to,eat,dry,bread,in,the,picards',miserable,house,or,mrs,elsing's,rickety,barn,than,to,be,the,belle,of,a,republican,inaugural,ball
scarlett,you've,been,a,fool
you,should,have,insured,a,place,for,your,children,in,the,social,scheme,years,ago,but,you,didn't
you,didn't,even,bother,to,keep,what,position,you,had
and,it's,too,much,to,hope,that,you'll,mend,your,ways,at,this,late,date
you're,too,anxious,to,make,money,and,too,fond,of,bullying,people
i,consider,this,whole,affair,a,tempest,in,a,teapot,said,scarlett,coldly,rattling,her,papers,to,indicate,that,as,far,as,she,was,concerned,the,discussion,was,finished
we,have,only,mrs,wilkes,to,help,us,and,you,do,your,best,to,alienate,and,insult,her
oh,spare,me,your,remarks,about,her,poverty,and,her,tacky,clothes
she's,the,soul,and,the,center,of,everything,in,atlanta,that's,sterling
thank,god,for,her
she'll,help,me,do,something,about,it
and,what,are,you,going,to,do
do
i'm,going,to,cultivate,every,female,dragon,of,the,old,guard,in,this,town,especially,mrs,merriwether,mrs,elsing,mrs,whiting,and,mrs,meade
if,i,have,to,crawl,on,my,belly,to,every,fat,old,cat,who,hates,me,i'll,do,it
i'll,be,meek,under,their,coldness,and,repentant,of,my,evil,ways
i'll,contribute,to,their,damned,charities,and,i'll,go,to,their,damned,churches
i'll,admit,and,brag,about,my,services,to,the,confederacy,and,if,worst,comes,to,worst,i'll,join,their,damned,klan,though,a,merciful,god,could,hardly,lay,so,heavy,a,penance,on,my,shoulders,as,that
and,i,shall,not,hesitate,to,remind,the,fools,whose,necks,i,saved,that,they,owe,me,a,debt
and,you,madam,will,kindly,refrain,from,undoing,my,work,behind,my,back,and,foreclosing,mortgages,on,any,of,the,people,i'm,courting,or,selling,them,rotten,lumber,or,in,other,ways,insulting,them
and,governor,bullock,never,sets,foot,in,this,house,again
do,you,hear
and,none,of,this,gang,of,elegant,thieves,you've,been,associating,with,either
if,you,do,invite,them,over,my,request,you,will,find,yourself,in,the,embarrassing,position,of,having,no,host,in,your,home
if,they,come,in,this,house,i,will,spend,the,time,in,belle,watling's,bar,telling,anyone,who,cares,to,hear,that,i,won't,stay,under,the,same,roof,with,them
scarlett,who,had,been,smarting,under,his,words,laughed,shortly
so,the,river-boat,gambler,and,the,speculator,is,going,to,be,respectable
well,your,first,move,toward,respectability,had,better,be,the,sale,of,belle,watling's,house
that,was,a,shot,in,the,dark
she,had,never,been,absolutely,certain,that,rhett,owned,the,house
he,laughed,suddenly,as,though,he,read,her,mind
thanks,for,the,suggestion
had,he,tried,rhett,could,not,have,chosen,a,more,difficult,time,to,beat,his,way,back,to,respectability
never,before,or,after,did,the,names,republican,and,scallawag,carry,such,odium,for,now,the,corruption,of,the,carpetbag,regime,was,at,its,height
and,since,the,surrender,rhett's,name,had,been,inextricably,linked,with,yankees,republicans,and,scallawags
atlanta,people,had,thought,with,helpless,fury,in,1866,that,nothing,could,be,worse,than,the,harsh,military,rule,they,had,then,but,now,under,bullock,they,were,learning,the,worst
thanks,to,the,negro,vote,the,republicans,and,their,allies,were,firmly,entrenched,and,they,were,riding,rough-shod,over,the,powerless,but,still,protesting,minority
word,had,been,spread,among,the,negroes,that,there,were,only,two,political,parties,mentioned,in,the,bible,the,publicans,and,the,sinners
no,negro,wanted,to,join,a,party,made,up,entirely,of,sinners,so,they,hastened,to,join,the,republicans
their,new,masters,voted,them,over,and,over,again,electing,poor,whites,and,scallawags,to,high,places,electing,even,some,negroes
these,negroes,sat,in,the,legislature,where,they,spent,most,of,their,time,eating,goobers,and,easing,their,unaccustomed,feet,into,and,out,of,new,shoes
few,of,them,could,read,or,write
they,were,fresh,from,cotton,patch,and,canebrake,but,it,was,within,their,power,to,vote,taxes,and,bonds,as,well,as,enormous,expense,accounts,to,themselves,and,their,republican,friends
and,they,voted,them
the,state,staggered,under,taxes,which,were,paid,in,fury,for,the,taxpayers,knew,that,much,of,the,money,voted,for,public,purposes,was,finding,its,way,into,private,pockets
completely,surrounding,the,state,capitol,was,a,host,of,promoters,speculators,seekers,after,contracts,and,others,hoping,to,profit,from,the,orgy,of,spending,and,many,were,growing,shamelessly,rich
they,had,no,difficulty,at,all,in,obtaining,the,state's,money,for,building,railroads,that,were,never,built,for,buying,cars,and,engines,that,were,never,bought,for,erecting,public,buildings,that,never,existed,except,in,the,minds,of,their,promoters
bonds,were,issued,running,into,the,millions
most,of,them,were,illegal,and,fraudulent,but,they,were,issued,just,the,same
the,state,treasurer,a,republican,but,an,honest,man,protested,against,the,illegal,issues,and,refused,to,sign,them,but,he,and,others,who,sought,to,check,the,abuses,could,do,nothing,against,the,tide,that,was,running
the,state-owned,railroad,had,once,been,an,asset,to,the,state,but,now,it,was,a,liability,and,its,debts,had,piled,up,to,the,million,mark
it,was,no,longer,a,railroad
it,was,an,enormous,bottomless,trough,in,which,the,hogs,could,swill,and,wallow
many,of,its,officials,were,appointed,for,political,reasons,regardless,of,their,knowledge,of,the,operation,of,railroads,there,were,three,times,as,many,people,employed,as,were,necessary,republicans,rode,free,on,passes,carloads,of,negroes,rode,free,on,their,happy,jaunts,about,the,state,to,vote,and,revote,in,the,same,elections
the,mismanagement,of,the,state,road,especially,infuriated,the,taxpayers,for,out,of,the,earnings,of,the,road,was,to,come,the,money,for,free,schools
but,there,were,no,earnings,there,were,only,debts,and,so,there,were,no,free,schools,and,there,was,a,generation,of,children,growing,up,in,ignorance,who,would,spread,the,seeds,of,illiteracy,down,the,years
but,far,and,above,their,anger,at,the,waste,and,mismanagement,and,graft,was,the,resentment,of,the,people,at,the,bad,light,in,which,the,governor,represented,them,in,the,north
when,georgia,howled,against,corruption,the,governor,hastily,went,north,appeared,before,congress,and,told,of,white,outrages,against,negroes,of,georgia's,preparation,for,another,rebellion,and,the,need,for,a,stern,military,rule,in,the,state
no,georgian,wanted,trouble,with,the,negroes,and,they,tried,to,avoid,trouble
no,one,wanted,another,war,no,one,wanted,or,needed,bayonet,rule
all,georgia,wanted,was,to,be,let,alone,so,the,state,could,recuperate
but,with,the,operation,of,what,came,to,be,known,as,the,governor's,slander,mill,the,north,saw,only,a,rebellious,state,that,needed,a,heavy,hand,and,a,heavy,hand,was,laid,upon,it
it,was,a,glorious,spree,for,the,gang,which,had,georgia,by,the,throat
there,was,an,orgy,of,grabbing,and,over,all,there,was,a,cold,cynicism,about,open,theft,in,high,places,that,was,chilling,to,contemplate
protests,and,efforts,to,resist,accomplished,nothing,for,the,state,government,was,being,upheld,and,supported,by,the,power,of,the,united,states,army
atlanta,cursed,the,name,of,bullock,and,his,scallawags,and,republicans,and,they,cursed,the,name,of,anyone,connected,with,them
and,rhett,was,connected,with,them
he,had,been,in,with,them,so,everyone,said,in,all,their,schemes
but,now,he,turned,against,the,stream,in,which,he,had,drifted,so,short,a,while,before,and,began,swimming,arduously,back,against,the,current
he,went,about,his,campaign,slowly,subtly,not,arousing,the,suspicions,of,atlanta,by,the,spectacle,of,a,leopard,trying,to,change,his,spots,overnight
he,avoided,his,dubious,cronies,and,was,seen,no,more,in,the,company,of,yankee,officers,scallawags,and,republicans
he,attended,democratic,rallies,and,he,ostentatiously,voted,the,democratic,ticket
he,gave,up,high-stake,card,games,and,stayed,comparatively,sober
if,he,went,to,belle,watling's,house,at,all,he,went,by,night,and,by,stealth,as,did,more,respectable,townsmen,instead,of,leaving,his,horse,hitched,in,front,of,her,door,in,the,afternoons,as,an,advertisement,of,his,presence,within
and,the,congregation,of,the,episcopal,church,almost,fell,out,of,their,pews,when,he,tiptoed,in,late,for,services,with,wade's,hand,held,in,his
the,congregation,was,as,much,stunned,by,wade's,appearance,as,by,rhett's,for,the,little,boy,was,supposed,to,be,a,catholic
at,least,scarlett,was,one
or,she,was,supposed,to,be,one
but,she,had,not,put,foot,in,the,church,in,years,for,religion,had,gone,from,her,as,many,of,ellen's,other,teachings,had,gone
everyone,thought,she,had,neglected,her,boy's,religious,education,and,thought,more,of,rhett,for,trying,to,rectify,the,matter,even,if,he,did,take,the,boy,to,the,episcopal,church,instead,of,the,catholic
rhett,could,be,grave,of,manner,and,charming,when,he,chose,to,restrain,his,tongue,and,keep,his,black,eyes,from,dancing,maliciously
it,had,been,years,since,he,had,chosen,to,do,this,but,he,did,it,now,putting,on,gravity,and,charm,even,as,he,put,on,waistcoats,of,more,sober,hues
it,was,not,difficult,to,gain,a,foothold,of,friendliness,with,the,men,who,owed,their,necks,to,him
they,would,have,showed,their,appreciation,long,ago,had,rhett,not,acted,as,if,their,appreciation,were,a,matter,of,small,moment
now,hugh,elsing,rene,the,simmons,boys,andy,bonnell,and,the,others,found,him,pleasant,diffident,about,putting,himself,forward,and,embarrassed,when,they,spoke,of,the,obligation,they,owed,him
it,was,nothing,he,would,protest
in,my,place,you'd,have,all,done,the,same,thing
he,subscribed,handsomely,to,the,fund,for,the,repairs,of,the,episcopal,church,and,he,gave,a,large,but,not,vulgarly,large,contribution,to,the,association,for,the,beautification,of,the,graves,of,our,glorious,dead
he,sought,out,mrs,elsing,to,make,this,donation,and,embarrassedly,begged,that,she,keep,his,gift,a,secret,knowing,very,well,that,this,would,spur,her,to,spreading,the,news
mrs,elsing,hated,to,take,his,money,speculator,money,but,the,association,needed,money,badly
i,don't,see,why,you,of,all,people,should,be,subscribing,she,said,acidly
when,rhett,told,her,with,the,proper,sober,mien,that,he,was,moved,to,contribute,by,the,memories,of,former,comrades,in,arms,braver,than,he,but,less,fortunate,who,now,lay,in,unmarked,graves,mrs,elsing's,aristocratic,jaw,dropped
dolly,merriwether,had,told,her,scarlett,had,said,captain,butler,was,in,the,army,but,of,course,she,hadn't,believed,it
nobody,had,believed,it
you,in,the,army
what,was,your,company,your,regiment
rhett,gave,them
oh,the,artillery
everyone,i,knew,was,either,in,the,cavalry,or,the,infantry
then,that,explains,she,broke,off,disconcerted,expecting,to,see,his,eyes,snap,with,malice
but,he,only,looked,down,and,toyed,with,his,watch,chain
i,would,have,liked,the,infantry,he,said,passing,completely,over,her,insinuation,but,when,they,found,that,i,was,a,west,pointer,though,i,did,not,graduate,mrs,elsing,due,to,a,boyish,prank,they,put,me,in,the,artillery,the,regular,artillery,not,the,militia
they,needed,men,with,specialized,knowledge,in,that,last,campaign
you,know,how,heavy,the,losses,had,been,so,many,artillerymen,killed
it,was,pretty,lonely,in,the,artillery
i,didn't,see,a,soul,i,knew
i,don't,believe,i,saw,a,single,man,from,atlanta,during,my,whole,service
well
said,mrs,elsing,confused
if,he,had,been,in,the,army,then,she,was,wrong
she,had,made,many,sharp,remarks,about,his,cowardice,and,the,memory,of,them,made,her,feel,guilty
well
and,why,haven't,you,ever,told,anybody,about,your,service
you,act,as,though,you,were,ashamed,of,it
rhett,looked,her,squarely,in,the,eyes,his,face,blank
mrs,elsing,he,said,earnestly,believe,me,when,i,say,that,i,am,prouder,of,my,services,to,the,confederacy,than,of,anything,i,have,ever,done,or,will,do
i,feel,i,feel
well,why,did,you,keep,it,hidden
i,was,ashamed,to,speak,of,it,in,the,light,of,of,some,of,my,former,actions
mrs,elsing,reported,the,contribution,and,the,conversation,in,detail,to,mrs,merriwether
and,dolly,i,give,you,my,word,that,when,he,said,that,about,being,ashamed,tears,came,into,his,eyes
yes,tears
i,nearly,cried,myself
stuff,and,nonsense
cried,mrs,merriwether,in,disbelief
i,don't,believe,tears,came,into,his,eyes,any,more,than,i,believe,he,was,in,the,army
and,i,can,find,out,mighty,quick
if,he,was,in,that,artillery,outfit,i,can,get,at,the,truth,for,colonel,carleton,who,commanded,it,married,the,daughter,of,one,of,my,grandfather's,sisters,and,i'll,write,him
she,wrote,colonel,carlton,and,to,her,consternation,received,a,reply,praising,rhett's,services,in,no,uncertain,terms
a,born,artilleryman,a,brave,soldier,and,an,uncomplaining,gentleman,a,modest,man,who,wouldn't,even,take,a,commission,when,it,was,offered,him
well
said,mrs,merriwether,showing,the,letter,to,mrs,elsing
you,can,knock,me,down,with,a,feather
maybe,we,did,misjudge,the,scamp,about,not,being,a,soldier
maybe,we,should,have,believed,what,scarlett,and,melanie,said,about,him,enlisting,the,day,the,town,fell
but,just,the,same,he's,a,scallawag,and,a,rascal,and,i,don't,like,him
somehow,said,mrs,elsing,uncertainly,somehow,i,don't,think,he's,so,bad
a,man,who,fought,for,the,confederacy,can't,be,all,bad
it's,scarlett,who,is,the,bad,one
do,you,know,dolly,i,really,believe,that,he,well,he's,ashamed,of,scarlett,but,is,too,much,of,a,gentleman,to,let,on
ashamed
pooh
they're,both,cut,out,of,the,same,piece,of,cloth
where,did,you,ever,get,such,a,silly,notion
it,isn't,silly,said,mrs,elsing,indignantly
yesterday,in,the,pouring,rain,he,had,those,three,children,even,the,baby,mind,you,out,in,his,carriage,riding,them,up,and,down,peachtree,street,and,he,gave,me,a,lift,home
and,when,i,said,'captain,butler,have,you,lost,your,mind,keeping,these,children,out,in,the,damp
why,don't,you,take,them,home,'
and,he,didn't,say,a,word,but,just,looked,embarrassed
but,mammy,spoke,up,and,said,'de,house,full,of,w'ite,trash,an',it,healthier,fer,de,chillun,in,de,rain,dan,at,home,'
what,did,he,say
what,could,he,say
he,just,scowled,at,mammy,and,passed,it,over
you,know,scarlett,was,giving,a,big,whist,party,yesterday,afternoon,with,all,those,common,ordinary,women,there
i,guess,he,didn't,want,them,kissing,his,baby
well
said,mrs,merriwether,wavering,but,still,obstinate
but,the,next,week,she,too,capitulated
rhett,now,had,a,desk,in,the,bank
what,he,did,at,this,desk,the,bewildered,officials,of,the,bank,did,not,know,but,he,owned,too,large,a,block,of,the,stock,for,them,to,protest,his,presence,there
after,a,while,they,forgot,that,they,had,objected,to,him,for,he,was,quiet,and,well,mannered,and,actually,knew,something,about,banking,and,investments
at,any,rate,he,sat,at,his,desk,all,day,giving,every,appearance,of,industry,for,he,wished,to,be,on,equal,terms,with,his,respectable,fellow,townsmen,who,worked,and,worked,hard
mrs,merriwether,wishing,to,expand,her,growing,bakery,had,tried,to,borrow,two,thousand,dollars,from,the,bank,with,her,house,as,security
she,had,been,refused,because,there,were,already,two,mortgages,on,the,house
the,stout,old,lady,was,storming,out,of,the,bank,when,rhett,stopped,her,learned,the,trouble,and,said,worriedly,but,there,must,be,some,mistake,mrs,merriwether
some,dreadful,mistake
you,of,all,people,shouldn't,have,to,bother,about,collateral
why,i'd,lend,you,money,just,on,your,word
any,lady,who,could,build,up,the,business,you've,built,up,is,the,best,risk,in,the,world
the,bank,wants,to,lend,money,to,people,like,you
now,do,sit,down,right,here,in,my,chair,and,i,will,attend,to,it,for,you
when,he,came,back,he,was,smiling,blandly,saying,that,there,had,been,a,mistake,just,as,he,had,thought
the,two,thousand,dollars,was,right,there,waiting,for,her,whenever,she,cared,to,draw,against,it
now,about,her,house,would,she,just,sign,right,here
mrs,merriwether,torn,with,indignation,and,insult,furious,that,she,had,to,take,this,favor,from,a,man,she,disliked,and,distrusted,was,hardly,gracious,in,her,thanks
but,he,failed,to,notice,it
as,he,escorted,her,to,the,door,he,said,mrs,merriwether,i,have,always,had,a,great,regard,for,your,knowledge,and,i,wonder,if,you,could,tell,me,something
the,plumes,on,her,bonnet,barely,moved,as,she,nodded
what,did,you,do,when,your,maybelle,was,little,and,she,sucked,her,thumb
what
my,bonnie,sucks,her,thumb
i,can't,make,her,stop,it
you,should,make,her,stop,it,said,mrs,merriwether,vigorously
it,will,ruin,the,shape,of,her,mouth
i,know
i,know
and,she,has,a,beautiful,mouth
but,i,don't,know,what,to,do
well,scarlett,ought,to,know,said,mrs,merriwether,shortly
she's,had,two,other,children
rhett,looked,down,at,his,shoes,and,sighed
i've,tried,putting,soap,under,her,finger,nails,he,said,passing,over,her,remark,about,scarlett
soap
bah
soap,is,no,good,at,all
i,put,quinine,on,maybelle's,thumb,and,let,me,tell,you,captain,butler,she,stopped,sucking,that,thumb,mighty,quick
quinine
i,would,never,have,thought,of,it
i,can't,thank,you,enough,mrs,merriwether
it,was,worrying,me
he,gave,her,a,smile,so,pleasant,so,grateful,that,mrs,merriwether,stood,uncertainly,for,a,moment
but,as,she,told,him,good-by,she,was,smiling,too
she,hated,to,admit,to,mrs,elsing,that,she,had,misjudged,the,man,but,she,was,an,honest,person,and,she,said,there,had,to,be,something,good,about,a,man,who,loved,his,child
what,a,pity,scarlett,took,no,interest,in,so,pretty,a,creature,as,bonnie
there,was,something,pathetic,about,a,man,trying,to,raise,a,little,girl,all,by,himself
rhett,knew,very,well,the,pathos,of,the,spectacle,and,if,it,blackened,scarlett's,reputation,he,did,not,care
from,the,time,the,child,could,walk,he,took,her,about,with,him,constantly,in,the,carriage,or,in,front,of,his,saddle
when,he,came,home,from,the,bank,in,the,afternoon,he,took,her,walking,down,peachtree,street,holding,her,hand,slowing,his,long,strides,to,her,toddling,steps,patiently,answering,her,thousand,questions
people,were,always,in,their,front,yards,or,on,their,porches,at,sunset,and,as,bonnie,was,such,a,friendly,pretty,child,with,her,tangle,of,black,curls,and,her,bright,blue,eyes,few,could,resist,talking,to,her
rhett,never,presumed,on,these,conversations,but,stood,by,exuding,fatherly,pride,and,gratification,at,the,notice,taken,of,his,daughter
atlanta,had,a,long,memory,and,was,suspicious,and,slow,to,change
times,were,hard,and,feeling,was,bitter,against,anyone,who,had,had,anything,to,do,with,bullock,and,his,crowd
but,bonnie,had,the,combined,charm,of,scarlett,and,rhett,at,their,best,and,she,was,the,small,opening,wedge,rhett,drove,into,the,wall,of,atlanta's,coldness
bonnie,grew,rapidly,and,every,day,it,became,more,evident,that,gerald,o'hara,had,been,her,grandfather
she,had,short,sturdy,legs,and,wide,eyes,of,irish,blue,and,a,small,square,jaw,that,went,with,a,determination,to,have,her,own,way
she,had,gerald's,sudden,temper,to,which,she,gave,vent,in,screaming,tantrums,that,were,forgotten,as,soon,as,her,wishes,were,gratified
and,as,long,as,her,father,was,near,her,they,were,always,gratified,hastily
he,spoiled,her,despite,all,the,efforts,of,mammy,and,scarlett,for,in,all,things,she,pleased,him,except,one
and,that,was,her,fear,of,the,dark
until,she,was,two,years,old,she,went,to,sleep,readily,in,the,nursery,she,shared,with,wade,and,ella
then,for,no,apparent,reason,she,began,to,sob,whenever,mammy,waddled,out,of,the,room,carrying,the,lamp
from,this,she,progressed,to,wakening,in,the,late,night,hours,screaming,with,terror,frightening,the,other,two,children,and,alarming,the,house
once,dr,meade,had,to,be,called,and,rhett,was,short,with,him,when,he,diagnosed,only,bad,dreams
all,anyone,could,get,from,her,was,one,word,dark
scarlett,was,inclined,to,be,irritated,with,the,child,and,favored,a,spanking
she,would,not,humor,her,by,leaving,a,lamp,burning,in,the,nursery,for,then,wade,and,ella,would,be,unable,to,sleep
rhett,worried,but,gentle,attempting,to,extract,further,information,from,his,daughter,said,coldly,that,if,any,spanking,were,done,he,would,do,it,personally,and,to,scarlett
the,upshot,of,the,situation,was,that,bonnie,was,removed,from,the,nursery,to,the,room,rhett,now,occupied,alone
her,small,bed,was,placed,beside,his,large,one,and,a,shaded,lamp,burned,on,the,table,all,night,long
the,town,buzzed,when,this,story,got,about
somehow,there,was,something,indelicate,about,a,girl,child,sleeping,in,her,father's,room,even,though,the,girl,was,only,two,years,old
scarlett,suffered,from,this,gossip,in,two,ways
first,it,proved,indubitably,that,she,and,her,husband,occupied,separate,rooms,in,itself,a,shocking,enough,state,of,affairs
second,everyone,thought,that,if,the,child,was,afraid,to,sleep,alone,her,place,was,with,her,mother
and,scarlett,did,not,feel,equal,to,explaining,that,she,could,not,sleep,in,a,lighted,room,nor,would,rhett,permit,the,child,to,sleep,with,her
you'd,never,wake,up,unless,she,screamed,and,then,you'd,probably,slap,her,he,said,shortly
scarlett,was,annoyed,at,the,weight,he,attached,to,bonnie's,night,terrors,but,she,thought,she,could,eventually,remedy,the,state,of,affairs,and,transfer,the,child,back,to,the,nursery
all,children,were,afraid,of,the,dark,and,the,only,cure,was,firmness
rhett,was,just,being,perverse,in,the,matter,making,her,appear,a,poor,mother,just,to,pay,her,back
