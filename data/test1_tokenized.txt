prologue,[END]
the,day,was,grey,and,bitter,cold,and,the,dogs,would,not,take,the,scent,[END]
the,big,black,bitch,had,taken,one,sniff,at,the,bear,tracks,backed,off,and,skulked,back,to,the,pack,with,her,tail,between,her,legs,[END]
the,dogs,huddled,together,miserably,on,the,riverbank,as,the,wind,snapped,at,them,[END]
chett,felt,it,too,biting,through,his,layers,of,black,wool,and,boiled,leather,[END]
it,was,too,bloody,cold,for,man,or,beast,but,here,they,were,[END]
his,mouth,twisted,and,he,could,almost,feel,the,boils,that,covered,his,cheeks,and,neck,growing,red,and,angry,[END]
i,should,be,safe,back,at,the,wall,tending,the,bloody,ravens,and,making,fires,for,old,maester,aemon,[END]
it,was,the,bastard,jon,snow,who,had,taken,that,from,him,him,and,his,fat,friend,sam,tarly,[END]
it,was,their,fault,he,was,here,freezing,his,bloody,balls,off,with,a,pack,of,hounds,deep,in,the,haunted,forest,[END]
seven,hells,[END]
he,gave,the,leashes,a,hard,yank,to,get,the,dogs',attention,[END]
track,you,bastards,[END]
that's,a,bear,print,[END]
you,want,some,meat,or,no,[END]
find,[END]
but,the,hounds,only,huddled,closer,whining,[END]
chett,snapped,his,short,lash,above,their,heads,and,the,black,bitch,snarled,at,him,[END]
dog,meat,would,taste,as,good,as,bear,he,warned,her,his,breath,frosting,with,every,word,[END]
lark,the,sisterman,stood,with,his,arms,crossed,over,his,chest,and,his,hands,tucked,up,into,his,armpits,[END]
he,wore,black,wool,gloves,but,he,was,always,complaining,how,his,fingers,were,frozen,[END]
it's,too,bloody,cold,to,hunt,he,said,[END]
bugger,this,bear,he's,not,worth,freezing,over,[END]
we,can't,go,back,emptyhand,lark,rumbled,small,paul,through,the,brown,whiskers,that,covered,most,of,his,face,[END]
the,lord,commander,wouldn't,like,that,[END]
there,was,ice,under,the,big,man's,squashed,pug,nose,where,his,snot,had,frozen,[END]
a,huge,hand,in,a,thick,fur,glove,clenched,tight,around,the,shaft,of,a,spear,[END]
bugger,that,old,bear,too,said,the,sisterman,a,thin,man,with,sharp,features,and,nervous,eyes,[END]
mormont,will,be,dead,before,daybreak,remember,[END]
who,cares,what,he,likes,[END]
small,paul,blinked,his,black,little,eyes,[END]
maybe,he,had,forgotten,chett,thought,he,was,stupid,enough,to,forget,most,anything,[END]
why,do,we,have,to,kill,the,old,bear,[END]
why,don't,we,just,go,off,and,let,him,be,[END]
you,think,he'll,let,us,be,[END]
said,lark,[END]
he'll,hunt,us,down,[END]
you,want,to,be,hunted,you,great,muttonhead,[END]
no,said,small,paul,[END]
i,don't,want,that,[END]
i,don't,[END]
so,you'll,kill,him,[END]
said,lark,[END]
yes,[END]
the,huge,man,stamped,the,butt,of,his,spear,on,the,frozen,riverbank,[END]
i,will,[END]
he,shouldn't,hunt,us,[END]
the,sisterman,took,his,hands,from,his,armpits,and,turned,to,chett,[END]
we,need,to,kill,all,the,officers,i,say,[END]
chett,was,sick,of,hearing,it,[END]
we,been,over,this,[END]
the,old,bear,dies,and,blane,from,the,shadow,tower,[END]
grubbs,and,aethan,as,well,their,ill,luck,for,drawing,the,watch,dywen,and,bannen,for,their,tracking,and,ser,piggy,for,the,ravens,[END]
that's,all,[END]
we,kill,them,quiet,while,they,sleep,[END]
one,scream,and,we're,wormfood,every,one,of,us,[END]
his,boils,were,red,with,rage,[END]
just,do,your,bit,and,see,that,your,cousins,do,theirs,[END]
and,paul,try,and,remember,it's,third,watch,not,second,[END]
third,watch,the,big,man,said,through,hair,and,frozen,snot,[END]
me,and,softfoot,[END]
i,remember,chett,[END]
the,moon,would,be,black,tonight,and,they,had,jiggered,the,watches,so,as,to,have,eight,of,their,own,standing,sentry,with,two,more,guarding,the,horses,[END]
it,wasn't,going,to,get,much,riper,than,that,[END]
besides,the,wildlings,could,be,upon,them,any,day,now,[END]
chett,meant,to,be,well,away,from,here,before,that,happened,[END]
he,meant,to,live,[END]
three,hundred,sworn,brothers,of,the,night's,watch,had,ridden,north,two,hundred,from,castle,black,and,another,hundred,from,the,shadow,tower,[END]
it,was,the,biggest,ranging,in,living,memory,near,a,third,of,the,watch's,strength,[END]
they,meant,to,find,ben,stark,ser,waymar,royce,and,the,other,rangers,who'd,gone,missing,and,discover,why,the,wildlings,were,leaving,their,villages,[END]
well,they,were,no,closer,to,stark,and,royce,than,when,they'd,left,the,wall,but,they'd,learned,where,all,the,wildlings,had,gone,up,into,the,icy,heights,of,the,godsforsaken,frostfangs,[END]
they,could,squat,up,there,till,the,end,of,time,and,it,wouldn't,prick,chett's,boils,none,[END]
but,no,[END]
they,were,coming,down,[END]
down,the,milkwater,[END]
chett,raised,his,eyes,and,there,it,was,[END]
the,river's,stony,banks,were,bearded,by,ice,its,pale,milky,waters,flowing,endlessly,down,out,of,the,frostfangs,[END]
and,now,mance,rayder,and,his,wildlings,were,flowing,down,the,same,way,[END]
thoren,smallwood,had,returned,in,a,lather,three,days,past,[END]
while,he,was,telling,the,old,bear,what,his,scouts,had,seen,his,man,kedge,whiteye,told,the,rest,of,them,[END]
they're,still,well,up,the,foothills,but,they're,coming,kedge,said,warming,his,hands,over,the,fire,[END]
harma,the,dogshead,has,the,van,the,poxy,bitch,[END]
goady,crept,up,on,her,camp,and,saw,her,plain,by,the,fire,[END]
that,fool,tumberjon,wanted,to,pick,her,off,with,an,arrow,but,smallwood,had,better,sense,[END]
chett,spat,[END]
how,many,were,there,could,you,tell,[END]
many,and,more,[END]
twenty,thirty,thousand,we,didn't,stay,to,count,[END]
harma,had,five,hundred,in,the,van,every,one,ahorse,[END]
the,men,around,the,fire,exchanged,uneasy,looks,[END]
it,was,a,rare,thing,to,find,even,a,dozen,mounted,wildlings,and,five,hundred,[END]
smallwood,sent,bannen,and,me,wide,around,the,van,to,catch,a,peek,at,the,main,body,kedge,went,on,[END]
there,was,no,end,of,them,[END]
they're,moving,slow,as,a,frozen,river,four,five,miles,a,day,but,they,don't,look,like,they,mean,to,go,back,to,their,villages,neither,[END]
more'n,half,were,women,and,children,and,they,were,driving,their,animals,before,them,goats,sheep,even,aurochs,dragging,sledges,[END]
they'd,loaded,up,with,bales,of,fur,and,sides,of,meat,cages,of,chickens,butter,churns,and,spinning,wheels,every,damn,thing,they,own,[END]
the,mules,and,garrons,was,so,heavy,laden,you'd,think,their,backs,would,break,[END]
the,women,as,well,[END]
and,they,follow,the,milkwater,[END]
lark,the,sisterman,asked,[END]
i,said,so,didn't,i,[END]
the,milkwater,would,take,them,past,the,fist,of,the,first,men,the,ancient,ringfort,where,the,night's,watch,had,made,its,camp,[END]
any,man,with,a,thimble,of,sense,could,see,that,it,was,time,to,pull,up,stakes,and,fall,back,on,the,wall,[END]
the,old,bear,had,strengthened,the,fist,with,spikes,and,pits,and,caltrops,but,against,such,a,host,all,that,was,pointless,[END]
if,they,stayed,here,they,would,be,engulfed,and,overwhelmed,[END]
and,thoren,smallwood,wanted,to,attack,[END]
sweet,donnel,hill,was,squire,to,ser,mallador,locke,and,the,night,before,last,smallwood,had,come,to,locke's,tent,[END]
ser,mallador,had,been,of,the,same,mind,as,old,ser,ottyn,wythers,urging,a,retreat,on,the,wall,but,smallwood,wanted,to,convince,him,otherwise,[END]
this,king-beyond-the-wall,will,never,look,for,us,so,far,north,sweet,donnel,reported,him,saying,[END]
and,this,great,host,of,his,is,a,shambling,horde,full,of,useless,mouths,who,won't,know,what,end,of,a,sword,to,hold,[END]
one,blow,will,take,all,the,fight,out,of,them,and,send,them,howling,back,to,their,hovels,for,another,fifty,years,[END]
three,hundred,against,thirty,thousand,[END]
chett,called,that,rank,madness,and,what,was,madder,still,was,that,ser,mallador,had,been,persuaded,and,the,two,of,them,together,were,on,the,point,of,persuading,the,old,bear,[END]
if,we,wait,too,long,this,chance,may,be,lost,never,to,come,again,smallwood,was,saying,to,anyone,who,would,listen,[END]
against,that,ser,ottyn,wythers,said,we,are,the,shield,that,guards,the,realms,of,men,[END]
you,do,not,throw,away,your,shield,for,no,good,purpose,but,to,that,thoren,smallwood,said,in,a,swordfight,a,man's,surest,defense,is,the,swift,stroke,that,slays,his,foe,not,cringing,behind,a,shield,[END]
neither,smallwood,nor,wythers,had,the,command,though,[END]
lord,mormont,did,and,mormont,was,waiting,for,his,other,scouts,for,jarman,buckwell,and,the,men,who'd,climbed,the,giant's,stair,and,for,qhorin,halfhand,and,jon,snow,who'd,gone,to,probe,the,skirling,pass,[END]
buckwell,and,the,halfhand,were,late,in,returning,though,[END]
dead,most,like,[END]
chett,pictured,jon,snow,lying,blue,and,frozen,on,some,bleak,mountaintop,with,a,wildling,spear,up,his,bastard's,arse,[END]
the,thought,made,him,smile,[END]
i,hope,they,killed,his,bloody,wolf,as,well,[END]
there's,no,bear,here,he,decided,abruptly,[END]
just,an,old,print,that's,all,[END]
back,to,the,fist,[END]
the,dogs,almost,yanked,him,off,his,feet,as,eager,to,get,back,as,he,was,[END]
maybe,they,thought,they,were,going,to,get,fed,[END]
chett,had,to,laugh,[END]
he,hadn't,fed,them,for,three,days,now,to,turn,them,mean,and,hungry,[END]
tonight,before,slipping,off,into,the,dark,he'd,turn,them,loose,among,the,horse,lines,after,sweet,donnel,hill,and,clubfoot,karl,cut,the,tethers,[END]
they'll,have,snarling,hounds,and,panicked,horses,all,over,the,fist,running,through,fires,jumping,the,ringwall,and,trampling,down,tents,[END]
with,all,the,confusion,it,might,be,hours,before,anyone,noticed,that,fourteen,brothers,were,missing,[END]
lark,had,wanted,to,bring,in,twice,that,number,but,what,could,you,expect,from,some,stupid,fishbreath,sisterman,[END]
whisper,a,word,in,the,wrong,ear,and,before,you,knew,it,you'd,be,short,a,head,[END]
no,fourteen,was,a,good,number,enough,to,do,what,needed,doing,but,not,so,many,that,they,couldn't,keep,the,secret,[END]
chett,had,recruited,most,of,them,himself,[END]
small,paul,was,one,of,his,the,strongest,man,on,the,wall,even,if,he,was,slower,than,a,dead,snail,[END]
he'd,once,broken,a,wildling's,back,with,a,hug,[END]
they,had,dirk,as,well,named,for,his,favorite,weapon,and,the,little,grey,man,the,brothers,called,softfoot,who'd,raped,a,hundred,women,in,his,youth,and,liked,to,boast,how,none,had,ever,seen,nor,heard,him,until,he,shoved,it,up,inside,them,[END]
the,plan,was,chett's,[END]
he,was,the,clever,one,he'd,been,steward,to,old,maester,aemon,for,four,good,years,before,that,bastard,jon,snow,had,done,him,out,so,his,job,could,be,handed,to,his,fat,pig,of,a,friend,[END]
when,he,killed,sam,tarly,tonight,he,planned,to,whisper,give,my,love,to,lord,snow,right,in,his,ear,before,he,sliced,ser,piggy's,throat,open,to,let,the,blood,come,bubbling,out,through,all,those,layers,of,suet,[END]
chett,knew,the,ravens,so,he,wouldn't,have,no,trouble,there,no,more,than,he,would,with,tarly,[END]
one,touch,of,the,knife,and,that,craven,would,piss,his,pants,and,start,blubbering,for,his,life,[END]
let,him,beg,it,won't,do,him,no,good,[END]
after,he,opened,his,throat,he'd,open,the,cages,and,shoo,the,birds,away,so,no,messages,reached,the,wall,[END]
softfoot,and,small,paul,would,kill,the,old,bear,dirk,would,do,blane,and,lark,and,his,cousins,would,silence,bannen,and,old,dywen,to,keep,them,from,sniffing,after,their,trail,[END]
they'd,been,caching,food,for,a,fortnight,and,sweet,donnel,and,clubfoot,karl,would,have,the,horses,ready,[END]
with,mormont,dead,command,would,pass,to,ser,ottyn,wythers,an,old,done,man,and,failing,[END]
he'll,be,running,for,the,wall,before,sundown,and,he,won't,waste,no,men,sending,them,after,us,neither,[END]
the,dogs,pulled,at,him,as,they,made,their,way,through,the,trees,[END]
chett,could,see,the,fist,punching,its,way,up,through,the,green,[END]
the,day,was,so,dark,that,the,old,bear,had,the,torches,lit,a,great,circle,of,them,burning,all,along,the,ringwall,that,crowned,the,top,of,the,steep,stony,hill,[END]
the,three,of,them,waded,across,a,brook,[END]
the,water,was,icy,cold,and,patches,of,ice,were,spreading,across,its,surface,[END]
i'm,going,to,make,for,the,coast,lark,the,sisterman,confided,[END]
me,and,my,cousins,[END]
we'll,build,us,a,boat,sail,back,home,to,the,sisters,[END]
and,at,home,they'll,know,you,for,deserters,and,lop,off,your,fool,heads,thought,chett,[END]
there,was,no,leaving,the,night's,watch,once,you,said,your,words,[END]
anywhere,in,the,seven,kingdoms,they'd,take,you,and,kill,you,[END]
ollo,lophand,now,he,was,talking,about,sailing,back,to,tyrosh,where,he,claimed,men,didn't,lose,their,hands,for,a,bit,of,honest,thievery,nor,get,sent,off,to,freeze,their,life,away,for,being,found,in,bed,with,some,knight's,wife,[END]
chett,had,weighed,going,with,him,but,he,didn't,speak,their,wet,girly,tongue,[END]
and,what,could,he,do,in,tyrosh,[END]
he,had,no,trade,to,speak,of,growing,up,in,hag's,mire,[END]
his,father,had,spent,his,life,grubbing,in,other,men's,fields,and,collecting,leeches,[END]
he'd,strip,down,bare,but,for,a,thick,leather,clout,and,go,wading,in,the,murky,waters,[END]
when,he,climbed,out,he'd,be,covered,from,nipple,to,ankle,[END]
sometimes,he,made,chett,help,pull,the,leeches,off,[END]
one,had,attached,itself,to,his,palm,once,and,he'd,smashed,it,against,a,wall,in,revulsion,[END]
his,father,beat,him,bloody,for,that,[END]
the,maesters,bought,the,leeches,at,twelve-for-a-penny,[END]
lark,could,go,home,if,he,liked,and,the,damn,tyroshi,too,but,not,chett,[END]
if,he,never,saw,hag's,mire,again,it,would,be,too,bloody,soon,[END]
he,had,liked,the,look,of,craster's,keep,himself,[END]
craster,lived,high,as,a,lord,there,so,why,shouldn't,he,do,the,same,[END]
that,would,be,a,laugh,[END]
chett,the,leechman's,son,a,lord,with,a,keep,[END]
his,banner,could,be,a,dozen,leeches,on,a,field,of,pink,[END]
but,why,stop,at,lord,[END]
maybe,he,should,be,a,king,[END]
mance,rayder,started,out,a,crow,[END]
i,could,be,a,king,same,as,him,and,have,me,some,wives,[END]
craster,had,nineteen,not,even,counting,the,young,ones,the,daughters,he,hadn't,gotten,around,to,bedding,yet,[END]
half,them,wives,were,as,old,and,ugly,as,craster,but,that,didn't,matter,[END]
the,old,ones,chett,could,put,to,work,cooking,and,cleaning,for,him,pulling,carrots,and,slopping,pigs,while,the,young,ones,warmed,his,bed,and,bore,his,children,[END]
craster,wouldn't,object,not,once,small,paul,gave,him,a,hug,[END]
the,only,women,chett,had,ever,known,were,the,whores,he'd,bought,in,mole's,town,[END]
when,he'd,been,younger,the,village,girls,took,one,look,at,his,face,with,its,boils,and,its,wen,and,turned,away,sickened,[END]
the,worst,was,that,slattern,bessa,[END]
she'd,spread,her,legs,for,every,boy,in,hag's,mire,so,he'd,figured,why,not,him,too,[END]
he,even,spent,a,morning,picking,wildflowers,when,he,heard,she,liked,them,but,she'd,just,laughed,in,his,face,and,told,him,she'd,crawl,in,a,bed,with,his,father's,leeches,before,she'd,crawl,in,one,with,him,[END]
she,stopped,laughing,when,he,put,his,knife,in,her,[END]
that,was,sweet,the,look,on,her,face,so,he,pulled,the,knife,out,and,put,it,in,her,again,[END]
when,they,caught,him,down,near,sevenstreams,old,lord,walder,frey,hadn't,even,bothered,to,come,himself,to,do,the,judging,[END]
he'd,sent,one,of,his,bastards,that,walder,rivers,and,the,next,thing,chett,had,known,he,was,walking,to,the,wall,with,that,foul-smelling,black,devil,yoren,[END]
to,pay,for,his,one,sweet,moment,they,took,his,whole,life,[END]
but,now,he,meant,to,take,it,back,and,craster's,women,too,[END]
that,twisted,old,wildling,has,the,right,of,it,[END]
if,you,want,a,woman,to,wife,you,take,her,and,none,of,this,giving,her,flowers,so,that,maybe,she,don't,notice,your,bloody,boils,[END]
chett,didn't,mean,to,make,that,mistake,again,[END]
it,would,work,he,promised,himself,for,the,hundredth,time,[END]
so,long,as,we,get,away,clean,[END]
ser,ottyn,would,strike,south,for,the,shadow,tower,the,shortest,way,to,the,wall,[END]
he,won't,bother,with,us,not,wythers,all,he'll,want,is,to,get,back,whole,[END]
thoren,smallwood,now,he'd,want,to,press,on,with,the,attack,but,ser,ottyn's,caution,ran,too,deep,and,he,was,senior,[END]
it,won't,matter,anyhow,[END]
once,we're,gone,smallwood,can,attack,anyone,he,likes,[END]
what,do,we,care,[END]
if,none,of,them,ever,returns,to,the,wall,no,one,will,ever,come,looking,for,us,they'll,think,we,died,with,the,rest,[END]
that,was,a,new,thought,and,for,a,moment,it,tempted,him,[END]
but,they,would,need,to,kill,ser,ottyn,and,ser,mallador,locke,as,well,to,give,smallwood,the,command,and,both,of,them,were,well-attended,day,and,night,[END]
no,the,risk,was,too,great,[END]
chett,said,small,paul,as,they,trudged,along,a,stony,game,trail,through,sentinels,and,soldier,pines,what,about,the,bird,[END]
what,bloody,bird,[END]
the,last,thing,he,needed,now,was,some,mutton-head,going,on,about,a,bird,[END]
the,old,bear's,raven,small,paul,said,[END]
if,we,kill,him,who's,going,to,feed,his,bird,[END]
who,bloody,well,cares,[END]
kill,the,bird,too,if,you,like,[END]
i,don't,want,to,hurt,no,bird,the,big,man,said,[END]
but,that's,a,talking,bird,[END]
what,if,it,tells,what,we,did,[END]
lark,the,sisterman,laughed,[END]
small,paul,thick,as,a,castle,wall,he,mocked,[END]
you,shut,up,with,that,said,small,paul,dangerously,[END]
paul,said,chett,before,the,big,man,got,too,angry,when,they,find,the,old,man,lying,in,a,pool,of,blood,with,his,throat,slit,they,won't,need,no,bird,to,tell,them,someone,killed,him,[END]
small,paul,chewed,on,that,a,moment,[END]
that's,true,he,allowed,[END]
can,i,keep,the,bird,then,[END]
i,like,that,bird,[END]
he's,yours,said,chett,just,to,shut,him,up,[END]
we,can,always,eat,him,if,we,get,hungry,offered,lark,[END]
small,paul,clouded,up,again,[END]
best,not,try,and,eat,my,bird,lark,[END]
best,not,[END]
chett,could,hear,voices,drifting,through,the,trees,[END]
close,your,bloody,mouths,both,of,you,[END]
we're,almost,to,the,fist,[END]
they,emerged,near,the,west,face,of,the,hill,and,walked,around,south,where,the,slope,was,gentler,[END]
near,the,edge,of,the,forest,a,dozen,men,were,taking,archery,practice,[END]
they,had,carved,outlines,on,the,trunks,of,trees,and,were,loosing,shafts,at,them,[END]
look,said,lark,[END]
a,pig,with,a,bow,[END]
sure,enough,the,nearest,bowman,was,ser,piggy,himself,the,fat,boy,who,had,stolen,his,place,with,maester,aemon,[END]
just,the,sight,of,samwell,tarly,filled,him,with,anger,[END]
stewarding,for,maester,aemon,had,been,as,good,a,life,as,he'd,ever,known,[END]
the,old,blind,man,was,undemanding,and,clydas,had,taken,care,of,most,of,his,wants,anyway,[END]
chett's,duties,were,easy,cleaning,the,rookery,a,few,fires,to,build,a,few,meals,to,fetch,[END]
and,aemon,never,once,hit,him,[END]

tully,men,did,not,surrender,easily,no,matter,the,odds,[END]

the,hills,were,not,high,nor,especially,steep,but,there,seemed,to,be,no,end,of,them,and,they,soon,grew,tired,of,climbing,up,one,and,down,the,other,and,found,themselves,following,the,lay,of,the,land,along,streambeds,and,through,a,maze,of,shallow,wooded,valleys,where,the,trees,made,a,solid,canopy,overhead,[END]

she,had,to,ride,a,good,half,mile,along,the,bank,before,she,finally,found,a,place,where,it,looked,as,though,it,might,be,safe,to,cross,and,even,then,her,mare,was,reluctant,to,enter,the,water,[END]
the,river,whatever,its,name,was,running,brown,and,fast,and,the,deep,part,in,the,middle,came,up,past,the,horse's,belly,[END]

you,ask,that,[END]
you,who,killed,your,mother,to,come,into,the,world,[END]

why,do,you,care,[END]
he,asked,unwilling,even,to,speak,shae's,name,in,his,presence,[END]
i,don't,[END]
no,more,than,i,care,if,they,live,or,die,[END]
it,was,you,who,had,yaya,whipped,[END]
it,was,not,a,question,[END]
your,sister,told,me,of,your,threats,against,my,grandsons,[END]
lord,tywin's,voice,was,colder,than,ice,[END]
did,she,lie,[END]
tyrion,would,not,deny,it,[END]

so,the,kettleblacks,would,not,misuse,her,[END]
to,save,a,whore's,virtue,you,threatened,your,own,house,your,own,kin,[END]
is,that,the,way,of,it,[END]
you,were,the,one,who,taught,me,that,a,good,threat,is,often,more,telling,than,a,blow,[END]
not,that,joffrey,hasn't,tempted,me,sore,a,few,hundred,times,[END]
if,you're,so,anxious,to,whip,people,start,with,him,[END]

why,would,i,harm,tommen,[END]
he's,a,good,lad,and,mine,own,blood,[END]
as,was,your,mother,[END]
lord,tywin,rose,abruptly,to,tower,over,his,dwarf,son,[END]

he,watched,the,sail,grow,for,a,long,time,trying,to,decide,whether,he,would,sooner,live,or,die,[END]
dying,would,be,easier,he,knew,[END]
all,he,had,to,do,was,crawl,inside,his,cave,and,let,the,ship,pass,by,and,death,would,find,him,[END]
for,days,now,the,fever,had,been,burning,through,him,turning,his,bowels,to,brown,water,and,making,him,shiver,in,his,restless,sleep,[END]
each,morning,found,him,weaker,[END]
it,will,not,be,much,longer,he,had,taken,to,telling,himself,[END]
if,the,fever,did,not,kill,him,thirst,surely,would,[END]
he,had,no,fresh,water,here,but,for,the,occasional,rainfall,that,pooled,in,hollows,on,the,rock,[END]
only,three,days,past,or,had,it,been,four,[END]
on,his,rock,it,was,hard,to,tell,the,days,apart,his,pools,had,been,dry,as,old,bone,and,the,sight,of,the,bay,rippling,green,and,grey,all,around,him,had,been,almost,more,than,he,could,bear,[END]
once,he,began,to,drink,seawater,the,end,would,come,swiftly,he,knew,but,all,the,same,he,had,almost,taken,that,first,swallow,so,parched,was,his,throat,[END]
a,sudden,squall,had,saved,him,[END]
he,had,grown,so,feeble,by,then,that,it,was,all,he,could,do,to,lie,in,the,rain,with,his,eyes,closed,and,his,mouth,open,and,let,the,water,splash,down,on,his,cracked,lips,and,swollen,tongue,[END]
but,afterward,he,felt,a,little,stronger,and,the,island's,pools,and,cracks,and,crevices,once,more,had,brimmed,with,life,[END]
but,that,had,been,three,days,ago,or,maybe,four,and,most,of,the,water,was,gone,now,[END]
some,had,evaporated,and,he,had,sucked,up,the,rest,[END]
by,the,morrow,he,would,be,tasting,the,mud,again,and,licking,the,damp,cold,stones,at,the,bottom,of,the,depressions,[END]
and,if,not,thirst,or,fever,starvation,would,kill,him,[END]
his,island,was,no,more,than,a,barren,spire,jutting,up,out,of,the,immensity,of,blackwater,bay,[END]
when,the,tide,was,low,he,could,sometimes,find,tiny,crabs,along,the,stony,strand,where,he,had,washed,ashore,after,the,battle,[END]
they,nipped,his,fingers,painfully,before,he,smashed,them,apart,on,the,rocks,to,suck,the,meat,from,their,claws,and,the,guts,from,their,shells,[END]
but,the,strand,vanished,whenever,the,tide,came,rushing,in,and,davos,had,to,scramble,up,the,rock,to,keep,from,being,swept,out,into,the,bay,once,more,[END]
the,point,of,the,spire,was,fifteen,feet,above,the,water,at,high,tide,but,when,the,bay,grew,rough,the,spray,went,even,higher,so,there,was,no,way,to,keep,dry,even,in,his,cave,which,was,really,no,more,than,a,hollow,in,the,rock,beneath,an,overhang,[END]
nothing,grew,on,the,rock,but,lichen,and,even,the,seabirds,shunned,the,place,[END]
now,and,again,some,gulls,would,land,atop,the,spire,and,davos,would,try,to,catch,one,but,they,were,too,quick,for,him,to,get,close,[END]
he,took,to,flinging,stones,at,them,but,he,was,too,weak,to,throw,with,much,force,so,even,when,his,stones,hit,the,gulls,would,only,scream,at,him,in,annoyance,and,then,take,to,the,air,[END]
there,were,other,rocks,visible,from,his,refuge,distant,stony,spires,taller,than,his,own,[END]
the,nearest,stood,a,good,forty,feet,above,the,water,he,guessed,though,it,was,hard,to,be,sure,at,this,distance,[END]
a,cloud,of,gulls,swirled,about,it,constantly,and,often,davos,thought,of,crossing,over,to,raid,their,nests,[END]
but,the,water,was,cold,here,the,currents,strong,and,treacherous,and,he,knew,he,did,not,have,the,strength,for,such,a,swim,[END]
that,would,kill,him,as,sure,as,drinking,seawater,[END]
autumn,in,the,narrow,sea,could,often,be,wet,and,rainy,he,remembered,from,years,past,[END]
the,days,were,not,bad,so,long,as,the,sun,was,shining,but,the,nights,were,growing,colder,and,sometimes,the,wind,would,come,gusting,across,the,bay,driving,a,line,of,whitecaps,before,it,and,before,long,davos,would,be,soaked,and,shivering,[END]
fever,and,chills,assaulted,him,in,turn,and,of,late,he,had,developed,a,persistent,racking,cough,[END]
his,cave,was,all,the,shelter,he,had,and,that,was,little,enough,[END]
driftwood,and,bits,of,charred,debris,would,wash,up,on,the,strand,during,low,tide,but,he,had,no,way,to,strike,a,spark,or,start,a,fire,[END]
once,in,desperation,he,had,tried,rubbing,two,pieces,of,driftwood,against,each,other,but,the,wood,was,rotted,and,his,efforts,earned,him,only,blisters,[END]
his,clothes,were,sodden,as,well,and,he,had,lost,one,of,his,boots,somewhere,in,the,bay,before,he,washed,up,here,[END]
thirst,hunger,exposure,[END]
they,were,his,companions,with,him,every,hour,of,every,day,and,in,time,he,had,come,to,think,of,them,as,his,friends,[END]
soon,enough,one,or,the,other,of,his,friends,would,take,pity,on,him,and,free,him,from,this,endless,misery,[END]
or,perhaps,he,would,simply,walk,into,the,water,one,day,and,strike,out,for,the,shore,that,he,knew,lay,somewhere,to,the,north,beyond,his,sight,[END]
it,was,too,far,to,swim,as,weak,as,he,was,but,that,did,not,matter,[END]
davos,had,always,been,a,sailor,he,was,meant,to,die,at,sea,[END]
the,gods,beneath,the,waters,have,been,waiting,for,me,he,told,himself,[END]
it's,past,time,i,went,to,them,[END]
but,now,there,was,a,sail,only,a,speck,on,the,horizon,but,growing,larger,[END]
a,ship,where,no,ship,should,be,[END]
he,knew,where,his,rock,lay,more,or,less,it,was,one,of,a,series,of,sea,monts,that,rose,from,the,floor,of,blackwater,bay,[END]

when,your,father,learned,the,king,was,coming,he,sent,word,to,his,brother,benjen,on,the,wall,so,he,might,come,down,for,the,feast,[END]
there,is,more,commerce,between,the,black,brothers,and,the,free,folk,than,you,know,and,soon,enough,word,came,to,my,ears,as,well,[END]

the,wall,can,stop,an,army,but,not,a,man,alone,[END]
i,took,a,lute,and,a,bag,of,silver,scaled,the,ice,near,long,barrow,walked,a,few,leagues,south,of,the,new,gift,and,bought,a,horse,[END]
all,in,all,i,made,much,better,time,than,robert,who,was,traveling,with,a,ponderous,great,wheelhouse,to,keep,his,queen,in,comfort,[END]
a,day,south,of,winterfell,i,came,up,on,him,and,fell,in,with,his,company,[END]
freeriders,and,hedge,knights,are,always,attaching,themselves,to,royal,processions,in,hopes,of,finding,service,with,the,king,and,my,lute,gained,me,easy,acceptance,[END]

daenerys,[END]
across,the,still,blue,water,came,the,slow,steady,beat,of,drums,and,the,soft,swish,of,oars,from,the,galleys,[END]
the,great,cog,groaned,in,their,wake,the,heavy,lines,stretched,taut,between,[END]
balerion's,sails,hung,limp,drooping,forlorn,from,the,masts,[END]
yet,even,so,as,she,stood,upon,the,forecastle,watching,her,dragons,chase,each,other,across,a,cloudless,blue,sky,daenerys,targaryen,was,as,happy,as,she,could,ever,remember,being,[END]
her,dothraki,called,the,sea,the,poison,water,distrusting,any,liquid,that,their,horses,could,not,drink,[END]
on,the,day,the,three,ships,had,lifted,anchor,at,quarth,you,would,have,thought,they,were,sailing,to,hell,instead,of,pentos,[END]
her,brave,young,bloodriders,had,stared,off,at,the,dwindling,coastline,with,huge,white,eyes,each,of,the,three,determined,to,show,no,fear,before,the,other,two,while,her,handmaids,irri,and,jhiqui,clutched,the,rail,desperately,and,retched,over,the,side,at,every,little,swell,[END]
the,rest,of,dany's,tiny,khalasar,remained,below,decks,preferring,the,company,of,their,nervous,horses,to,the,terrifying,landless,world,about,the,ships,[END]
when,a,sudden,squall,had,enveloped,them,six,days,into,the,voyage,she,heard,them,through,the,hatches,the,horses,kicking,and,screaming,the,riders,praying,in,thin,quavery,voices,each,time,balerion,heaved,or,swayed,[END]
no,squall,could,frighten,dany,though,[END]
daenerys,stormborn,she,was,called,for,she,had,come,howling,into,the,world,on,distant,dragonstone,as,the,greatest,storm,in,the,memory,of,westeros,howled,outside,a,storm,so,fierce,that,it,ripped,gargoyles,from,the,castle,walls,and,smashed,her,father's,fleet,to,kindling,[END]
the,narrow,sea,was,often,stormy,and,dany,had,crossed,it,half,a,hundred,times,as,a,girl,running,from,one,free,city,to,the,next,half,a,step,ahead,of,the,usurper's,hired,knives,[END]
she,loved,the,sea,[END]
she,liked,the,sharp,salty,smell,of,the,air,and,the,vastness,of,horizons,bounded,only,by,a,vault,of,azure,sky,above,[END]
it,made,her,feel,small,but,free,as,well,[END]
she,liked,the,dolphins,that,sometimes,swam,along,beside,balerion,slicing,through,the,waves,like,silvery,spears,and,the,flying,fish,they,glimpsed,now,and,again,[END]
she,even,liked,the,sailors,with,all,their,songs,and,stories,[END]
once,on,a,voyage,to,braavos,as,she'd,watched,the,crew,wrestle,down,a,great,green,sail,in,a,rising,gale,she,had,even,thought,how,fine,it,would,be,to,be,a,sailor,[END]
but,when,she,told,her,brother,viserys,had,twisted,her,hair,until,she,cried,[END]
you,are,blood,of,the,dragon,he,had,screamed,at,her,[END]
a,dragon,not,some,smelly,fish,[END]
he,was,a,fool,about,that,and,so,much,else,dany,thought,[END]
if,he,had,been,wiser,and,more,patient,it,would,be,him,sailing,west,to,take,the,throne,that,was,his,by,rights,[END]
viserys,had,been,stupid,and,vicious,she,had,come,to,realize,yet,sometimes,she,missed,him,all,the,same,[END]
not,the,cruel,weak,man,he,had,become,by,the,end,but,the,brother,who,had,sometimes,let,her,creep,into,his,bed,the,boy,who,told,her,tales,of,the,seven,kingdoms,and,talked,of,how,much,better,their,lives,would,be,once,he,claimed,his,crown,[END]
the,captain,appeared,at,her,elbow,[END]
would,that,this,balerion,could,soar,as,her,namesake,did,your,grace,he,said,in,bastard,valyrian,heavily,flavored,with,accents,of,pentos,[END]
then,we,should,not,need,to,row,nor,tow,nor,pray,for,wind,[END]
just,so,captain,she,answered,with,a,smile,pleased,to,have,won,the,man,over,[END]
captain,groleo,was,an,old,pentoshi,like,his,master,illyrio,mopatis,and,he,had,been,nervous,as,a,maiden,about,carrying,three,dragons,on,his,ship,[END]
half,a,hundred,buckets,of,seawater,still,hung,from,the,gunwales,in,case,of,fires,[END]
at,first,groleo,had,wanted,the,dragons,caged,and,dany,had,consented,to,put,his,fears,at,ease,but,their,misery,was,so,palpable,that,she,soon,changed,her,mind,and,insisted,they,be,freed,[END]
even,captain,groleo,was,glad,of,that,now,[END]
there,had,been,one,small,fire,easily,extinguished,against,that,balerion,suddenly,seemed,to,have,far,fewer,rats,than,she'd,had,before,when,she,sailed,under,the,name,saduleon,[END]
and,her,crew,once,as,fearful,as,they,were,curious,had,begun,to,take,a,queer,fierce,pride,in,their,dragons,[END]
every,man,of,them,from,captain,to,cook's,boy,loved,to,watch,the,three,fly,[END]
though,none,so,much,as,dany,[END]
they,are,my,children,she,told,herself,and,if,the,maegi,spoke,truly,they,are,the,only,children,i,am,ever,like,to,have,[END]
viserion's,scales,were,the,color,of,fresh,cream,his,horns,wing,bones,and,spinal,crest,a,dark,gold,that,flashed,bright,as,metal,in,the,sun,[END]
rhaegal,was,made,of,the,green,of,summer,and,the,bronze,of,fall,[END]
they,soared,above,the,ships,in,wide,circles,higher,and,higher,each,trying,to,climb,above,the,other,[END]
dragons,always,preferred,to,attack,from,above,dany,had,learned,[END]
should,either,get,between,the,other,and,the,sun,he,would,fold,his,wings,and,dive,screaming,and,they,would,tumble,from,the,sky,locked,together,in,a,tangled,scaly,ball,jaws,snapping,and,tails,lashing,[END]
the,first,time,they,had,done,it,she,feared,that,they,meant,to,kill,each,other,but,it,was,only,sport,[END]
no,sooner,would,they,splash,into,the,sea,than,they,would,break,apart,and,rise,again,shrieking,and,hissing,the,salt,water,steaming,off,them,as,their,wings,clawed,at,the,air,[END]
drogon,was,aloft,as,well,though,not,in,sight,he,would,be,miles,ahead,or,miles,behind,hunting,[END]
he,was,always,hungry,her,drogon,[END]
hungry,and,growing,fast,[END]
another,year,or,perhaps,two,and,he,may,be,large,enough,to,ride,[END]
then,i,shall,have,no,need,of,ships,to,cross,the,great,salt,sea,[END]
but,that,time,was,not,yet,come,[END]
rhaegal,and,viserion,were,the,size,of,small,dogs,drogon,only,a,little,larger,and,any,dog,would,have,out-weighed,them,they,were,all,wings,and,neck,and,tail,lighter,than,they,looked,[END]
and,so,daenerys,targaryen,must,rely,on,wood,and,wind,and,canvas,to,bear,her,home,[END]
the,wood,and,the,canvas,had,served,her,well,enough,so,far,but,the,fickle,wind,had,turned,traitor,[END]
for,six,days,and,six,nights,they,had,been,becalmed,and,now,a,seventh,day,had,come,and,still,no,breath,of,air,to,fill,their,sails,[END]
fortunately,two,of,the,ships,that,magister,illyrio,had,sent,after,her,were,trading,galleys,with,two,hundred,oars,apiece,and,crews,of,strong-armed,oarsmen,to,row,them,[END]
but,the,great,cog,balerion,was,a,song,of,a,different,key,a,ponderous,broad-beamed,sow,of,a,ship,with,immense,holds,and,huge,sails,but,helpless,in,a,calm,[END]
vhagar,and,meraxes,had,let,out,lines,to,tow,her,but,it,made,for,painfully,slow,going,[END]
all,three,ships,were,crowded,and,heavily,laden,[END]
i,cannot,see,drogon,said,ser,jorah,mormont,as,he,joined,her,on,the,forecastle,[END]
is,he,lost,again,[END]
we,are,the,ones,who,are,lost,ser,[END]
drogon,has,no,taste,for,this,wet,creeping,no,more,than,i,do,[END]
bolder,than,the,other,two,her,black,dragon,had,been,the,first,to,try,his,wings,above,the,water,the,first,to,flutter,from,ship,to,ship,the,first,to,lose,himself,in,a,passing,cloud,[END]
and,the,first,to,kill,[END]
the,flying,fish,no,sooner,broke,the,surface,of,the,water,than,they,were,enveloped,in,a,lance,of,flame,snatched,up,and,swallowed,[END]
how,big,will,he,grow,[END]
dany,asked,curiously,[END]
do,you,know,[END]
in,the,seven,kingdoms,there,are,tales,of,dragons,who,grew,so,huge,that,they,could,pluck,giant,krakens,from,the,seas,[END]
dany,laughed,[END]
that,would,be,a,wondrous,sight,to,see,[END]
it,is,only,a,tale,khaleesi,said,her,exile,knight,[END]
they,talk,of,wise,old,dragons,living,a,thousand,years,as,well,[END]
well,how,long,does,a,dragon,live,[END]
she,looked,up,as,viserion,swooped,low,over,the,ship,his,wings,beating,slowly,and,stirring,the,limp,sails,[END]
ser,jorah,shrugged,[END]
a,dragon's,natural,span,of,days,is,many,times,as,long,as,a,man's,or,so,the,songs,would,have,us,believe,[END]
but,the,dragons,the,seven,kingdoms,knew,best,were,those,of,house,targaryen,[END]
they,were,bred,for,war,and,in,war,they,died,[END]
it,is,no,easy,thing,to,slay,a,dragon,but,it,can,be,done,[END]
the,squire,whitebeard,standing,by,the,figurehead,with,one,lean,hand,curled,about,his,tall,hardwood,staff,turned,toward,them,and,said,balerion,the,black,dread,was,two,hundred,years,old,when,he,died,during,the,reign,of,jaehaerys,the,conciliator,[END]

the,dragonpit,it,is,called,[END]
it,still,stands,atop,the,hill,of,rhaenys,though,all,in,ruins,now,[END]
that,was,where,the,royal,dragons,dwelt,in,days,of,yore,and,a,cavernous,dwelling,it,was,with,iron,doors,so,wide,that,thirty,knights,could,ride,through,them,abreast,[END]
yet,even,so,it,was,noted,that,none,of,the,pit,dragons,ever,reached,the,size,of,their,ancestors,[END]
the,maesters,say,it,was,because,of,the,walls,around,them,and,the,great,dome,above,their,heads,[END]

the,coverlet,slipped,off,dany's,shoulder,and,she,tugged,it,back,into,place,[END]
it,was,four,hundred,years,ago,or,more,when,the,dothraki,first,rode,out,of,the,east,sacking,and,burning,every,town,and,city,in,their,path,[END]
the,khal,who,led,them,was,named,temmo,[END]
his,khalasar,was,not,so,big,as,drogo's,but,it,was,big,enough,[END]
fifty,thousand,at,the,least,[END]
half,of,them,braided,warriors,with,bells,ringing,in,their,hair,[END]
the,qohorik,knew,he,was,coming,[END]
they,strengthened,their,walls,doubled,the,size,of,their,own,guard,and,hired,two,free,companies,besides,the,bright,banners,and,the,second,sons,[END]
and,almost,as,an,afterthought,they,sent,a,man,to,astapor,to,buy,three,thousand,unsullied,[END]
it,was,a,long,march,back,to,qohor,however,and,as,they,approached,they,saw,the,smoke,and,dust,and,heard,the,distant,din,of,battle,[END]
by,the,time,the,unsullied,reached,the,city,the,sun,had,set,[END]
crows,and,wolves,were,feasting,beneath,the,walls,on,what,remained,of,the,qohorik,heavy,horse,[END]
the,bright,banners,and,second,sons,had,fled,as,sellswords,are,wont,to,do,in,the,face,of,hopeless,odds,[END]
with,dark,falling,the,dothraki,had,retired,to,their,own,camps,to,drink,and,dance,and,feast,but,none,doubted,that,they,would,return,on,the,morrow,to,smash,the,city,gates,storm,the,walls,and,rape,loot,and,slave,as,they,pleased,[END]
but,when,dawn,broke,and,temmo,and,his,bloodriders,led,their,khalasar,out,of,camp,they,found,three,thousand,unsullied,drawn,up,before,the,gates,with,the,black,goat,standard,flying,over,their,heads,[END]
so,small,a,force,could,easily,have,been,flanked,but,you,know,dothraki,[END]
these,were,men,on,foot,and,men,on,foot,are,fit,only,to,be,ridden,down,[END]
the,dothraki,charged,[END]
the,unsullied,locked,their,shields,lowered,their,spears,and,stood,firm,[END]
against,twenty,thousand,screamers,with,bells,in,their,hair,they,stood,firm,[END]
eighteen,times,the,dothraki,charged,and,broke,themselves,on,those,shields,and,spears,like,waves,on,a,rocky,shore,[END]
thrice,temmo,sent,his,archers,wheeling,past,and,arrows,fell,like,rain,upon,the,three,thousand,but,the,unsullied,merely,lifted,their,shields,above,their,heads,until,the,squall,had,passed,[END]
in,the,end,only,six,hundred,of,them,remained,[END]
but,more,than,twelve,thousand,dothraki,lay,dead,upon,that,field,including,khal,temmo,his,bloodriders,his,kos,and,all,his,sons,[END]
on,the,morning,of,the,fourth,day,the,new,khal,led,the,survivors,past,the,city,gates,in,a,stately,procession,[END]
one,by,one,each,man,cut,off,his,braid,and,threw,it,down,before,the,feet,of,the,three,thousand,[END]

he,hoped,she,might,strike,the,irons,off,his,wrists,as,well,but,brienne,was,still,suspicious,[END]
she,split,the,ankle,chain,in,the,center,with,a,half-dozen,sharp,blows,from,the,smith's,hammer,delivered,to,the,blunt,end,of,a,steel,chisel,[END]
when,he,suggested,that,she,break,the,wrist,chain,as,well,she,ignored,him,[END]

jaime's,mount,plodded,along,placidly,though,the,poor,old,thing,had,a,tendency,to,want,to,drift,off,to,the,side,of,his,good,eye,[END]
it,felt,good,to,be,mounted,once,more,[END]
he,had,not,been,on,a,horse,since,robb,stark's,archers,had,killed,his,destrier,under,him,in,the,whispering,wood,[END]
when,they,reached,the,burned,village,a,choice,of,equally,unpromising,roads,confronted,them,narrow,tracks,deeply,rutted,by,the,carts,of,farmers,hauling,their,grain,to,the,river,[END]

brienne,considered,them,briefly,and,then,swung,her,horse,onto,the,southern,road,[END]

the,man,took,too,great,an,interest,in,our,choice,of,route,and,those,woods,[END]
such,places,are,notorious,haunts,of,outlaws,[END]
he,may,have,been,urging,us,into,a,trap,[END]

our,host,has,friends,down,that,road,i,would,venture,[END]
the,ones,whose,mounts,gave,that,stable,such,a,memorable,aroma,[END]
he,may,have,been,lying,about,the,river,as,well,to,put,us,on,these,horses,the,wench,said,but,i,could,not,take,the,risk,[END]
there,will,be,soldiers,at,the,ruby,ford,and,the,crossroads,[END]
well,she,may,be,ugly,but,she's,not,entirely,stupid,[END]
jaime,gave,her,a,grudging,smile,[END]
the,ruddy,light,from,the,upper,windows,of,the,stone,towerhouse,gave,them,warning,of,its,presence,a,long,way,off,and,brienne,led,them,off,into,the,fields,[END]
only,when,the,stronghold,was,well,to,the,rear,did,they,angle,back,and,find,the,road,again,[END]
half,the,night,passed,before,the,wench,allowed,that,it,might,be,safe,to,stop,[END]
by,then,all,three,of,them,were,drooping,in,their,saddles,[END]
they,sheltered,in,a,small,grove,of,oak,and,ash,beside,a,sluggish,stream,[END]
the,wench,would,allow,no,fire,so,they,shared,a,midnight,supper,of,stale,oatcakes,and,salt,fish,[END]
the,night,was,strangely,peaceful,[END]
the,half-moon,sat,overhead,in,a,black,felt,sky,surrounded,by,stars,[END]
off,in,the,distance,some,wolves,were,howling,[END]
one,of,their,horses,whickered,nervously,[END]

what,a,wretched,creature,this,one,is,[END]
she,reminded,him,of,tyrion,in,some,queer,way,though,at,first,blush,two,people,could,scarcely,be,any,more,dissimilar,[END]

the,king,[END]
it,always,came,back,to,aerys,[END]
don't,presume,to,judge,what,you,do,not,understand,wench,[END]
my,name,is,[END]
brienne,yes,[END]
has,anyone,ever,told,you,that,you're,as,tedious,as,you,are,ugly,[END]
you,will,not,provoke,me,to,anger,kingslayer,[END]
oh,i,might,if,i,cared,enough,to,try,[END]
why,did,you,take,the,oath,[END]
she,demanded,[END]
why,don,the,white,cloak,if,you,meant,to,betray,all,it,stood,for,[END]
why,[END]
what,could,he,say,that,she,might,possibly,understand,[END]
i,was,a,boy,[END]
fifteen,[END]
it,was,a,great,honor,for,one,so,young,[END]
that,is,no,answer,she,said,scornfully,[END]
you,would,not,like,the,truth,[END]
he,had,joined,the,kingsguard,for,love,of,course,[END]
their,father,had,summoned,cersei,to,court,when,she,was,twelve,hoping,to,make,her,a,royal,marriage,[END]
he,refused,every,offer,for,her,hand,preferring,to,keep,her,with,him,in,the,tower,of,the,hand,while,she,grew,older,and,more,womanly,and,ever,more,beautiful,[END]
no,doubt,he,was,waiting,for,prince,viserys,to,mature,or,perhaps,for,rhaegar's,wife,to,die,in,childbed,[END]
elia,of,dorne,was,never,the,healthiest,of,women,[END]
jaime,meantime,had,spent,four,years,as,squire,to,ser,sumner,crake-hall,and,earned,his,spurs,against,the,kingswood,brotherhood,[END]
but,when,he,made,a,brief,call,at,king's,landing,on,his,way,back,to,casterly,rock,chiefly,to,see,his,sister,cersei,took,him,aside,and,whispered,that,lord,tywin,meant,to,marry,him,to,lysa,tully,had,gone,so,far,as,to,invite,lord,hoster,to,the,city,to,discuss,dower,[END]
but,if,jaime,took,the,white,he,could,be,near,her,always,[END]
old,ser,harlan,grandison,had,died,in,his,sleep,as,was,only,appropriate,for,one,whose,sigil,was,a,sleeping,lion,[END]
aerys,would,want,a,young,man,to,take,his,place,so,why,not,a,roaring,lion,in,place,of,a,sleepy,one,[END]
father,will,never,consent,jaime,objected,[END]
the,king,won't,ask,him,[END]
and,once,it's,done,father,can't,object,not,openly,[END]
aerys,had,ser,ilyn,payne's,tongue,torn,out,just,for,boasting,that,it,was,the,hand,who,truly,ruled,the,seven,kingdoms,[END]
the,captain,of,the,hand's,guard,and,yet,father,dared,not,try,and,stop,it,[END]
he,won't,stop,this,either,[END]
but,jaime,said,there's,casterly,rock,[END]
is,it,a,rock,you,want,[END]
or,me,[END]
he,remembered,that,night,as,if,it,were,yesterday,[END]
they,spent,it,in,an,old,inn,on,eel,alley,well,away,from,watchful,eyes,[END]
cersei,had,come,to,him,dressed,as,a,simple,serving,wench,which,somehow,excited,him,all,the,more,[END]
jaime,had,never,seen,her,more,passionate,[END]
every,time,he,went,to,sleep,she,woke,him,again,[END]
by,morning,casterly,rock,seemed,a,small,price,to,pay,to,be,near,her,always,[END]
he,gave,his,consent,and,cersei,promised,to,do,the,rest,[END]
a,moon's,turn,later,a,royal,raven,arrived,at,casterly,rock,to,inform,him,that,he,had,been,chosen,for,the,kingsguard,[END]
he,was,commanded,to,present,himself,to,the,king,during,the,great,tourney,at,harrenhal,to,say,his,vows,and,don,his,cloak,[END]
jaime's,investiture,freed,him,from,lysa,tully,[END]
elsewise,nothing,went,as,planned,[END]
his,father,had,never,been,more,furious,[END]
he,could,not,object,openly,cersei,had,judged,that,correctly,but,he,resigned,the,handship,on,some,thin,pretext,and,returned,to,casterly,rock,taking,his,daughter,with,him,[END]
instead,of,being,together,cersei,and,jaime,just,changed,places,and,he,found,himself,alone,at,court,guarding,a,mad,king,while,four,lesser,men,took,their,turns,dancing,on,knives,in,his,father's,ill-fitting,shoes,[END]
so,swiftly,did,the,hands,rise,and,fall,that,jaime,remembered,their,heraldry,better,than,their,faces,[END]
the,horn-of-plenty,hand,and,the,dancing,griffins,hand,had,both,been,exiled,the,mace-and-dagger,hand,dipped,in,wildfire,and,burned,alive,[END]
lord,rossart,had,been,the,last,[END]
his,sigil,had,been,a,burning,torch,an,unfortunate,choice,given,the,fate,of,his,predecessor,but,the,alchemist,had,been,elevated,largely,because,he,shared,the,king's,passion,for,fire,[END]
i,ought,to,have,drowned,rossart,instead,of,gutting,him,[END]
brienne,was,still,awaiting,his,answer,[END]
jaime,said,you,are,not,old,enough,to,have,known,aerys,targaryen,[END]
she,would,not,hear,it,[END]
aerys,was,mad,and,cruel,no,one,has,ever,denied,that,[END]
he,was,still,king,crowned,and,anointed,[END]
and,you,had,sworn,to,protect,him,[END]
i,know,what,i,swore,[END]
and,what,you,did,[END]
she,loomed,above,him,six,feet,of,freckled,frowning,horse-toothed,disapproval,[END]
yes,and,what,you,did,as,well,[END]
we're,both,kingslayers,here,if,what,i've,heard,is,true,[END]
i,never,harmed,renly,[END]
i'll,kill,the,man,who,says,i,did,[END]
best,start,with,cleos,then,[END]
and,you'll,have,a,deal,of,killing,to,do,after,that,the,way,he,tells,the,tale,[END]
lies,[END]
lady,catelyn,was,there,when,his,grace,was,murdered,she,saw,[END]
there,was,a,shadow,[END]
the,candles,guttered,and,the,air,grew,cold,and,there,was,blood,[END]
oh,very,good,[END]
jaime,laughed,[END]
your,wits,are,quicker,than,mine,i,confess,it,[END]
when,they,found,me,standing,over,my,dead,king,i,never,thought,to,say,no,no,it,wasn't,me,it,was,a,shadow,a,terrible,cold,shadow,',[END]
he,laughed,again,[END]
tell,me,true,one,kingslayer,to,another,did,the,starks,pay,you,to,slit,his,throat,or,was,it,stannis,[END]
had,renly,spurned,you,was,that,the,way,of,it,[END]
or,perhaps,your,moon's,blood,was,on,you,[END]
never,give,a,wench,a,sword,when,she's,bleeding,[END]
for,a,moment,jaime,thought,brienne,might,strike,him,[END]
a,step,closer,and,i'll,snatch,that,dagger,from,her,sheath,and,bury,it,up,her,womb,[END]
he,gathered,a,leg,under,him,ready,to,spring,but,the,wench,did,not,move,[END]
it,is,a,rare,and,precious,gift,to,be,a,knight,she,said,and,even,more,so,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,[END]
it,is,a,gift,given,to,few,a,gift,you,scorned,and,soiled,[END]
a,gift,you,want,desperately,wench,and,can,never,have,[END]
i,earned,my,knighthood,[END]
nothing,was,given,to,me,[END]
i,won,a,tourney,mêlée,at,thirteen,when,i,was,yet,a,squire,[END]
at,fifteen,i,rode,with,ser,arthur,dayne,against,the,kingswood,brotherhood,and,he,knighted,me,on,the,battlefield,[END]
it,was,that,white,cloak,that,soiled,me,not,the,other,way,around,[END]
so,spare,me,your,envy,[END]
it,was,the,gods,who,neglected,to,give,you,a,cock,not,me,[END]
the,look,brienne,gave,him,then,was,full,of,loathing,[END]
she,would,gladly,hack,me,to,pieces,but,for,her,precious,vow,he,reflected,[END]
good,[END]
i've,had,enough,of,feeble,pieties,and,maidens',judgments,[END]
the,wench,stalked,off,without,saying,a,word,[END]
jaime,curled,up,beneath,his,cloak,hoping,to,dream,of,cersei,[END]
but,when,he,closed,his,eyes,it,was,aerys,targaryen,he,saw,pacing,alone,in,his,throne,room,picking,at,his,scabbed,and,bleeding,hands,[END]
the,fool,was,always,cutting,himself,on,the,blades,and,barbs,of,the,iron,throne,[END]
jaime,had,slipped,in,through,the,king's,door,clad,in,his,golden,armor,sword,in,hand,[END]
the,golden,armor,not,the,white,but,no,one,ever,remembers,that,[END]
would,that,i,had,taken,off,that,damned,cloak,as,well,[END]
when,aerys,saw,the,blood,on,his,blade,he,demanded,to,know,if,it,was,lord,tywin's,[END]
i,want,him,dead,the,traitor,[END]
i,want,his,head,you'll,bring,me,his,head,or,you'll,burn,with,all,the,rest,[END]
all,the,traitors,[END]
rossart,says,they,are,inside,the,walls,[END]
he's,gone,to,make,them,a,warm,welcome,[END]
whose,blood,[END]
whose,[END]
rossart's,answered,jaime,[END]
those,purple,eyes,grew,huge,then,and,the,royal,mouth,drooped,open,in,shock,[END]
he,lost,control,of,his,bowels,turned,and,ran,for,the,iron,throne,[END]
beneath,the,empty,eyes,of,the,skulls,on,the,walls,jaime,hauled,the,last,dragonking,bodily,off,the,steps,squealing,like,a,pig,and,smelling,like,a,privy,[END]
a,single,slash,across,his,throat,was,all,it,took,to,end,it,[END]
so,easy,he,remembered,thinking,[END]
a,king,should,die,harder,than,this,[END]
rossart,at,least,had,tried,to,make,a,fight,of,it,though,if,truth,be,told,he,fought,like,an,alchemist,[END]
queer,that,they,never,ask,who,killed,rossart,[END]
but,of,course,he,was,no,one,lowborn,hand,for,a,fortnight,just,another,mad,fancy,of,the,mad,king,[END]
ser,elys,westerling,and,lord,crakehall,and,others,of,his,father's,knights,burst,into,the,hall,in,time,to,see,the,last,of,it,so,there,was,no,way,for,jaime,to,vanish,and,let,some,braggart,steal,the,praise,or,blame,[END]
it,would,be,blame,he,knew,at,once,when,he,saw,the,way,they,looked,at,him,[END]
though,perhaps,that,was,fear,[END]
lannister,or,no,he,was,one,of,aerys's,seven,[END]
the,castle,is,ours,ser,and,the,city,roland,crakehall,told,him,which,was,half,true,[END]
targaryen,loyalists,were,still,dying,on,the,serpentine,steps,and,in,the,armory,gregor,clegane,and,amory,lorch,were,scaling,the,walls,of,maegor's,holdfast,and,ned,stark,was,leading,his,northmen,through,the,king's,gate,even,then,but,crakehall,could,not,have,known,that,[END]
he,had,not,seemed,surprised,to,find,aerys,slain,jaime,had,been,lord,tywin's,son,long,before,he,had,been,named,to,the,kingsguard,[END]
tell,them,the,mad,king,is,dead,he,commanded,[END]
spare,all,those,who,yield,and,hold,them,captive,[END]
shall,i,proclaim,a,new,king,as,well,[END]
crakehall,asked,and,jaime,read,the,question,plain,shall,it,be,your,father,or,robert,baratheon,or,do,you,mean,to,try,to,make,a,new,dragonking,[END]
he,thought,for,a,moment,of,the,boy,viserys,fled,to,dragonstone,and,of,rhaegar's,infant,son,aegon,still,in,maegor's,with,his,mother,[END]
a,new,targaryen,king,and,my,father,as,hand,[END]
how,the,wolves,will,howl,and,the,storm,lord,choke,with,rage,[END]
for,a,moment,he,was,tempted,until,he,glanced,down,again,at,the,body,on,the,floor,in,its,spreading,pool,of,blood,[END]
his,blood,is,in,both,of,them,he,thought,[END]
proclaim,who,you,bloody,well,like,he,told,crakehall,[END]
then,he,climbed,the,iron,throne,and,seated,himself,with,his,sword,across,his,knees,to,see,who,would,come,to,claim,the,kingdom,[END]
as,it,happened,it,had,been,eddard,stark,[END]
you,had,no,right,to,judge,me,either,stark,[END]
in,his,dreams,the,dead,came,burning,gowned,in,swirling,green,flames,[END]
jaime,danced,around,them,with,a,golden,sword,but,for,every,one,he,struck,down,two,more,arose,to,take,his,place,[END]
brienne,woke,him,with,a,boot,in,the,ribs,[END]
the,world,was,still,black,and,it,had,begun,to,rain,[END]
they,broke,their,fast,on,oatcakes,salt,fish,and,some,blackberries,that,ser,cleos,had,found,and,were,back,in,the,saddle,before,the,sun,came,up,[END]
tyrion,[END]
the,eunuch,was,humming,tunelessly,to,himself,as,he,came,through,the,door,dressed,in,flowing,robes,of,peach-colored,silk,and,smelling,of,lemons,[END]
when,he,saw,tyrion,seated,by,the,hearth,he,stopped,and,grew,very,still,[END]
my,lord,tyrion,came,out,in,a,squeak,punctuated,by,a,nervous,giggle,[END]
so,you,do,remember,me,[END]
i,had,begun,to,wonder,[END]
it,is,so,very,good,to,see,you,looking,so,strong,and,well,[END]
varys,smiled,his,slimiest,smile,[END]
though,i,confess,i,had,not,thought,to,find,you,in,mine,own,humble,chambers,[END]
they,are,humble,[END]
excessively,so,in,truth,[END]
tyrion,had,waited,until,varys,was,summoned,by,his,father,before,slipping,in,to,pay,him,a,visit,[END]
the,eunuch's,apartments,were,sparse,and,small,three,snug,windowless,chambers,under,the,north,wall,[END]
i'd,hoped,to,discover,bushel,baskets,of,juicy,secrets,to,while,away,the,waiting,but,there's,not,a,paper,to,be,found,[END]
he'd,searched,for,hidden,passages,too,knowing,the,spider,must,have,ways,of,coming,and,going,unseen,but,those,had,proved,equally,elusive,[END]
there,was,water,in,your,flagon,gods,have,mercy,he,went,on,your,sleeping,cell,is,no,wider,than,a,coffin,and,that,bed,[END]
is,it,actually,made,of,stone,or,does,it,only,feel,that,way,[END]
varys,closed,the,door,and,barred,it,[END]
i,am,plagued,with,backaches,my,lord,and,prefer,to,sleep,upon,a,hard,surface,[END]
i,would,have,taken,you,for,a,featherbed,man,[END]
i,am,full,of,surprises,[END]
are,you,cross,with,me,for,abandoning,you,after,the,battle,[END]
it,made,me,think,of,you,as,one,of,my,family,[END]
it,was,not,for,want,of,love,my,good,lord,[END]
i,have,such,a,delicate,disposition,and,your,scar,is,so,dreadful,to,look,upon,[END]
he,gave,an,exaggerated,shudder,[END]
your,poor,nose,[END]
tyrion,rubbed,irritably,at,the,scab,[END]
perhaps,i,should,have,a,new,one,made,of,gold,[END]
what,sort,of,nose,would,you,suggest,varys,[END]
one,like,yours,to,smell,out,secrets,[END]
or,should,i,tell,the,goldsmith,that,i,want,my,father's,nose,[END]
he,smiled,[END]
my,noble,father,labors,so,diligently,that,i,scarce,see,him,anymore,[END]
tell,me,is,it,true,that,he's,restoring,grand,maester,pycelle,to,the,small,council,[END]
it,is,my,lord,[END]
do,i,have,my,sweet,sister,to,thank,for,that,[END]
pycelle,had,been,his,sister's,creature,tyrion,had,stripped,the,man,of,office,beard,and,dignity,and,flung,him,down,into,a,black,cell,[END]
not,at,all,my,lord,[END]
thank,the,archmaesters,of,oldtown,those,who,wished,to,insist,on,pycelle's,restoration,on,the,grounds,that,only,the,conclave,may,make,or,unmake,a,grand,maester,[END]
bloody,fools,thought,tyrion,[END]
i,seem,to,recall,that,maegor,the,cruel's,headsman,unmade,three,with,his,axe,[END]
quite,true,varys,said,[END]
and,the,second,aegon,fed,grand,maester,gerardys,to,his,dragon,[END]
alas,i,am,quite,dragonless,[END]
i,suppose,i,could,have,dipped,pycelle,in,wildfire,and,set,him,ablaze,[END]
would,the,citadel,have,preferred,that,[END]
well,it,would,have,been,more,in,keeping,with,tradition,[END]
the,eunuch,tittered,[END]
thankfully,wiser,heads,prevailed,and,the,conclave,accepted,the,fact,of,pycelle's,dismissal,and,set,about,choosing,his,successor,[END]
after,giving,due,consideration,to,maester,turquin,the,cordwainer's,son,and,maester,erreck,the,hedge,knight's,bastard,and,thereby,demonstrating,to,their,own,satisfaction,that,ability,counts,for,more,than,birth,in,their,order,the,conclave,was,on,the,verge,of,sending,us,maester,gormon,a,tyrell,of,highgarden,[END]
when,i,told,your,lord,father,he,acted,at,once,[END]
the,conclave,met,in,oldtown,behind,closed,doors,tyrion,knew,its,deliberations,were,supposedly,a,secret,[END]
so,varys,has,little,birds,in,the,citadel,too,[END]
i,see,[END]
so,my,father,decided,to,nip,the,rose,before,it,bloomed,[END]
he,had,to,chuckle,[END]
pycelle,is,a,toad,[END]
but,better,a,lannister,toad,than,a,tyrell,toad,no,[END]
grand,maester,pycelle,has,always,been,a,good,friend,to,your,house,varys,said,sweetly,[END]
perhaps,it,will,console,you,to,learn,that,ser,boros,blount,is,also,being,restored,[END]
cersei,had,stripped,ser,boros,of,his,white,cloak,for,failing,to,die,in,the,defense,of,prince,tommen,when,bronn,had,seized,the,boy,on,the,rosby,road,[END]
the,man,was,no,friend,of,tyrion's,but,after,that,he,likely,hated,cersei,almost,as,much,[END]
i,suppose,that's,something,[END]
blount,is,a,blustering,coward,he,said,amiably,[END]
is,he,[END]
oh,dear,[END]
still,the,knights,of,the,kingsguard,do,serve,for,life,traditionally,[END]
perhaps,ser,boros,will,prove,braver,in,future,[END]
he,will,no,doubt,remain,very,loyal,[END]
to,my,father,said,tyrion,pointedly,[END]
while,we,are,on,the,subject,of,the,kingsguard,[END]
i,wonder,could,this,delightfully,unexpected,visit,of,yours,happen,to,concern,ser,boros's,fallen,brother,the,gallant,ser,mandon,moore,[END]
the,eunuch,stroked,a,powdered,cheek,[END]
your,man,bronn,seems,most,interested,in,him,of,late,[END]
bronn,had,turned,up,all,he,could,on,ser,mandon,but,no,doubt,varys,knew,a,deal,more,[END]
should,he,choose,to,share,it,[END]
the,man,seems,to,have,been,quite,friendless,tyrion,said,carefully,[END]
sadly,said,varys,oh,sadly,[END]
you,might,find,some,kin,if,you,turned,over,enough,stones,back,in,the,vale,but,here,[END]
lord,arryn,brought,him,to,king's,landing,and,robert,gave,him,his,white,cloak,but,neither,loved,him,much,i,fear,[END]
nor,was,he,the,sort,the,smallfolk,cheer,in,tourneys,despite,his,undoubted,prowess,[END]
why,even,his,brothers,of,the,kingsguard,never,warmed,to,him,[END]
ser,barristan,was,once,heard,to,say,that,the,man,had,no,friend,but,his,sword,and,no,life,but,duty,[END]
but,you,know,i,do,not,think,selmy,meant,it,altogether,as,praise,[END]
which,is,queer,when,you,consider,it,is,it,not,[END]
those,are,the,very,qualities,we,seek,in,our,kingsguard,it,could,be,said,men,who,live,not,for,themselves,but,for,their,king,[END]
by,those,lights,our,brave,ser,mandon,was,the,perfect,white,knight,[END]
and,he,died,as,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,ought,with,sword,in,hand,defending,one,of,the,king's,own,blood,[END]
the,eunuch,gave,him,a,slimy,smile,and,watched,him,sharply,[END]
trying,to,murder,one,of,the,king's,own,blood,you,mean,[END]
tyrion,wondered,if,varys,knew,rather,more,than,he,was,saying,[END]
nothing,he'd,just,heard,was,new,to,him,bronn,had,brought,back,much,the,same,reports,[END]
he,needed,a,link,to,cersei,some,sign,that,ser,mandon,had,been,his,sister's,catspaw,[END]
what,we,want,is,not,always,what,we,get,he,reflected,bitterly,which,reminded,him,[END]
it,is,not,ser,mandon,who,brings,me,here,[END]
to,be,sure,[END]
the,eunuch,crossed,the,room,to,his,flagon,of,water,[END]
may,i,serve,you,my,lord,[END]
he,asked,as,he,filled,a,cup,[END]
yes,[END]
but,not,with,water,[END]
he,folded,his,hands,together,[END]
i,want,you,to,bring,me,shae,[END]
varys,took,a,drink,[END]
is,that,wise,my,lord,[END]
the,dear,sweet,child,[END]
it,would,be,such,a,shame,if,your,father,hanged,her,[END]
it,did,not,surprise,him,that,varys,knew,[END]
no,it's,not,wise,it's,bloody,madness,[END]
i,want,to,see,her,one,last,time,before,i,send,her,away,[END]
i,cannot,abide,having,her,so,close,[END]
i,understand,[END]
how,could,you,[END]
tyrion,had,seen,her,only,yesterday,climbing,the,serpentine,steps,with,a,pail,of,water,[END]
he,had,watched,as,a,young,knight,had,offered,to,carry,the,heavy,pail,[END]
the,way,she,had,touched,his,arm,and,smiled,for,him,had,tied,tyrion's,guts,into,knots,[END]
they,passed,within,inches,of,each,other,him,descending,and,her,climbing,so,close,that,he,could,smell,the,clean,fresh,scent,of,her,hair,[END]
m'lord,she'd,said,to,him,with,a,little,curtsy,and,he,wanted,to,reach,out,and,grab,her,and,kiss,her,right,there,but,all,he,could,do,was,nod,stiffly,and,waddle,on,past,[END]
i,have,seen,her,several,times,he,told,varys,but,i,dare,not,speak,to,her,[END]
i,suspect,that,all,my,movements,are,being,watched,[END]
you,are,wise,to,suspect,so,my,good,lord,[END]
who,[END]
he,cocked,his,head,[END]
the,kettleblacks,report,frequently,to,your,sweet,sister,[END]
when,i,think,of,how,much,coin,i,paid,those,wretched,[END]
do,you,think,there's,any,chance,that,more,gold,might,win,them,away,from,cersei,[END]
there,is,always,a,chance,but,i,should,not,care,to,wager,on,the,likelihood,[END]
they,are,knights,now,all,three,and,your,sister,has,promised,them,further,advancement,[END]
a,wicked,little,titter,burst,from,the,eunuch's,lips,[END]
and,the,eldest,ser,osmund,of,the,kingsguard,dreams,of,certain,other,[END]
favors,[END]
as,well,[END]
you,can,match,the,queen,coin,for,coin,i,have,no,doubt,but,she,has,a,second,purse,that,is,quite,inexhaustible,[END]
seven,hells,thought,tyrion,[END]
are,you,suggesting,that,cersei's,fucking,osmund,kettleblack,[END]
oh,dear,me,no,that,would,be,dreadfully,dangerous,don't,you,think,[END]
no,the,queen,only,hints,[END]
perhaps,on,the,morrow,or,when,the,wedding's,done,[END]
and,then,a,smile,a,whisper,a,ribald,jest,[END]
a,breast,brushing,lightly,against,his,sleeve,as,they,pass,[END]
and,yet,it,seems,to,serve,[END]
but,what,would,a,eunuch,know,of,such,things,[END]
the,tip,of,his,tongue,ran,across,his,lower,lip,like,a,shy,pink,animal,[END]
if,i,could,somehow,push,them,beyond,sly,fondling,arrange,for,father,to,catch,them,abed,together,[END]
tyrion,fingered,the,scab,on,his,nose,[END]
he,did,not,see,how,it,could,be,done,but,perhaps,some,plan,would,come,to,him,later,[END]
are,the,kettleblacks,the,only,ones,[END]
would,that,were,true,my,lord,[END]
i,fear,there,are,many,eyes,upon,you,[END]
you,are,[END]
how,shall,we,say,[END]
conspicuous,[END]
and,not,well,loved,it,grieves,me,to,tell,you,[END]
janos,slynt's,sons,would,gladly,inform,on,you,to,avenge,their,father,and,our,sweet,lord,petyr,has,friends,in,half,the,brothels,of,king's,landing,[END]
should,you,be,so,unwise,as,to,visit,any,of,them,he,will,know,at,once,and,your,lord,father,soon,thereafter,[END]
it's,even,worse,than,i,feared,[END]
and,my,father,[END]
who,does,he,have,spying,on,me,[END]
this,time,the,eunuch,laughed,aloud,[END]
why,me,my,lord,[END]
tyrion,laughed,as,well,[END]
he,was,not,so,great,a,fool,as,to,trust,varys,any,further,than,he,had,to,but,the,eunuch,already,knew,enough,about,shae,to,get,her,well,and,thoroughly,hanged,[END]
you,will,bring,shae,to,me,through,the,walls,hidden,from,all,these,eyes,[END]
as,you,have,done,before,[END]
varys,wrung,his,hands,[END]
oh,my,lord,nothing,would,please,me,more,but,[END]
king,maegor,wanted,no,rats,in,his,own,walls,if,you,take,my,meaning,[END]
he,did,require,a,means,of,secret,egress,should,he,ever,be,trapped,by,his,enemies,but,that,door,does,not,connect,with,any,other,passages,[END]
i,can,steal,your,shae,away,from,lady,lollys,for,a,time,to,be,sure,but,i,have,no,way,to,bring,her,to,your,bedchamber,without,us,being,seen,[END]
then,bring,her,somewhere,else,[END]
but,where,[END]
there,is,no,safe,place,[END]
there,is,[END]
tyrion,grinned,[END]
here,[END]
it's,time,to,put,that,rock-hard,bed,of,yours,to,better,use,i,think,[END]
the,eunuch's,mouth,opened,[END]
then,he,giggled,[END]
lollys,tires,easily,these,days,[END]
she,is,great,with,child,[END]
i,imagine,she,will,be,safely,asleep,by,moonrise,[END]
tyrion,hopped,down,from,the,chair,[END]
moonrise,then,[END]
see,that,you,lay,in,some,wine,[END]
and,two,clean,cups,[END]
varys,bowed,[END]
it,shall,be,as,my,lord,commands,[END]
the,rest,of,the,day,seemed,to,creep,by,as,slow,as,a,worm,in,molasses,[END]
tyrion,climbed,to,the,castle,library,and,tried,to,distract,himself,with,beldecar's,history,of,the,rhoynish,wars,but,he,could,hardly,see,the,elephants,for,imagining,shae's,smile,[END]
come,the,afternoon,he,put,the,book,aside,and,called,for,a,bath,[END]
he,scrubbed,himself,until,the,water,grew,cool,and,then,had,pod,even,out,his,whiskers,[END]
his,beard,was,a,trial,to,him,a,tangle,of,yellow,white,and,black,hairs,patchy,and,coarse,it,was,seldom,less,than,unsightly,but,it,did,serve,to,conceal,some,of,his,face,and,that,was,all,to,the,good,[END]
when,he,was,as,clean,and,pink,and,trimmed,as,he,was,like,to,get,tyrion,looked,over,his,wardrobe,and,chose,a,pair,of,tight,satin,breeches,in,lannister,crimson,and,his,best,doublet,the,heavy,black,velvet,with,the,lion's,head,studs,[END]
he,would,have,donned,his,chain,of,golden,hands,as,well,if,his,father,hadn't,stolen,it,while,he,lay,dying,[END]
it,was,not,until,he,was,dressed,that,he,realized,the,depths,of,his,folly,[END]
seven,hells,dwarf,did,you,lose,all,your,sense,along,with,your,nose,[END]
anyone,who,sees,you,is,going,to,wonder,why,you've,put,on,your,court,clothes,to,visit,the,eunuch,[END]
cursing,tyrion,stripped,and,dressed,again,in,simpler,garb,black,woolen,breeches,an,old,white,tunic,and,a,faded,brown,leather,jerkin,[END]
it,doesn't,matter,he,told,himself,as,he,waited,for,moonrise,[END]
whatever,you,wear,you're,still,a,dwarf,[END]
you'll,never,be,as,tall,as,that,knight,on,the,steps,him,with,his,long,straight,legs,and,hard,stomach,and,wide,manly,shoulders,[END]
the,moon,was,peeping,over,the,castle,wall,when,he,told,podrick,payne,that,he,was,going,to,pay,a,call,on,varys,[END]
will,you,be,long,my,lord,[END]
the,boy,asked,[END]
oh,i,hope,so,[END]
with,the,red,keep,so,crowded,tyrion,could,not,hope,to,go,unnoticed,[END]
ser,balon,swann,stood,guard,on,the,door,and,ser,loras,tyrell,on,the,drawbridge,[END]
he,stopped,to,exchange,pleasantries,with,both,of,them,[END]
it,was,strange,to,see,the,knight,of,flowers,all,in,white,when,before,he,had,always,been,as,colorful,as,a,rainbow,[END]
how,old,are,you,ser,loras,[END]
tyrion,asked,him,[END]
seventeen,my,lord,[END]
seventeen,and,beautiful,and,already,a,legend,[END]
half,the,girls,in,the,seven,kingdoms,want,to,bed,him,and,all,the,boys,want,to,be,him,[END]
if,you,will,pardon,my,asking,ser,why,would,anyone,choose,to,join,the,kingsguard,at,seventeen,[END]
prince,aemon,the,dragonknight,took,his,vows,at,seventeen,ser,loras,said,and,your,brother,jaime,was,younger,still,[END]
i,know,their,reasons,[END]
what,are,yours,[END]
the,honor,of,serving,beside,such,paragons,as,meryn,trant,and,boros,blount,[END]
he,gave,the,boy,a,mocking,grin,[END]
to,guard,the,king's,life,you,surrender,your,own,[END]
you,give,up,your,lands,and,titles,give,up,hope,of,marriage,children,[END]
house,tyrell,continues,through,my,brothers,ser,loras,said,[END]
it,is,not,necessary,for,a,third,son,to,wed,or,breed,[END]
not,necessary,but,some,find,it,pleasant,[END]
what,of,love,[END]
when,the,sun,has,set,no,candle,can,replace,it,[END]
is,that,from,a,song,[END]
tyrion,cocked,his,head,smiling,[END]
yes,you,are,seventeen,i,see,that,now,[END]
ser,loras,tensed,[END]
do,you,mock,me,[END]
a,prickly,lad,[END]
no,[END]
if,i've,given,offense,forgive,me,[END]
i,had,my,own,love,once,and,we,had,a,song,as,well,[END]
i,loved,a,maid,as,fair,as,summer,with,sunlight,in,her,hair,[END]
he,bid,ser,loras,a,good,evening,and,went,on,his,way,[END]
near,the,kennels,a,group,of,men-at-arms,were,fighting,a,pair,of,dogs,[END]
tyrion,stopped,long,enough,to,see,the,smaller,dog,tear,half,the,face,off,the,larger,one,and,earned,a,few,coarse,laughs,by,observing,that,the,loser,now,resembled,sandor,clegane,[END]
then,hoping,he,had,disarmed,their,suspicions,he,proceeded,to,the,north,wall,and,down,the,short,flight,of,steps,to,the,eunuch's,meager,abode,[END]
the,door,opened,as,he,was,lifting,his,hand,to,knock,[END]
varys,[END]
tyrion,slipped,inside,[END]
are,you,there,[END]
a,single,candle,lit,the,gloom,spicing,the,air,with,the,scent,of,jasmine,[END]
my,lord,[END]
a,woman,sidled,into,the,light,plump,soft,matronly,with,a,round,pink,moon,of,a,face,and,heavy,dark,curls,[END]
tyrion,recoiled,[END]
is,something,amiss,[END]
she,asked,[END]
varys,he,realized,with,annoyance,[END]
for,one,horrid,moment,i,thought,you'd,brought,me,lollys,instead,of,shae,[END]
where,is,she,[END]
here,m'lord,[END]
she,put,her,hands,over,his,eyes,from,behind,[END]
can,you,guess,what,i'm,wearing,[END]
nothing,[END]
oh,you're,so,smart,she,pouted,snatching,her,hands,away,[END]
how,did,you,know,[END]
you're,very,beautiful,in,nothing,[END]
am,i,[END]
she,said,[END]
am,i,truly,[END]
oh,yes,[END]
then,shouldn't,you,be,fucking,me,instead,of,talking,[END]
we,need,to,rid,ourselves,of,lady,varys,first,[END]
i,am,not,the,sort,of,dwarf,who,likes,an,audience,[END]
he's,gone,shae,said,[END]
tyrion,turned,to,look,[END]
it,was,true,[END]
the,eunuch,had,vanished,skirts,and,all,[END]
the,hidden,doors,are,here,somewhere,they,have,to,be,[END]
that,was,as,much,as,he,had,time,to,think,before,shae,turned,his,head,to,kiss,him,[END]
her,mouth,was,wet,and,hungry,and,she,did,not,even,seem,to,see,his,scar,or,the,raw,scab,where,his,nose,had,been,[END]
her,skin,was,warm,silk,beneath,his,fingers,[END]
when,his,thumb,brushed,against,her,left,nipple,it,hardened,at,once,[END]
hurry,she,urged,between,kisses,as,his,fingers,went,to,his,laces,oh,hurry,hurry,i,want,you,in,me,in,me,in,me,[END]
he,did,not,even,have,time,to,undress,properly,[END]
shae,pulled,his,cock,out,of,his,breeches,then,pushed,him,down,onto,the,floor,and,climbed,atop,him,[END]
she,screamed,as,he,pushed,past,her,lips,and,rode,him,wildly,moaning,my,giant,my,giant,my,giant,every,time,she,slammed,down,on,him,[END]
tyrion,was,so,eager,that,he,exploded,on,the,fifth,stroke,but,shae,did,not,seem,to,mind,[END]
she,smiled,wickedly,when,she,felt,him,spurting,and,leaned,forward,to,kiss,the,sweat,from,his,brow,[END]
my,giant,of,lannister,she,murmured,[END]
stay,inside,me,please,[END]
i,like,to,feel,you,there,[END]
so,tyrion,did,not,move,except,to,put,his,arms,around,her,[END]
it,feels,so,good,to,hold,her,and,to,be,held,he,thought,[END]
how,can,something,this,sweet,be,a,crime,worth,hanging,her,for,[END]
shae,he,said,sweetling,this,must,be,our,last,time,together,[END]
the,danger,is,too,great,[END]
if,my,lord,father,should,find,you,[END]
i,like,your,scar,[END]
she,traced,it,with,her,finger,[END]
it,makes,you,look,very,fierce,and,strong,[END]
he,laughed,[END]
very,ugly,you,mean,[END]
m'lord,will,never,be,ugly,in,my,eyes,[END]
she,kissed,the,scab,that,covered,the,ragged,stub,of,his,nose,[END]
it's,not,my,face,that,need,concern,you,it's,my,father,[END]
he,does,not,frighten,me,[END]
will,m'lord,give,me,back,my,jewels,and,silks,now,[END]
i,asked,varys,if,i,could,have,them,when,you,were,hurt,in,the,battle,but,he,wouldn't,give,them,to,me,[END]
what,would,have,become,of,them,if,you'd,died,[END]
i,didn't,die,[END]
here,i,am,[END]
i,know,[END]
shae,wriggled,atop,him,smiling,[END]
just,where,you,belong,[END]
her,mouth,turned,pouty,[END]
but,how,long,must,i,go,on,with,lollys,now,that,you're,well,[END]
have,you,been,listening,[END]
tyrion,said,[END]
you,can,stay,with,lollys,if,you,like,but,it,would,be,best,if,you,left,the,city,[END]
i,don't,want,to,leave,[END]
you,promised,you'd,move,me,into,a,manse,again,after,the,battle,[END]
her,cunt,gave,him,a,little,squeeze,and,he,started,to,stiffen,again,inside,her,[END]
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts,you,said,[END]
shae,gods,be,damned,stop,that,[END]
listen,to,me,[END]
you,have,to,go,away,[END]
the,city's,full,of,tyrells,just,now,and,i,am,closely,watched,[END]
you,don't,understand,the,dangers,[END]
can,i,come,to,the,king's,wedding,feast,[END]
lollys,won't,go,[END]
i,told,her,no,one's,like,to,rape,her,in,the,king's,own,throne,room,but,she's,so,stupid,[END]
when,shae,rolled,off,his,cock,slid,out,of,her,with,a,soft,wet,sound,[END]
symon,says,there's,to,be,a,singers',tourney,and,tumblers,even,a,fools',joust,[END]
tyrion,had,almost,forgotten,about,shae's,thrice-damned,singer,[END]
how,is,it,you,spoke,to,symon,[END]
i,told,lady,tanda,about,him,and,she,hired,him,to,play,for,lollys,[END]
the,music,calms,her,when,the,baby,starts,to,kick,[END]
symon,says,there's,to,be,a,dancing,bear,at,the,feast,and,wines,from,the,arbor,[END]
i've,never,seen,a,bear,dance,[END]
they,do,it,worse,than,i,do,[END]
it,was,the,singer,who,concerned,him,not,the,bear,[END]
one,careless,word,in,the,wrong,ear,and,shae,would,hang,[END]
symon,says,there's,to,be,seventy-seven,courses,and,a,hundred,doves,baked,into,a,great,pie,shae,gushed,[END]
when,the,crust's,opened,they'll,all,burst,out,and,fly,[END]
after,which,they,will,roost,in,the,rafters,and,rain,down,birdshit,on,the,guests,[END]
tyrion,had,suffered,such,wedding,pies,before,[END]
the,doves,liked,to,shit,on,him,especially,or,so,he,had,always,suspected,[END]
couldn't,i,dress,in,my,silks,and,velvets,and,go,as,a,lady,instead,of,a,maidservant,[END]
no,one,would,know,i,wasn't,[END]
everyone,would,know,you,weren't,thought,tyrion,[END]
lady,tanda,might,wonder,where,lollys's,bedmaid,found,so,many,jewels,[END]
there's,to,be,a,thousand,guests,symon,says,[END]
she'd,never,even,see,me,[END]
i'd,find,a,place,in,some,dark,corner,below,the,salt,but,whenever,you,got,up,to,go,to,the,privy,i,could,slip,out,and,meet,you,[END]
she,cupped,his,cock,and,stroked,it,gently,[END]
i,won't,wear,any,smallclothes,under,my,gown,so,m'lord,won't,even,need,to,unlace,me,[END]
her,fingers,teased,him,up,and,down,[END]
or,if,he,liked,i,could,do,this,for,him,[END]
she,took,him,in,her,mouth,[END]
tyrion,was,soon,ready,again,[END]
this,time,he,lasted,much,longer,[END]
when,he,finished,shae,crawled,back,up,him,and,curled,up,naked,under,his,arm,[END]
you'll,let,me,come,won't,you,[END]
shae,he,groaned,it,is,not,safe,[END]
for,a,time,she,said,nothing,at,all,[END]
tyrion,tried,to,speak,of,other,things,but,he,met,a,wall,of,sullen,courtesy,as,icy,and,unyielding,as,the,wall,he'd,once,walked,in,the,north,[END]
gods,be,good,he,thought,wearily,as,he,watched,the,candle,burn,down,and,begin,to,gutter,how,could,i,let,this,happen,again,after,tysha,[END]
am,i,as,great,a,fool,as,my,father,thinks,[END]
gladly,would,he,have,given,her,the,promise,she,wanted,and,gladly,walked,her,back,to,his,own,bedchamber,on,his,arm,to,let,her,dress,in,the,silks,and,velvets,she,loved,so,much,[END]
had,the,choice,been,his,she,could,have,sat,beside,him,at,joffrey's,wedding,feast,and,danced,with,all,the,bears,she,liked,[END]
but,he,could,not,see,her,hang,[END]
when,the,candle,burned,out,tyrion,disentangled,himself,and,lit,another,[END]
then,he,made,a,round,of,the,walls,tapping,on,each,in,turn,searching,for,the,hidden,door,[END]
shae,sat,with,her,legs,drawn,up,and,her,arms,wrapped,around,them,watching,him,[END]
finally,she,said,they're,under,the,bed,[END]
the,secret,steps,[END]
he,looked,at,her,incredulous,[END]
the,bed,[END]
the,bed,is,solid,stone,[END]
it,weighs,half,a,ton,[END]
there's,a,place,where,varys,pushes,and,it,floats,right,up,[END]
i,asked,him,how,and,he,said,it,was,magic,[END]
yes,[END]
tyrion,had,to,grin,[END]
a,counterweight,spell,[END]
shae,stood,[END]
i,should,go,back,[END]
sometimes,the,baby,kicks,and,lollys,wakes,and,calls,for,me,[END]
varys,should,return,shortly,[END]
he's,probably,listening,to,every,word,we,say,[END]
tyrion,set,the,candle,down,[END]
there,was,a,wet,spot,on,the,front,of,his,breeches,but,in,the,darkness,it,ought,to,go,unnoticed,[END]
he,told,shae,to,dress,and,wait,for,the,eunuch,[END]
i,will,she,promised,[END]
you,are,my,lion,aren't,you,[END]
my,giant,of,lannister,[END]
i,am,he,said,[END]
and,you're,[END]
your,whore,[END]
she,laid,a,finger,to,his,lips,[END]
i,know,[END]
i'd,be,your,lady,but,i,never,can,[END]
else,you'd,take,me,to,the,feast,[END]
it,doesn't,matter,[END]
i,like,being,a,whore,for,you,tyrion,[END]
just,keep,me,my,lion,and,keep,me,safe,[END]
i,shall,he,promised,[END]
fool,fool,the,voice,inside,him,screamed,[END]
why,did,you,say,that,[END]
you,came,here,to,send,her,away,[END]
instead,he,kissed,her,once,more,[END]
the,walk,back,seemed,long,and,lonely,[END]
podrick,payne,was,asleep,in,his,trundle,bed,at,the,foot,of,tyrion's,but,he,woke,the,boy,[END]
bronn,he,said,[END]
ser,bronn,[END]
pod,rubbed,the,sleep,from,his,eyes,[END]
oh,[END]
should,i,get,him,[END]
my,lord,[END]
why,no,i,woke,you,up,so,we,could,have,a,little,chat,about,the,way,he,dresses,said,tyrion,but,his,sarcasm,was,wasted,[END]
pod,only,gaped,at,him,in,confusion,until,he,threw,up,his,hands,and,said,yes,get,him,[END]
bring,him,[END]
now,[END]
the,lad,dressed,hurriedly,and,all,but,ran,from,the,room,[END]
am,i,really,so,terrifying,[END]
tyrion,wondered,as,he,changed,into,a,bedrobe,and,poured,himself,some,wine,[END]
he,was,on,his,third,cup,and,half,the,night,was,gone,before,pod,finally,returned,with,the,sellsword,knight,in,tow,[END]
i,hope,the,boy,had,a,damn,good,reason,dragging,me,out,of,chataya's,bronn,said,as,he,seated,himself,[END]
chataya's,[END]
tyrion,said,annoyed,[END]
it's,good,to,be,a,knight,[END]
no,more,looking,for,the,cheaper,brothels,down,the,street,[END]
bronn,grinned,[END]
now,it's,alayaya,and,marei,in,the,same,featherbed,with,ser,bronn,in,the,middle,[END]
tyrion,had,to,bite,back,his,annoyance,[END]
bronn,had,as,much,right,to,bed,alayaya,as,any,other,man,but,still,[END]
i,never,touched,her,much,as,i,wanted,to,but,bronn,could,not,know,that,[END]
he,should,have,kept,his,cock,out,of,her,[END]
he,dare,not,visit,chataya's,himself,[END]
if,he,did,cersei,would,see,that,his,father,heard,of,it,and,'yaya,would,suffer,more,than,a,whipping,[END]
he'd,sent,the,girl,a,necklace,of,silver,and,jade,and,a,pair,of,matching,bracelets,by,way,of,apology,but,other,than,that,[END]
this,is,fruitless,[END]
there,is,a,singer,who,calls,himself,symon,silver,tongue,tyrion,said,wearily,pushing,his,guilt,aside,[END]
he,plays,for,lady,tanda's,daughter,sometimes,[END]

when,the,marriage,contract,had,been,made,at,the,twins,old,lord,walder,frey,had,sent,robb,off,with,a,thousand,mounted,knights,and,near,three,thousand,foot,[END]

how,could,you,do,this,robb,[END]
how,could,you,be,so,heedless,so,stupid,[END]
how,could,you,be,so,[END]
so,very,[END]
young,[END]
reproaches,would,not,serve,here,however,[END]
all,she,said,was,tell,me,how,this,came,to,be,[END]
i,took,her,castle,and,she,took,my,heart,[END]
robb,smiled,[END]
the,crag,was,weakly,garrisoned,so,we,took,it,by,storm,one,night,[END]
black,walder,and,the,smalljon,led,scaling,parties,over,the,walls,while,i,broke,the,main,gate,with,a,ram,[END]

it,seemed,nothing,at,first,but,it,festered,[END]

and,she,was,with,me,when,the,greatjon,brought,me,the,news,of,[END]
of,winterfell,[END]
bran,and,rickon,[END]
he,seemed,to,have,trouble,saying,his,brothers',names,[END]
that,night,she,[END]
she,comforted,me,mother,[END]
catelyn,did,not,need,to,be,told,what,sort,of,comfort,jeyne,westerling,had,offered,her,son,[END]
and,you,wed,her,the,next,day,[END]
he,looked,her,in,the,eyes,proud,and,miserable,all,at,once,[END]
it,was,the,only,honorable,thing,to,do,[END]
she's,gentle,and,sweet,mother,she,will,make,me,a,good,wife,[END]
perhaps,[END]
that,will,not,appease,lord,frey,[END]
i,know,her,son,said,stricken,[END]
i've,made,a,botch,of,everything,but,the,battles,haven't,i,[END]
i,thought,the,battles,would,be,the,hard,part,but,[END]
if,i,had,listened,to,you,and,kept,theon,as,my,hostage,i'd,still,rule,the,north,and,bran,and,rickon,would,be,alive,and,safe,in,winterfell,[END]
perhaps,[END]
or,not,[END]
lord,balon,might,still,have,chanced,war,[END]
the,last,time,he,reached,for,a,crown,it,cost,him,two,sons,[END]
he,might,have,thought,it,a,bargain,to,lose,only,one,this,time,[END]
she,touched,his,arm,[END]
what,happened,with,the,freys,after,you,wed,[END]
robb,shook,his,head,[END]
with,ser,stevron,i,might,have,been,able,to,make,amends,but,ser,ryman,is,dull-witted,as,a,stone,and,black,walder,[END]
that,one,was,not,named,for,the,color,of,his,beard,i,promise,you,[END]
he,went,so,far,as,to,say,that,his,sisters,would,not,be,loath,to,wed,a,widower,[END]
i,would,have,killed,him,for,that,if,jeyne,had,not,begged,me,to,be,merciful,[END]
you,have,done,house,frey,a,grievous,insult,robb,[END]
i,never,meant,to,[END]
ser,stevron,died,for,me,and,olyvar,was,as,loyal,a,squire,as,any,king,could,want,[END]
he,asked,to,stay,with,me,but,ser,ryman,took,him,with,the,rest,[END]
all,their,strength,[END]
the,greatjon,urged,me,to,attack,them,[END]
fighting,your,own,in,the,midst,of,your,enemies,[END]
she,said,[END]
it,would,have,been,the,end,of,you,[END]
yes,[END]
i,thought,perhaps,we,could,arrange,other,matches,for,lord,walder's,daughters,[END]
ser,wendel,manderly,has,offered,to,take,one,and,the,greatjon,tells,me,his,uncles,wish,to,wed,again,[END]
if,lord,walder,will,be,reasonable,[END]
he,is,not,reasonable,said,catelyn,[END]
he,is,proud,and,prickly,to,a,fault,[END]
you,know,that,[END]
he,wanted,to,be,grandfather,to,a,king,[END]
you,will,not,appease,him,with,the,offer,of,two,hoary,old,brigands,and,the,second,son,of,the,fattest,man,in,the,seven,kingdoms,[END]
not,only,have,you,broken,your,oath,but,you've,slighted,the,honor,of,the,twins,by,choosing,a,bride,from,a,lesser,house,[END]
robb,bristled,at,that,[END]
the,westerlings,are,better,blood,than,the,freys,[END]
they're,an,ancient,line,descended,from,the,first,men,[END]
the,kings,of,the,rock,sometimes,wed,westerlings,before,the,conquest,and,there,was,another,jeyne,westerling,who,was,queen,to,king,maegor,three,hundred,years,ago,[END]
all,of,which,will,only,salt,lord,walder's,wounds,[END]
it,has,always,rankled,him,that,older,houses,look,down,on,the,freys,as,upstarts,[END]
this,insult,is,not,the,first,he's,borne,to,hear,him,tell,it,[END]
jon,arryn,was,disinclined,to,foster,his,grandsons,and,my,father,refused,the,offer,of,one,of,his,daughters,for,edmure,[END]

lord,hoster's,private,audience,chamber,was,a,small,room,above,the,great,hall,better,suited,to,intimate,discussions,[END]

so,long,as,theon,greyjoy,sits,in,your,father's,seat,with,your,brothers',blood,on,his,hands,these,other,foes,must,wait,catelyn,told,her,son,[END]
your,first,duty,is,to,defend,your,own,people,win,back,winterfell,and,hang,theon,in,a,crow's,cage,to,die,slowly,[END]

from,the,way,robb,looked,at,her,she,could,tell,that,it,had,been,a,long,while,since,anyone,had,dared,speak,to,him,so,bluntly,[END]
when,they,told,me,winterfell,had,fallen,i,wanted,to,go,north,at,once,he,said,with,a,hint,of,defensiveness,[END]

it,is,too,late,for,ifs,and,too,late,for,rescues,catelyn,said,[END]
all,that,remains,is,vengeance,[END]
the,last,word,we,had,from,the,north,ser,rodrik,had,defeated,a,force,of,ironmen,near,torrhen's,square,and,was,assembling,a,host,at,castle,cerwyn,to,retake,winterfell,said,robb,[END]

her,brother,edmure,asked,[END]
the,ironmen,control,the,sunset,sea,[END]
the,greyjoys,hold,moat,cailin,as,well,[END]
no,army,has,ever,taken,moat,cailin,from,the,south,[END]
even,to,march,against,it,is,madness,[END]
we,could,be,trapped,on,the,causeway,with,the,ironborn,before,us,and,angry,freys,at,our,backs,[END]
we,must,win,back,the,freys,said,robb,[END]
with,them,we,still,have,some,chance,of,success,however,small,[END]
without,them,i,see,no,hope,[END]
i,am,willing,to,give,lord,walder,whatever,he,requires,[END]
apologies,honors,lands,gold,[END]
there,must,be,something,that,would,soothe,his,pride,[END]
not,something,said,catelyn,[END]
someone,[END]
jon,[END]
big,enough,for,you,[END]
snowflakes,speckled,tormund's,broad,face,melting,in,his,hair,and,beard,[END]
the,giants,swayed,slowly,atop,the,mammoths,as,they,rode,past,two,by,two,[END]
jon's,garron,shied,frightened,by,such,strangeness,but,whether,it,was,the,mammoths,or,their,riders,that,scared,him,it,was,hard,to,say,[END]
even,ghost,backed,off,a,step,baring,his,teeth,in,a,silent,snarl,[END]
the,direwolf,was,big,but,the,mammoths,were,a,deal,bigger,and,there,were,many,and,more,of,them,[END]
jon,took,the,horse,in,hand,and,held,him,still,so,he,could,count,the,giants,emerging,from,the,blowing,snow,and,pale,mists,that,swirled,along,the,milkwater,[END]
he,was,well,beyond,fifty,when,tormund,said,something,and,he,lost,the,count,[END]
there,must,be,hundreds,[END]
no,matter,how,many,went,past,they,just,seemed,to,keep,coming,[END]
in,old,nan's,stories,giants,were,outsized,men,who,lived,in,colossal,castles,fought,with,huge,swords,and,walked,about,in,boots,a,boy,could,hide,in,[END]
these,were,something,else,more,bearlike,than,human,and,as,wooly,as,the,mammoths,they,rode,[END]
seated,it,was,hard,to,say,how,big,they,truly,were,[END]
ten,feet,tall,maybe,or,twelve,jon,thought,[END]
maybe,fourteen,but,no,taller,[END]
their,sloping,chests,might,have,passed,for,those,of,men,but,their,arms,hung,down,too,far,and,their,lower,torsos,looked,half,again,as,wide,as,their,upper,[END]
their,legs,were,shorter,than,their,arms,but,very,thick,and,they,wore,no,boots,at,all,their,feet,were,broad,splayed,things,hard,and,horny,and,black,[END]
neckless,their,huge,heavy,heads,thrust,forward,from,between,their,shoulder,blades,and,their,faces,were,squashed,and,brutal,[END]
rats',eyes,no,larger,than,beads,were,almost,lost,within,folds,of,horny,flesh,but,they,snuffled,constantly,smelling,as,much,as,they,saw,[END]
they're,not,wearing,skins,jon,realized,[END]
that's,hair,[END]
shaggy,pelts,covered,their,bodies,thick,below,the,waist,sparser,above,[END]
the,stink,that,came,off,them,was,choking,but,perhaps,that,was,the,mammoths,[END]
and,joramun,blew,the,horn,of,winter,and,woke,giants,from,the,earth,[END]
he,looked,for,great,swords,ten,feet,long,but,saw,only,clubs,[END]
most,were,just,the,limbs,of,dead,trees,some,still,trailing,shattered,branches,[END]
a,few,had,stone,balls,lashed,to,the,ends,to,make,colossal,mauls,[END]
the,song,never,says,if,the,horn,can,put,them,back,to,sleep,[END]
one,of,the,giants,coming,up,on,them,looked,older,than,the,rest,[END]
his,pelt,was,grey,and,streaked,with,white,and,the,mammoth,he,rode,larger,than,any,of,the,others,was,grey,and,white,as,well,[END]
tormund,shouted,something,up,to,him,as,he,passed,harsh,clanging,words,in,a,tongue,that,jon,did,not,comprehend,[END]
the,giant's,lips,split,apart,to,reveal,a,mouth,full,of,huge,square,teeth,and,he,made,a,sound,half,belch,and,half,rumble,[END]
after,a,moment,jon,realized,he,was,laughing,[END]
the,mammoth,turned,its,massive,head,to,regard,the,two,of,them,briefly,one,huge,tusk,passing,over,the,top,of,jon's,head,as,the,beast,lumbered,by,leaving,huge,footprints,in,the,soft,mud,and,fresh,snow,along,the,river,[END]
the,giant,shouted,down,something,in,the,same,coarse,tongue,that,tormund,had,used,[END]
was,that,their,king,[END]
asked,jon,[END]
giants,have,no,kings,no,more'n,mammoths,do,nor,snow,bears,nor,the,great,whales,o',the,grey,sea,[END]
that,was,mag,mar,tun,doh,weg,[END]
mag,the,mighty,[END]
you,can,kneel,to,him,if,you,like,he,won't,mind,[END]
i,know,your,kneeler's,knees,must,be,itching,for,want,of,some,king,to,bend,to,[END]
watch,out,he,don't,step,on,you,though,[END]
giants,have,bad,eyes,and,might,be,he,wouldn't,see,some,little,crow,all,the,way,down,there,by,his,feet,[END]
what,did,you,say,to,him,[END]
was,that,the,old,tongue,[END]
aye,[END]
i,asked,him,if,that,was,his,father,he,was,forking,they,looked,so,much,alike,except,his,father,had,a,better,smell,[END]
and,what,did,he,say,to,you,[END]
tormund,thunderfist,cracked,a,gap-toothed,smile,[END]
he,asked,me,if,that,was,my,daughter,riding,there,beside,me,with,her,smooth,pink,cheeks,[END]
the,wildling,shook,snow,from,his,arm,and,turned,his,horse,about,[END]
it,may,be,he,never,saw,a,man,without,a,beard,before,[END]
come,we,start,back,[END]
mance,grows,sore,wroth,when,i'm,not,found,in,my,accustomed,place,[END]
jon,wheeled,and,followed,tormund,back,toward,the,head,of,the,column,his,new,cloak,hanging,heavy,from,his,shoulders,[END]
it,was,made,of,unwashed,sheepskins,worn,fleece,side,in,as,the,wildlings,suggested,[END]
it,kept,the,snow,off,well,enough,and,at,night,it,was,good,and,warm,but,he,kept,his,black,cloak,as,well,folded,up,beneath,his,saddle,[END]
is,it,true,you,killed,a,giant,once,[END]
he,asked,tormund,as,they,rode,[END]
ghost,loped,silently,beside,them,leaving,paw,prints,in,the,new-fallen,snow,[END]
now,why,would,you,doubt,a,mighty,man,like,me,[END]
it,was,winter,and,i,was,half,a,boy,and,stupid,the,way,boys,are,[END]
i,went,too,far,and,my,horse,died,and,then,a,storm,caught,me,[END]
a,true,storm,not,no,little,dusting,such,as,this,[END]
har,[END]
i,knew,i'd,freeze,to,death,before,it,broke,[END]
so,i,found,me,a,sleeping,giant,cut,open,her,belly,and,crawled,up,right,inside,her,[END]
kept,me,warm,enough,she,did,but,the,stink,near,did,for,me,[END]
the,worst,thing,was,she,woke,up,when,the,spring,come,and,took,me,for,her,babe,[END]
suckled,me,for,three,whole,moons,before,i,could,get,away,[END]
har,[END]
there's,times,i,miss,the,taste,o',giant's,milk,though,[END]
if,she,nursed,you,you,couldn't,have,killed,her,[END]
i,never,did,but,see,you,don't,go,spreading,that,about,[END]
tormund,giantsbane,has,a,better,ring,to,it,than,tormund,giantsbabe,and,that's,the,honest,truth,o',it,[END]
so,how,did,you,come,by,your,other,names,[END]
jon,asked,[END]
mance,called,you,the,horn-blower,didn't,he,[END]
mead-king,of,ruddy,hall,husband,to,bears,father,to,hosts,[END]
it,was,the,horn,blowing,he,particularly,wanted,to,hear,about,but,he,dared,not,ask,too,plainly,[END]
and,joramun,blew,the,horn,of,winter,and,woke,giants,from,the,earth,[END]
is,that,where,they,had,come,from,them,and,their,mammoths,[END]
had,mance,rayder,found,the,horn,of,joramun,and,given,it,to,tormund,thunderfist,to,blow,[END]
are,all,crows,so,curious,[END]
asked,tormund,[END]
well,here's,a,tale,for,you,[END]
it,were,another,winter,colder,even,than,the,one,i,spent,inside,that,giant,and,snowing,day,and,night,snowflakes,as,big,as,your,head,not,these,little,things,[END]
it,snowed,so,hard,the,whole,village,was,half,buried,[END]
i,was,in,me,ruddy,hall,with,only,a,cask,o',mead,to,keep,me,company,and,nothing,to,do,but,drink,it,[END]
the,more,i,drank,the,more,i,got,to,thinking,about,this,woman,lived,close,by,a,fine,strong,woman,with,the,biggest,pair,of,teats,you,ever,saw,[END]
she,had,a,temper,on,her,that,one,but,oh,she,could,be,warm,too,and,in,the,deep,of,winter,a,man,needs,his,warmth,[END]
the,more,i,drank,the,more,i,thought,about,her,and,the,more,i,thought,the,harder,me,member,got,till,i,couldn't,suffer,it,no,more,[END]
fool,that,i,was,i,bundled,meself,up,in,furs,from,head,to,heels,wrapped,a,winding,wool,around,me,face,and,set,off,to,find,her,[END]
the,snow,was,coming,down,so,hard,i,got,turned,around,once,or,twice,and,the,wind,blew,right,through,me,and,froze,me,bones,but,finally,i,come,on,her,all,bundled,up,like,i,was,[END]
the,woman,had,a,terrible,temper,and,she,put,up,quite,the,fight,when,i,laid,hands,on,her,[END]
it,was,all,i,could,do,to,carry,her,home,and,get,her,out,o',them,furs,but,when,i,did,oh,she,was,hotter,even,than,i,remembered,and,we,had,a,fine,old,time,and,then,i,went,to,sleep,[END]
next,morning,when,i,woke,the,snow,had,stopped,and,the,sun,was,shining,but,i,was,in,no,fit,state,to,enjoy,it,[END]
all,ripped,and,torn,i,was,and,half,me,member,bit,right,off,and,there,on,me,floor,was,a,she-bear's,pelt,[END]
and,soon,enough,the,free,folk,were,telling,tales,o',this,bald,bear,seen,in,the,woods,with,the,queerest,pair,o',cubs,behind,her,[END]
har,[END]
he,slapped,a,meaty,thigh,[END]
would,that,i,could,find,her,again,[END]
she,was,fine,to,lay,with,that,bear,[END]
never,was,a,woman,gave,me,such,a,fight,nor,such,strong,sons,neither,[END]
what,could,you,do,if,you,did,find,her,[END]
jon,asked,smiling,[END]
you,said,she,bit,your,member,off,[END]
only,half,[END]
and,half,me,member,is,twice,as,long,as,any,other,man's,[END]
tormund,snorted,[END]
now,as,to,you,[END]
is,it,true,they,cut,your,members,off,when,they,take,you,for,the,wall,[END]
no,jon,said,affronted,[END]
i,think,it,must,be,true,[END]
else,why,refuse,ygritte,[END]
she'd,hardly,give,you,any,fight,at,all,seems,to,me,[END]
the,girl,wants,you,in,her,that's,plain,enough,to,see,[END]
too,bloody,plain,thought,jon,and,it,seems,that,half,the,column,has,seen,it,[END]
he,studied,the,falling,snow,so,tormund,might,not,see,him,redden,[END]
i,am,a,man,of,the,night's,watch,he,reminded,himself,[END]
so,why,did,he,feel,like,some,blushing,maid,[END]
he,spent,most,of,his,days,in,ygritte's,company,and,most,nights,as,well,[END]
mance,rayder,had,not,been,blind,to,rattleshirt's,mistrust,of,the,crow-come-over,so,after,he,had,given,jon,his,new,sheepskin,cloak,he,had,suggested,that,he,might,want,to,ride,with,tormund,giantsbane,instead,[END]
jon,had,happily,agreed,and,the,very,next,day,ygritte,and,longspear,ryk,left,rattleshirt's,band,for,tormund's,as,well,[END]
free,folk,ride,with,who,they,want,the,girl,told,him,and,we,had,a,bellyful,of,bag,o',bones,[END]
every,night,when,they,made,camp,ygritte,threw,her,sleeping,skins,down,beside,his,own,no,matter,if,he,was,near,the,fire,or,well,away,from,it,[END]
once,he,woke,to,find,her,nestled,against,him,her,arm,across,his,chest,[END]
he,lay,listening,to,her,breathe,for,a,long,time,trying,to,ignore,the,tension,in,his,groin,[END]
rangers,often,shared,skins,for,warmth,but,warmth,was,not,all,ygritte,wanted,he,suspected,[END]
after,that,he,had,taken,to,using,ghost,to,keep,her,away,[END]
old,nan,used,to,tell,stories,about,knights,and,their,ladies,who,would,sleep,in,a,single,bed,with,a,blade,between,them,for,honor's,sake,but,he,thought,this,must,be,the,first,time,where,a,direwolf,took,the,place,of,the,sword,[END]
even,then,ygritte,persisted,[END]
the,day,before,last,jon,had,made,the,mistake,of,wishing,he,had,hot,water,for,a,bath,[END]
cold,is,better,she,had,said,at,once,if,you've,got,someone,to,warm,you,up,after,[END]
the,river's,only,part,ice,yet,go,on,[END]
jon,laughed,[END]
you'd,freeze,me,to,death,[END]
are,all,crows,afraid,of,gooseprickles,[END]
a,little,ice,won't,kill,you,[END]
i'll,jump,in,with,you,t'prove,it,so,[END]
and,ride,the,rest,of,the,day,with,wet,clothes,frozen,to,our,skins,[END]

sansa,was,surprised,that,margaery,did,not,see,it,too,[END]

when,she,told,ser,dontos,that,she,was,going,to,highgarden,to,marry,willas,tyrell,she,thought,he,would,be,relieved,and,pleased,for,her,[END]

something,would,go,wrong,[END]
when,i,wanted,to,escape,you,wouldn't,take,me,and,now,i,don't,need,to,[END]

the,ship,to,take,you,home,the,boat,to,take,you,to,the,ship,your,florian,did,it,all,for,his,sweet,jonquil,[END]

it's,your,claim,they,mean,to,wed,[END]
my,claim,[END]
she,was,lost,for,a,moment,[END]
sweetling,he,told,her,you,are,heir,to,winterfell,[END]
he,grabbed,her,again,pleading,that,she,must,not,do,this,thing,and,sansa,wrenched,free,and,left,him,swaying,beneath,the,heart,tree,[END]
she,had,not,visited,the,godswood,since,[END]

it,doesn't,matter,there's,still,robb,he's,a,man,grown,now,and,soon,he'll,wed,and,have,a,son,[END]
anyway,willas,tyrell,will,have,highgarden,what,would,he,want,with,winterfell,[END]
sometimes,she,would,whisper,his,name,into,her,pillow,just,to,hear,the,sound,of,it,[END]
willas,willas,willas,[END]
willas,was,as,good,a,name,as,loras,she,supposed,[END]
they,even,sounded,the,same,a,little,[END]
what,did,it,matter,about,his,leg,[END]
willas,would,be,lord,of,highgarden,and,she,would,be,his,lady,[END]
she,pictured,the,two,of,them,sitting,together,in,a,garden,with,puppies,in,their,laps,or,listening,to,a,singer,strum,upon,a,lute,while,they,floated,down,the,mander,on,a,pleasure,barge,[END]

in,sansa's,dreams,her,children,looked,just,like,the,brothers,she,had,lost,[END]
sometimes,there,was,even,a,girl,who,looked,like,arya,[END]
she,could,never,hold,a,picture,of,willas,long,in,her,head,though,her,imaginings,kept,turning,him,back,into,ser,loras,young,and,graceful,and,beautiful,[END]
you,must,not,think,of,him,like,that,she,told,herself,[END]
or,else,he,may,see,the,disappointment,in,your,eyes,when,you,meet,and,how,could,he,marry,you,then,knowing,it,was,his,brother,you,loved,[END]
willas,tyrell,was,twice,her,age,she,reminded,herself,constantly,and,lame,as,well,and,perhaps,even,plump,and,red-faced,like,his,father,[END]
but,comely,or,no,he,might,be,the,only,champion,she,would,ever,have,[END]
once,she,dreamed,it,was,still,her,marrying,joff,not,margaery,and,on,their,wedding,night,he,turned,into,the,headsman,ilyn,payne,[END]
she,woke,trembling,[END]
she,did,not,want,margaery,to,suffer,as,she,had,but,she,dreaded,the,thought,that,the,tyrells,might,refuse,to,go,ahead,with,the,wedding,[END]
i,warned,her,i,did,i,told,her,the,truth,of,him,[END]
perhaps,margaery,did,not,believe,her,[END]

she,will,see,his,true,nature,soon,enough,[END]
after,the,wedding,if,not,before,[END]
sansa,decided,that,she,would,light,a,candle,to,the,mother,above,the,next,time,she,visited,the,sept,and,ask,her,to,protect,margaery,from,joffrey's,cruelty,[END]
and,perhaps,a,candle,to,the,warrior,as,well,for,loras,[END]
she,would,wear,her,new,gown,for,the,ceremony,at,the,great,sept,of,baelor,she,decided,as,the,seamstress,took,her,last,measurement,[END]
that,must,be,why,cersei,is,having,it,made,for,me,so,i,will,not,look,shabby,at,the,wedding,[END]
she,really,ought,to,have,a,different,gown,for,the,feast,afterward,but,she,supposed,one,of,her,old,ones,would,do,[END]
she,did,not,want,to,risk,getting,food,or,wine,on,the,new,one,[END]
i,must,take,it,with,me,to,highgarden,[END]
she,wanted,to,look,beautiful,for,willas,tyrell,[END]
even,if,dontos,was,right,and,it,is,winterfell,he,wants,and,not,me,he,still,may,come,to,love,me,for,myself,[END]
sansa,hugged,herself,tightly,wondering,how,long,it,would,be,before,the,gown,was,ready,[END]
she,could,scarcely,wait,to,wear,it,[END]
arya,[END]
the,rains,came,and,went,but,there,was,more,grey,sky,than,blue,and,all,the,streams,were,running,high,[END]
on,the,morning,of,the,third,day,arya,noticed,that,the,moss,was,growing,mostly,on,the,wrong,side,of,the,trees,[END]
we're,going,the,wrong,way,she,said,to,gendry,as,they,rode,past,an,especially,mossy,elm,[END]
we're,going,south,[END]

he,pushed,thick,black,hair,from,eyes,and,said,we're,following,the,road,that's,all,[END]
the,road,goes,south,here,[END]
we've,been,going,south,all,day,she,wanted,to,tell,him,[END]
and,yesterday,too,when,we,were,riding,along,that,streambed,[END]
but,she,hadn't,been,paying,close,attention,yesterday,so,she,couldn't,be,certain,[END]
i,think,we're,lost,she,said,in,a,low,voice,[END]
we,shouldn't,have,left,the,river,[END]
all,we,had,to,do,was,follow,it,[END]
the,river,bends,and,loops,said,gendry,[END]
this,is,just,a,shorter,way,i,bet,[END]
some,secret,outlaw,way,[END]
lem,and,tom,and,them,have,been,living,here,for,years,[END]
that,was,true,[END]
arya,bit,her,lip,[END]
but,the,moss,[END]
the,way,it's,raining,we'll,have,moss,growing,from,our,ears,before,long,gendry,complained,[END]
only,from,our,south,ear,arya,declared,stubbornly,[END]
there,was,no,use,trying,to,convince,the,bull,of,anything,[END]
still,he,was,the,only,true,friend,she,had,now,that,hot,pie,had,left,them,[END]
sharna,says,she,needs,me,to,bake,bread,he'd,told,her,the,day,they,rode,[END]
anyhow,i'm,tired,of,rain,and,saddlesores,and,being,scared,all,the,time,[END]
there's,ale,here,and,rabbit,to,eat,and,the,bread,will,be,better,when,i,make,it,[END]
you'll,see,when,you,come,back,[END]
you,will,come,back,won't,you,[END]
when,the,war's,done,[END]
he,remembered,who,she,was,then,and,added,my,lady,reddening,[END]
arya,didn't,know,if,the,war,would,ever,be,done,but,she,had,nodded,[END]
i'm,sorry,i,beat,you,that,time,she,said,[END]
hot,pie,was,stupid,and,craven,but,he'd,been,with,her,all,the,way,from,king's,landing,and,she'd,gotten,used,to,him,[END]
i,broke,your,nose,[END]
you,broke,lem's,too,[END]
hot,pie,grinned,[END]
that,was,good,[END]
lem,didn't,think,so,arya,said,glumly,[END]
then,it,was,time,to,go,[END]
when,hot,pie,asked,if,he,might,kiss,milady's,hand,she,punched,his,shoulder,[END]
don't,call,me,that,[END]
you're,hot,pie,and,i'm,arry,[END]
i'm,not,hot,pie,here,[END]
sharna,just,calls,me,boy,[END]
the,same,as,she,calls,the,other,boy,[END]
it's,going,to,be,confusing,[END]
she,missed,him,more,than,she,thought,she,would,but,harwin,made,up,for,it,some,[END]
she,had,told,him,about,his,father,hullen,and,how,she'd,found,him,dying,by,the,stables,in,the,red,keep,the,day,she,fled,[END]
he,always,said,he'd,die,in,a,stable,harwin,said,but,we,all,thought,some,bad-tempered,stallion,would,be,his,death,not,a,pack,of,lions,[END]
arya,told,of,yoren,and,their,escape,from,king's,landing,as,well,and,much,that,had,happened,since,but,she,left,out,the,stableboy,she'd,stabbed,with,needle,and,the,guard,whose,throat,she'd,cut,to,get,out,of,harrenhal,[END]
telling,harwin,would,be,almost,like,telling,her,father,and,there,were,some,things,that,she,could,not,bear,having,her,father,know,[END]
nor,did,she,speak,of,jaqen,h'ghar,and,the,three,deaths,he'd,owed,and,paid,[END]
the,iron,coin,he'd,given,her,arya,kept,tucked,away,beneath,her,belt,but,sometimes,at,night,she,would,take,it,out,and,remember,how,his,face,had,melted,and,changed,when,he,ran,his,hand,across,it,[END]
valar,morghulis,she,would,say,under,her,breath,[END]
ser,gregor,dunsen,polliver,raff,the,sweetling,[END]
the,tickler,and,the,hound,[END]
ser,ilyn,ser,meryn,queen,cersei,king,joffrey,[END]
only,six,winterfell,men,remained,of,the,twenty,her,father,had,sent,west,with,beric,dondarrion,harwin,told,her,and,they,were,scattered,[END]
it,was,a,trap,milady,[END]
lord,tywin,sent,his,mountain,across,the,red,fork,with,fire,and,sword,hoping,to,draw,your,lord,father,[END]
he,planned,for,lord,eddard,to,come,west,himself,to,deal,with,gregor,clegane,[END]
if,he,had,he,would,have,been,killed,or,taken,prisoner,and,traded,for,the,imp,who,was,your,lady,mother's,captive,at,the,time,[END]
only,the,kingslayer,never,knew,lord,tywin's,plan,and,when,he,heard,about,his,brother's,capture,he,attacked,your,father,in,the,streets,of,king's,landing,[END]
i,remember,said,arya,[END]
he,killed,jory,[END]
jory,had,always,smiled,at,her,when,he,wasn't,telling,her,to,get,from,underfoot,[END]
he,killed,jory,harwin,agreed,and,your,father's,leg,was,broken,when,his,horse,fell,on,him,[END]
so,lord,eddard,couldn't,go,west,[END]
he,sent,lord,beric,instead,with,twenty,of,his,own,men,and,twenty,from,winterfell,me,among,them,[END]
there,were,others,besides,[END]
thoros,and,ser,raymun,darry,and,their,men,ser,gladden,wylde,a,lord,named,lothar,mallery,[END]
but,gregor,was,waiting,for,us,at,the,mummer's,ford,with,men,concealed,on,both,banks,[END]
as,we,crossed,he,fell,upon,us,from,front,and,rear,[END]
i,saw,the,mountain,slay,raymun,darry,with,a,single,blow,so,terrible,that,it,took,darry's,arm,off,at,the,elbow,and,killed,the,horse,beneath,him,too,[END]
gladden,wylde,died,there,with,him,and,lord,mallery,was,ridden,down,and,drowned,[END]
we,had,lions,on,every,side,and,i,thought,i,was,doomed,with,the,rest,but,alyn,shouted,commands,and,restored,order,to,our,ranks,and,those,still,ahorse,rallied,around,thoros,and,cut,our,way,free,[END]
six,score,we'd,been,that,morning,[END]
by,dark,no,more,than,two,score,were,left,and,lord,beric,was,gravely,wounded,[END]
thoros,drew,a,foot,of,lance,from,his,chest,that,night,and,poured,boiling,wine,into,the,hole,it,left,[END]
every,man,of,us,was,certain,his,lordship,would,be,dead,by,daybreak,[END]
but,thoros,prayed,with,him,all,night,beside,the,fire,and,when,dawn,came,he,was,still,alive,and,stronger,than,he'd,been,[END]
it,was,a,fortnight,before,he,could,mount,a,horse,but,his,courage,kept,us,strong,[END]
he,told,us,that,our,war,had,not,ended,at,the,mummer's,ford,but,only,begun,there,and,that,every,man,of,ours,who'd,fallen,would,be,avenged,tenfold,[END]
by,then,the,fighting,had,passed,by,us,[END]
the,mountain's,men,were,only,the,van,of,lord,tywin's,host,[END]
they,crossed,the,red,fork,in,strength,and,swept,up,into,the,riverlands,burning,everything,in,their,path,[END]
we,were,so,few,that,all,we,could,do,was,harry,their,rear,but,we,told,each,other,that,we'd,join,up,with,king,robert,when,he,marched,west,to,crush,lord,tywin's,rebellion,[END]
only,then,we,heard,that,robert,was,dead,and,lord,eddard,as,well,and,cersei,lannister's,whelp,had,ascended,the,iron,throne,[END]
that,turned,the,whole,world,on,its,head,[END]
we'd,been,sent,out,by,the,king's,hand,to,deal,with,outlaws,you,see,but,now,we,were,the,outlaws,and,lord,tywin,was,the,hand,of,the,king,[END]
there,was,some,wanted,to,yield,then,but,lord,beric,wouldn't,hear,of,it,[END]
we,were,still,king's,men,he,said,and,these,were,the,king's,people,the,lions,were,savaging,[END]
if,we,could,not,fight,for,robert,we,would,fight,for,them,until,every,man,of,us,was,dead,[END]
and,so,we,did,but,as,we,fought,something,queer,happened,[END]
for,every,man,we,lost,two,showed,up,to,take,his,place,[END]
a,few,were,knights,or,squires,of,gentle,birth,but,most,were,common,men,fieldhands,and,fiddlers,and,innkeeps,servants,and,shoemakers,even,two,septons,[END]
men,of,all,sorts,and,women,too,children,dogs,[END]
dogs,[END]

one,of,our,lads,keeps,the,meanest,dogs,you'd,ever,want,to,see,[END]
i,wish,i,had,a,good,mean,dog,said,arya,wistfully,[END]
a,lion-killing,dog,[END]
she'd,had,a,direwolf,once,nymeria,but,she'd,thrown,rocks,at,her,until,she,fled,to,keep,the,queen,from,killing,her,[END]
could,a,direwolf,kill,a,lion,[END]
she,wondered,[END]
it,rained,again,that,afternoon,and,long,into,the,evening,[END]
thankfully,the,outlaws,had,secret,friends,all,over,so,they,did,not,need,to,camp,out,in,the,open,or,seek,shelter,beneath,some,leaky,bower,as,she,and,hot,pie,and,gendry,had,done,so,often,[END]
that,night,they,sheltered,in,a,burned,abandoned,village,[END]
at,least,it,seemed,to,be,abandoned,until,jack-be-lucky,blew,two,short,blasts,and,two,long,ones,on,his,hunting,horn,[END]
then,all,sorts,of,people,came,crawling,out,of,the,ruins,and,up,from,secret,cellars,[END]
they,had,ale,and,dried,apples,and,some,stale,barley,bread,and,the,outlaws,had,a,goose,that,anguy,had,brought,down,on,the,ride,so,supper,that,night,was,almost,a,feast,[END]
arya,was,sucking,the,last,bit,of,meat,off,a,wing,when,one,of,the,villagers,turned,to,lem,lemoncloak,and,said,there,were,men,through,here,not,two,days,past,looking,for,the,kingslayer,[END]
lem,snorted,[END]
they'd,do,better,looking,in,riverrun,[END]
down,in,the,deepest,dungeons,where,it's,nice,and,damp,[END]
his,nose,looked,like,a,squashed,apple,red,and,raw,and,swollen,and,his,mood,was,foul,[END]
no,another,villager,said,[END]
he's,escaped,[END]
the,kingslayer,[END]
arya,could,feel,the,hair,on,the,back,of,her,neck,prickling,[END]
she,held,her,breath,to,listen,[END]
could,that,be,true,[END]
tom,o',sevens,said,[END]
i'll,not,believe,it,said,the,one-eyed,man,in,the,rusty,pothelm,[END]
the,other,outlaws,called,him,jack-be-lucky,though,losing,an,eye,didn't,seem,very,lucky,to,arya,[END]
i've,had,me,a,taste,o',them,dungeons,[END]
how,could,he,escape,[END]
the,villagers,could,only,shrug,at,that,[END]
greenbeard,stroked,his,thick,grey-and-green,whiskers,and,said,the,wolves,will,drown,in,blood,if,the,kingslayer's,loose,again,[END]
thoros,must,be,told,[END]
the,lord,of,light,will,show,him,lannister,in,the,flames,[END]

when,pello,of,tyrosh,peers,into,the,fire,the,cinders,singe,his,beard,[END]
lem,cracked,his,knuckles,and,said,wouldn't,lord,beric,love,to,capture,jaime,lannister,though,[END]
would,he,hang,him,lem,[END]
one,of,the,village,women,asked,[END]
it'd,be,half,a,shame,to,hang,a,man,as,pretty,as,that,one,[END]
a,trial,first,[END]
said,anguy,[END]
lord,beric,always,gives,them,a,trial,you,know,that,[END]
he,smiled,[END]
then,he,hangs,them,[END]
there,was,laughter,all,around,[END]
then,tom,drew,his,fingers,across,the,strings,of,his,woodharp,and,broke,into,soft,song,[END]
the,brothers,of,the,kingswood,[END]
they,were,an,outlaw,band,[END]
the,forest,was,their,castle,[END]
but,they,roamed,across,the,land,[END]
no,man's,gold,was,safe,from,them,[END]

oh,the,brothers,of,the,kingswood,[END]
that,fearsome,outlaw,band,[END]
warm,and,dry,in,a,corner,between,gendry,and,harwin,arya,listened,to,the,singing,for,a,time,then,closed,her,eyes,and,drifted,off,to,sleep,[END]
she,dreamt,of,home,not,riverrun,but,winterfell,[END]
it,was,not,a,good,dream,though,[END]
she,was,alone,outside,the,castle,up,to,her,knees,in,mud,[END]
she,could,see,the,grey,walls,ahead,of,her,but,when,she,tried,to,reach,the,gates,every,step,seemed,harder,than,the,one,before,and,the,castle,faded,before,her,until,it,looked,more,like,smoke,than,granite,[END]
and,there,were,wolves,as,well,gaunt,grey,shapes,stalking,through,the,trees,all,around,her,their,eyes,shining,[END]
whenever,she,looked,at,them,she,remembered,the,taste,of,blood,[END]
the,next,morning,they,left,the,road,to,cut,across,the,fields,[END]
the,wind,was,gusting,sending,dry,brown,leaves,swirling,around,the,hooves,of,their,horses,but,for,once,it,did,not,rain,[END]
when,the,sun,came,out,from,behind,a,cloud,it,was,so,bright,arya,had,to,pull,her,hood,forward,to,keep,it,out,of,her,eyes,[END]

arya,rummaged,in,her,saddlebag,for,the,map,so,she,could,show,them,[END]

she,unrolled,the,map,on,her,leg,[END]
all,of,them,were,looking,at,her,now,[END]

as,it,happens,said,jack-be-lucky,we,know,where,riverrun,is,[END]
every,man,o',us,[END]
you're,not,going,to,riverrun,lem,told,her,bluntly,[END]

when,he,looked,down,he,could,see,them,stumbling,through,the,snow,shapeless,things,and,clumsy,[END]
his,boots,had,been,black,he,seemed,to,remember,but,the,snow,had,caked,around,them,and,now,they,were,misshapen,white,balls,[END]

it,would,not,stop,the,snow,[END]
the,drifts,were,up,past,his,knees,and,a,crust,covered,his,lower,legs,like,a,pair,of,white,greaves,[END]
his,steps,were,dragging,lurching,[END]
the,heavy,pack,he,carried,made,him,look,like,some,monstrous,hunchback,[END]

all,that,weight,dragged,heavy,and,his,belly,was,so,big,and,round,that,if,he,forgot,to,tug,the,belt,slipped,right,off,and,tangled,round,his,ankles,no,matter,how,tight,he,cinched,it,[END]
he,had,tried,belting,it,above,his,belly,once,but,then,it,came,almost,to,his,armpits,[END]

one,day,he,stumbled,and,the,hilt,went,up,his,nose,[END]
sam,was,stumbling,himself,[END]
there,were,rocks,beneath,the,snow,and,the,roots,of,trees,and,sometimes,deep,holes,in,the,frozen,ground,[END]
black,bernarr,had,stepped,in,one,and,broken,his,ankle,three,days,past,or,maybe,four,or,[END]
he,did,not,know,how,long,it,had,been,truly,[END]
the,lord,commander,had,put,bernarr,on,a,horse,after,that,[END]

it,felt,more,like,he,was,falling,down,than,walking,falling,endlessly,but,never,hitting,the,ground,just,falling,forward,and,forward,[END]
i,have,to,stop,it,hurts,too,much,[END]

he,knew,that,[END]
they,all,knew,that,the,few,who,were,left,[END]
they,had,been,fifty,when,they,fled,the,fist,maybe,more,but,some,had,wandered,off,in,the,snow,a,few,wounded,had,bled,to,death,[END]
and,sometimes,sam,heard,shouts,behind,him,from,the,rear,guard,and,once,an,awful,scream,[END]
when,he,heard,that,he,had,run,twenty,yards,or,thirty,as,fast,and,as,far,as,he,could,his,half-frozen,feet,kicking,up,the,snow,[END]
he,would,be,running,still,if,his,legs,were,stronger,[END]
they,are,behind,us,they,are,still,behind,us,they,are,taking,us,one,by,one,[END]
sobbing,sam,took,another,step,[END]
he,had,been,cold,so,long,he,was,forgetting,what,it,was,like,to,feel,warm,[END]
he,wore,three,pairs,of,hose,two,layers,of,smallclothes,beneath,a,double,lambswool,tunic,and,over,that,a,thick,quilted,coat,that,padded,him,against,the,cold,steel,of,his,chainmail,[END]
over,the,hauberk,he,had,a,loose,surcoat,over,that,a,triple-thick,cloak,with,a,bone,button,that,fastened,tight,under,his,chins,[END]
its,hood,flopped,forward,over,his,forehead,[END]
heavy,fur,mitts,covered,his,hands,over,thin,wool-and-leather,gloves,a,scarf,was,wrapped,snugly,about,the,lower,half,of,his,face,and,he,had,a,tight-fitting,fleece-lined,cap,to,pull,down,over,his,ears,beneath,the,hood,[END]
and,still,the,cold,was,in,him,[END]
his,feet,especially,[END]
he,couldn't,even,feel,them,now,but,only,yesterday,they,had,hurt,so,bad,he,could,hardly,bear,to,stand,on,them,let,alone,walk,[END]
every,step,made,him,want,to,scream,[END]

could,a,man,walk,while,he,was,sleeping,[END]
sam,did,not,know,or,else,he,had,forgotten,[END]
sobbing,he,took,another,step,[END]
the,snow,swirled,down,around,him,[END]
sometimes,it,fell,from,a,white,sky,and,sometimes,from,a,black,but,that,was,all,that,remained,of,day,and,night,[END]
he,wore,it,on,his,shoulders,like,a,second,cloak,and,it,piled,up,high,atop,the,pack,he,carried,and,made,it,even,heavier,and,harder,to,bear,[END]
the,small,of,his,back,hurt,abominably,as,if,someone,had,shoved,a,knife,in,there,and,was,wiggling,it,back,and,forth,with,every,step,[END]
his,shoulders,were,in,agony,from,the,weight,of,the,mail,[END]
he,would,have,given,most,anything,to,take,it,off,but,he,was,afraid,to,[END]
anyway,he,would,have,needed,to,remove,his,cloak,and,surcoat,to,get,at,it,and,then,the,cold,would,have,him,[END]
if,only,i,was,stronger,[END]
he,wasn't,though,and,it,was,no,good,wishing,[END]
sam,was,weak,and,fat,so,very,fat,he,could,hardly,bear,his,own,weight,the,mail,was,much,too,much,for,him,[END]
it,felt,as,though,it,was,rubbing,his,shoulders,raw,despite,the,layers,of,cloth,and,quilt,between,the,steel,and,skin,[END]
the,only,thing,he,could,do,was,cry,and,when,he,cried,the,tears,froze,on,his,cheeks,[END]
sobbing,he,took,another,step,[END]
the,crust,was,broken,where,he,set,his,feet,otherwise,he,did,not,think,he,could,have,moved,at,all,[END]
off,to,the,left,and,right,half-seen,through,the,silent,trees,torches,turned,to,vague,orange,haloes,in,the,falling,snow,[END]

the,old,bear's,ring,of,fire,he,reminded,himself,and,woe,to,him,who,leaves,it,[END]
as,he,walked,it,seemed,as,if,he,were,chasing,the,torches,ahead,of,him,but,they,had,legs,as,well,longer,and,stronger,than,his,so,he,could,never,catch,them,[END]
yesterday,he,begged,for,them,to,let,him,be,one,of,the,torchbearers,even,if,it,meant,walking,outside,of,the,column,with,the,darkness,pressing,close,[END]
he,wanted,the,fire,dreamed,of,the,fire,[END]
if,i,had,the,fire,i,would,not,be,cold,[END]
but,someone,reminded,him,that,he'd,had,a,torch,at,the,start,but,he'd,dropped,it,in,the,snow,and,snuffed,the,fire,out,[END]
sam,didn't,remember,dropping,any,torch,but,he,supposed,it,was,true,[END]
he,was,too,weak,to,hold,his,arm,up,for,long,[END]

he,couldn't,remember,that,either,[END]
fat,and,weak,and,useless,even,my,wits,are,freezing,now,[END]
he,took,another,step,[END]
he,had,wrapped,his,scarf,over,his,nose,and,mouth,but,it,was,covered,with,snot,now,and,so,stiff,he,feared,it,must,be,frozen,to,his,face,[END]
even,breathing,was,hard,and,the,air,was,so,cold,it,hurt,to,swallow,it,[END]

this,was,where,the,old,gods,ruled,the,nameless,gods,of,the,trees,and,the,wolves,and,the,snows,[END]

maslyn,screamed,for,mercy,[END]
why,had,he,suddenly,remembered,that,[END]
it,was,nothing,he,wanted,to,remember,[END]

a,root,beneath,the,crust,caught,his,toe,and,sam,tripped,and,fell,heavily,to,one,knee,so,hard,he,bit,his,tongue,[END]
he,could,taste,the,blood,in,his,mouth,warmer,than,anything,he,had,tasted,since,the,fist,[END]
this,is,the,end,he,thought,[END]
now,that,he,had,fallen,he,could,not,seem,to,find,the,strength,to,rise,again,[END]
he,groped,for,a,tree,branch,and,clutched,it,tight,trying,to,pull,himself,back,to,his,feet,but,his,stiff,legs,would,not,support,him,[END]

he,thought,he,was,dreaming,them,at,first,but,when,he,opened,his,eyes,snow,was,falling,on,the,camp,and,the,black,brothers,were,all,grabbing,bows,and,spears,and,running,toward,the,ringwall,[END]

he,has,the,dogs,to,care,for,sam,remembered,[END]
probably,the,lord,commander,had,given,him,some,orders,as,well,[END]
his,fingers,had,been,so,stiff,and,clumsy,in,the,gloves,and,he,was,shaking,from,fear,and,cold,but,he,found,the,parchment,pouch,and,dug,out,the,messages,he'd,written,[END]
the,ravens,were,shrieking,furiously,and,when,he,opened,the,castle,black,cage,one,of,them,flew,right,in,his,face,[END]
two,more,escaped,before,sam,could,catch,one,and,when,he,did,it,pecked,him,through,his,glove,drawing,blood,[END]
yet,somehow,he,held,on,long,enough,to,attach,the,little,roll,of,parchment,[END]
the,warhorn,had,fallen,silent,by,then,but,the,fist,rang,with,shouted,commands,and,the,clatter,of,steel,[END]

the,birds,in,the,shadow,tower,cage,were,screaming,and,fluttering,about,so,madly,that,he,was,afraid,to,open,the,door,but,he,made,himself,do,it,anyway,[END]
this,time,he,caught,the,first,raven,that,tried,to,escape,[END]
a,moment,later,it,was,clawing,its,way,up,through,the,falling,snow,bearing,word,of,the,attack,[END]
his,duty,done,he,finished,dressing,with,clumsy,frightened,fingers,donning,his,cap,and,surcoat,and,hooded,cloak,and,buckling,on,his,swordbelt,buckling,it,real,tight,so,it,wouldn't,fall,down,[END]
then,he,found,his,pack,and,stuffed,all,his,things,inside,spare,smallclothes,and,dry,socks,the,dragonglass,arrowheads,and,spearhead,jon,had,given,him,and,the,old,horn,too,his,parchments,inks,and,quills,the,maps,he'd,been,drawing,and,a,rock-hard,garlic,sausage,he'd,been,saving,since,the,wall,[END]
he,tied,it,all,up,and,shouldered,the,pack,onto,his,back,[END]
the,lord,commander,said,i,wasn't,to,rush,to,the,ringwall,he,recalled,but,he,said,i,shouldn't,come,running,to,him,either,[END]
sam,took,a,deep,breath,and,realized,that,he,did,not,know,what,to,do,next,[END]
he,remembered,turning,in,a,circle,lost,the,fear,growing,inside,him,as,it,always,did,[END]
there,were,dogs,barking,and,horses,trumpeting,but,the,snow,muffled,the,sounds,and,made,them,seem,far,away,[END]

the,horn,blew,thrice,long,three,long,blasts,means,others,[END]
the,white,walkers,of,the,wood,the,cold,shadows,the,monsters,of,the,tales,that,made,him,squeak,and,tremble,as,a,boy,riding,their,giant,ice-spiders,hungry,for,blood,[END]
awkwardly,he,drew,his,sword,and,plodded,heavily,through,the,snow,holding,it,[END]
a,dog,ran,past,barking,and,he,saw,some,of,the,men,from,the,shadow,tower,big,bearded,men,with,longaxes,and,eight-foot,spears,[END]
he,felt,safer,for,their,company,so,he,followed,them,to,the,wall,[END]

he,chased,one,his,breath,puffing,out,his,nose,in,thick,white,clouds,stumbled,and,found,himself,ten,feet,from,the,ringwall,[END]

some,were,all,in,ringmail,and,some,were,almost,naked,[END]
wildings,most,of,them,but,a,few,wore,faded,blacks,[END]

it,wasn't,his,own,horse,and,he,never,recalled,mounting,up,either,[END]
maybe,it,was,the,horse,that,had,smashed,ser,ottyn's,face,in,[END]
the,horns,were,still,blowing,so,he,kicked,the,horse,and,turned,him,toward,the,sound,[END]

since,you,stand,no,taller,than,a,boy,i,have,found,it,easy,to,forget,that,you,are,in,truth,a,man,grown,with,all,of,a,man's,baser,needs,[END]
it,is,past,time,you,were,wed,[END]
i,was,wed,or,have,you,forgotten,[END]

only,imagining,what,a,bugger-all,handsome,bridegroom,i'll,make,[END]
a,wife,might,be,the,very,thing,he,needed,[END]

on,the,other,hand,there,was,shae,[END]
she,will,not,like,this,for,all,she,swears,that,she,is,content,to,be,my,whore,[END]
that,was,scarcely,a,point,to,sway,his,father,however,so,tyrion,squirmed,higher,in,his,seat,and,said,you,mean,to,wed,me,to,sansa,stark,[END]
but,won't,the,tyrells,take,the,match,as,an,affront,if,they,have,designs,on,the,girl,[END]

that,seems,singularly,cruel,[END]
even,for,you,father,[END]
why,do,you,plan,to,mistreat,her,[END]
his,father,sounded,more,curious,than,concerned,[END]
the,girl's,happiness,is,not,my,purpose,nor,should,it,be,yours,[END]
our,alliances,in,the,south,may,be,as,solid,as,casterly,rock,but,there,remains,the,north,to,win,and,the,key,to,the,north,is,sansa,stark,[END]
she,is,no,more,than,a,child,[END]
your,sister,swears,she's,flowered,[END]
if,so,she,is,a,woman,fit,to,be,wed,you,must,needs,take,her,maidenhead,so,no,man,can,say,the,marriage,was,not,consummated,[END]
after,that,if,you,prefer,to,wait,a,year,or,two,before,bedding,her,again,you,would,be,within,your,rights,as,her,husband,[END]

if,your,purpose,here,is,to,keep,her,from,the,tyrells,why,not,return,her,to,her,mother,[END]
perhaps,that,would,convince,robb,stark,to,bend,the,knee,[END]
lord,tywin's,look,was,scornful,[END]
send,her,to,riverrun,and,her,mother,will,match,her,with,a,blackwood,or,a,mallister,to,shore,up,her,son's,alliances,along,the,trident,[END]
send,her,north,and,she,will,be,wed,to,some,manderly,or,umber,before,the,moon,turns,[END]
yet,she,is,no,less,dangerous,here,at,court,as,this,business,with,the,tyrells,should,prove,[END]

they,have,genna's,boy,tion,as,well,else,he,might,serve,[END]
tyrion,let,them,have,their,byplay,it,was,all,for,his,benefit,he,knew,[END]
sansa,stark,he,mused,[END]
soft-spoken,sweet-smelling,sansa,who,loved,silks,songs,chivalry,and,tall,gallant,knights,with,handsome,faces,[END]
he,felt,as,though,he,was,back,on,the,bridge,of,boats,the,deck,shifting,beneath,his,feet,[END]
you,asked,me,to,reward,you,for,your,efforts,in,the,battle,lord,tywin,reminded,him,forcefully,[END]
this,is,a,chance,for,you,tyrion,the,best,you,are,ever,likely,to,have,[END]
he,drummed,his,fingers,impatiently,on,the,table,[END]
i,once,hoped,to,marry,your,brother,to,lysa,tully,but,aerys,named,jaime,to,his,kingsguard,before,the,arrangements,were,complete,[END]
when,i,suggested,to,lord,hoster,that,lysa,might,be,wed,to,you,instead,he,replied,that,he,wanted,a,whole,man,for,his,daughter,[END]
so,he,wed,her,to,jon,arryn,who,was,old,enough,to,be,her,grandfather,[END]
tyrion,was,more,inclined,to,be,thankful,than,angry,considering,what,lysa,arryn,had,become,[END]
when,i,offered,you,to,dorne,i,was,told,that,the,suggestion,was,an,insult,lord,tywin,continued,[END]
in,later,years,i,had,similar,answers,from,yohn,royce,and,leyton,hightower,[END]
i,finally,stooped,so,low,as,to,suggest,you,might,take,the,florent,girl,robert,deflowered,in,his,brother's,wedding,bed,but,her,father,preferred,to,give,her,to,one,of,his,own,household,knights,[END]
if,you,will,not,have,the,stark,girl,i,shall,find,you,another,wife,[END]
somewhere,in,the,realm,there,is,doubtless,some,little,lordling,who'd,gladly,part,with,a,daughter,to,win,the,friendship,of,casterly,rock,[END]
lady,tanda,has,offered,lollys,[END]
tyrion,gave,a,shudder,of,dismay,[END]
i'd,sooner,cut,it,off,and,feed,it,to,the,goats,[END]
then,open,your,eyes,[END]
the,stark,girl,is,young,nubile,tractable,of,the,highest,birth,and,still,a,maid,[END]
she,is,not,uncomely,[END]
why,would,you,hesitate,[END]
why,indeed,[END]
a,quirk,of,mine,[END]
strange,to,say,i,would,prefer,a,wife,who,wants,me,in,her,bed,[END]
if,you,think,your,whores,want,you,in,their,bed,you,are,an,even,greater,fool,than,i,suspected,said,lord,tywin,[END]
you,disappoint,me,tyrion,[END]
i,had,hoped,this,match,would,please,you,[END]
yes,we,all,know,how,important,my,pleasure,is,to,you,father,[END]
but,there's,more,to,this,[END]
the,key,to,the,north,you,say,[END]
the,greyjoys,hold,the,north,now,and,king,balon,has,a,daughter,[END]
why,sansa,stark,and,not,her,[END]
he,looked,into,his,father's,cool,green,eyes,with,their,bright,flecks,of,gold,[END]
lord,tywin,steepled,his,fingers,beneath,his,chin,[END]
balon,greyjoy,thinks,in,terms,of,plunder,not,rule,[END]
let,him,enjoy,an,autumn,crown,and,suffer,a,northern,winter,[END]
he,will,give,his,subjects,no,cause,to,love,him,[END]
come,spring,the,northmen,will,have,had,a,bellyful,of,krakens,[END]
when,you,bring,eddard,stark's,grandson,home,to,claim,his,birthright,lords,and,little,folk,alike,will,rise,as,one,to,place,him,on,the,high,seat,of,his,ancestors,[END]
you,are,capable,of,getting,a,woman,with,child,i,hope,[END]
i,believe,i,am,he,said,bristling,[END]
i,confess,i,cannot,prove,it,[END]
though,no,one,can,say,i,have,not,tried,[END]
why,i,plant,my,little,seeds,just,as,often,as,i,can,[END]
in,the,gutters,and,the,ditches,finished,lord,tywin,and,in,common,ground,where,only,bastard,weeds,take,root,[END]
it,is,past,time,you,kept,your,own,garden,[END]
he,rose,to,his,feet,[END]
you,shall,never,have,casterly,rock,i,promise,you,[END]
but,wed,sansa,stark,and,it,is,just,possible,that,you,might,win,winterfell,[END]
tyrion,lannister,lord,protector,of,winterfell,[END]
the,prospect,gave,him,a,queer,chill,[END]
very,good,father,he,said,slowly,but,there's,a,big,ugly,roach,in,your,rushes,[END]
robb,stark,is,as,capable,as,i,am,presumably,and,sworn,to,marry,one,of,those,fertile,freys,[END]
and,once,the,young,wolf,sires,a,litter,any,pups,that,sansa,births,are,heirs,to,nothing,[END]
lord,tywin,was,unconcerned,[END]
robb,stark,will,father,no,children,on,his,fertile,frey,you,have,my,word,[END]
there,is,a,bit,of,news,i,have,not,yet,seen,fit,to,share,with,the,council,though,no,doubt,the,good,lords,will,hear,it,soon,enough,[END]
the,young,wolf,has,taken,gawen,westerling's,eldest,daughter,to,wife,[END]
for,a,moment,tyrion,could,not,believe,he'd,heard,his,father,right,[END]
he,broke,his,sworn,word,[END]
he,said,incredulous,[END]
he,threw,away,the,freys,for,[END]
words,failed,him,[END]
a,maid,of,sixteen,years,named,jeyne,said,ser,kevan,[END]
lord,gawen,once,suggested,her,to,me,for,willem,or,martyn,but,i,had,to,refuse,him,[END]
gawen,is,a,good,man,but,his,wife,is,sybell,spicer,[END]
he,should,never,have,wed,her,[END]
the,westerlings,always,did,have,more,honor,than,sense,[END]
lady,sybell's,grandfather,was,a,trader,in,saffron,and,pepper,almost,as,lowborn,as,that,smuggler,stannis,keeps,[END]
and,the,grandmother,was,some,woman,he'd,brought,back,from,the,east,[END]
a,frightening,old,crone,supposed,to,be,a,priestess,[END]
maegi,they,called,her,[END]
no,one,could,pronounce,her,real,name,[END]
half,of,lannisport,used,to,go,to,her,for,cures,and,love,potions,and,the,like,[END]
he,shrugged,[END]
she's,long,dead,to,be,sure,[END]
and,jeyne,seemed,a,sweet,child,i'll,grant,you,though,i,only,saw,her,once,[END]
but,with,such,doubtful,blood,[END]
having,once,married,a,whore,tyrion,could,not,entirely,share,his,uncle's,horror,at,the,thought,of,wedding,a,girl,whose,great,grandfather,sold,cloves,[END]
even,so,[END]
a,sweet,child,ser,kevan,had,said,but,many,a,poison,was,sweet,as,well,[END]
the,westerlings,were,old,blood,but,they,had,more,pride,than,power,[END]
it,would,not,surprise,him,to,learn,that,lady,sybell,had,brought,more,wealth,to,the,marriage,than,her,highborn,husband,[END]
the,westerling,mines,had,failed,years,ago,their,best,lands,had,been,sold,off,or,lost,and,the,crag,was,more,ruin,than,stronghold,[END]
a,romantic,ruin,though,jutting,up,so,brave,above,the,sea,[END]
i,am,surprised,tyrion,had,to,confess,[END]
i,thought,robb,stark,had,better,sense,[END]
he,is,a,boy,of,sixteen,said,lord,tywin,[END]
at,that,age,sense,weighs,for,little,against,lust,and,love,and,honor,[END]
he,forswore,himself,shamed,an,ally,betrayed,a,solemn,promise,[END]
where,is,the,honor,in,that,[END]
ser,kevan,answered,[END]
he,chose,the,girl's,honor,over,his,own,[END]
once,he,had,deflowered,her,he,had,no,other,course,[END]
it,would,have,been,kinder,to,leave,her,with,a,bastard,in,her,belly,said,tyrion,bluntly,[END]
the,westerlings,stood,to,lose,everything,here,their,lands,their,castle,their,very,lives,[END]
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts,[END]
jeyne,westerling,is,her,mother's,daughter,said,lord,tywin,and,robb,stark,is,his,father's,son,[END]
this,westerling,betrayal,did,not,seem,to,have,enraged,his,father,as,much,as,tyrion,would,have,expected,[END]
lord,tywin,did,not,suffer,disloyalty,in,his,vassals,[END]
he,had,extinguished,the,proud,reynes,of,castamere,and,the,ancient,tarbecks,of,tarbeck,hall,root,and,branch,when,he,was,still,half,a,boy,[END]
the,singers,had,even,made,a,rather,gloomy,song,of,it,[END]
some,years,later,when,lord,farman,of,faircastle,grew,truculent,lord,tywin,sent,an,envoy,bearing,a,lute,instead,of,a,letter,[END]
but,once,he'd,heard,the,rains,of,castamere,echoing,through,his,hall,lord,farman,gave,no,further,trouble,[END]
and,if,the,song,were,not,enough,the,shattered,castles,of,the,reynes,and,tarbecks,still,stood,as,mute,testimony,to,the,fate,that,awaited,those,who,chose,to,scorn,the,power,of,casterly,rock,[END]
the,crag,is,not,so,far,from,tarbeck,hall,and,castamere,tyrion,pointed,out,[END]
you'd,think,the,westerlings,might,have,ridden,past,and,seen,the,lesson,there,[END]
mayhaps,they,have,lord,tywin,said,[END]
they,are,well,aware,of,castamere,i,promise,you,[END]
could,the,westerlings,and,spicers,be,such,great,fools,as,to,believe,the,wolf,can,defeat,the,lion,[END]
every,once,in,a,very,long,while,lord,tywin,lannister,would,actually,threaten,to,smile,he,never,did,but,the,threat,alone,was,terrible,to,behold,[END]
the,greatest,fools,are,ofttimes,more,clever,than,the,men,who,laugh,at,them,he,said,and,then,you,will,marry,sansa,stark,tyrion,[END]
and,soon,[END]
catelyn,[END]
they,carried,the,corpses,in,upon,their,shoulders,and,laid,them,beneath,the,dais,[END]
a,silence,fell,across,the,torchlit,hall,and,in,the,quiet,catelyn,could,hear,grey,wind,howling,half,a,castle,away,[END]
he,smells,the,blood,she,thought,through,stone,walls,and,wooden,doors,through,night,and,rain,he,still,knows,the,scent,of,death,and,ruin,[END]
she,stood,at,robb's,left,hand,beside,the,high,seat,and,for,a,moment,felt,almost,as,if,she,were,looking,down,at,her,own,dead,at,bran,and,rickon,[END]
these,boys,had,been,much,older,but,death,had,shrunken,them,[END]
naked,and,wet,they,seemed,such,little,things,so,still,it,was,hard,to,remember,them,living,[END]
the,blond,boy,had,been,trying,to,grow,a,beard,[END]
pale,yellow,peach,fuzz,covered,his,cheeks,and,jaw,above,the,red,ruin,the,knife,had,made,of,his,throat,[END]
his,long,golden,hair,was,still,wet,as,if,he,had,been,pulled,from,a,bath,[END]
by,the,look,of,him,he,had,died,peacefully,perhaps,in,sleep,but,his,brown-haired,cousin,had,fought,for,life,[END]
his,arms,bore,slashes,where,he'd,tried,to,block,the,blades,and,red,still,trickled,slowly,from,the,stab,wounds,that,covered,his,chest,and,belly,and,back,like,so,many,tongueless,mouths,though,the,rain,had,washed,him,almost,clean,[END]
robb,had,donned,his,crown,before,coming,to,the,hall,and,the,bronze,shone,darkly,in,the,torchlight,[END]
shadows,hid,his,eyes,as,he,looked,upon,the,dead,[END]

she,might,have,wept,but,there,were,no,tears,left,in,her,[END]
the,dead,boys,were,pale,from,long,imprisonment,and,both,had,been,fair,against,their,smooth,white,skin,the,blood,was,shockingly,red,unbearable,to,look,upon,[END]
will,they,lay,sansa,down,naked,beneath,the,iron,throne,after,they,have,killed,her,[END]
will,her,skin,seem,as,white,her,blood,as,red,[END]
from,outside,came,the,steady,wash,of,rain,and,the,restless,howling,of,a,wolf,[END]
her,brother,edmure,stood,to,robb's,right,one,hand,upon,the,back,of,his,father's,seat,his,face,still,puffy,from,sleep,[END]

wordless,smalljon,umber,turned,to,obey,his,steps,echoing,in,the,great,stone,hall,[END]

that,much,was,true,arya,knew,[END]
knights,were,captured,and,ransomed,all,the,time,and,sometimes,women,were,too,[END]
but,what,if,robb,won't,pay,their,price,[END]
she,wasn't,a,famous,knight,and,kings,were,supposed,to,put,the,realm,before,their,sisters,[END]
and,her,lady,mother,what,would,she,say,[END]
would,she,still,want,her,back,after,all,the,things,she'd,done,[END]
arya,chewed,her,lip,and,wondered,[END]
the,next,day,they,rode,to,a,place,called,high,heart,a,hill,so,lofty,that,from,atop,it,arya,felt,as,though,she,could,see,half,the,world,[END]
around,its,brow,stood,a,ring,of,huge,pale,stumps,all,that,remained,of,a,circle,of,once-mighty,weirwoods,[END]

the,smallfolk,hereabouts,shunned,the,place,tom,told,her,it,was,said,to,be,haunted,by,the,ghosts,of,the,children,of,the,forest,who,had,died,here,when,the,andal,king,named,erreg,the,kinslayer,had,cut,down,their,grove,[END]
arya,knew,about,the,children,of,the,forest,and,about,the,andals,too,but,ghosts,did,not,frighten,her,[END]
she,used,to,hide,in,the,crypts,of,winterfell,when,she,was,little,and,play,games,of,come-into-my-castle,and,monsters,and,maidens,amongst,the,stone,kings,on,their,thrones,[END]
yet,even,so,the,hair,on,the,back,of,her,neck,stood,up,that,night,[END]
she,had,been,asleep,but,the,storm,woke,her,[END]
the,wind,pulled,the,coverlet,right,off,her,and,sent,it,swirling,into,the,bushes,[END]
when,she,went,after,it,she,heard,voices,[END]
beside,the,embers,of,their,campfire,she,saw,tom,lem,and,greenbeard,talking,to,a,tiny,little,woman,a,foot,shorter,than,arya,and,older,than,old,nan,all,stooped,and,wrinkled,and,leaning,on,a,gnarled,black,cane,[END]
her,white,hair,was,so,long,it,came,almost,to,the,ground,[END]
when,the,wind,gusted,it,blew,about,her,head,in,a,fine,cloud,[END]
her,flesh,was,whiter,the,color,of,milk,and,it,seemed,to,arya,that,her,eyes,were,red,though,it,was,hard,to,tell,from,the,bushes,[END]
the,old,gods,stir,and,will,not,let,me,sleep,she,heard,the,woman,say,[END]
i,dreamt,i,saw,a,shadow,with,a,burning,heart,butchering,a,golden,stag,aye,[END]

on,his,shoulder,perched,a,drowned,crow,with,seaweed,hanging,from,his,wings,[END]
i,dreamt,of,a,roaring,river,and,a,woman,that,was,a,fish,[END]
dead,she,drifted,with,red,tears,on,her,cheeks,but,when,her,eyes,did,open,oh,i,woke,from,terror,[END]
all,this,i,dreamt,and,more,[END]

only,worms,may,kiss,her,now,[END]
and,then,to,tom,sevenstrings,she,said,i'll,have,my,song,or,i'll,have,you,gone,[END]
so,the,singer,played,for,her,so,soft,and,sad,that,arya,only,heard,snatches,of,the,words,though,the,tune,was,half-familiar,[END]
sansa,would,know,it,i,bet,[END]
her,sister,had,known,all,the,songs,and,she,could,even,play,a,little,and,sing,so,sweetly,[END]

a,red,priest,fat,with,a,shaved,head,[END]
i,think,so,[END]
arya,had,never,spoken,to,thoros,at,king's,landing,that,she,could,recall,but,she,knew,who,he,was,[END]
he,and,jalabhar,xho,had,been,the,most,colorful,figures,at,robert's,court,and,thoros,was,a,great,friend,of,the,king,as,well,[END]

the,smallwood,forge,had,not,been,used,in,some,time,though,the,smith,had,hung,his,tools,neatly,on,the,wall,[END]
gendry,lit,a,candle,and,set,it,on,the,anvil,while,he,took,down,a,pair,of,tongs,[END]
my,master,always,scolded,him,about,his,flaming,swords,[END]
it,was,no,way,to,treat,good,steel,he'd,say,but,this,thoros,never,used,good,steel,[END]
he'd,just,dip,some,cheap,sword,in,wildfire,and,set,it,alight,[END]
it,was,only,an,alchemist's,trick,my,master,said,but,it,scared,the,horses,and,some,of,the,greener,knights,[END]
she,screwed,up,her,face,trying,to,remember,if,her,father,had,ever,talked,about,thoros,[END]
he,isn't,very,priestly,is,he,[END]

they,were,pease,in,a,pod,he,told,me,both,gluttons,and,sots,[END]
you,shouldn't,call,the,king,a,sot,[END]
maybe,king,robert,had,drunk,a,lot,but,he'd,been,her,father's,friend,[END]
i,was,talking,about,thoros,[END]
gendry,reached,out,with,the,tongs,as,if,to,pinch,her,face,but,arya,swatted,them,away,[END]
he,liked,feasts,and,tourneys,that,was,why,king,robert,was,so,fond,of,him,[END]
and,this,thoros,was,brave,[END]
when,the,walls,of,pyke,crashed,down,he,was,the,first,through,the,breach,[END]
he,fought,with,one,of,his,flaming,swords,setting,ironmen,afire,with,every,slash,[END]
i,wish,i,had,a,flaming,sword,[END]
arya,could,think,of,lots,of,people,she'd,like,to,set,on,fire,[END]
it's,only,a,trick,i,told,you,[END]
the,wildfire,ruins,the,steel,[END]
my,master,sold,thoros,a,new,sword,after,every,tourney,[END]
every,time,they,would,have,a,fight,about,the,price,[END]
gendry,hung,the,tongs,back,up,and,took,down,the,heavy,hammer,[END]
master,mott,said,it,was,time,i,made,my,first,longsword,[END]
he,gave,me,a,sweet,piece,of,steel,and,i,knew,just,how,i,wanted,to,shape,the,blade,[END]
only,yoren,came,and,took,me,away,for,the,night's,watch,[END]
you,can,still,make,swords,if,you,want,said,arya,[END]
you,can,make,them,for,my,brother,robb,when,we,get,to,riverrun,[END]
riverrun,[END]

a,nice,oak,tree,[END]
he,stepped,closer,and,sniffed,at,her,[END]
you,even,smell,nice,for,a,change,[END]
you,don't,[END]
you,stink,[END]
arya,shoved,him,back,against,the,anvil,and,made,to,run,but,gendry,caught,her,arm,[END]
she,stuck,a,foot,between,his,legs,and,tripped,him,but,he,yanked,her,down,with,him,and,they,rolled,across,the,floor,of,the,smithy,[END]
he,was,very,strong,but,she,was,quicker,[END]
every,time,he,tried,to,hold,her,still,she,wriggled,free,and,punched,him,[END]

the,unsullied,were,eunuchs,every,one,of,them,[END]
why,do,you,cut,them,[END]
she,asked,kraznys,through,the,slave,girl,[END]

you,can,see,where,they've,begun,to,crumble,[END]
there,and,there,[END]
do,you,see,any,guards,on,those,towers,[END]
i,don't,[END]
are,they,hiding,ser,[END]
i,saw,these,sons,of,the,harpy,today,all,their,proud,highborn,warriors,[END]
they,dressed,in,linen,skirts,and,the,fiercest,thing,about,them,was,their,hair,[END]
even,a,modest,khalasar,could,crack,this,astapor,like,a,nut,and,spill,out,the,rotted,meat,inside,[END]

you,have,a,dragon's,eye,khaleesi,that's,plain,to,see,[END]
i,wanted,an,answer,not,a,compliment,[END]
there,are,two,reasons,[END]
astapor's,brave,defenders,are,so,much,chaff,it's,true,[END]
old,names,and,fat,purses,who,dress,up,as,ghiscari,scourges,to,pretend,they,still,rule,a,vast,empire,[END]
every,one,is,a,high,officer,[END]
on,feastdays,they,fight,mock,wars,in,the,pits,to,demonstrate,what,brilliant,commanders,they,are,but,it's,the,eunuchs,who,do,the,dying,[END]
all,the,same,any,enemy,wanting,to,sack,astapor,would,have,to,know,that,they'd,be,facing,unsullied,[END]
the,slavers,would,turn,out,the,whole,garrison,in,the,city's,defense,[END]
the,dothraki,have,not,ridden,against,unsullied,since,they,left,their,braids,at,the,gates,of,qohor,[END]
and,the,second,reason,[END]
dany,asked,[END]
who,would,attack,astapor,[END]
ser,jorah,asked,[END]
meereen,and,yunkai,are,rivals,but,not,enemies,the,doom,destroyed,valyria,the,folk,of,the,eastern,hinterlands,are,all,ghiscari,and,beyond,the,hills,lies,lhazar,[END]
the,lamb,men,as,your,dothraki,call,them,a,notably,unwarlike,people,[END]
yes,she,agreed,but,north,of,the,slave,cities,is,the,dothraki,sea,and,two,dozen,mighty,khals,who,like,nothing,more,than,sacking,cities,and,carrying,off,their,people,into,slavery,[END]
carrying,them,off,where,[END]
what,good,are,slaves,once,you've,killed,the,slavers,[END]
valyria,is,no,more,qarth,lies,beyond,the,red,waste,and,the,nine,free,cities,are,thousands,of,leagues,to,the,west,[END]
and,you,may,be,sure,the,sons,of,the,harpy,give,lavishly,to,every,passing,khal,just,as,the,magisters,do,in,pentos,and,norvos,and,myr,[END]
they,know,that,if,they,feast,the,horselords,and,give,them,gifts,they,will,soon,ride,on,[END]
it's,cheaper,than,fighting,and,a,deal,more,certain,[END]
cheaper,than,fighting,dany,thought,[END]
yes,it,might,be,[END]
if,only,it,could,be,that,easy,for,her,[END]
how,pleasant,it,would,be,to,sail,to,king's,landing,with,her,dragons,and,pay,the,boy,joffrey,a,chest,of,gold,to,make,him,go,away,[END]

your,grace,she,corrected,[END]
prince,rhaegar,led,free,men,into,battle,not,slaves,[END]
whitebeard,said,he,dubbed,his,squires,himself,and,made,many,other,knights,as,well,[END]
there,was,no,higher,honor,than,to,receive,your,knighthood,from,the,prince,of,dragonstone,[END]
tell,me,then,when,he,touched,a,man,on,the,shoulder,with,his,sword,what,did,he,say,[END]
go,forth,and,kill,the,weak',[END]
or,go,forth,and,defend,them',[END]
at,the,trident,those,brave,men,viserys,spoke,of,who,died,beneath,our,dragon,banners,did,they,give,their,lives,because,they,believed,in,rhaegar's,cause,or,because,they,had,been,bought,and,paid,for,[END]
dany,turned,to,mormont,crossed,her,arms,and,waited,for,an,answer,[END]
my,queen,the,big,man,said,slowly,all,you,say,is,true,[END]
but,rhaegar,lost,on,the,trident,[END]
he,lost,the,battle,he,lost,the,war,he,lost,the,kingdom,and,he,lost,his,life,[END]
his,blood,swirled,downriver,with,the,rubies,from,his,breastplate,and,robert,the,usurper,rode,over,his,corpse,to,steal,the,iron,throne,[END]

when,they,lost,their,way,as,happened,once,or,twice,they,need,only,wait,for,a,clear,cold,night,when,the,clouds,did,not,intrude,and,look,up,in,the,sky,for,the,ice,dragon,[END]
the,blue,star,in,the,dragon's,eye,pointed,the,way,north,as,osha,told,him,once,[END]

why,can't,it,be,both,[END]
meera,reached,up,to,pinch,his,nose,[END]
because,they're,different,he,insisted,[END]
like,night,and,day,or,ice,and,fire,[END]
if,ice,can,burn,said,jojen,in,his,solemn,voice,then,love,and,hate,can,mate,[END]

the,land,is,one,[END]
one,his,sister,agreed,but,over,wrinkled,[END]
the,high,glens,seldom,did,them,the,courtesy,of,running,north,and,south,so,often,they,found,themselves,going,long,leagues,in,the,wrong,direction,and,sometimes,they,were,forced,to,double,back,the,way,they'd,come,[END]
if,we,took,the,kingsroad,we,could,be,at,the,wall,by,now,bran,would,remind,the,reeds,[END]
he,wanted,to,find,the,three-eyed,crow,so,he,could,learn,to,fly,[END]
half,a,hundred,times,he,said,it,if,he,said,it,once,until,meera,started,teasing,by,saying,it,along,with,him,[END]

the,thought,of,drowned,knights,under,the,water,gave,bran,the,shivers,[END]

sometimes,old,nan,would,tell,the,same,story,she'd,told,before,but,we,never,minded,if,it,was,a,good,story,[END]
old,stories,are,like,old,friends,she,used,to,say,[END]

just,when,bran,began,to,think,that,she,wasn't,going,to,tell,the,story,after,all,she,began,once,there,was,a,curious,lad,who,lived,in,the,neck,[END]
he,was,small,like,all,crannogmen,but,brave,and,smart,and,strong,as,well,[END]
he,grew,up,hunting,and,fishing,and,climbing,trees,and,learned,all,the,magics,of,my,people,[END]
bran,was,almost,certain,he,had,never,heard,this,story,[END]
did,he,have,green,dreams,like,jojen,[END]
no,said,meera,but,he,could,breathe,mud,and,run,on,leaves,and,change,earth,to,water,and,water,to,earth,with,no,more,than,a,whispered,word,[END]
he,could,talk,to,trees,and,weave,words,and,make,castles,appear,and,disappear,[END]
i,wish,i,could,bran,said,plaintively,[END]
when,does,he,meet,the,tree,knight,[END]
meera,made,a,face,at,him,[END]
sooner,if,a,certain,prince,would,be,quiet,[END]
i,was,just,asking,[END]
the,lad,knew,the,magics,of,the,crannogs,she,continued,but,he,wanted,more,[END]
our,people,seldom,travel,far,from,home,you,know,[END]
we're,a,small,folk,and,our,ways,seem,queer,to,some,so,the,big,people,do,not,always,treat,us,kindly,[END]
but,this,lad,was,bolder,than,most,and,one,day,when,he,had,grown,to,manhood,he,decided,he,would,leave,the,crannogs,and,visit,the,isle,of,faces,[END]
no,one,visits,the,isle,of,faces,objected,bran,[END]
that's,where,the,green,men,live,[END]
it,was,the,green,men,he,meant,to,find,[END]
so,he,donned,a,shirt,sewn,with,bronze,scales,like,mine,took,up,a,leathern,shield,and,a,three-pronged,spear,like,mine,and,paddled,a,little,skin,boat,down,the,green,fork,[END]
bran,closed,his,eyes,to,try,and,see,the,man,in,his,little,skin,boat,[END]
in,his,head,the,crannogman,looked,like,jojen,only,older,and,stronger,and,dressed,like,meera,[END]
he,passed,beneath,the,twins,by,night,so,the,freys,would,not,attack,him,and,when,he,reached,the,trident,he,climbed,from,the,river,and,put,his,boat,on,his,head,and,began,to,walk,[END]
it,took,him,many,a,day,but,finally,he,reached,the,gods,eye,threw,his,boat,in,the,lake,and,paddled,out,to,the,isle,of,faces,[END]
did,he,meet,the,green,men,[END]
yes,said,meera,but,that's,another,story,and,not,for,me,to,tell,[END]
my,prince,asked,for,knights,[END]
green,men,are,good,too,[END]
they,are,she,agreed,but,said,no,more,about,them,[END]
all,that,winter,the,crannogman,stayed,on,the,isle,but,when,the,spring,broke,he,heard,the,wide,world,calling,and,knew,the,time,had,come,to,leave,[END]
his,skin,boat,was,just,where,he'd,left,it,so,he,said,his,farewells,and,paddled,off,toward,shore,[END]
he,rowed,and,rowed,and,finally,saw,the,distant,towers,of,a,castle,rising,beside,the,lake,[END]
the,towers,reached,ever,higher,as,he,neared,shore,until,he,realized,that,this,must,be,the,greatest,castle,in,all,the,world,[END]
harrenhal,[END]
bran,knew,at,once,[END]
it,was,harrenhal,[END]
meera,smiled,[END]
was,it,[END]
beneath,its,walls,he,saw,tents,of,many,colors,bright,banners,cracking,in,the,wind,and,knights,in,mail,and,plate,on,barded,horses,[END]
he,smelled,roasting,meats,and,heard,the,sound,of,laughter,and,the,blare,of,heralds',trumpets,[END]
a,great,tourney,was,about,to,commence,and,champions,from,all,over,the,land,had,come,to,contest,it,[END]
the,king,himself,was,there,with,his,son,the,dragon,prince,[END]
the,white,swords,had,come,to,welcome,a,new,brother,to,their,ranks,[END]
the,storm,lord,was,on,hand,and,the,rose,lord,as,well,[END]
the,great,lion,of,the,rock,had,quarreled,with,the,king,and,stayed,away,but,many,of,his,bannermen,and,knights,attended,all,the,same,[END]
the,crannogman,had,never,seen,such,pageantry,and,knew,he,might,never,see,the,like,again,[END]
part,of,him,wanted,nothing,so,much,as,to,be,part,of,it,[END]
bran,knew,that,feeling,well,enough,[END]
when,he'd,been,little,all,he,had,ever,dreamed,of,was,being,a,knight,[END]
but,that,had,been,before,he,fell,and,lost,his,legs,[END]
the,daughter,of,the,great,castle,reigned,as,queen,of,love,and,beauty,when,the,tourney,opened,[END]
five,champions,had,sworn,to,defend,her,crown,her,four,brothers,of,harrenhal,and,her,famous,uncle,a,white,knight,of,the,kingsguard,[END]
was,she,a,fair,maid,[END]
she,was,said,meera,hopping,over,a,stone,but,there,were,others,fairer,still,[END]
one,was,the,wife,of,the,dragon,prince,who'd,brought,a,dozen,lady,companions,to,attend,her,[END]
the,knights,all,begged,them,for,favors,to,tie,about,their,lances,[END]
this,isn't,going,to,be,one,of,those,love,stories,is,it,[END]
bran,asked,suspiciously,[END]
hodor,doesn't,like,those,so,much,[END]
hodor,said,hodor,agreeably,[END]
he,likes,the,stories,where,the,knights,fight,monsters,[END]
sometimes,the,knights,are,the,monsters,bran,[END]
the,little,crannogman,was,walking,across,the,field,enjoying,the,warm,spring,day,and,harming,none,when,he,was,set,upon,by,three,squires,[END]
they,were,none,older,than,fifteen,yet,even,so,they,were,bigger,than,him,all,three,[END]
this,was,their,world,as,they,saw,it,and,he,had,no,right,to,be,there,[END]
they,snatched,away,his,spear,and,knocked,him,to,the,ground,cursing,him,for,a,frogeater,[END]
were,they,walders,[END]
it,sounded,like,something,little,walder,frey,might,have,done,[END]
none,offered,a,name,but,he,marked,their,faces,well,so,he,could,revenge,himself,upon,them,later,[END]
they,shoved,him,down,every,time,he,tried,to,rise,and,kicked,him,when,he,curled,up,on,the,ground,[END]
but,then,they,heard,a,roar,[END]
that's,my,father's,man,you're,kicking,',howled,the,she-wolf,[END]
a,wolf,on,four,legs,or,two,[END]
two,said,meera,[END]
the,she-wolf,laid,into,the,squires,with,a,tourney,sword,scattering,them,all,[END]
the,crannogman,was,bruised,and,bloodied,so,she,took,him,back,to,her,lair,to,clean,his,cuts,and,bind,them,up,with,linen,[END]
there,he,met,her,pack,brothers,the,wild,wolf,who,led,them,the,quiet,wolf,beside,him,and,the,pup,who,was,youngest,of,the,four,[END]
that,evening,there,was,to,be,a,feast,in,harrenhal,to,mark,the,opening,of,the,tourney,and,the,she-wolf,insisted,that,the,lad,attend,[END]
he,was,of,high,birth,with,as,much,a,right,to,a,place,on,the,bench,as,any,other,man,[END]
she,was,not,easy,to,refuse,this,wolf,maid,so,he,let,the,young,pup,find,him,garb,suitable,to,a,king's,feast,and,went,up,to,the,great,castle,[END]
under,harren's,roof,he,ate,and,drank,with,the,wolves,and,many,of,their,sworn,swords,besides,barrowdown,men,and,moose,and,bears,and,mermen,[END]
the,dragon,prince,sang,a,song,so,sad,it,made,the,wolf,maid,sniffle,but,when,her,pup,brother,teased,her,for,crying,she,poured,wine,over,his,head,[END]
a,black,brother,spoke,asking,the,knights,to,join,the,night's,watch,[END]
the,storm,lord,drank,down,the,knight,of,skulls,and,kisses,in,a,wine-cup,war,[END]
the,crannogman,saw,a,maid,with,laughing,purple,eyes,dance,with,a,white,sword,a,red,snake,and,the,lord,of,griffins,and,lastly,with,the,quiet,wolf,[END]
but,only,after,the,wild,wolf,spoke,to,her,on,behalf,of,a,brother,too,shy,to,leave,his,bench,[END]
amidst,all,this,merriment,the,little,crannogman,spied,the,three,squires,who'd,attacked,him,[END]
one,served,a,pitchfork,knight,one,a,porcupine,while,the,last,attended,a,knight,with,two,towers,on,his,surcoat,a,sigil,all,crannogmen,know,well,[END]
the,freys,said,bran,[END]
the,freys,of,the,crossing,[END]
then,as,now,she,agreed,[END]
the,wolf,maid,saw,them,too,and,pointed,them,out,to,her,brothers,[END]
i,could,find,you,a,horse,and,some,armor,that,might,fit,',the,pup,offered,[END]
the,little,crannogman,thanked,him,but,gave,no,answer,[END]
his,heart,was,torn,[END]
crannogmen,are,smaller,than,most,but,just,as,proud,[END]
the,lad,was,no,knight,no,more,than,any,of,his,people,[END]
we,sit,a,boat,more,often,than,a,horse,and,our,hands,are,made,for,oars,not,lances,[END]
much,as,he,wished,to,have,his,vengeance,he,feared,he,would,only,make,a,fool,of,himself,and,shame,his,people,[END]
the,quiet,wolf,had,offered,the,little,crannogman,a,place,in,his,tent,that,night,but,before,he,slept,he,knelt,on,the,lakeshore,looking,across,the,water,to,where,the,isle,of,faces,would,be,and,said,a,prayer,to,the,old,gods,of,north,and,neck,[END]
you,never,heard,this,tale,from,your,father,[END]
asked,jojen,[END]
it,was,old,nan,who,told,the,stories,[END]
meera,go,on,you,can't,stop,there,[END]
hodor,must,have,felt,the,same,[END]
hodor,he,said,and,then,hodor,hodor,hodor,hodor,[END]
well,said,meera,if,you,would,hear,the,rest,[END]
yes,[END]
tell,it,[END]
five,days,of,jousting,were,planned,she,said,[END]
there,was,a,great,seven-sided,mêlée,as,well,and,archery,and,axe-throwing,a,horse,race,and,tourney,of,singers,[END]
never,mind,about,all,that,[END]
bran,squirmed,impatiently,in,his,basket,on,hodor's,back,[END]
tell,about,the,jousting,[END]
as,my,prince,commands,[END]
the,daughter,of,the,castle,was,the,queen,of,love,and,beauty,with,four,brothers,and,an,uncle,to,defend,her,but,all,four,sons,of,harrenhal,were,defeated,on,the,first,day,[END]
their,conquerors,reigned,briefly,as,champions,until,they,were,vanquished,in,turn,[END]
as,it,happened,the,end,of,the,first,day,saw,the,porcupine,knight,win,a,place,among,the,champions,and,on,the,morning,of,the,second,day,the,pitchfork,knight,and,the,knight,of,the,two,towers,were,victorious,as,well,[END]
but,late,on,the,afternoon,of,that,second,day,as,the,shadows,grew,long,a,mystery,knight,appeared,in,the,lists,[END]
bran,nodded,sagely,[END]
mystery,knights,would,oft,appear,at,tourneys,with,helms,concealing,their,faces,and,shields,that,were,either,blank,or,bore,some,strange,device,[END]
sometimes,they,were,famous,champions,in,disguise,[END]
the,dragonknight,once,won,a,tourney,as,the,knight,of,tears,so,he,could,name,his,sister,the,queen,of,love,and,beauty,in,place,of,the,king's,mistress,[END]
and,barristan,the,bold,twice,donned,a,mystery,knight's,armor,the,first,time,when,he,was,only,ten,[END]
it,was,the,little,crannogman,i,bet,[END]
no,one,knew,said,meera,but,the,mystery,knight,was,short,of,stature,and,clad,in,ill-fitting,armor,made,up,of,bits,and,pieces,[END]
the,device,upon,his,shield,was,a,heart,tree,of,the,old,gods,a,white,weirwood,with,a,laughing,red,face,[END]
maybe,he,came,from,the,isle,of,faces,said,bran,[END]
was,he,green,[END]
in,old,nan's,stories,the,guardians,had,dark,green,skin,and,leaves,instead,of,hair,[END]
sometimes,they,had,antlers,too,but,bran,didn't,see,how,the,mystery,knight,could,have,worn,a,helm,if,he,had,antlers,[END]
i,bet,the,old,gods,sent,him,[END]
perhaps,they,did,[END]
the,mystery,knight,dipped,his,lance,before,the,king,and,rode,to,the,end,of,the,lists,where,the,five,champions,had,their,pavilions,[END]
you,know,the,three,he,challenged,[END]
the,porcupine,knight,the,pitchfork,knight,and,the,knight,of,the,twin,towers,[END]
bran,had,heard,enough,stories,to,know,that,[END]
he,was,the,little,crannogman,i,told,you,[END]
whoever,he,was,the,old,gods,gave,strength,to,his,arm,[END]
the,porcupine,knight,fell,first,then,the,pitchfork,knight,and,lastly,the,knight,of,the,two,towers,[END]
none,were,well,loved,so,the,common,folk,cheered,lustily,for,the,knight,of,the,laughing,tree,as,the,new,champion,soon,was,called,[END]
when,his,fallen,foes,sought,to,ransom,horse,and,armor,the,knight,of,the,laughing,tree,spoke,in,a,booming,voice,through,his,helm,saying,teach,your,squires,honor,that,shall,be,ransom,enough,',[END]
once,the,defeated,knights,chastised,their,squires,sharply,their,horses,and,armor,were,returned,[END]
and,so,the,little,crannogman's,prayer,was,answered,[END]
by,the,green,men,or,the,old,gods,or,the,children,of,the,forest,who,can,say,[END]
it,was,a,good,story,bran,decided,after,thinking,about,it,a,moment,or,two,[END]
then,what,happened,[END]
did,the,knight,of,the,laughing,tree,win,the,tourney,and,marry,a,princess,[END]
no,said,meera,[END]
that,night,at,the,great,castle,the,storm,lord,and,the,knight,of,skulls,and,kisses,each,swore,they,would,unmask,him,and,the,king,himself,urged,men,to,challenge,him,declaring,that,the,face,behind,that,helm,was,no,friend,of,his,[END]
but,the,next,morning,when,the,heralds,blew,their,trumpets,and,the,king,took,his,seat,only,two,champions,appeared,[END]
the,knight,of,the,laughing,tree,had,vanished,[END]
the,king,was,wroth,and,even,sent,his,son,the,dragon,prince,to,seek,the,man,but,all,they,ever,found,was,his,painted,shield,hanging,abandoned,in,a,tree,[END]
it,was,the,dragon,prince,who,won,that,tourney,in,the,end,[END]
oh,[END]
bran,thought,about,the,tale,awhile,[END]
that,was,a,good,story,[END]
but,it,should,have,been,the,three,bad,knights,who,hurt,him,not,their,squires,[END]
then,the,little,crannogman,could,have,killed,them,all,[END]
the,part,about,the,ransoms,was,stupid,[END]
and,the,mystery,knight,should,win,the,tourney,defeating,every,challenger,and,name,the,wolf,maid,the,queen,of,love,and,beauty,[END]
she,was,said,meera,but,that's,a,sadder,story,[END]

asked,jojen,[END]
your,lord,father,never,told,it,to,you,[END]
bran,shook,his,head,[END]
the,day,was,growing,old,by,then,and,long,shadows,were,creeping,down,the,mountainsides,to,send,black,fingers,through,the,pines,[END]
if,the,little,crannogman,could,visit,the,isle,of,faces,maybe,i,could,too,[END]
all,the,tales,agreed,that,the,green,men,had,strange,magic,powers,[END]
maybe,they,could,help,him,walk,again,even,turn,him,into,a,knight,[END]
they,turned,the,little,crannogman,into,a,knight,even,if,it,was,only,for,a,day,he,thought,[END]
a,day,would,be,enough,[END]
davos,[END]
the,cell,was,warmer,than,any,cell,had,a,right,to,be,[END]
it,was,dark,yes,[END]
flickering,orange,light,fell,through,the,ancient,iron,bars,from,the,torch,in,the,sconce,on,the,wall,outside,but,the,back,half,of,the,cell,remained,drenched,in,gloom,[END]
it,was,dank,as,well,as,might,be,expected,on,an,isle,such,as,dragonstone,where,the,sea,was,never,far,[END]
and,there,were,rats,as,many,as,any,dungeon,could,expect,to,have,and,a,few,more,besides,[END]

the,smooth,stony,passages,beneath,the,great,mass,of,dragonstone,were,always,warm,and,davos,had,often,heard,it,said,they,grew,warmer,the,farther,down,one,went,[END]
he,was,well,below,the,castle,he,judged,and,the,wall,of,his,cell,often,felt,warm,to,his,touch,when,he,pressed,a,palm,against,it,[END]
perhaps,the,old,tales,were,true,and,dragonstone,was,built,with,the,stones,of,hell,[END]
he,was,sick,when,they,first,brought,him,here,[END]
the,cough,that,had,plagued,him,since,the,battle,grew,worse,and,a,fever,took,hold,of,him,as,well,[END]
his,lips,broke,with,blood,blisters,and,the,warmth,of,the,cell,did,not,stop,his,shivering,[END]
i,will,not,linger,long,he,remembered,thinking,[END]
i,will,die,soon,here,in,the,dark,[END]
davos,soon,found,that,he,was,wrong,about,that,as,about,so,much,else,[END]
dimly,he,remembered,gentle,hands,and,a,firm,voice,and,young,maester,pylos,looking,down,on,him,[END]
he,was,given,hot,garlic,broth,to,drink,and,milk,of,the,poppy,to,take,away,his,aches,and,shivers,[END]
the,poppy,made,him,sleep,and,while,he,slept,they,leeched,him,to,drain,off,the,bad,blood,[END]
or,so,he,surmised,by,the,leech,marks,on,his,arms,when,he,woke,[END]
before,very,long,the,coughing,stopped,the,blisters,vanished,and,his,broth,had,chunks,of,whitefish,in,it,and,carrots,and,onions,as,well,[END]
and,one,day,he,realized,that,he,felt,stronger,than,he,had,since,black,betha,shattered,beneath,him,and,flung,him,in,the,river,[END]
he,had,two,gaolers,to,tend,him,[END]
one,was,broad,and,squat,with,thick,shoulders,and,huge,strong,hands,[END]
he,wore,a,leather,brigantine,dotted,with,iron,studs,and,once,a,day,brought,davos,a,bowl,of,oaten,porridge,[END]
sometimes,he,sweetened,it,with,honey,or,poured,in,a,bit,of,milk,[END]
the,other,gaoler,was,older,stooped,and,sallow,with,greasy,unwashed,hair,and,pebbled,skin,[END]
he,wore,a,doublet,of,white,velvet,with,a,ring,of,stars,worked,upon,the,breast,in,golden,thread,[END]
it,fit,him,badly,being,both,too,short,and,too,loose,and,was,soiled,and,torn,besides,[END]
he,would,bring,davos,plates,of,meat,and,mash,or,fish,stew,and,once,even,half,a,lamprey,pie,[END]
the,lamprey,was,so,rich,he,could,not,keep,it,down,but,even,so,it,was,a,rare,treat,for,a,prisoner,in,a,dungeon,[END]
neither,sun,nor,moon,shone,in,the,dungeons,no,windows,pierced,the,thick,stone,walls,[END]
the,only,way,to,tell,day,from,night,was,by,his,gaolers,[END]
neither,man,would,speak,to,him,though,he,knew,they,were,no,mutes,sometimes,he,heard,them,exchange,a,few,brusque,words,as,the,watch,was,changing,[END]
they,would,not,even,tell,him,their,names,so,he,gave,them,names,of,his,own,[END]
the,short,strong,one,he,called,porridge,the,stooped,sallow,one,lamprey,for,the,pie,[END]
he,marked,the,passage,of,days,by,the,meals,they,brought,and,by,the,changing,of,the,torches,in,the,sconce,outside,his,cell,[END]
a,man,grows,lonely,in,the,dark,and,hungers,for,the,sound,of,a,human,voice,[END]
davos,would,talk,to,the,gaolers,whenever,they,came,to,his,cell,whether,to,bring,him,food,or,change,his,slops,pail,[END]
he,knew,they,would,be,deaf,to,pleas,for,freedom,or,mercy,instead,he,asked,them,questions,hoping,perhaps,one,day,one,might,answer,[END]
what,news,of,the,war,[END]
he,asked,and,is,the,king,well,[END]
he,asked,after,his,son,devan,and,the,princess,shireen,and,salladhor,saan,[END]
what,is,the,weather,like,[END]
he,asked,and,have,the,autumn,storms,begun,yet,[END]
do,ships,still,sail,the,narrow,sea,[END]
it,made,no,matter,what,he,asked,they,never,answered,though,sometimes,porridge,gave,him,a,look,and,for,half,a,heartbeat,davos,would,think,that,he,was,about,to,speak,[END]
with,lamprey,there,was,not,even,that,much,[END]
i,am,not,a,man,to,him,davos,thought,only,a,stone,that,eats,and,shits,and,speaks,[END]
he,decided,after,a,while,that,he,liked,porridge,much,the,better,[END]
porridge,at,least,seemed,to,know,he,was,alive,and,there,was,a,queer,sort,of,kindness,to,the,man,[END]
davos,suspected,that,he,fed,the,rats,that,was,why,there,were,so,many,[END]
once,he,thought,he,heard,the,gaoler,talking,to,them,as,if,they,were,children,but,perhaps,he'd,only,dreamed,that,[END]
they,do,not,mean,to,let,me,die,he,realized,[END]
they,are,keeping,me,alive,for,some,purpose,of,their,own,[END]
he,did,not,like,to,think,what,that,might,be,[END]
lord,sunglass,had,been,confined,in,the,cells,beneath,dragonstone,for,a,time,as,had,ser,hubard,rambton's,sons,all,of,them,had,ended,on,the,pyre,[END]
i,should,have,given,myself,to,the,sea,davos,thought,as,he,sat,staring,at,the,torch,beyond,the,bars,[END]
or,let,the,sail,pass,me,by,to,perish,on,my,rock,[END]
i,would,sooner,feed,crabs,than,flames,[END]
then,one,night,as,he,was,finishing,his,supper,davos,felt,a,queer,flush,come,over,him,[END]
he,glanced,up,through,the,bars,and,there,she,stood,in,shimmering,scarlet,with,her,great,ruby,at,her,throat,her,red,eyes,gleaming,as,bright,as,the,torch,that,bathed,her,[END]
melisandre,he,said,with,a,calm,he,did,not,feel,[END]
onion,knight,she,replied,just,as,calmly,as,if,the,two,of,them,had,met,on,a,stair,or,in,the,yard,and,were,exchanging,polite,greetings,[END]
are,you,well,[END]
better,than,i,was,[END]
do,you,lack,for,anything,[END]
my,king,[END]
my,son,[END]
i,lack,for,them,[END]
he,pushed,the,bowl,aside,and,stood,[END]
have,you,come,to,burn,me,[END]
her,strange,red,eyes,studied,him,through,the,bars,[END]
this,is,a,bad,place,is,it,not,[END]
a,dark,place,and,foul,[END]
the,good,sun,does,not,shine,here,nor,the,bright,moon,[END]
she,lifted,a,hand,toward,the,torch,in,the,wall,sconce,[END]
this,is,all,that,stands,between,you,and,the,darkness,onion,knight,[END]
this,little,fire,this,gift,of,r'hllor,[END]
shall,i,put,it,out,[END]
no,[END]
he,moved,toward,the,bars,[END]
please,[END]
he,did,not,think,he,could,bear,that,to,be,left,alone,in,utter,blackness,with,no,one,but,the,rats,for,company,[END]
the,red,woman's,lips,curved,upward,in,a,smile,[END]
so,you,have,come,to,love,the,fire,it,would,seem,[END]
i,need,the,torch,[END]
his,hands,opened,and,closed,[END]
i,will,not,beg,her,[END]
i,will,not,[END]
i,am,like,this,torch,ser,davos,[END]
we,are,both,instruments,of,r'hllor,[END]
we,were,made,for,a,single,purpose,to,keep,the,darkness,at,bay,[END]
do,you,believe,that,[END]
no,[END]
perhaps,he,should,have,lied,and,told,her,what,she,wanted,to,hear,but,davos,was,too,accustomed,to,speaking,truth,[END]
you,are,the,mother,of,darkness,[END]
i,saw,that,under,storm's,end,when,you,gave,birth,before,my,eyes,[END]
is,the,brave,ser,onions,so,frightened,of,a,passing,shadow,[END]
take,heart,then,[END]
shadows,only,live,when,given,birth,by,light,and,the,king's,fires,burn,so,low,i,dare,not,draw,off,any,more,to,make,another,son,[END]
it,might,well,kill,him,[END]
melisandre,moved,closer,[END]
with,another,man,though,[END]
a,man,whose,flames,still,burn,hot,and,high,[END]
if,you,truly,wish,to,serve,your,king's,cause,come,to,my,chamber,one,night,[END]
i,could,give,you,pleasure,such,as,you,have,never,known,and,with,your,life-fire,i,could,make,[END]
a,horror,[END]
davos,retreated,from,her,[END]
i,want,no,part,of,you,my,lady,[END]
or,your,god,[END]
may,the,seven,protect,me,[END]
melisandre,sighed,[END]
they,did,not,protect,guncer,sunglass,[END]
he,prayed,thrice,each,day,and,bore,seven,seven-pointed,stars,upon,his,shield,but,when,r'hllor,reached,out,his,hand,his,prayers,turned,to,screams,and,he,burned,[END]
why,cling,to,these,false,gods,[END]
i,have,worshiped,them,all,my,life,[END]
all,your,life,davos,seaworth,[END]
as,well,say,it,was,so,yesterday,[END]
she,shook,her,head,sadly,[END]
you,have,never,feared,to,speak,the,truth,to,kings,why,do,you,lie,to,yourself,[END]
open,your,eyes,ser,knight,[END]
what,is,it,you,would,have,me,see,[END]
the,way,the,world,is,made,[END]
the,truth,is,all,around,you,plain,to,behold,[END]
the,night,is,dark,and,full,of,terrors,the,day,bright,and,beautiful,and,full,of,hope,[END]
one,is,black,the,other,white,[END]
there,is,ice,and,there,is,fire,[END]
hate,and,love,[END]
bitter,and,sweet,[END]
male,and,female,[END]
pain,and,pleasure,[END]
winter,and,summer,[END]
evil,and,good,[END]
she,took,a,step,toward,him,[END]
death,and,life,[END]
everywhere,opposites,[END]
everywhere,the,war,[END]
the,war,[END]
asked,davos,[END]
the,war,she,affirmed,[END]
there,are,two,onion,knight,[END]
not,seven,not,one,not,a,hundred,or,a,thousand,[END]
two,[END]
do,you,think,i,crossed,half,the,world,to,put,yet,another,vain,king,on,yet,another,empty,throne,[END]
the,war,has,been,waged,since,time,began,and,before,it,is,done,all,men,must,choose,where,they,will,stand,[END]
on,one,side,is,r'hllor,the,lord,of,light,the,heart,of,fire,the,god,of,flame,and,shadow,[END]
against,him,stands,the,great,other,whose,name,may,not,be,spoken,the,lord,of,darkness,the,soul,of,ice,the,god,of,night,and,terror,[END]
ours,is,not,a,choice,between,baratheon,and,lannister,between,greyjoy,and,stark,[END]
it,is,death,we,choose,or,life,[END]
darkness,or,light,[END]
she,clasped,the,bars,of,his,cell,with,her,slender,white,hands,[END]
the,great,ruby,at,her,throat,seemed,to,pulse,with,its,own,radiance,[END]
so,tell,me,ser,davos,seaworth,and,tell,me,truly,does,your,heart,burn,with,the,shining,light,of,r'hllor,[END]
or,is,it,black,and,cold,and,full,of,worms,[END]
she,reached,through,the,bars,and,laid,three,fingers,upon,his,breast,as,if,to,feel,the,truth,of,him,through,flesh,and,wool,and,leather,[END]
my,heart,davos,said,slowly,is,full,of,doubts,[END]
melisandre,sighed,[END]
ahhhh,davos,[END]
the,good,knight,is,honest,to,the,last,even,in,his,day,of,darkness,[END]
it,is,well,you,did,not,lie,to,me,[END]
i,would,have,known,[END]
the,other's,servants,oft,hide,black,hearts,in,gaudy,light,so,r'hllor,gives,his,priests,the,power,to,see,through,falsehoods,[END]
she,stepped,lightly,away,from,the,cell,[END]
why,did,you,mean,to,kill,me,[END]
i,will,tell,you,said,davos,if,you,will,tell,me,who,betrayed,me,[END]
it,could,only,have,been,salladhor,saan,and,yet,even,now,he,prayed,it,was,not,so,[END]
the,red,woman,laughed,[END]
no,one,betrayed,you,onion,knight,[END]
i,saw,your,purpose,in,my,flames,[END]
the,flames,[END]
if,you,can,see,the,future,in,these,flames,how,is,it,that,we,burned,upon,the,blackwater,[END]
you,gave,my,sons,to,the,fire,[END]
my,sons,my,ship,my,men,all,burning,[END]
melisandre,shook,her,head,[END]
you,wrong,me,onion,knight,[END]
those,were,no,fires,of,mine,[END]
had,i,been,with,you,your,battle,would,have,had,a,different,ending,[END]
but,his,grace,was,surrounded,by,unbelievers,and,his,pride,proved,stronger,than,his,faith,[END]
his,punishment,was,grievous,but,he,has,learned,from,his,mistake,[END]
were,my,sons,no,more,than,a,lesson,for,a,king,then,[END]
davos,felt,his,mouth,tighten,[END]
it,is,night,in,your,seven,kingdoms,now,the,red,woman,went,on,but,soon,the,sun,will,rise,again,[END]
the,war,continues,davos,seaworth,and,some,will,soon,learn,that,even,an,ember,in,the,ashes,can,still,ignite,a,great,blaze,[END]
the,old,maester,looked,at,stannis,and,saw,only,a,man,[END]
you,see,a,king,[END]
you,are,both,wrong,[END]
he,is,the,lord's,chosen,the,warrior,of,fire,[END]
i,have,seen,him,leading,the,fight,against,the,dark,i,have,seen,it,in,the,flames,[END]
the,flames,do,not,lie,else,you,would,not,be,here,[END]
it,is,written,in,prophecy,as,well,[END]
when,the,red,star,bleeds,and,the,darkness,gathers,azor,ahai,shall,be,born,again,amidst,smoke,and,salt,to,wake,dragons,out,of,stone,[END]
the,bleeding,star,has,come,and,gone,and,dragonstone,is,the,place,of,smoke,and,salt,[END]
stannis,baratheon,is,azor,ahai,reborn,[END]
her,red,eyes,blazed,like,twin,fires,and,seemed,to,stare,deep,into,his,soul,[END]
you,do,not,believe,me,[END]
you,doubt,the,truth,of,r'hllor,even,now,[END]
yet,have,served,him,all,the,same,and,will,serve,him,again,[END]
i,shall,leave,you,here,to,think,on,all,that,i,have,told,you,[END]
and,because,r'hllor,is,the,source,of,all,good,i,shall,leave,the,torch,as,well,[END]
with,a,smile,and,swirl,of,scarlet,skirts,she,was,gone,[END]
only,her,scent,lingered,after,[END]
that,and,the,torch,[END]
davos,lowered,himself,to,the,floor,of,the,cell,and,wrapped,his,arms,about,his,knees,[END]
the,shifting,torchlight,washed,over,him,[END]
once,melisandre's,footsteps,faded,away,the,only,sound,was,the,scrabbling,of,rats,[END]
ice,and,fire,he,thought,[END]
black,and,white,[END]
dark,and,light,[END]
davos,could,not,deny,the,power,of,her,god,[END]
he,had,seen,the,shadow,crawling,from,melisandre's,womb,and,the,priestess,knew,things,she,had,no,way,of,knowing,[END]
she,saw,my,purpose,in,her,flames,[END]
it,was,good,to,learn,that,salla,had,not,sold,him,but,the,thought,of,the,red,woman,spying,out,his,secrets,with,her,fires,disquieted,him,more,than,he,could,say,[END]
and,what,did,she,mean,when,she,said,that,i,had,served,her,god,and,would,serve,him,again,[END]
he,did,not,like,that,either,[END]
he,lifted,his,eyes,to,stare,up,at,the,torch,[END]
he,looked,for,a,long,time,never,blinking,watching,the,flames,shift,and,shimmer,[END]
he,tried,to,see,beyond,them,to,peer,through,the,fiery,curtain,and,glimpse,whatever,lived,back,there,[END]
but,there,was,nothing,only,fire,and,after,a,time,his,eyes,began,to,water,[END]
god-blind,and,tired,davos,curled,up,on,the,straw,and,gave,himself,to,sleep,[END]
three,days,later,well,porridge,had,come,thrice,and,lamprey,twice,davos,heard,voices,outside,his,cell,[END]
he,sat,up,at,once,his,back,to,the,stone,wall,listening,to,the,sounds,of,struggle,[END]
this,was,new,a,change,in,his,unchanging,world,[END]
the,noise,was,coming,from,the,left,where,the,steps,led,up,to,daylight,[END]
he,could,hear,a,man's,voice,pleading,and,shouting,[END]
madness,[END]
the,man,was,saying,as,he,came,into,view,dragged,along,between,two,guardsmen,with,fiery,hearts,on,their,breasts,[END]
porridge,went,before,them,jangling,a,ring,of,keys,and,ser,axell,florent,walked,behind,[END]
axell,the,prisoner,said,desperately,for,the,love,you,bear,me,unhand,me,[END]
you,cannot,do,this,i'm,no,traitor,[END]
he,was,an,older,man,tall,and,slender,with,silvery,grey,hair,a,pointed,beard,and,a,long,elegant,face,twisted,in,fear,[END]
where,is,selyse,where,is,the,queen,[END]

porridge,asked,in,front,of,the,cell,[END]
davos,got,to,his,feet,[END]
for,an,instant,he,considered,trying,to,rush,them,when,the,door,was,opened,but,that,was,madness,[END]
there,were,too,many,the,guards,wore,swords,and,porridge,was,strong,as,a,bull,[END]
ser,axell,gave,the,gaoler,a,curt,nod,[END]
let,the,traitors,enjoy,each,other's,company,[END]
i,am,no,traitor,[END]
screeched,the,prisoner,as,porridge,was,unlocking,the,door,[END]
though,he,was,plainly,dressed,in,grey,wool,doublet,and,black,breeches,his,speech,marked,him,as,highborn,[END]
his,birth,will,not,serve,him,here,thought,davos,[END]
porridge,swung,the,bars,wide,ser,axell,gave,a,nod,and,the,guards,flung,their,charge,in,headlong,[END]
the,man,stumbled,and,might,have,fallen,but,davos,caught,him,[END]
at,once,he,wrenched,away,and,staggered,back,toward,the,door,only,to,have,it,slammed,in,his,pale,pampered,face,[END]
no,he,shouted,[END]
nooooo,[END]
all,the,strength,suddenly,left,his,legs,and,he,slid,slowly,to,the,floor,clutching,at,the,iron,bars,[END]
ser,axell,porridge,and,the,guards,had,already,turned,to,leave,[END]
you,cannot,do,this,the,prisoner,shouted,at,their,retreating,backs,[END]

he,had,never,truly,been,a,stark,only,lord,eddard's,motherless,bastard,with,no,more,place,at,winterfell,than,theon,greyjoy,[END]

the,hare,[END]
the,doe,[END]
the,she-wolf,[END]

we,have,to,part,[END]

in,the,dark,the,direwolf's,red,eyes,looked,black,[END]
he,nuzzled,at,jon's,neck,silent,as,ever,his,breath,a,hot,mist,[END]
the,wildlings,called,jon,snow,a,warg,but,if,so,he,was,a,poor,one,[END]
he,did,not,know,how,to,put,on,a,wolf,skin,the,way,orell,had,with,his,eagle,before,he'd,died,[END]
once,jon,had,dreamed,that,he,was,ghost,looking,down,upon,the,valley,of,the,milkwater,where,mance,rayder,had,gathered,his,people,and,that,dream,had,turned,out,to,be,true,[END]
but,he,was,not,dreaming,now,and,that,left,him,only,words,[END]
you,cannot,come,with,me,jon,said,cupping,the,wolf's,head,in,his,hands,and,looking,deep,into,those,eyes,[END]
you,have,to,go,to,castle,black,[END]

they,will,know,you,at,castle,black,and,maybe,your,coming,will,warn,them,[END]
he,had,thought,of,writing,out,a,warning,for,ghost,to,carry,but,he,had,no,ink,no,parchment,not,even,a,writing,quill,and,the,risk,of,discovery,was,too,great,[END]

we,must,each,hunt,alone,for,a,time,[END]
alone,[END]
the,direwolf,twisted,free,of,jon's,grasp,his,ears,pricked,up,[END]

he,loped,through,a,tangle,of,brush,leapt,a,deadfall,and,raced,down,the,hillside,a,pale,streak,among,the,trees,[END]
off,to,castle,black,[END]
jon,wondered,[END]
or,off,after,a,hare,[END]
he,wished,he,knew,[END]
he,feared,he,might,prove,just,as,poor,a,warg,as,a,sworn,brother,and,a,spy,[END]
a,wind,sighed,through,the,trees,rich,with,the,smell,of,pine,needles,tugging,at,his,faded,blacks,[END]
jon,could,see,the,wall,looming,high,and,dark,to,the,south,a,great,shadow,blocking,out,the,stars,[END]
the,rough,hilly,ground,made,him,think,they,must,be,somewhere,between,the,shadow,tower,and,castle,black,and,likely,closer,to,the,former,[END]
for,days,they,had,been,wending,their,way,south,between,deep,lakes,that,stretched,like,long,thin,fingers,along,the,floors,of,narrow,valleys,while,flint,ridges,and,pine-clad,hills,jostled,against,one,another,to,either,side,[END]
such,ground,made,for,slow,riding,but,offered,easy,concealment,for,those,wishing,to,approach,the,wall,unseen,[END]
for,wildling,raiders,he,thought,[END]
like,us,[END]
like,me,[END]
beyond,that,wall,lay,the,seven,kingdoms,and,everything,he,had,sworn,to,protect,[END]
he,had,said,the,words,had,pledged,his,life,and,honor,and,by,rights,he,should,be,up,there,standing,sentry,[END]
he,should,be,raising,a,horn,to,his,lips,to,rouse,the,night's,watch,to,arms,[END]
he,had,no,horn,though,[END]
it,would,not,be,hard,to,steal,one,from,the,wildlings,he,suspected,but,what,would,that,accomplish,[END]
even,if,he,blew,it,there,was,no,one,to,hear,[END]
the,wall,was,a,hundred,leagues,long,and,the,watch,sadly,dwindled,[END]
all,but,three,of,the,strongholds,had,been,abandoned,there,might,not,be,a,brother,within,forty,miles,of,here,but,for,jon,[END]
if,he,was,a,brother,still,[END]
i,should,have,tried,to,kill,mance,rayder,on,the,fist,even,if,it,meant,my,life,[END]
that,was,what,qhorin,halfhand,would,have,done,[END]
but,jon,had,hesitated,and,the,chance,passed,[END]
the,next,day,he,had,ridden,off,with,styr,the,magnar,jarl,and,more,than,a,hundred,picked,thenns,and,raiders,[END]
he,told,himself,that,he,was,only,biding,his,time,that,when,the,moment,came,he,would,slip,away,and,ride,for,castle,black,[END]
the,moment,never,came,[END]
they,rested,most,nights,in,empty,wildling,villages,and,styr,always,set,a,dozen,of,his,thenns,to,guard,the,horses,[END]

and,ygritte,was,never,far,day,or,night,[END]
two,hearts,that,beat,as,one,[END]
mance,rayder's,mocking,words,rang,bitter,in,his,head,[END]
jon,had,seldom,felt,so,confused,[END]

if,i,refuse,her,she,will,know,me,for,a,turncloak,[END]
i,am,playing,the,part,the,halfhand,told,me,to,play,[END]
his,body,had,played,the,part,eagerly,enough,[END]
his,lips,on,hers,his,hand,sliding,under,her,doeskin,shirt,to,find,a,breast,his,manhood,stiffening,when,she,rubbed,her,mound,against,it,through,their,clothes,[END]
my,vows,he'd,thought,remembering,the,weirwood,grove,where,he,had,said,them,the,nine,great,white,trees,in,a,circle,the,carved,red,faces,watching,listening,[END]
but,her,fingers,were,undoing,his,laces,and,her,tongue,was,in,his,mouth,and,her,hand,slipped,inside,his,smallclothes,and,brought,him,out,and,he,could,not,see,the,weirwoods,anymore,only,her,[END]
she,bit,his,neck,and,he,nuzzled,hers,burying,his,nose,in,her,thick,red,hair,[END]
lucky,he,thought,she,is,lucky,fire-kissed,[END]
isn't,that,good,[END]
she,whispered,as,she,guided,him,inside,her,[END]
she,was,sopping,wet,down,there,and,no,maiden,that,was,plain,but,jon,did,not,care,[END]
his,vows,her,maidenhood,none,of,it,mattered,only,the,heat,of,her,the,mouth,on,his,the,finger,that,pinched,at,his,nipple,[END]
isn't,that,sweet,[END]
she,said,again,[END]
not,so,fast,oh,slow,yes,like,that,[END]
there,now,there,now,yes,sweet,sweet,[END]
you,know,nothing,jon,snow,but,i,can,show,you,[END]
harder,now,[END]
yessss,[END]
a,part,he,tried,to,remind,himself,afterward,[END]
i,am,playing,a,part,[END]
i,had,to,do,it,once,to,prove,i'd,abandoned,my,vows,[END]
i,had,to,make,her,trust,me,[END]
it,need,never,happen,again,[END]
he,was,still,a,man,of,the,night's,watch,and,a,son,of,eddard,stark,[END]
he,had,done,what,needed,to,be,done,proved,what,needed,to,be,proven,[END]
the,proving,had,been,so,sweet,though,and,ygritte,had,gone,to,sleep,beside,him,with,her,head,against,his,chest,and,that,was,sweet,as,well,dangerously,sweet,[END]
he,thought,of,the,weirwoods,again,and,the,words,he'd,said,before,them,[END]
it,was,only,once,and,it,had,to,be,[END]
even,my,father,stumbled,once,when,he,forgot,his,marriage,vows,and,sired,a,bastard,[END]
jon,vowed,to,himself,that,it,would,be,the,same,with,him,[END]
it,will,never,happen,again,[END]
it,happened,twice,more,that,night,and,again,in,the,morning,when,she,woke,to,find,him,hard,[END]
the,wildlings,were,stirring,by,then,and,several,could,not,help,but,notice,what,was,going,on,beneath,the,pile,of,furs,[END]
jarl,told,them,to,be,quick,about,it,before,he,had,to,throw,a,pail,of,water,over,them,[END]
like,a,pair,of,rutting,dogs,jon,thought,afterward,[END]
was,that,what,he'd,become,[END]
i,am,a,man,of,the,night's,watch,a,small,voice,inside,insisted,but,every,night,it,seemed,a,little,fainter,and,when,ygritte,kissed,his,ears,or,bit,his,neck,he,could,not,hear,it,at,all,[END]
was,this,how,it,was,for,my,father,[END]
he,wondered,[END]
was,he,as,weak,as,i,am,when,he,dishonored,himself,in,my,mother's,bed,[END]
something,was,coming,up,the,hill,behind,him,he,realized,suddenly,[END]
for,half,a,heartbeat,he,thought,it,might,be,ghost,come,back,but,the,direwolf,never,made,so,much,noise,[END]
jon,drew,longclaw,in,a,single,smooth,motion,but,it,was,only,one,of,the,thenns,a,broad,man,in,a,bronze,helm,[END]
snow,the,intruder,said,[END]
come,[END]
magnar,wants,[END]
the,men,of,thenn,spoke,the,old,tongue,and,most,had,only,a,few,words,of,the,common,[END]
jon,did,not,much,care,what,the,magnar,wanted,but,there,was,no,use,arguing,with,someone,who,could,scarcely,understand,him,so,he,followed,the,man,back,down,the,hill,[END]
the,mouth,of,the,cave,was,a,cleft,in,the,rock,barely,wide,enough,for,a,horse,half,concealed,behind,a,soldier,pine,[END]
it,opened,to,the,north,so,the,glows,of,the,fires,within,would,not,be,visible,from,the,wall,[END]
even,if,by,some,mischance,a,patrol,should,happen,to,pass,atop,the,wall,tonight,they,would,see,nothing,but,hills,and,pines,and,the,icy,sheen,of,starlight,on,a,half-frozen,lake,[END]
mance,rayder,had,planned,his,thrust,well,[END]
within,the,rock,the,passage,descended,twenty,feet,before,it,opened,out,onto,a,space,as,large,as,winterfell's,great,hall,[END]
cookfires,burned,amongst,the,columns,their,smoke,rising,to,blacken,the,stony,ceiling,[END]
the,horses,had,been,hobbled,along,one,wall,beside,a,shallow,pool,[END]
a,sinkhole,in,the,center,of,the,floor,opened,on,what,might,have,been,an,even,greater,cavern,below,though,the,darkness,made,it,hard,to,tell,[END]
jon,could,hear,the,soft,rushing,sound,of,an,underground,stream,somewhere,below,as,well,[END]
jarl,was,with,the,magnar,mance,had,given,them,the,joint,command,[END]
styr,was,none,too,pleased,by,that,jon,had,noted,early,on,[END]
mance,rayder,had,called,the,dark,youth,a,pet,of,val,who,was,sister,to,dalla,his,own,queen,which,made,jarl,a,sort,of,good,brother,once,removed,to,the,king-beyond-the-wall,[END]
the,magnar,plainly,resented,sharing,his,authority,[END]
he,had,brought,a,hundred,thenns,five,times,as,many,men,as,jarl,and,often,acted,as,if,he,had,the,sole,command,[END]
but,it,would,be,the,younger,man,who,got,them,over,the,ice,jon,knew,[END]
though,he,could,not,have,been,older,than,twenty,jarl,had,been,raiding,for,eight,years,and,had,gone,over,the,wall,a,dozen,times,with,the,likes,of,alfyn,crowkiller,and,the,weeper,and,more,recently,with,his,own,band,[END]
the,magnar,was,direct,[END]
jarl,has,warned,me,of,crows,patrolling,on,high,[END]
tell,me,all,you,know,of,these,patrols,[END]
tell,me,jon,noted,not,tell,us,though,jarl,stood,right,beside,him,[END]
he,would,have,liked,nothing,better,than,to,refuse,the,brusque,demand,but,he,knew,styr,would,put,him,to,death,at,the,slightest,disloyalty,and,ygritte,as,well,for,the,crime,of,being,his,[END]
there,are,four,men,in,each,patrol,two,rangers,and,two,builders,he,said,[END]
the,builders,are,supposed,to,make,note,of,cracks,melting,and,other,structural,problems,while,the,rangers,look,for,signs,of,foes,[END]
they,ride,mules,[END]
mules,[END]
the,earless,man,frowned,[END]

the,magnar,nodded,[END]
even,in,far,thenn,we,know,the,tale,of,arson,iceaxe,and,his,tunnel,[END]
jon,knew,the,tale,as,well,[END]
arson,iceaxe,had,been,halfway,through,the,wall,when,his,tunnel,was,found,by,rangers,from,the,nightfort,[END]
they,did,not,trouble,to,disturb,him,at,his,digging,only,sealed,the,way,behind,with,ice,and,stone,and,snow,[END]
dolorous,edd,used,to,say,that,if,you,pressed,your,ear,flat,to,the,wall,you,could,still,hear,arson,chipping,away,with,his,axe,[END]

the,watch,had,more,men,in,his,day,though,[END]

the,other,slavers,were,not,listening,[END]

though,the,astapori,yanked,and,tugged,drogon,would,not,budge,off,the,litter,[END]
smoke,rose,grey,from,his,open,jaws,and,his,long,neck,curled,and,straightened,as,he,snapped,at,the,slaver's,face,[END]

sansa,chose,a,sharp,sweet,fragrance,with,a,hint,of,lemon,in,it,under,the,smell,of,flowers,[END]
the,maid,dabbed,some,on,her,finger,and,touched,sansa,behind,each,ear,and,under,her,chin,and,then,lightly,on,her,nipples,[END]
cersei,herself,arrived,with,the,seamstress,and,watched,as,they,dressed,sansa,in,her,new,clothes,[END]
the,smallclothes,were,all,silk,but,the,gown,itself,was,ivory,samite,and,cloth-of-silver,and,lined,with,silvery,satin,[END]
the,points,of,the,long,dagged,sleeves,almost,touched,the,ground,when,she,lowered,her,arms,[END]

the,bodice,was,slashed,in,front,almost,to,her,belly,the,deep,vee,covered,over,with,a,panel,of,ornate,myrish,lace,in,dove-grey,[END]

afterward,she,could,not,remember,leaving,the,room,or,descending,the,steps,or,crossing,the,yard,[END]
it,seemed,to,take,all,her,attention,just,to,put,one,foot,down,in,front,of,the,other,[END]
ser,meryn,and,ser,osmund,walked,beside,her,in,cloaks,as,pale,as,her,own,lacking,only,the,pearls,and,the,direwolf,that,had,been,her,father's,[END]

you,are,very,beautiful,sansa,he,told,her,[END]
it,is,good,of,you,to,say,so,my,lord,[END]
she,did,not,know,what,else,to,say,[END]

he'll,think,me,a,fool,or,a,liar,[END]
she,lowered,her,gaze,and,held,her,tongue,[END]
my,lady,this,is,no,way,to,bring,you,to,your,wedding,[END]
i,am,sorry,for,that,[END]
and,for,making,this,so,sudden,and,so,secret,[END]
my,lord,father,felt,it,necessary,for,reasons,of,state,[END]

he,waddled,closer,[END]
you,did,not,ask,for,this,marriage,i,know,[END]
no,more,than,i,did,[END]
if,i,had,refused,you,however,they,would,have,wed,you,to,my,cousin,lancel,[END]

perhaps,i,shall,do,the,same,before,this,day,is,done,[END]
the,ceremony,passed,as,in,a,dream,[END]
sansa,did,all,that,was,required,of,her,[END]
there,were,prayers,and,vows,and,singing,and,tall,candles,burning,a,hundred,dancing,lights,that,the,tears,in,her,eyes,transformed,into,a,thousand,[END]
thankfully,no,one,seemed,to,notice,that,she,was,crying,as,she,stood,there,wrapped,in,her,father's,colors,or,if,they,did,they,pretended,not,to,[END]
in,what,seemed,no,time,at,all,they,came,to,the,changing,of,the,cloaks,[END]
as,father,of,the,realm,joffrey,took,the,place,of,lord,eddard,stark,[END]
sansa,stood,stiff,as,a,lance,as,his,hands,came,over,her,shoulders,to,fumble,with,the,clasp,of,her,cloak,[END]
one,of,them,brushed,her,breast,and,lingered,to,give,it,a,little,squeeze,[END]
then,the,clasp,opened,and,joff,swept,her,maiden's,cloak,away,with,a,kingly,flourish,and,a,grin,[END]
his,uncle's,part,went,less,well,[END]
the,bride's,cloak,he,held,was,huge,and,heavy,crimson,velvet,richly,worked,with,lions,and,bordered,with,gold,satin,and,rubies,[END]
no,one,had,thought,to,bring,a,stool,however,and,tyrion,stood,a,foot,and,a,half,shorter,than,his,bride,[END]

he,wants,me,to,kneel,she,realized,blushing,[END]
she,was,mortified,[END]
it,was,not,supposed,to,be,this,way,[END]
she,had,dreamed,of,her,wedding,a,thousand,times,and,always,she,had,pictured,how,her,betrothed,would,stand,behind,her,tall,and,strong,sweep,the,cloak,of,his,protection,over,her,shoulders,and,tenderly,kiss,her,cheek,as,he,leaned,forward,to,fasten,the,clasp,[END]
she,felt,another,tug,at,her,skirt,more,insistent,[END]
i,won't,[END]
why,should,i,spare,his,feelings,when,no,one,cares,about,mine,[END]
the,dwarf,tugged,at,her,a,third,time,[END]
stubbornly,she,pressed,her,lips,together,and,pretended,not,to,notice,[END]
someone,behind,them,tittered,[END]
the,queen,she,thought,but,it,didn't,matter,[END]
they,were,all,laughing,by,then,joffrey,the,loudest,[END]
dontos,down,on,your,hands,and,knees,the,king,commanded,[END]
my,uncle,needs,a,boost,to,climb,his,bride,[END]
and,so,it,was,that,her,lord,husband,cloaked,her,in,the,colors,of,house,lannister,whilst,standing,on,the,back,of,a,fool,[END]
when,sansa,turned,the,little,man,was,gazing,up,at,her,his,mouth,tight,his,face,as,red,as,her,cloak,[END]
suddenly,she,was,ashamed,of,her,stubbornness,[END]
she,smoothed,her,skirts,and,knelt,in,front,of,him,so,their,heads,were,on,the,same,level,[END]
with,this,kiss,i,pledge,my,love,and,take,you,for,my,lord,and,husband,[END]
with,this,kiss,i,pledge,my,love,the,dwarf,replied,hoarsely,and,take,you,for,my,lady,and,wife,[END]
he,leaned,forward,and,their,lips,touched,briefly,[END]
he,is,so,ugly,sansa,thought,when,his,face,was,close,to,hers,[END]
he,is,even,uglier,than,the,hound,[END]
the,septon,raised,his,crystal,high,so,the,rainbow,light,fell,down,upon,them,[END]
here,in,the,sight,of,gods,and,men,he,said,i,do,solemnly,proclaim,tyrion,of,house,lannister,and,sansa,of,house,stark,to,be,man,and,wife,one,flesh,one,heart,one,soul,now,and,forever,and,cursed,be,the,one,who,comes,between,them,[END]
she,had,to,bite,her,lip,to,keep,from,sobbing,[END]
the,wedding,feast,was,held,in,the,small,hall,[END]

and,here,sansa,found,the,tyrells,[END]

elinor,alla,and,megga,seemed,determined,not,to,know,her,[END]
my,friends,sansa,thought,bitterly,[END]
her,husband,drank,heavily,and,ate,but,little,[END]
he,listened,whenever,someone,rose,to,make,a,toast,and,sometimes,nodded,a,curt,acknowledgment,but,otherwise,his,face,might,have,been,made,of,stone,[END]
the,feast,seemed,to,go,on,forever,though,sansa,tasted,none,of,the,food,[END]
she,wanted,it,to,be,done,and,yet,she,dreaded,its,end,[END]
for,after,the,feast,would,come,the,bedding,[END]
the,men,would,carry,her,up,to,her,wedding,bed,undressing,her,on,the,way,and,making,rude,jokes,about,the,fate,that,awaited,her,between,the,sheets,while,the,women,did,tyrion,the,same,honors,[END]
only,after,they,had,been,bundled,naked,into,bed,would,they,be,left,alone,and,even,then,the,guests,would,stand,outside,the,bridal,chamber,shouting,ribald,suggestions,through,the,door,[END]
the,bedding,had,seemed,wonderfully,wicked,and,exciting,when,sansa,was,a,girl,but,now,that,the,moment,was,upon,her,she,felt,only,dread,[END]
she,did,not,think,she,could,bear,for,them,to,rip,off,her,clothes,and,she,was,certain,she,would,burst,into,tears,at,the,first,randy,jape,[END]
when,the,musicians,began,to,play,she,timidly,laid,her,hand,on,tyrion's,and,said,my,lord,should,we,lead,the,dance,[END]

it,was,so,sweet,and,silly,that,sansa,had,to,laugh,despite,everything,[END]
afterward,she,was,absurdly,grateful,[END]
somehow,the,laughter,made,her,hopeful,again,if,only,for,a,little,while,[END]
smiling,she,let,the,music,take,her,losing,herself,in,the,steps,in,the,sound,of,flute,and,pipes,and,harp,in,the,rhythm,of,the,drum,[END]

climbers,must,of,necessity,leave,their,mounts,behind,and,many,younger,greener,raiders,began,by,taking,the,first,horses,they,found,[END]

there,they,are,ygritte,said,and,jon,glanced,up,to,see,the,first,climber,emerge,above,the,treetops,[END]
it,was,jarl,[END]

the,wood,should,never,have,been,allowed,to,creep,so,close,[END]
they're,three,hundred,feet,up,and,they,haven't,touched,the,ice,itself,yet,[END]

the,rope,around,his,waist,tied,him,to,the,second,man,in,line,still,edging,up,the,tree,[END]

the,second,man,moved,onto,the,wall,behind,him,while,the,third,was,scrambling,to,the,top,of,the,tree,[END]

stone,was,solid,[END]
ice,was,treacherous,stuff,at,the,best,of,times,and,on,a,day,like,this,when,the,wall,was,weeping,the,warmth,of,a,climber's,hand,might,be,enough,to,melt,it,[END]
the,huge,blocks,could,be,frozen,rock-hard,inside,but,their,outer,surface,would,be,slick,with,runnels,of,water,trickling,down,and,patches,of,rotten,ice,where,the,air,had,gotten,in,[END]

no,defenders,appeared,however,not,four,not,even,one,[END]
the,sun,climbed,the,sky,and,the,wildlings,climbed,the,wall,[END]

chunks,of,ice,as,big,as,a,man's,head,bombarded,the,three,below,but,they,clung,to,the,handholds,and,the,stakes,held,and,jarl,jerked,to,a,sudden,halt,at,the,end,of,the,rope,[END]

their,legs,must,be,numb,jon,thought,by,the,fourth,hour,[END]
how,long,can,they,keep,on,with,that,[END]
he,watched,as,restless,as,the,magnar,listening,for,the,distant,moan,of,a,thenn,warhorn,[END]
but,the,horns,stayed,silent,and,there,was,no,sign,of,the,night's,watch,[END]
by,the,sixth,hour,jarl,had,moved,ahead,of,grigg,the,goat,again,and,his,men,were,widening,the,gap,[END]
the,mance's,pet,must,want,a,sword,the,magnar,said,shading,his,eyes,[END]
the,sun,was,high,in,the,sky,and,the,upper,third,of,the,wall,was,a,crystalline,blue,from,below,reflecting,so,brilliantly,that,it,hurt,the,eyes,to,look,on,it,[END]
jarl's,four,and,grigg's,were,all,but,lost,in,the,glare,though,errok's,team,was,still,in,shadow,[END]
instead,of,moving,upward,they,were,edging,their,way,sideways,at,about,five,hundred,feet,making,for,a,chimney,[END]
jon,was,watching,them,inch,along,when,he,heard,the,sound,a,sudden,crack,that,seemed,to,roll,along,the,ice,followed,by,a,shout,of,alarm,[END]
and,then,the,air,was,full,of,shards,and,shrieks,and,falling,men,as,a,sheet,of,ice,a,foot,thick,and,fifty,feet,square,broke,off,from,the,wall,and,came,tumbling,crumbling,rumbling,sweeping,all,before,it,[END]

the,goat,might,not,be,as,clever,as,some,but,he,could,count,that,high,at,least,[END]
he,held,his,tongue,[END]
they,took,my,sword,brienne,said,my,armor,[END]
you,shall,have,no,need,of,armor,here,my,lady,lord,bolton,told,her,[END]

amabel,find,suitable,rooms,for,the,lady,brienne,[END]
walton,you,will,see,to,ser,jaime,at,once,[END]
he,did,not,wait,for,an,answer,but,turned,and,climbed,the,steps,his,fur-trimmed,cloak,swirling,behind,[END]
jaime,had,only,enough,time,to,exchange,a,quick,look,with,brienne,before,they,were,marched,away,separately,[END]
in,the,maester's,chambers,beneath,the,rookery,a,grey-haired,fatherly,man,named,qyburn,sucked,in,his,breath,when,he,cut,away,the,linen,from,the,stump,of,jaime's,hand,[END]
that,bad,[END]
will,i,die,[END]
qyburn,pushed,at,the,wound,with,a,finger,and,wrinkled,his,nose,at,the,gush,of,pus,[END]
no,[END]
though,in,a,few,more,days,[END]
he,sliced,away,jaime's,sleeve,[END]
the,corruption,has,spread,[END]
see,how,tender,the,flesh,is,[END]
i,must,cut,it,all,away,[END]
the,safest,course,would,be,to,take,the,arm,off,[END]
then,you'll,die,jaime,promised,[END]
clean,the,stump,and,sew,it,up,[END]
i'll,take,my,chances,[END]
qyburn,frowned,[END]
i,can,leave,you,the,upper,arm,make,the,cut,at,your,elbow,but,[END]
take,any,part,of,my,arm,and,you'd,best,chop,off,the,other,one,as,well,or,i'll,strangle,you,with,it,afterward,[END]
qyburn,looked,in,his,eyes,[END]
whatever,he,saw,there,gave,him,pause,[END]
very,well,[END]
i,will,cut,away,the,rotten,flesh,no,more,[END]
try,to,burn,out,the,corruption,with,boiling,wine,and,a,poultice,of,nettle,mustard,seed,and,bread,mold,[END]
mayhaps,that,will,suffice,[END]
it,is,on,your,head,[END]
you,will,want,milk,of,the,poppy,[END]
no,[END]
jaime,dare,not,let,himself,be,put,to,sleep,he,might,be,short,an,arm,when,he,woke,no,matter,what,the,man,said,[END]
qyburn,was,taken,aback,[END]
there,will,be,pain,[END]
i'll,scream,[END]
a,great,deal,of,pain,[END]
i'll,scream,very,loudly,[END]
will,you,take,some,wine,at,least,[END]

of,that,i,am,not,certain,[END]
i,shall,bring,the,wine,[END]
lie,back,i,must,needs,strap,down,your,arm,[END]
with,a,bowl,and,a,sharp,blade,qyburn,cleaned,the,stump,while,jaime,gulped,down,strongwine,spilling,it,all,over,himself,in,the,process,[END]
his,left,hand,did,not,seem,to,know,how,to,find,his,mouth,but,there,was,something,to,be,said,for,that,[END]
the,smell,of,wine,in,his,sodden,beard,helped,disguise,the,stench,of,pus,[END]
nothing,helped,when,the,time,came,to,pare,away,the,rotten,flesh,[END]
jaime,did,scream,then,and,pounded,his,table,with,his,good,fist,over,and,over,and,over,again,[END]
he,screamed,again,when,qyburn,poured,boiling,wine,over,what,remained,of,his,stump,[END]
despite,all,his,vows,and,all,his,fears,he,lost,consciousness,for,a,time,[END]
when,he,woke,the,maester,was,sewing,at,his,arm,with,needle,and,catgut,[END]
i,left,a,flap,of,skin,to,fold,back,over,your,wrist,[END]
you,have,done,this,before,muttered,jaime,weakly,[END]
he,could,taste,blood,in,his,mouth,where,he'd,bitten,his,tongue,[END]
no,man,who,serves,with,vargo,hoat,is,a,stranger,to,stumps,[END]
he,makes,them,wherever,he,goes,[END]
qyburn,did,not,look,a,monster,jaime,thought,[END]
he,was,spare,and,soft-spoken,with,warm,brown,eyes,[END]
how,does,a,maester,come,to,ride,with,the,brave,companions,[END]
the,citadel,took,my,chain,[END]
qyburn,put,away,his,needle,[END]
i,should,do,something,about,that,wound,above,your,eye,as,well,[END]
the,flesh,is,badly,inflamed,[END]
jaime,closed,his,eyes,and,let,the,wine,and,qyburn,do,their,work,[END]
tell,me,of,the,battle,[END]
as,keeper,of,harrenhal's,ravens,qyburn,would,have,been,the,first,to,hear,the,news,[END]
lord,stannis,was,caught,between,your,father,and,the,fire,[END]
it's,said,the,imp,set,the,river,itself,aflame,[END]
jaime,saw,green,flames,reaching,up,into,the,sky,higher,than,the,tallest,towers,as,burning,men,screamed,in,the,streets,[END]
i,have,dreamed,this,dream,before,[END]
it,was,almost,funny,but,there,was,no,one,to,share,the,joke,[END]
open,your,eye,[END]
qyburn,soaked,a,cloth,in,warm,water,and,dabbed,at,the,crust,of,dried,blood,[END]
the,eyelid,was,swollen,but,jaime,found,he,could,force,it,open,halfway,[END]
qyburn's,face,loomed,above,[END]
how,did,you,come,by,this,one,[END]
the,maester,asked,[END]
a,wench's,gift,[END]
rough,wooing,my,lord,[END]
this,wench,is,bigger,than,me,and,uglier,than,you,[END]
you'd,best,see,to,her,as,well,[END]
she's,still,limping,on,the,leg,i,pricked,when,we,fought,[END]
i,will,ask,after,her,[END]
what,is,this,woman,to,you,[END]
my,protector,[END]
jaime,had,to,laugh,no,matter,how,it,hurt,[END]
i'll,grind,some,herbs,you,can,mix,with,wine,to,bring,down,your,fever,[END]
come,back,on,the,morrow,and,i'll,put,a,leech,on,your,eye,to,drain,the,bad,blood,[END]
a,leech,[END]
lovely,[END]
lord,bolton,is,very,fond,of,leeches,qyburn,said,primly,[END]
yes,said,jaime,[END]
he,would,be,[END]
tyrion,[END]
nothing,remained,beyond,the,king's,gate,but,mud,and,ashes,and,bits,of,burned,bone,yet,already,there,were,people,living,in,the,shadow,of,the,city,walls,and,others,selling,fish,from,barrows,and,barrels,[END]
tyrion,felt,their,eyes,on,him,as,he,rode,past,chilly,eyes,angry,and,unsympathetic,[END]
no,one,dared,speak,to,him,or,try,to,bar,his,way,not,with,bronn,beside,him,in,oiled,black,mail,[END]
if,i,were,alone,though,they,would,pull,me,down,and,smash,my,face,in,with,a,cobblestone,as,they,did,for,preston,greenfield,[END]
they,come,back,quicker,than,the,rats,he,complained,[END]
we,burned,them,out,once,you'd,think,they'd,take,that,as,a,lesson,[END]
give,me,a,few,dozen,gold,cloaks,and,i'll,kill,them,all,said,bronn,[END]
once,they're,dead,they,don't,come,back,[END]
no,but,others,come,in,their,places,[END]
leave,them,be,[END]
but,if,they,start,throwing,up,hovels,against,the,wall,again,pull,them,down,at,once,[END]
the,war's,not,done,yet,no,matter,what,these,fools,may,think,[END]
he,spied,the,mud,gate,up,ahead,[END]
i,have,seen,enough,for,now,[END]
we'll,return,on,the,morrow,with,the,guild,masters,to,go,over,their,plans,[END]
he,sighed,[END]
well,i,burned,most,of,this,i,suppose,it's,only,just,that,i,rebuild,it,[END]
that,task,was,to,have,been,his,uncle's,but,solid,steady,tireless,ser,kevan,lannister,had,not,been,himself,since,the,raven,had,come,from,riverrun,with,word,of,his,son's,murder,[END]
willem's,twin,martyn,had,been,taken,captive,by,robb,stark,as,well,and,their,elder,brother,lancel,was,still,abed,beset,by,an,ulcerating,wound,that,would,not,heal,[END]
with,one,son,dead,and,two,more,in,mortal,danger,ser,kevan,was,consumed,by,grief,and,fear,[END]
lord,tywin,had,always,relied,on,his,brother,but,now,he,had,no,choice,but,to,turn,again,to,his,dwarf,son,[END]
the,cost,of,rebuilding,was,going,to,be,ruinous,but,there,was,no,help,for,that,[END]
king's,landing,was,the,realm's,principal,harbor,rivaled,only,by,oldtown,[END]
the,river,had,to,be,reopened,and,the,sooner,the,better,[END]
and,where,am,i,going,to,find,the,bloody,coin,[END]
it,was,almost,enough,to,make,him,miss,littlefinger,who,had,sailed,north,a,fortnight,past,[END]
while,he,beds,lysa,arryn,and,rules,the,vale,beside,her,i,get,to,clean,up,the,mess,he,left,behind,him,[END]
though,at,least,his,father,was,giving,him,significant,work,to,do,[END]
he,won't,name,me,heir,to,casterly,rock,but,he'll,make,use,of,me,wherever,he,can,tyrion,thought,as,a,captain,of,gold,cloaks,waved,them,through,the,mud,gate,[END]
the,three,whores,still,dominated,the,market,square,inside,the,gate,but,they,stood,idle,now,and,the,boulders,and,barrels,of,pitch,had,all,been,trundled,away,[END]
there,were,children,climbing,the,towering,wooden,structures,swarming,up,like,monkeys,in,roughspun,to,perch,on,the,throwing,arms,and,hoot,at,each,other,[END]
remind,me,to,tell,ser,addam,to,post,some,gold,cloaks,here,tyrion,told,bronn,as,they,rode,between,two,of,the,trebuchets,[END]
some,fool,boy's,like,to,fall,off,and,break,his,back,[END]
there,was,a,shout,from,above,and,a,clod,of,manure,exploded,on,the,ground,a,foot,in,front,of,them,[END]
tyrion's,mare,reared,and,almost,threw,him,[END]
on,second,thoughts,he,said,when,he,had,the,horse,in,hand,let,the,poxy,brats,splatter,on,the,cobbles,like,overripe,melons,[END]
he,was,in,a,black,mood,and,not,just,because,a,few,street,urchins,wanted,to,pelt,him,with,dung,[END]
his,marriage,was,a,daily,agony,[END]
sansa,stark,remained,a,maiden,and,half,the,castle,seemed,to,know,it,[END]
when,they,had,saddled,up,this,morning,he'd,heard,two,of,the,stableboys,sniggering,behind,his,back,[END]
he,could,almost,imagine,that,the,horses,were,sniggering,as,well,[END]
he'd,risked,his,skin,to,avoid,the,bedding,ritual,hoping,to,preserve,the,privacy,of,his,bedchamber,but,that,hope,had,been,dashed,quick,enough,[END]
either,sansa,had,been,stupid,enough,to,confide,in,one,of,her,bedmaids,every,one,of,whom,was,a,spy,for,cersei,or,varys,and,his,little,birds,were,to,blame,[END]
what,difference,did,it,make,[END]
they,were,laughing,at,him,all,the,same,[END]
the,only,person,in,the,red,keep,who,didn't,seem,to,find,his,marriage,a,source,of,amusement,was,his,lady,wife,[END]
sansa's,misery,was,deepening,every,day,[END]
tyrion,would,gladly,have,broken,through,her,courtesy,to,give,her,what,solace,he,might,but,it,was,no,good,[END]
no,words,would,ever,make,him,fair,in,her,eyes,[END]
or,any,less,a,lannister,[END]
this,was,the,wife,they,had,given,him,for,all,the,rest,of,his,life,and,she,hated,him,[END]
and,their,nights,together,in,the,great,bed,were,another,source,of,torment,[END]
he,could,no,longer,bear,to,sleep,naked,as,had,been,his,custom,[END]
his,wife,was,too,well,trained,ever,to,say,an,unkind,word,but,the,revulsion,in,her,eyes,whenever,she,looked,on,his,body,was,more,than,he,could,bear,[END]
tyrion,had,commanded,sansa,to,wear,a,sleeping,shift,as,well,[END]
i,want,her,he,realized,[END]
i,want,winterfell,yes,but,i,want,her,as,well,child,or,woman,or,whatever,she,is,[END]
i,want,to,comfort,her,[END]
i,want,to,hear,her,laugh,[END]
i,want,her,to,come,to,me,willingly,to,bring,me,her,joys,and,her,sorrows,and,her,lust,[END]
his,mouth,twisted,in,a,bitter,smile,[END]
yes,and,i,want,to,be,tall,as,jaime,and,as,strong,as,ser,gregor,the,mountain,too,for,all,the,bloody,good,it,does,[END]
unbidden,his,thoughts,went,to,shae,[END]
tyrion,had,not,wanted,her,to,hear,the,news,from,any,lips,but,his,own,so,he,had,commanded,varys,to,bring,her,to,him,the,night,before,his,wedding,[END]
they,met,again,in,the,eunuch's,chambers,and,when,shae,began,to,undo,the,laces,of,his,jerkin,he'd,caught,her,by,the,wrist,and,pushed,her,away,[END]
wait,he,said,there,is,something,you,must,hear,[END]
on,the,morrow,i,am,to,be,wed,[END]
to,sansa,stark,[END]
i,know,[END]
he,was,speechless,for,an,instant,[END]
even,sansa,did,not,know,not,then,[END]
how,could,you,know,[END]
did,varys,tell,you,[END]
some,page,was,telling,ser,tallad,about,it,when,i,took,lollys,to,the,sept,he,had,it,from,this,serving,girl,who,heard,ser,kevan,talking,to,your,father,[END]
she,wriggled,free,of,his,grasp,and,pulled,her,dress,up,over,her,head,[END]
as,ever,she,was,naked,underneath,[END]
i,don't,care,[END]
she's,only,a,little,girl,[END]
you'll,give,her,a,big,belly,and,come,back,to,me,[END]
some,part,of,him,had,hoped,for,less,indifference,[END]
had,hoped,he,jeered,bitterly,but,now,you,know,better,dwarf,[END]
shae,is,all,the,love,you're,ever,like,to,have,[END]
muddy,way,was,crowded,but,soldiers,and,townfolk,alike,made,way,for,the,imp,and,his,escort,[END]
hollow-eyed,children,swarmed,underfoot,some,looking,up,in,silent,appeal,whilst,others,begged,noisily,[END]
tyrion,pulled,a,big,fistful,of,coppers,from,his,purse,and,tossed,them,in,the,air,and,the,children,went,running,for,them,shoving,and,shouting,[END]
the,lucky,ones,might,be,able,to,buy,a,heel,of,stale,bread,tonight,[END]
he,had,never,seen,markets,so,crowded,and,for,all,the,food,the,tyrells,were,bringing,in,prices,remained,shockingly,high,[END]
six,coppers,for,a,melon,a,silver,stag,for,a,bushel,of,corn,a,dragon,for,a,side,of,beef,or,six,skinny,piglets,[END]
yet,there,seemed,no,lack,of,buyers,[END]
gaunt,men,and,haggard,women,crowded,around,every,wagon,and,stall,while,others,even,more,ragged,looked,on,sullenly,from,the,mouths,of,alleys,[END]
this,way,bronn,said,when,they,reached,the,foot,of,the,hook,[END]
if,you,still,mean,to,[END]
i,do,[END]
the,riverfront,had,made,a,convenient,excuse,but,tyrion,had,another,purpose,today,[END]
it,was,not,a,task,he,relished,but,it,must,be,done,[END]
they,turned,away,from,aegon's,high,hill,into,the,maze,of,smaller,streets,that,clustered,around,the,foot,of,visenya's,[END]
bronn,led,the,way,[END]
once,or,twice,tyrion,glanced,back,over,his,shoulder,to,see,if,they,were,being,followed,but,there,was,nothing,to,be,seen,except,the,usual,rabble,a,carter,beating,his,horse,an,old,woman,throwing,nightsoil,from,her,window,two,little,boys,fighting,with,sticks,three,gold,cloaks,escorting,a,captive,[END]
they,all,looked,innocent,but,any,one,of,them,could,be,his,undoing,[END]
varys,had,informers,everywhere,[END]
they,turned,at,a,corner,and,again,at,the,next,and,rode,slowly,through,a,crowd,of,women,at,a,well,[END]
bronn,led,him,along,a,curving,wynd,through,an,alley,under,a,broken,archway,[END]
they,cut,through,the,rubble,where,a,house,had,burned,and,walked,their,horses,up,a,shallow,flight,of,stone,steps,[END]
the,buildings,were,close,and,poor,[END]
bronn,halted,at,the,mouth,of,a,crooked,alley,too,narrow,for,two,to,ride,abreast,[END]
there's,two,jags,and,then,a,dead,end,[END]
the,sink,is,in,the,cellar,of,the,last,building,[END]
tyrion,swung,down,off,his,horse,[END]
see,that,no,one,enters,or,leaves,till,i,return,[END]
this,won't,take,long,[END]
his,hand,went,into,his,cloak,to,make,certain,the,gold,was,still,there,in,the,hidden,pocket,[END]
thirty,dragons,[END]
a,bloody,fortune,for,a,man,like,him,[END]
he,waddled,up,the,alley,quickly,anxious,to,be,done,with,this,[END]
the,wine,sink,was,a,dismal,place,dark,and,damp,walls,pale,with,niter,the,ceiling,so,low,that,bronn,would,have,had,to,duck,to,keep,from,hitting,his,head,on,the,beams,[END]
tyrion,lannister,had,no,such,problem,[END]
at,this,hour,the,front,room,was,empty,but,for,a,dead-eyed,woman,who,sat,on,a,stool,behind,a,rough,plank,bar,[END]
she,handed,him,a,cup,of,sour,wine,and,said,in,the,back,[END]
the,back,room,was,even,darker,[END]
a,flickering,candle,burned,on,a,low,table,beside,a,flagon,of,wine,[END]
the,man,behind,it,scarce,looked,a,danger,a,short,man,though,all,men,were,tall,to,tyrion,with,thinning,brown,hair,pink,cheeks,and,a,little,pot,pushing,at,the,bone,buttons,of,his,doeskin,jerkin,[END]
in,his,soft,hands,he,held,a,twelve-stringed,woodharp,more,deadly,than,a,longsword,[END]
tyrion,sat,across,from,him,[END]
symon,silver,tongue,[END]
the,man,inclined,his,head,[END]
he,was,bald,on,top,[END]
my,lord,hand,he,said,[END]
you,mistake,me,[END]
my,father,is,the,king's,hand,[END]
i,am,no,longer,even,a,finger,i,fear,[END]
you,shall,rise,again,i,am,sure,[END]
a,man,like,you,[END]
my,sweet,lady,shae,tells,me,you,are,newly,wed,would,that,you,had,sent,for,me,earlier,[END]
i,should,have,been,honored,to,sing,at,your,feast,[END]
the,last,thing,my,wife,needs,is,more,songs,said,tyrion,[END]
as,for,shae,we,both,know,she,is,no,lady,and,i,would,thank,you,never,to,speak,her,name,aloud,[END]
as,the,hand,commands,symon,said,[END]
the,last,time,tyrion,had,seen,the,man,a,sharp,word,had,been,enough,to,set,him,sweating,but,it,seemed,the,singer,had,found,some,courage,somewhere,[END]
most,like,in,that,flagon,[END]
or,perhaps,tyrion,himself,was,to,blame,for,this,new,boldness,[END]
i,threatened,him,but,nothing,ever,came,of,the,threat,so,now,he,believes,me,toothless,[END]
he,sighed,[END]
i,am,told,you,are,a,very,gifted,singer,[END]
you,are,most,kind,to,say,so,my,lord,[END]
tyrion,gave,him,a,smile,[END]
i,think,it,is,time,you,brought,your,music,to,the,free,cities,[END]
they,are,great,lovers,of,song,in,braavos,and,pentos,and,lys,and,generous,with,those,who,please,them,[END]
he,took,a,sip,of,wine,[END]
it,was,foul,stuff,but,strong,[END]
a,tour,of,all,nine,cities,would,be,best,[END]
you,wouldn't,want,to,deny,anyone,the,joy,of,hearing,you,sing,[END]
a,year,in,each,should,suffice,[END]
he,reached,inside,his,cloak,to,where,the,gold,was,hidden,[END]
with,the,port,closed,you,will,need,to,go,to,duskendale,to,take,ship,but,my,man,bronn,will,find,a,horse,for,you,and,i,would,be,honored,if,you,would,let,me,pay,your,passage,[END]
but,my,lord,the,man,objected,you,have,never,heard,me,sing,[END]
pray,listen,a,moment,[END]
his,fingers,moved,deftly,over,the,strings,of,the,woodharp,and,soft,music,filled,the,cellar,[END]
symon,began,to,sing,[END]
he,rode,through,the,streets,of,the,city,[END]
down,from,his,hill,on,high,[END]
o'er,the,wynds,and,the,steps,and,the,cobbles,[END]
he,rode,to,a,woman's,sigh,[END]
for,she,was,his,secret,treasure,[END]
she,was,his,shame,and,his,bliss,[END]
and,a,chain,and,a,keep,are,nothing,[END]
compared,to,a,woman's,kiss,[END]
there's,more,the,man,said,as,he,broke,off,[END]
oh,a,good,deal,more,[END]
the,refrain,is,especially,nice,i,think,[END]
for,hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman's,hands,are,warm,[END]
enough,[END]
tyrion,slid,his,fingers,from,his,cloak,empty,[END]
that's,not,a,song,i,would,care,to,hear,again,[END]
ever,[END]
no,[END]
symon,silver,tongue,put,his,harp,aside,and,took,a,sip,of,wine,[END]
a,pity,[END]
still,each,man,has,his,song,as,my,old,master,used,to,say,when,he,was,teaching,me,to,play,[END]
others,might,like,my,tune,better,[END]
the,queen,perhaps,[END]
or,your,lord,father,[END]
tyrion,rubbed,the,scar,over,his,nose,and,said,my,father,has,no,time,for,singers,and,my,sister,is,not,as,generous,as,one,might,think,[END]
a,wise,man,could,earn,more,from,silence,than,from,song,[END]
he,could,not,put,it,much,plainer,than,that,[END]
symon,seemed,to,take,his,meaning,quick,enough,[END]
you,will,find,my,price,modest,my,lord,[END]
that's,good,to,know,[END]

seven,kingdoms,seven,vows,seven,challenges,seventy-seven,dishes,[END]

what,would,the,high,septon,think,[END]
you,did,not,strike,me,as,a,pious,man,my,lord,[END]
piety,is,not,the,point,[END]
certain,forms,must,be,observed,[END]

the,balding,kettle-bellied,singer,took,up,his,woodharp,again,[END]
bronn,was,waiting,with,the,horses,at,the,mouth,of,the,alley,[END]

even,that,modest,pleasure,was,denied,him,however,no,sooner,had,he,returned,to,his,chambers,than,podrick,payne,informed,him,that,he,had,been,summoned,to,the,tower,of,the,hand,[END]
his,lordship,wants,to,see,you,[END]
the,hand,[END]
lord,tywin,[END]

why,not,[END]
he,never,uses,it,[END]
tyrion,wondered,what,he'd,done,now,[END]
or,more,like,what,i,have,failed,to,do,[END]
a,summons,from,lord,tywin,always,had,teeth,his,father,never,sent,for,him,just,to,share,a,meal,or,a,cup,of,wine,that,was,for,certain,[END]
as,he,entered,his,lord,father's,solar,a,few,moments,later,he,heard,a,voice,saying,[END]
cherrywood,for,the,scabbards,bound,in,red,leather,and,ornamented,with,a,row,of,lion's-head,studs,in,pure,gold,[END]
perhaps,with,garnets,for,the,eyes,[END]

a,bundle,of,oilcloth,lay,on,the,table,between,them,and,lord,tywin,had,a,longsword,in,his,hand,[END]
a,wedding,gift,for,joffrey,he,told,tyrion,[END]
the,light,streaming,through,the,diamond-shaped,panes,of,glass,made,the,blade,shimmer,black,and,red,as,lord,tywin,turned,it,to,inspect,the,edge,while,the,pommel,and,crossguard,flamed,gold,[END]
with,this,fool's,jabber,of,stannis,and,his,magic,sword,it,seemed,to,me,that,we,had,best,give,joffrey,something,extraordinary,as,well,[END]
a,king,should,bear,a,kingly,weapon,[END]
that's,much,too,much,sword,for,joff,tyrion,said,[END]
he,will,grow,into,it,[END]
here,feel,the,weight,of,it,[END]
he,offered,the,weapon,hilt,first,[END]
the,sword,was,much,lighter,than,he,had,expected,[END]
as,he,turned,it,in,his,hand,he,saw,why,[END]
only,one,metal,could,be,beaten,so,thin,and,still,have,strength,enough,to,fight,with,and,there,was,no,mistaking,those,ripples,the,mark,of,steel,that,has,been,folded,back,on,itself,many,thousands,of,times,[END]
valyrian,steel,[END]
yes,lord,tywin,said,in,a,tone,of,deep,satisfaction,[END]
at,long,last,father,[END]
valyrian,steel,blades,were,scarce,and,costly,yet,thousands,remained,in,the,world,perhaps,two,hundred,in,the,seven,kingdoms,alone,[END]
it,had,always,irked,his,father,that,none,belonged,to,house,lannister,[END]
the,old,kings,of,the,rock,had,owned,such,a,weapon,but,the,greatsword,brightroar,had,been,lost,when,the,second,king,tommen,carried,it,back,to,valyria,on,his,fool's,quest,[END]
he,had,never,returned,nor,had,uncle,gery,the,youngest,and,most,reckless,of,his,father's,brothers,who,had,gone,seeking,after,the,lost,sword,some,eight,years,past,[END]
thrice,at,least,lord,tywin,had,offered,to,buy,valyrian,longswords,from,impoverished,lesser,houses,but,his,advances,had,always,been,firmly,rebuffed,[END]
the,little,lordlings,would,gladly,part,with,their,daughters,should,a,lannister,come,asking,but,they,cherished,their,old,family,swords,[END]
tyrion,wondered,where,the,metal,for,this,one,had,come,from,[END]
a,few,master,armorers,could,rework,old,valyrian,steel,but,the,secrets,of,its,making,had,been,lost,when,the,doom,came,to,old,valyria,[END]
the,colors,are,strange,he,commented,as,he,turned,the,blade,in,the,sunlight,[END]
most,valyrian,steel,was,a,grey,so,dark,it,looked,almost,black,as,was,true,here,as,well,[END]
but,blended,into,the,folds,was,a,red,as,deep,as,the,grey,[END]
the,two,colors,lapped,over,one,another,without,ever,touching,each,ripple,distinct,like,waves,of,night,and,blood,upon,some,steely,shore,[END]
how,did,you,get,this,patterning,[END]
i've,never,seen,anything,like,it,[END]
nor,i,my,lord,said,the,armorer,[END]
i,confess,these,colors,were,not,what,i,intended,and,i,do,not,know,that,i,could,duplicate,them,[END]
your,lord,father,had,asked,for,the,crimson,of,your,house,and,it,was,that,color,i,set,out,to,infuse,into,the,metal,[END]
but,valyrian,steel,is,stubborn,[END]
these,old,swords,remember,it,is,said,and,they,do,not,change,easily,[END]
i,worked,half,a,hundred,spells,and,brightened,the,red,time,and,time,again,but,always,the,color,would,darken,as,if,the,blade,was,drinking,the,sun,from,it,[END]
and,some,folds,would,not,take,the,red,at,all,as,you,can,see,[END]
if,my,lords,of,lannister,are,displeased,i,will,of,course,try,again,as,many,times,as,you,should,require,but,[END]
no,need,lord,tywin,said,[END]
this,will,serve,[END]
a,crimson,sword,might,flash,prettily,in,the,sun,but,if,truth,be,told,i,like,these,colors,better,said,tyrion,[END]
they,have,an,ominous,beauty,[END]
and,they,make,this,blade,unique,[END]
there,is,no,other,sword,like,it,in,all,the,world,i,should,think,[END]
there,is,one,[END]
the,armorer,bent,over,the,table,and,unfolded,the,bundle,of,oilcloth,to,reveal,a,second,longsword,[END]
tyrion,put,down,joffrey's,sword,and,took,up,the,other,[END]
if,not,twins,the,two,were,at,least,close,cousins,[END]
this,one,was,thicker,and,heavier,a,half-inch,wider,and,three,inches,longer,but,they,shared,the,same,fine,clean,lines,and,the,same,distinctive,color,the,ripples,of,blood,and,night,[END]
three,fullers,deeply,incised,ran,down,the,second,blade,from,hilt,to,point,the,king's,sword,had,only,two,[END]
joff's,hilt,was,a,good,deal,more,ornate,the,arms,of,its,crossguard,done,as,lions',paws,with,ruby,claws,unsheathed,but,both,swords,had,grips,of,finely,tooled,red,leather,and,gold,lions',heads,for,pommels,[END]
magnificent,[END]
even,in,hands,as,unskilled,as,tyrion's,the,blade,felt,alive,[END]
i,have,never,felt,better,balance,[END]
it,is,meant,for,my,son,[END]
no,need,to,ask,which,son,[END]
tyrion,placed,jaime's,sword,back,on,the,table,beside,joffrey's,wondering,if,robb,stark,would,let,his,brother,live,long,enough,to,wield,it,[END]
our,father,must,surely,think,so,else,why,have,this,blade,forged,[END]
you,have,done,good,work,master,mott,lord,tywin,told,the,armorer,[END]
my,steward,will,see,to,your,payment,[END]
and,remember,rubies,for,the,scabbards,[END]
i,shall,my,lord,[END]
you,are,most,generous,[END]
the,man,folded,the,swords,up,in,the,oilcloth,tucked,the,bundle,under,one,arm,and,went,to,his,knee,[END]
it,is,an,honor,to,serve,the,king's,hand,[END]
i,shall,deliver,the,swords,the,day,before,the,wedding,[END]
see,that,you,do,[END]
when,the,guards,had,seen,the,armorer,out,tyrion,clambered,up,onto,a,chair,[END]
so,[END]
a,sword,for,joff,a,sword,for,jaime,and,not,even,a,dagger,for,the,dwarf,[END]
is,that,the,way,of,it,father,[END]
the,steel,was,sufficient,for,two,blades,not,three,[END]
if,you,have,need,of,a,dagger,take,one,from,the,armory,[END]
robert,left,a,hundred,when,he,died,[END]
gerion,gave,him,a,gilded,dagger,with,an,ivory,grip,and,a,sapphire,pommel,for,a,wedding,gift,and,half,the,envoys,who,came,to,court,tried,to,curry,favor,by,presenting,his,grace,with,jewel-encrusted,knives,and,silver,inlay,swords,[END]
tyrion,smiled,[END]
they'd,have,pleased,him,more,if,they'd,presented,him,with,their,daughters,[END]
no,doubt,[END]
the,only,blade,he,ever,used,was,the,hunting,knife,he,had,from,jon,arryn,when,he,was,a,boy,[END]
lord,tywin,waved,a,hand,dismissing,king,robert,and,all,his,knives,[END]
what,did,you,find,at,the,riverfront,[END]
mud,said,tyrion,and,a,few,dead,things,no,one's,bothered,to,bury,[END]
before,we,can,open,the,port,again,the,blackwater's,going,to,have,to,be,dredged,the,sunken,ships,broken,up,or,raised,[END]
three-quarters,of,the,quays,need,repair,and,some,may,have,to,be,torn,down,and,rebuilt,[END]
the,entire,fish,market,is,gone,and,both,the,river,gate,and,the,king's,gate,are,splintered,from,the,battering,stannis,gave,them,and,should,be,replaced,[END]
i,shudder,to,think,of,the,cost,[END]
if,you,do,shit,gold,father,find,a,privy,and,get,busy,he,wanted,to,say,but,he,knew,better,[END]
you,will,find,whatever,gold,is,required,[END]
will,i,[END]
where,[END]
the,treasury,is,empty,i've,told,you,that,[END]
we're,not,done,paying,the,alchemists,for,all,that,wildfire,or,the,smiths,for,my,chain,and,cersei's,pledged,the,crown,to,pay,half,the,costs,of,joff's,wedding,seventy-seven,bloody,courses,a,thousand,guests,a,pie,full,of,doves,singers,jugglers,[END]
extravagance,has,its,uses,[END]
we,must,demonstrate,the,power,and,wealth,of,casterly,rock,for,all,the,realm,to,see,[END]
then,perhaps,casterly,rock,should,pay,[END]
why,[END]
i,have,seen,littlefinger's,accounts,[END]
crown,incomes,are,ten,times,higher,than,they,were,under,aerys,[END]
as,are,the,crown's,expenses,[END]
robert,was,as,generous,with,his,coin,as,he,was,with,his,cock,[END]
littlefinger,borrowed,heavily,[END]
from,you,amongst,others,[END]
yes,the,incomes,are,considerable,but,they,are,barely,sufficient,to,cover,the,usury,on,littlefinger's,loans,[END]
will,you,forgive,the,throne's,debt,to,house,lannister,[END]
don't,be,absurd,[END]
then,perhaps,seven,courses,would,suffice,[END]
three,hundred,guests,instead,of,a,thousand,[END]
i,understand,that,a,marriage,can,be,just,as,binding,without,a,dancing,bear,[END]
the,tyrells,would,think,us,niggardly,[END]
i,will,have,the,wedding,and,the,waterfront,[END]
if,you,cannot,pay,for,them,say,so,and,i,shall,find,a,master,of,coin,who,can,[END]
the,disgrace,of,being,dismissed,after,so,short,a,time,was,not,something,tyrion,cared,to,suffer,[END]
i,will,find,your,money,[END]
you,will,his,father,promised,and,while,you,are,about,it,see,if,you,can,find,your,wife's,bed,as,well,[END]
so,the,talk,has,reached,even,him,[END]
i,have,thank,you,[END]
it's,that,piece,of,furniture,between,the,window,and,the,hearth,with,the,velvet,canopy,and,the,mattress,stuffed,with,goose,down,[END]
i,am,pleased,you,know,of,it,[END]
now,perhaps,you,ought,to,try,and,know,the,woman,who,shares,it,with,you,[END]
woman,[END]
child,you,mean,[END]
has,a,spider,been,whispering,in,your,ear,or,do,i,have,my,sweet,sister,to,thank,[END]
considering,the,things,that,went,on,beneath,cersei's,blankets,you,would,think,she'd,have,the,decency,to,keep,her,nose,out,of,his,[END]
tell,me,why,is,it,that,all,of,sansa's,maids,are,women,in,cersei's,service,[END]
i,am,sick,of,being,spied,upon,in,my,own,chambers,[END]
if,you,mislike,your,wife's,servants,dismiss,them,and,hire,ones,more,to,your,liking,[END]
that,is,your,right,[END]
it,is,your,wife's,maidenhood,that,concerns,me,not,her,maids,[END]
this,[END]
delicacy,puzzles,me,[END]
you,seem,to,have,no,difficulty,bedding,whores,[END]
is,the,stark,girl,made,differently,[END]
why,do,you,take,so,much,bloody,interest,in,where,i,put,my,cock,[END]
tyrion,demanded,[END]
sansa,is,too,young,[END]
she,is,old,enough,to,be,lady,of,winterfell,once,her,brother,is,dead,[END]
claim,her,maidenhood,and,you,will,be,one,step,closer,to,claiming,the,north,[END]
get,her,with,child,and,the,prize,is,all,but,won,[END]
do,i,need,to,remind,you,that,a,marriage,that,has,not,been,consummated,can,be,set,aside,[END]
by,the,high,septon,or,a,council,of,faith,[END]
our,present,high,septon,is,a,trained,seal,who,barks,prettily,on,command,[END]
moon,boy,is,more,like,to,annul,my,marriage,than,he,is,[END]
perhaps,i,should,have,married,sansa,stark,to,moon,boy,[END]
he,might,have,known,what,to,do,with,her,[END]
tyrion's,hands,clenched,on,the,arms,of,his,chair,[END]
i,have,heard,all,i,mean,to,hear,on,the,subject,of,my,wife's,maidenhead,[END]
but,so,long,as,we,are,discussing,marriage,why,is,it,that,i,hear,nothing,of,my,sister's,impending,nuptials,[END]
as,i,recall,[END]
lord,tywin,cut,him,off,[END]
mace,tyrell,has,refused,my,offer,to,marry,cersei,to,his,heir,willas,[END]
refused,our,sweet,cersei,[END]
that,put,tyrion,in,a,much,better,mood,[END]
when,i,first,broached,the,match,to,him,lord,tyrell,seemed,well,enough,disposed,his,father,said,[END]
a,day,later,all,was,changed,[END]
the,old,woman's,work,[END]
she,hectors,her,son,unmercifully,[END]
varys,claims,she,told,him,that,your,sister,was,too,old,and,too,used,for,this,precious,one-legged,grandson,of,hers,[END]
cersei,must,have,loved,that,[END]
he,laughed,[END]
lord,tywin,gave,him,a,chilly,look,[END]
she,does,not,know,[END]
nor,will,she,[END]
it,is,better,for,all,of,us,if,the,offer,was,never,made,[END]
see,that,you,remember,that,tyrion,[END]
the,offer,was,never,made,[END]
what,offer,[END]
tyrion,rather,suspected,that,lord,tyrell,might,come,to,regret,this,rebuff,[END]
your,sister,will,be,wed,the,question,is,to,whom,[END]
i,have,several,thoughts,before,he,could,get,to,them,there,was,a,rap,at,the,door,and,a,guardsman,stuck,in,his,head,to,announce,grand,maester,pycelle,[END]
he,may,enter,said,lord,tywin,[END]
pycelle,tottered,in,on,a,cane,and,stopped,long,enough,to,give,tyrion,a,look,that,would,curdle,milk,[END]
his,once-magnificent,white,beard,which,someone,had,unaccountably,shaved,off,was,growing,back,sparse,and,wispy,leaving,him,with,unsightly,pink,wattles,to,dangle,beneath,his,neck,[END]
my,lord,hand,the,old,man,said,bowing,as,deeply,as,he,could,without,falling,there,has,been,another,bird,from,castle,black,[END]
mayhaps,we,could,consult,privily,[END]
there's,no,need,for,that,[END]
lord,tywin,waved,grand,maester,pycelle,to,a,seat,[END]
tyrion,may,stay,[END]
oooooh,may,i,[END]
he,rubbed,his,nose,and,waited,[END]
pycelle,cleared,his,throat,which,involved,a,deal,of,coughing,and,hawking,[END]
the,letter,is,from,the,same,bowen,marsh,who,sent,the,last,[END]
the,castellan,[END]
he,writes,that,lord,mormont,has,sent,word,of,wildlings,moving,south,in,vast,numbers,[END]
the,lands,beyond,the,wall,cannot,support,vast,numbers,said,lord,tywin,firmly,[END]
this,warning,is,not,new,[END]
this,last,is,my,lord,[END]
mormont,sent,a,bird,from,the,haunted,forest,to,report,that,he,was,under,attack,[END]
more,ravens,have,returned,since,but,none,with,letters,[END]
this,bowen,marsh,fears,lord,mormont,slain,with,all,his,strength,[END]
tyrion,had,rather,liked,old,jeor,mormont,with,his,gruff,manner,and,talking,bird,[END]
is,this,certain,[END]
he,asked,[END]
it,is,not,pycelle,admitted,but,none,of,mormont's,men,have,returned,as,yet,[END]
marsh,fears,the,wildlings,have,killed,them,and,that,the,wall,itself,may,be,attacked,next,[END]
he,fumbled,in,his,robe,and,found,the,paper,[END]
here,is,his,letter,my,lord,a,plea,to,all,five,kings,[END]
he,wants,men,as,many,men,as,we,can,send,him,[END]
five,kings,[END]
his,father,was,annoyed,[END]
there,is,one,king,in,westeros,[END]
those,fools,in,black,might,try,and,remember,that,if,they,wish,his,grace,to,heed,them,[END]
when,you,reply,tell,him,that,renly,is,dead,and,the,others,are,traitors,and,pretenders,[END]
no,doubt,they,will,be,glad,to,learn,it,[END]
the,wall,is,a,world,apart,and,news,oft,reaches,them,late,[END]
pycelle,bobbed,his,head,up,and,down,[END]
what,shall,i,tell,marsh,concerning,the,men,he,begs,for,[END]
shall,we,convene,the,council,[END]
there,is,no,need,[END]
the,night's,watch,is,a,pack,of,thieves,killers,and,baseborn,churls,but,it,occurs,to,me,that,they,could,prove,otherwise,given,proper,discipline,[END]
if,mormont,is,indeed,dead,the,black,brothers,must,choose,a,new,lord,commander,[END]
pycelle,gave,tyrion,a,sly,glance,[END]
an,excellent,thought,my,lord,[END]
i,know,the,very,man,[END]
janos,slynt,[END]
tyrion,liked,that,notion,not,at,all,[END]
the,black,brothers,choose,their,own,commander,he,reminded,them,[END]

the,boat,had,vanished,in,the,mists,[END]

catelyn,reached,out,blindly,groping,for,her,brother's,hand,but,edmure,had,moved,away,to,stand,alone,on,the,highest,point,of,the,battlements,[END]
her,uncle,brynden,took,her,hand,instead,twining,his,strong,fingers,through,hers,[END]
together,they,watched,the,little,fire,grow,smaller,as,the,burning,boat,receded,in,the,distance,[END]
and,then,it,was,gone,[END]
drifting,downriver,still,perhaps,or,broken,up,and,sinking,[END]
the,weight,of,his,armor,would,carry,lord,hoster,down,to,rest,in,the,soft,mud,of,the,riverbed,in,the,watery,halls,where,the,tullys,held,eternal,court,with,schools,of,fish,their,last,attendants,[END]

yet,she,knew,as,well,as,he,that,this,was,not,the,time,he,was,lord,of,riverrun,now,and,his,knights,were,falling,in,around,him,murmuring,condolences,and,promises,of,fealty,walling,him,off,from,something,as,small,as,a,sister's,grief,[END]

the,day,my,own,lord,father,went,downriver,hoster,missed,as,well,[END]
with,his,first,shaft,[END]

his,second,found,the,sail,[END]
she,sighed,[END]
edmure,was,not,as,strong,as,he,seemed,[END]
their,father's,death,had,been,a,mercy,when,it,came,at,last,but,even,so,her,brother,had,taken,it,hard,[END]
last,night,in,his,cups,he,had,broken,down,and,wept,full,of,regrets,for,things,undone,and,words,unsaid,[END]
he,ought,never,to,have,ridden,off,to,fight,his,battle,on,the,fords,he,told,her,tearfully,he,should,have,stayed,at,their,father's,bedside,[END]

lord,hoster's,last,word,had,been,tansy,but,catelyn,could,not,bring,herself,to,tell,him,that,[END]
he,whispered,your,name,she,lied,and,her,brother,had,nodded,gratefully,and,kissed,her,hand,[END]
if,he,had,not,tried,to,drown,his,grief,and,guilt,he,might,have,been,able,to,bend,a,bow,she,thought,to,herself,sighing,but,that,was,something,else,she,dare,not,say,[END]
the,blackfish,escorted,her,down,from,the,battlements,to,where,robb,stood,among,his,bannermen,his,young,queen,at,his,side,[END]
when,he,saw,her,her,son,took,her,silently,in,his,arms,[END]
lord,hoster,looked,as,noble,as,a,king,my,lady,murmured,jeyne,[END]
would,that,i,had,been,given,the,chance,to,know,him,[END]
and,i,to,know,him,better,added,robb,[END]
he,would,have,wished,that,too,said,catelyn,[END]
there,were,too,many,leagues,between,riverrun,and,winterfell,[END]
and,too,many,mountains,and,rivers,and,armies,between,riverrun,and,the,eyrie,it,would,seem,[END]
lysa,had,made,no,reply,to,her,letter,[END]
and,from,king's,landing,came,only,silence,as,well,[END]
by,now,she,had,hoped,that,brienne,and,ser,cleos,would,have,reached,the,city,with,their,captive,[END]
it,might,even,be,that,brienne,was,on,her,way,back,and,the,girls,with,her,[END]

he,swore,it,[END]
ravens,did,not,always,win,through,[END]
some,bowman,could,have,brought,the,bird,down,and,roasted,him,for,supper,[END]
the,letter,that,would,have,set,her,heart,at,ease,might,even,now,be,lying,by,the,ashes,of,some,campfire,beside,a,pile,of,raven,bones,[END]
others,were,waiting,to,offer,robb,their,consolations,so,catelyn,stood,aside,patiently,while,lord,jason,mallister,the,greatjon,and,ser,rolph,spicer,spoke,to,him,each,in,turn,[END]
but,when,lothar,frey,approached,she,gave,his,sleeve,a,tug,[END]
robb,turned,and,waited,to,hear,what,lothar,would,say,[END]
your,grace,[END]
a,plump,man,in,his,middle,thirties,lothar,frey,had,close-set,eyes,a,pointed,beard,and,dark,hair,that,fell,to,his,shoulders,in,ringlets,[END]
a,leg,twisted,at,birth,had,earned,him,the,name,lame,lothar,[END]
he,had,served,as,his,father's,steward,for,the,past,dozen,years,[END]
we,are,loath,to,intrude,upon,your,grief,but,perhaps,you,might,grant,us,audience,tonight,[END]
it,would,be,my,pleasure,said,robb,[END]
it,was,never,my,wish,to,sow,enmity,between,us,[END]
nor,mine,to,be,the,cause,of,it,said,queen,jeyne,[END]
lothar,frey,smiled,[END]
i,understand,as,does,my,lord,father,[END]
he,instructed,me,to,say,that,he,was,young,once,and,well,remembers,what,it,is,like,to,lose,one's,heart,to,beauty,[END]
catelyn,doubted,very,much,that,lord,walder,had,said,any,such,thing,or,that,he,had,ever,lost,his,heart,to,beauty,[END]
the,lord,of,the,crossing,had,outlived,seven,wives,and,was,now,wed,to,his,eighth,but,he,spoke,of,them,only,as,bedwarmers,and,brood,mares,[END]
still,the,words,were,fairly,spoken,and,she,could,scarce,object,to,the,compliment,[END]
nor,did,robb,[END]
your,father,is,most,gracious,he,said,[END]
i,shall,look,forward,to,our,talk,[END]
lothar,bowed,kissed,the,queen's,hand,and,withdrew,[END]
by,then,a,dozen,others,had,gathered,for,a,word,[END]
robb,spoke,with,them,each,giving,a,thanks,here,a,smile,there,as,needed,[END]
only,when,the,last,of,them,was,done,did,he,turn,back,to,catelyn,[END]
there,is,something,we,must,speak,of,[END]
will,you,walk,with,me,[END]
as,you,command,your,grace,[END]
that,wasn't,a,command,mother,[END]
it,will,be,my,pleasure,then,[END]
her,son,had,treated,her,kindly,enough,since,returning,to,riverrun,yet,he,seldom,sought,her,out,[END]
if,he,was,more,comfortable,with,his,young,queen,she,could,scarcely,blame,him,[END]
jeyne,makes,him,smile,and,i,have,nothing,to,share,with,him,but,grief,[END]
he,seemed,to,enjoy,the,company,of,his,bride's,brothers,as,well,young,rollam,his,squire,and,ser,raynald,his,standard-bearer,[END]
they,are,standing,in,the,boots,of,those,he's,lost,catelyn,realized,when,she,watched,them,together,[END]
rollam,has,taken,bran's,place,and,raynald,is,part,theon,and,part,jon,snow,[END]
only,with,the,westerlings,did,she,see,robb,smile,or,hear,him,laugh,like,the,boy,he,was,[END]
to,the,others,he,was,always,the,king,in,the,north,head,bowed,beneath,the,weight,of,the,crown,even,when,his,brows,were,bare,[END]
robb,kissed,his,wife,gently,promised,to,see,her,in,their,chambers,and,went,off,with,his,lady,mother,[END]
his,steps,led,them,toward,the,godswood,[END]
lothar,seemed,amiable,that's,a,hopeful,sign,[END]
we,need,the,freys,[END]
that,does,not,mean,we,shall,have,them,[END]
he,nodded,and,there,was,glumness,to,his,face,and,a,slope,to,his,shoulders,that,made,her,heart,go,out,to,him,[END]
the,crown,is,crushing,him,she,thought,[END]
he,wants,so,much,to,be,a,good,king,to,be,brave,and,honorable,and,clever,but,the,weight,is,too,much,for,a,boy,to,bear,[END]
robb,was,doing,all,he,could,yet,still,the,blows,kept,falling,one,after,the,other,relentless,[END]
when,they,brought,him,word,of,the,battle,at,duskendale,where,lord,randyll,tarly,had,shattered,robett,glover,and,ser,helman,tallhart,he,might,have,been,expected,to,rage,[END]
instead,he'd,stared,in,dumb,disbelief,and,said,duskendale,on,the,narrow,sea,[END]
why,would,they,go,to,duskendale,[END]
he'd,shook,his,head,bewildered,[END]
a,third,of,my,foot,lost,for,duskendale,[END]
the,ironmen,have,my,castle,and,now,the,lannisters,hold,my,brother,galbart,glover,said,in,a,voice,thick,with,despair,[END]
robett,glover,had,survived,the,battle,but,had,been,captured,near,the,kingsroad,not,long,after,[END]
not,for,long,her,son,promised,[END]

lord,tywin,will,have,to,accept,for,his,brother's,sake,[END]
martyn,was,ser,kevan's,son,a,twin,to,the,willem,that,lord,karstark,had,butchered,[END]
those,murders,still,haunted,her,son,catelyn,knew,[END]
he,had,tripled,the,guard,around,martyn,but,still,feared,for,his,safety,[END]
i,should,have,traded,the,kingslayer,for,sansa,when,you,first,urged,it,robb,said,as,they,walked,the,gallery,[END]
if,i'd,offered,to,wed,her,to,the,knight,of,flowers,the,tyrells,might,be,ours,instead,of,joffrey's,[END]
i,should,have,thought,of,that,[END]
your,mind,was,on,your,battles,and,rightly,so,[END]
even,a,king,cannot,think,of,everything,[END]
battles,muttered,robb,as,he,led,her,out,beneath,the,trees,[END]

and,jeyne,yes,[END]
do,you,think,lord,balon,can,afford,to,let,her,live,to,bear,you,heirs,[END]
robb's,face,was,cold,[END]
is,that,why,you,freed,the,kingslayer,[END]
to,make,a,peace,with,the,lannisters,[END]
i,freed,jaime,for,sansa's,sake,[END]
and,arya's,if,she,still,lives,[END]
you,know,that,[END]
but,if,i,nurtured,some,hope,of,buying,peace,as,well,was,that,so,ill,[END]
yes,he,said,[END]
the,lannisters,killed,my,father,[END]
do,you,think,i,have,forgotten,that,[END]
i,don't,know,[END]
have,you,[END]
catelyn,had,never,struck,her,children,in,anger,but,she,almost,struck,robb,then,[END]
it,was,an,effort,to,remind,herself,how,frightened,and,alone,he,must,feel,[END]
you,are,king,in,the,north,the,choice,is,yours,[END]
i,only,ask,that,you,think,on,what,i've,said,[END]
the,singers,make,much,of,kings,who,die,valiantly,in,battle,but,your,life,is,worth,more,than,a,song,[END]
to,me,at,least,who,gave,it,to,you,[END]
she,lowered,her,head,[END]
do,i,have,your,leave,to,go,[END]
yes,[END]
he,turned,away,and,drew,his,sword,[END]
what,he,meant,to,do,with,it,she,could,not,say,[END]
there,was,no,enemy,there,no,one,to,fight,[END]
only,her,and,him,amongst,tall,trees,and,fallen,leaves,[END]
there,are,fights,no,sword,can,win,catelyn,wanted,to,tell,him,but,she,feared,the,king,was,deaf,to,such,words,[END]
hours,later,she,was,sewing,in,her,bedchamber,when,young,rollam,westerling,came,running,with,the,summons,to,supper,[END]
good,catelyn,thought,relieved,[END]
she,had,not,been,certain,that,her,son,would,want,her,there,after,their,quarrel,[END]
a,dutiful,squire,she,said,to,rollam,gravely,[END]
bran,would,have,been,the,same,[END]
if,robb,seemed,cool,at,table,and,edmure,surly,lame,lothar,made,up,for,them,both,[END]
he,was,the,model,of,courtesy,reminiscing,warmly,about,lord,hoster,offering,catelyn,gentle,condolences,on,the,loss,of,bran,and,rickon,praising,edmure,for,the,victory,at,stone,mill,and,thanking,robb,for,the,swift,sure,justice,he,had,meted,out,to,rickard,karstark,[END]
lothar's,bastard,brother,walder,rivers,was,another,matter,a,harsh,sour,man,with,old,lord,walder's,suspicious,face,he,spoke,but,seldom,and,devoted,most,of,his,attention,to,the,meat,and,mead,that,was,set,before,him,[END]
when,all,the,empty,words,were,said,the,queen,and,the,other,westerlings,excused,themselves,the,remains,of,the,meal,were,cleared,away,and,lothar,frey,cleared,his,throat,[END]

my,lord,father,has,had,a,letter,from,his,grandsons,[END]

no,more,she,thought,[END]

somehow,she,knew,the,next,words,she,heard,would,plunge,yet,another,blade,into,her,heart,[END]
the,grandsons,at,winterfell,[END]
she,made,herself,ask,[END]
my,wards,[END]

i,grieve,to,tell,you,this,but,there,has,been,a,battle,[END]
winterfell,is,burned,[END]
burned,[END]
robb's,voice,was,incredulous,[END]
your,northern,lords,tried,to,retake,it,from,the,ironmen,[END]
when,theon,greyjoy,saw,that,his,prize,was,lost,he,put,the,castle,to,the,torch,[END]
we,have,heard,naught,of,any,battle,said,ser,brynden,[END]
my,nephews,are,young,i,grant,you,but,they,were,there,[END]
big,walder,wrote,the,letter,though,his,cousin,signed,as,well,[END]
it,was,a,bloody,bit,of,business,by,their,account,[END]
your,castellan,was,slain,[END]
ser,rodrik,was,that,his,name,[END]
ser,rodrik,cassel,said,catelyn,numbly,[END]
that,dear,brave,loyal,old,soul,[END]
she,could,almost,see,him,tugging,on,his,fierce,white,whiskers,[END]
what,of,our,other,people,[END]
the,ironmen,put,many,of,them,to,the,sword,i,fear,[END]
wordless,with,rage,robb,slammed,a,fist,down,on,the,table,and,turned,his,face,away,so,the,freys,would,not,see,his,tears,[END]
but,his,mother,saw,them,[END]
the,world,grows,a,little,darker,every,day,[END]
catelyn's,thoughts,went,to,ser,rodrik's,little,daughter,beth,to,tireless,maester,luwin,and,cheerful,septon,chayle,mikken,at,the,forge,farlen,and,palla,in,the,kennels,old,nan,and,simple,hodor,[END]

the,women,and,children,hid,my,nephews,walder,and,walder,among,them,[END]
with,winterfell,in,ruins,the,survivors,were,carried,back,to,the,dreadfort,by,this,son,of,lord,bolton's,[END]
bolton's,son,[END]
robb's,voice,was,strained,[END]
walder,rivers,spoke,up,[END]
a,bastard,son,i,believe,[END]
not,ramsay,snow,[END]
does,lord,roose,have,another,bastard,[END]
robb,scowled,[END]
this,ramsay,was,a,monster,and,a,murderer,and,he,died,a,coward,[END]
or,so,i,was,told,[END]
i,cannot,speak,to,that,[END]
there,is,much,confusion,in,any,war,[END]
many,false,reports,[END]
all,i,can,tell,you,is,that,my,nephews,claim,it,was,this,bastard,son,of,bolton's,who,saved,the,women,of,winterfell,and,the,little,ones,[END]
they,are,safe,at,the,dreadfort,now,all,those,who,remain,[END]
theon,robb,said,suddenly,[END]
what,happened,to,theon,greyjoy,[END]
was,he,slain,[END]
lame,lothar,spread,his,hands,[END]
that,i,cannot,say,your,grace,[END]
walder,and,walder,made,no,mention,of,his,fate,[END]
perhaps,lord,bolton,might,know,if,he,has,had,word,from,this,son,of,his,[END]
ser,brynden,said,we,will,be,certain,to,ask,him,[END]
you,are,all,distraught,i,see,[END]
i,am,sorry,to,have,brought,you,such,fresh,grief,[END]
perhaps,we,should,adjourn,until,the,morrow,[END]
our,business,can,wait,until,you,have,composed,yourselves,[END]
no,said,robb,i,want,the,matter,settled,[END]
her,brother,edmure,nodded,[END]
me,as,well,[END]
do,you,have,an,answer,to,our,offer,my,lord,[END]
i,do,[END]
lothar,smiled,[END]
my,lord,father,bids,me,tell,your,grace,that,he,will,agree,to,this,new,marriage,alliance,between,our,houses,and,renew,his,fealty,to,the,king,in,the,north,upon,the,condition,that,the,king's,grace,apologize,for,the,insult,done,to,house,frey,in,his,royal,person,face,to,face,[END]
an,apology,was,a,small,enough,price,to,pay,but,catelyn,misliked,this,petty,condition,of,lord,walder's,at,once,[END]
i,am,pleased,robb,said,cautiously,[END]
it,was,never,my,wish,to,cause,this,rift,between,us,lothar,[END]
the,freys,have,fought,valiantly,for,my,cause,[END]
i,would,have,them,at,my,side,once,more,[END]
you,are,too,kind,your,grace,[END]
as,you,accept,these,terms,i,am,then,instructed,to,offer,lord,tully,the,hand,of,my,sister,the,lady,roslin,a,maid,of,sixteen,years,[END]
roslin,is,my,lord,father's,youngest,daughter,by,lady,bethany,of,house,rosby,his,sixth,wife,[END]
she,has,a,gentle,nature,and,a,gift,for,music,[END]
edmure,shifted,in,his,seat,[END]
might,not,it,be,better,if,i,first,met,[END]
you'll,meet,when,you're,wed,said,walder,rivers,curtly,[END]
unless,lord,tully,feels,a,need,to,count,her,teeth,first,[END]
edmure,kept,his,temper,[END]
i,will,take,your,word,so,far,as,her,teeth,are,concerned,but,it,would,be,pleasant,if,i,might,gaze,upon,her,face,before,i,espoused,her,[END]
you,must,accept,her,now,my,lord,said,walder,rivers,[END]
else,my,father's,offer,is,withdrawn,[END]
lame,lothar,spread,his,hands,[END]
my,brother,has,a,soldier's,bluntness,but,what,he,says,is,true,[END]
it,is,my,lord,father's,wish,that,this,marriage,take,place,at,once,[END]
at,once,[END]
edmure,sounded,so,unhappy,that,catelyn,had,the,unworthy,thought,that,perhaps,he,had,been,entertaining,notions,of,breaking,the,betrothal,after,the,fighting,was,done,[END]
has,lord,walder,forgotten,that,we,are,fighting,a,war,[END]
brynden,blackfish,asked,sharply,[END]
scarcely,said,lothar,[END]
that,is,why,he,insists,that,the,marriage,take,place,now,ser,[END]
men,die,in,war,even,men,who,are,young,and,strong,[END]
what,would,become,of,our,alliance,should,lord,edmure,fall,before,he,took,roslin,to,bride,[END]
and,there,is,my,father's,age,to,consider,as,well,[END]
he,is,past,ninety,and,not,like,to,see,the,end,of,this,struggle,[END]
it,would,put,his,noble,heart,at,peace,if,he,could,see,his,dear,roslin,safely,wed,before,the,gods,take,him,so,he,might,die,with,the,knowledge,that,the,girl,had,a,strong,husband,to,cherish,and,protect,her,[END]
we,all,want,lord,walder,to,die,happy,[END]
catelyn,was,growing,less,and,less,comfortable,with,this,arrangement,[END]
my,brother,has,just,lost,his,own,father,[END]
he,needs,time,to,mourn,[END]
roslin,is,a,cheerful,girl,said,lothar,[END]
she,may,be,the,very,thing,lord,edmure,needs,to,help,him,through,his,grief,[END]
and,my,grandfather,has,come,to,mislike,lengthy,betrothals,the,bastard,walder,rivers,added,[END]
i,cannot,imagine,why,[END]
robb,gave,him,a,chilly,look,[END]
i,take,your,meaning,rivers,[END]
pray,excuse,us,[END]
as,your,grace,commands,[END]
lame,lothar,rose,and,his,bastard,brother,helped,him,hobble,from,the,room,[END]
edmure,was,seething,[END]
they're,as,much,as,saying,that,my,promise,is,worthless,[END]
why,should,i,let,that,old,weasel,choose,my,bride,[END]
lord,walder,has,other,daughters,besides,this,roslin,[END]
granddaughters,as,well,[END]
i,should,be,offered,the,same,choice,you,were,[END]
i'm,his,liege,lord,he,should,be,overjoyed,that,i'm,willing,to,wed,any,of,them,[END]
he,is,a,proud,man,and,we've,wounded,him,said,catelyn,[END]
the,others,take,his,pride,[END]
i,will,not,be,shamed,in,my,own,hall,[END]
my,answer,is,no,[END]
robb,gave,him,a,weary,look,[END]
i,will,not,command,you,[END]
not,in,this,[END]
but,if,you,refuse,lord,frey,will,take,it,for,another,slight,and,any,hope,of,putting,this,arights,will,be,gone,[END]
you,cannot,know,that,edmure,insisted,[END]
frey,has,wanted,me,for,one,of,his,daughters,since,the,day,i,was,born,[END]
he,will,not,let,a,chance,like,this,slip,between,those,grasping,fingers,of,his,[END]
when,lothar,brings,him,our,answer,he'll,come,wheedling,back,and,accept,a,betrothal,[END]
and,to,a,daughter,of,my,choosing,[END]
perhaps,in,time,said,brynden,blackfish,[END]
but,can,we,wait,while,lothar,rides,back,and,forth,with,offers,and,counters,[END]
robb's,hands,curled,into,fists,[END]
i,must,get,back,to,the,north,[END]
my,brothers,dead,winterfell,burned,my,smallfolk,put,to,the,sword,[END]
the,gods,only,know,what,this,bastard,of,bolton's,is,about,or,whether,theon,is,still,alive,and,on,the,loose,[END]
i,can't,sit,here,waiting,for,a,wedding,that,might,or,might,not,happen,[END]
it,must,happen,said,catelyn,though,not,gladly,[END]
i,have,no,more,wish,to,suffer,walder,frey's,insults,and,complaints,than,you,do,brother,but,i,see,little,choice,here,[END]
without,this,wedding,robb's,cause,is,lost,[END]

the,eighth,lady,frey,is,still,alive,and,well,so,far,as,i,know,she,replied,[END]
thankfully,[END]
otherwise,it,might,well,have,come,to,that,knowing,lord,walder,[END]
the,blackfish,said,i,am,the,last,man,in,the,seven,kingdoms,to,tell,anyone,who,they,must,wed,nephew,[END]
nonetheless,you,did,say,something,of,making,amends,for,your,battle,of,the,fords,[END]

it's,time,for,our,supper,or,near,enough,[END]
last,night,lamprey,had,brought,them,half,a,beef-and-bacon,pie,and,a,flagon,of,mead,as,well,[END]
just,the,thought,of,it,made,his,belly,start,to,rumble,[END]
no,there's,more,than,one,[END]
he's,right,[END]
davos,heard,two,voices,at,least,and,footsteps,growing,louder,[END]
he,got,to,his,feet,and,moved,to,the,bars,[END]

no,i,swear,to,you,i,committed,no,treason,[END]
why,won't,you,listen,[END]
if,his,grace,would,only,let,me,explain,[END]
lamprey,thrust,a,great,iron,key,into,the,lock,turned,it,and,pulled,open,the,cell,[END]
the,rusted,hinges,screamed,in,protest,[END]

davos,asked,[END]
she,will,be,there,ser,axell,said,[END]
she,is,never,far,from,the,king,[END]
but,it,is,his,grace,himself,who,asked,for,you,[END]
davos,lifted,his,hand,to,his,chest,where,once,his,luck,had,hung,in,a,leather,bag,on,a,thong,[END]
gone,now,he,remembered,and,the,ends,of,four,fingers,as,well,[END]
but,his,hands,were,still,long,enough,to,wrap,about,a,woman's,throat,he,thought,especially,a,slender,throat,like,hers,[END]
up,they,went,climbing,the,turnpike,stair,in,single,file,[END]
the,walls,were,rough,dark,stone,cool,to,the,touch,[END]
the,light,of,the,torches,went,before,them,and,their,shadows,marched,beside,them,on,the,walls,[END]
at,the,third,turn,they,passed,an,iron,gate,that,opened,on,blackness,and,another,at,the,fifth,turn,[END]
davos,guessed,that,they,were,near,the,surface,by,then,perhaps,even,above,it,[END]
the,next,door,they,came,to,was,made,of,wood,but,still,they,climbed,[END]
now,the,walls,were,broken,by,arrow,slits,but,no,shafts,of,sunlight,pried,their,way,through,the,thickness,of,the,stone,[END]
it,was,night,outside,[END]
his,legs,were,aching,by,the,time,ser,axell,thrust,open,a,heavy,door,and,gestured,him,through,[END]
beyond,a,high,stone,bridge,arched,over,emptiness,to,the,massive,central,tower,called,the,stone,drum,[END]
a,sea,wind,blew,restlessly,through,the,arches,that,supported,the,roof,and,davos,could,smell,the,salt,water,as,they,crossed,[END]
he,took,a,deep,breath,filling,his,lungs,with,the,clean,cold,air,[END]

a,huge,nightfire,burned,in,the,yard,below,to,keep,the,terrors,of,the,dark,at,bay,and,the,queen's,men,were,gathered,around,it,singing,praises,to,their,new,red,god,[END]

at,the,very,top,of,stone,drum,within,the,great,round,room,called,the,chamber,of,the,painted,table,they,found,stannis,baratheon,standing,behind,the,artifact,that,gave,the,hall,its,name,a,massive,slab,of,wood,carved,and,painted,in,the,shape,of,westeros,as,it,had,been,in,the,time,of,aegon,the,conqueror,[END]
an,iron,brazier,stood,beside,the,king,its,coals,glowing,a,ruddy,orange,[END]
four,tall,pointed,windows,looked,out,to,north,south,east,and,west,[END]
beyond,was,the,night,and,the,starry,sky,[END]
davos,could,hear,the,wind,moving,and,fainter,the,sounds,of,the,sea,[END]
your,grace,ser,axell,said,as,it,please,you,i,have,brought,the,onion,knight,[END]
so,i,see,[END]
stannis,wore,a,grey,wool,tunic,a,dark,red,mantle,and,a,plain,black,leather,belt,from,which,his,sword,and,dagger,hung,[END]
a,red-gold,crown,with,flame-shaped,points,encircled,his,brows,[END]
the,look,of,him,was,a,shock,[END]
he,seemed,ten,years,older,than,the,man,that,davos,had,left,at,storm's,end,when,he,set,sail,for,the,blackwater,and,the,battle,that,would,be,their,undoing,[END]
the,king's,close-cropped,beard,was,spiderwebbed,with,grey,hairs,and,he,had,dropped,two,stone,or,more,of,weight,[END]
he,had,never,been,a,fleshy,man,but,now,the,bones,moved,beneath,his,skin,like,spears,fighting,to,cut,free,[END]
even,his,crown,seemed,too,large,for,his,head,[END]
his,eyes,were,blue,pits,lost,in,deep,hollows,and,the,shape,of,a,skull,could,be,seen,beneath,his,face,[END]
yet,when,he,saw,davos,a,faint,smile,brushed,his,lips,[END]
so,the,sea,has,returned,me,my,knight,of,the,fish,and,onions,[END]
it,did,your,grace,[END]

the,word,hung,in,the,air,[END]
a,frightful,word,thought,davos,[END]

i,ask,you,again,what,is,the,penalty,for,treason,under,the,law,[END]
davos,had,no,choice,but,to,answer,[END]

the,penalty,is,death,your,grace,[END]
it,has,always,been,so,[END]
i,am,not,[END]
i,am,not,a,cruel,man,ser,davos,[END]
you,know,me,[END]

it,is,law,[END]
law,davos,[END]
not,cruelty,[END]
yes,your,grace,[END]
he,does,not,speak,of,me,[END]
davos,felt,a,moment's,pity,for,his,cellmate,down,in,the,dark,[END]
he,knew,he,should,keep,silent,but,he,was,tired,and,sick,of,heart,and,he,heard,himself,say,sire,lord,florent,meant,no,treason,[END]
do,smugglers,have,another,name,for,it,[END]
i,made,him,hand,and,he,would,have,sold,my,rights,for,a,bowl,of,pease,porridge,[END]
he,would,even,have,given,them,shireen,[END]
mine,only,child,he,would,have,wed,to,a,bastard,born,of,incest,[END]
the,king's,voice,was,thick,with,anger,[END]
my,brother,had,a,gift,for,inspiring,loyalty,[END]
even,in,his,foes,[END]
at,summerhall,he,won,three,battles,in,a,single,day,and,brought,lords,grandison,and,cafferen,back,to,storm's,end,as,prisoners,[END]
he,hung,their,banners,in,the,hall,as,trophies,[END]
cafferen's,white,fawns,were,spotted,with,blood,and,grandison's,sleeping,lion,was,torn,near,in,two,[END]
yet,they,would,sit,beneath,those,banners,of,a,night,drinking,and,feasting,with,robert,[END]
he,even,took,them,hunting,[END]
these,men,meant,to,deliver,you,to,aerys,to,be,burned,',i,told,him,after,i,saw,them,throwing,axes,in,the,yard,[END]
you,should,not,be,putting,axes,in,their,hands,',[END]
robert,only,laughed,[END]
i,would,have,thrown,grandison,and,cafferen,into,a,dungeon,but,he,turned,them,into,friends,[END]
lord,cafferen,died,at,ashford,castle,cut,down,by,randyll,tarly,whilst,fighting,for,robert,[END]
lord,grandison,was,wounded,on,the,trident,and,died,of,it,a,year,after,[END]
my,brother,made,them,love,him,but,it,would,seem,that,i,inspire,only,betrayal,[END]
even,in,mine,own,blood,and,kin,[END]
brother,grandfather,cousins,good,uncle,[END]
your,grace,said,ser,axell,i,beg,you,give,me,the,chance,to,prove,to,you,that,not,all,florents,are,so,feeble,[END]
ser,axell,would,have,me,resume,the,war,king,stannis,told,davos,[END]
the,lannisters,think,i,am,done,and,beaten,and,my,sworn,lords,have,forsaken,me,near,every,one,[END]
even,lord,estermont,my,own,mother's,father,has,bent,his,knee,to,joffrey,[END]
the,few,loyal,men,who,remain,to,me,are,losing,heart,[END]
they,waste,their,days,drinking,and,gambling,and,lick,their,wounds,like,beaten,curs,[END]
battle,will,set,their,hearts,ablaze,once,more,your,grace,ser,axell,said,[END]
defeat,is,a,disease,and,victory,is,the,cure,[END]
victory,[END]
the,king's,mouth,twisted,[END]
there,are,victories,and,victories,ser,[END]
but,tell,your,plan,to,ser,davos,[END]
i,would,hear,his,views,on,what,you,propose,[END]
ser,axell,turned,to,davos,with,a,look,on,his,face,much,like,the,look,that,proud,lord,belgrave,must,have,worn,the,day,king,baelor,the,blessed,had,commanded,him,to,wash,the,beggar's,ulcerous,feet,[END]
nonetheless,he,obeyed,[END]
the,plan,ser,axell,had,devised,with,salladhor,saan,was,simple,[END]
a,few,hours',sail,from,dragonstone,lay,claw,isle,ancient,sea-girt,seat,of,house,celtigar,[END]
lord,ardrian,celtigar,had,fought,beneath,the,fiery,heart,on,the,blackwater,but,once,taken,he,had,wasted,no,time,in,going,over,to,joffrey,[END]
he,remained,in,king's,landing,even,now,[END]
too,frightened,of,his,grace's,wrath,to,come,near,dragonstone,no,doubt,ser,axell,declared,[END]
and,wisely,so,[END]
the,man,has,betrayed,his,rightful,king,[END]
ser,axell,proposed,to,use,salladhor,saan's,fleet,and,the,men,who,had,escaped,the,blackwater,stannis,still,had,some,fifteen,hundred,on,dragonstone,more,than,half,of,them,florents,to,exact,retribution,for,lord,celtigar's,defection,[END]
claw,isle,was,but,lightly,garrisoned,its,castle,reputedly,stuffed,with,myrish,carpets,volantene,glass,gold,and,silver,plate,jeweled,cups,magnificent,hawks,an,axe,of,valyrian,steel,a,horn,that,could,summon,monsters,from,the,deep,chests,of,rubies,and,more,wines,than,a,man,could,drink,in,a,hundred,years,[END]
though,celtigar,had,shown,the,world,a,niggardly,face,he,had,never,stinted,on,his,own,comforts,[END]
put,his,castle,to,the,torch,and,his,people,to,the,sword,i,say,ser,axell,concluded,[END]
leave,claw,isle,a,desolation,of,ash,and,bone,fit,only,for,carrion,crows,so,the,realm,might,see,the,fate,of,those,who,bed,with,lannisters,[END]
stannis,listened,to,ser,axell's,recitation,in,silence,grinding,his,jaw,slowly,from,side,to,side,[END]
when,it,was,done,he,said,it,could,be,done,i,believe,[END]
the,risk,is,small,[END]
joffrey,has,no,strength,at,sea,until,lord,redwyne,sets,sail,from,the,arbor,[END]
the,plunder,might,serve,to,keep,that,lysene,pirate,salladhor,saan,loyal,for,a,time,[END]
by,itself,claw,isle,is,worthless,but,its,fall,would,serve,notice,to,lord,tywin,that,my,cause,is,not,yet,done,[END]
the,king,turned,back,to,davos,[END]
speak,truly,ser,[END]
what,do,you,make,of,ser,axell's,proposal,[END]
speak,truly,ser,[END]
davos,remembered,the,dark,cell,he,had,shared,with,lord,alester,remembered,lamprey,and,porridge,[END]
he,thought,of,the,promises,that,ser,axell,had,made,on,the,bridge,above,the,yard,[END]
a,ship,or,a,shove,what,shall,it,be,[END]
but,this,was,stannis,asking,[END]
your,grace,he,said,slowly,i,make,it,folly,[END]
aye,and,cowardice,[END]
cowardice,[END]
ser,axell,all,but,shouted,[END]
no,man,calls,me,craven,before,my,king,[END]
silence,stannis,commanded,[END]
ser,davos,speak,on,i,would,hear,your,reasons,[END]
davos,turned,to,face,ser,axell,[END]
you,say,we,ought,show,the,realm,we,are,not,done,[END]
strike,a,blow,[END]
make,war,aye,[END]
but,on,what,enemy,[END]
you,will,find,no,lannisters,on,claw,isle,[END]
we,will,find,traitors,said,ser,axell,though,it,may,be,i,could,find,some,closer,to,home,[END]
even,in,this,very,room,[END]
davos,ignored,the,jibe,[END]
i,don't,doubt,lord,celtigar,bent,the,knee,to,the,boy,joffrey,[END]
he,is,an,old,done,man,who,wants,no,more,than,to,end,his,days,in,his,castle,drinking,his,fine,wine,out,of,his,jeweled,cups,[END]
he,turned,back,to,stannis,[END]
yet,he,came,when,you,called,sire,[END]
came,with,his,ships,and,swords,[END]
he,stood,by,you,at,storm's,end,when,lord,renly,came,down,on,us,and,his,ships,sailed,up,the,blackwater,[END]
his,men,fought,for,you,killed,for,you,burned,for,you,[END]
claw,isle,is,weakly,held,yes,[END]
held,by,women,and,children,and,old,men,[END]
and,why,is,that,[END]
because,their,husbands,and,sons,and,fathers,died,on,the,blackwater,that's,why,[END]
died,at,their,oars,or,with,swords,in,their,hands,fighting,beneath,our,banners,[END]
yet,ser,axell,proposes,we,swoop,down,on,the,homes,they,left,behind,to,rape,their,windows,and,put,their,children,to,the,sword,[END]
these,smallfolk,are,no,traitors,[END]
they,are,insisted,ser,axell,[END]
not,all,of,celtigar's,men,were,slain,on,the,blackwater,[END]
hundreds,were,taken,with,their,lord,and,bent,the,knee,when,he,did,[END]
when,he,did,davos,repeated,[END]
they,were,his,men,[END]
his,sworn,men,[END]
what,choice,were,they,given,[END]
every,man,has,choices,[END]
they,might,have,refused,to,kneel,[END]
some,did,and,died,for,it,[END]
yet,they,died,true,men,and,loyal,[END]
some,men,are,stronger,than,others,[END]
it,was,a,feeble,answer,and,davos,knew,it,[END]
stannis,baratheon,was,a,man,of,iron,will,who,neither,understood,nor,forgave,weakness,in,others,[END]
i,am,losing,he,thought,despairing,[END]
it,is,every,man's,duty,to,remain,loyal,to,his,rightful,king,even,if,the,lord,he,serves,proves,false,stannis,declared,in,a,tone,that,brooked,no,argument,[END]
a,desperate,folly,took,hold,of,davos,a,recklessness,akin,to,madness,[END]
as,you,remained,loyal,to,king,aerys,when,your,brother,raised,his,banners,[END]
he,blurted,[END]
shocked,silence,followed,until,ser,axell,cried,treason,[END]
and,snatched,his,dagger,from,its,sheath,[END]
your,grace,he,speaks,his,infamy,to,your,face,[END]
davos,could,hear,stannis,grinding,his,teeth,[END]
a,vein,bulged,blue,and,swollen,in,the,king's,brow,[END]
their,eyes,met,[END]
put,up,your,knife,ser,axell,[END]
and,leave,us,[END]
as,it,please,your,grace,[END]
it,would,please,me,for,you,to,leave,said,stannis,[END]
take,yourself,from,my,presence,and,send,me,melisandre,[END]
as,you,command,[END]
ser,axell,slid,the,knife,away,bowed,and,hurried,toward,the,door,[END]
his,boots,rang,against,the,floor,angry,[END]
you,have,always,presumed,on,my,forbearance,stannis,warned,davos,when,they,were,alone,[END]
i,can,shorten,your,tongue,as,easy,as,i,did,your,fingers,smuggler,[END]
i,am,your,man,your,grace,[END]
so,it,is,your,tongue,to,do,with,as,you,please,[END]
it,is,he,said,calmer,[END]
and,i,would,have,it,speak,the,truth,[END]
though,the,truth,is,a,bitter,draught,at,times,[END]
aerys,[END]
if,you,only,knew,[END]
that,was,a,hard,choosing,[END]
my,blood,or,my,liege,[END]
my,brother,or,my,king,[END]

have,you,ever,seen,the,iron,throne,[END]
the,barbs,along,the,back,the,ribbons,of,twisted,steel,the,jagged,ends,of,swords,and,knives,all,tangled,up,and,melted,[END]
it,is,not,a,comfortable,seat,ser,[END]
aerys,cut,himself,so,often,men,took,to,calling,him,king,scab,and,maegor,the,cruel,was,murdered,in,that,chair,[END]
by,that,chair,to,hear,some,tell,it,[END]
it,is,not,a,seat,where,a,man,can,rest,at,ease,[END]
ofttimes,i,wonder,why,my,brothers,wanted,it,so,desperately,[END]
why,would,you,want,it,then,[END]
davos,asked,him,[END]
it,is,not,a,question,of,wanting,[END]
the,throne,is,mine,as,robert's,heir,[END]
that,is,law,[END]
after,me,it,must,pass,to,my,daughter,unless,selyse,should,finally,give,me,a,son,[END]
he,ran,three,fingers,lightly,down,the,table,over,the,layers,of,smooth,hard,varnish,dark,with,age,[END]
i,am,king,[END]
wants,do,not,enter,into,it,[END]
i,have,a,duty,to,my,daughter,[END]
to,the,realm,[END]
even,to,robert,[END]
he,loved,me,but,little,i,know,yet,he,was,my,brother,[END]
the,lannister,woman,gave,him,horns,and,made,a,motley,fool,of,him,[END]
she,may,have,murdered,him,as,well,as,she,murdered,jon,arryn,and,ned,stark,[END]
for,such,crimes,there,must,be,justice,[END]
starting,with,cersei,and,her,abominations,[END]
but,only,starting,[END]
i,mean,to,scour,that,court,clean,[END]
as,robert,should,have,done,after,the,trident,[END]
ser,barristan,once,told,me,that,the,rot,in,king,aerys's,reign,began,with,varys,[END]
the,eunuch,should,never,have,been,pardoned,[END]
no,more,than,the,kingslayer,[END]
at,the,least,robert,should,have,stripped,the,white,cloak,from,jaime,and,sent,him,to,the,wall,as,lord,stark,urged,[END]
he,listened,to,jon,arryn,instead,[END]
i,was,still,at,storm's,end,under,siege,and,unconsulted,[END]
he,turned,abruptly,to,give,davos,a,hard,shrewd,look,[END]
the,truth,now,[END]
why,did,you,wish,to,murder,lady,melisandre,[END]
so,he,does,know,[END]
davos,could,not,lie,to,him,[END]
four,of,my,sons,burned,on,the,blackwater,[END]

you,wrong,her,[END]
those,fires,were,no,work,of,hers,[END]

she,slew,him,as,she,killed,ser,cortnay,penrose,and,your,brother,renly,[END]
now,you,sound,a,fool,the,king,complained,[END]
she,saw,renly's,end,in,the,flames,yes,but,she,had,no,more,part,in,it,than,i,did,[END]
the,priestess,was,with,me,[END]
your,devan,would,tell,you,so,[END]
ask,him,if,you,doubt,me,[END]
she,would,have,spared,renly,if,she,could,[END]
it,was,melisandre,who,urged,me,to,meet,with,him,and,give,him,one,last,chance,to,amend,his,treason,[END]
and,it,was,melisandre,who,told,me,to,send,for,you,when,ser,axell,wished,to,give,you,to,r'hllor,[END]
he,smiled,thinly,[END]
does,that,surprise,you,[END]

he,got,it,from,his,father,with,the,blood,[END]
he,knows,he,is,a,king's,son,but,chooses,to,forget,that,he,is,bastard-born,[END]
and,he,worships,robert,as,renly,did,when,he,was,young,[END]
my,royal,brother,played,the,fond,father,on,his,visits,to,storm's,end,and,there,were,gifts,[END]
swords,and,ponies,and,fur-trimmed,cloaks,[END]
the,eunuch's,work,every,one,[END]
the,boy,would,write,the,red,keep,full,of,thanks,and,robert,would,laugh,and,ask,varys,what,he'd,sent,this,year,[END]

he,left,the,boy's,upbringing,to,castellans,and,maesters,and,every,one,fell,victim,to,his,charm,[END]

i,chose,robert,did,i,not,[END]
when,that,hard,day,came,[END]
i,chose,blood,over,honor,[END]
he,does,not,use,the,boy's,name,[END]
that,made,davos,very,uneasy,[END]
i,hope,young,edric,will,recover,soon,[END]

it,is,a,chill,no,more,[END]

the,leech,was,twisting,in,the,king's,grip,trying,to,attach,itself,to,one,of,his,fingers,[END]
the,usurper,he,said,[END]
joffrey,baratheon,[END]
when,he,tossed,the,leech,into,the,fire,it,curled,up,like,an,autumn,leaf,amidst,the,coals,and,burned,[END]

jaime,[END]
harrenhal's,bathhouse,was,a,dim,steamy,low-ceilinged,room,filled,with,great,stone,tubs,[END]
when,they,led,jaime,in,they,found,brienne,seated,in,one,of,them,scrubbing,her,arm,almost,angrily,[END]
not,so,hard,wench,he,called,[END]
you'll,scrub,the,skin,off,[END]
she,dropped,her,brush,and,covered,her,teats,with,hands,as,big,as,gregor,clegane's,[END]
the,pointy,little,buds,she,was,so,intent,on,hiding,would,have,looked,more,natural,on,some,ten-year-old,than,they,did,on,her,thick,muscular,chest,[END]
what,are,you,doing,here,[END]
she,demanded,[END]
lord,bolton,insists,i,sup,with,him,but,he,neglected,to,invite,my,fleas,[END]
jaime,tugged,at,his,guard,with,his,left,hand,[END]
help,me,out,of,these,stinking,rags,[END]
one-handed,he,could,not,so,much,as,unlace,his,breeches,[END]
the,man,obeyed,grudgingly,but,he,obeyed,[END]
now,leave,us,jaime,said,when,his,clothes,lay,in,a,pile,on,the,wet,stone,floor,[END]
my,lady,of,tarth,doesn't,want,the,likes,of,you,scum,gaping,at,her,teats,[END]
he,pointed,his,stump,at,the,hatchet-faced,woman,attending,brienne,[END]
you,too,[END]
wait,without,[END]
there's,only,the,one,door,and,the,wench,is,too,big,to,try,and,shinny,up,a,chimney,[END]
the,habit,of,obedience,went,deep,[END]
the,woman,followed,his,guard,out,leaving,the,bathhouse,to,the,two,of,them,[END]
the,tubs,were,large,enough,to,hold,six,or,seven,after,the,fashion,of,the,free,cities,so,jaime,climbed,in,with,the,wench,awkward,and,slow,[END]
both,his,eyes,were,open,though,the,right,remained,somewhat,swollen,despite,qyburn's,leeches,[END]
jaime,felt,a,hundred,and,nine,years,old,which,was,a,deal,better,than,he,had,been,feeling,when,he,came,to,harrenhal,[END]
brienne,shrunk,away,from,him,[END]
there,are,other,tubs,[END]
this,one,suits,me,well,enough,[END]
gingerly,he,immersed,himself,up,to,the,chin,in,the,steaming,water,[END]
have,no,fear,wench,[END]
your,thighs,are,purple,and,green,and,i'm,not,interested,in,what,you've,got,between,them,[END]
he,had,to,rest,his,right,arm,on,the,rim,since,qyburn,had,warned,him,to,keep,the,linen,dry,[END]
he,could,feel,the,tension,drain,from,his,legs,but,his,head,spun,[END]
if,i,faint,pull,me,out,[END]
no,lannister,has,ever,drowned,in,his,bath,and,i,don't,mean,to,be,the,first,[END]
why,should,i,care,how,you,die,[END]
you,swore,a,solemn,vow,[END]
he,smiled,as,a,red,flush,crept,up,the,thick,white,column,of,her,neck,[END]
she,turned,her,back,to,him,[END]
still,the,shy,maiden,[END]
what,is,it,that,you,think,i,haven't,seen,[END]
he,groped,for,the,brush,she,had,dropped,caught,it,with,his,fingers,and,began,to,scrub,himself,desultorily,[END]
even,that,was,difficult,awkward,[END]
my,left,hand,is,good,for,nothing,[END]
still,the,water,darkened,as,the,caked,dirt,dissolved,off,his,skin,[END]
the,wench,kept,her,back,to,him,the,muscles,in,her,great,shoulders,hunched,and,hard,[END]
does,the,sight,of,my,stump,distress,you,so,[END]
jaime,asked,[END]
you,ought,to,be,pleased,[END]
i've,lost,the,hand,i,killed,the,king,with,[END]
the,hand,that,flung,the,stark,boy,from,that,tower,[END]
the,hand,i'd,slide,between,my,sister's,thighs,to,make,her,wet,[END]
he,thrust,his,stump,at,her,face,[END]
no,wonder,renly,died,with,you,guarding,him,[END]
she,jerked,to,her,feet,as,if,he'd,struck,her,sending,a,wash,of,hot,water,across,the,tub,[END]
jaime,caught,a,glimpse,of,the,thick,blonde,bush,at,the,juncture,of,her,thighs,as,she,climbed,out,[END]
she,was,much,hairier,than,his,sister,[END]
absurdly,he,felt,his,cock,stir,beneath,the,bathwater,[END]
now,i,know,i,have,been,too,long,away,from,cersei,[END]
he,averted,his,eyes,troubled,by,his,body's,response,[END]
that,was,unworthy,he,mumbled,[END]
i'm,a,maimed,man,and,bitter,[END]
forgive,me,wench,[END]
you,protected,me,as,well,as,any,man,could,have,and,better,than,most,[END]
she,wrapped,her,nakedness,in,a,towel,[END]
do,you,mock,me,[END]
that,pricked,him,back,to,anger,[END]
are,you,as,thick,as,a,castle,wall,[END]
that,was,an,apology,[END]
i,am,tired,of,fighting,with,you,[END]
what,say,we,make,a,truce,[END]
truces,are,built,on,trust,[END]
would,you,have,me,trust,[END]
the,kingslayer,yes,[END]
the,oathbreaker,who,murdered,poor,sad,aerys,targaryen,[END]
jaime,snorted,[END]
it's,not,aerys,i,rue,it's,robert,[END]
i,hear,they've,named,you,kingslayer,',he,said,to,me,at,his,coronation,feast,[END]
just,don't,think,to,make,it,a,habit,',[END]
and,he,laughed,[END]
why,is,it,that,no,one,names,robert,oathbreaker,[END]
he,tore,the,realm,apart,yet,i,am,the,one,with,shit,for,honor,[END]
robert,did,all,he,did,for,love,[END]
water,ran,down,brienne's,legs,and,pooled,beneath,her,feet,[END]
robert,did,all,he,did,for,pride,a,cunt,and,a,pretty,face,[END]
he,made,a,fist,[END]
or,would,have,if,he'd,had,a,hand,[END]
pain,lanced,up,his,arm,cruel,as,laughter,[END]
he,rode,to,save,the,realm,she,insisted,[END]
to,save,the,realm,[END]
did,you,know,that,my,brother,set,the,blackwater,rush,afire,[END]
wildfire,will,burn,on,water,[END]
aerys,would,have,bathed,in,it,if,he'd,dared,[END]
the,targaryens,were,all,mad,for,fire,[END]
jaime,felt,light-headed,[END]
it,is,the,heat,in,here,the,poison,in,my,blood,the,last,of,my,fever,[END]
i,am,not,myself,[END]
he,eased,himself,down,until,the,water,reached,his,chin,[END]
soiled,my,white,cloak,[END]
i,wore,my,gold,armor,that,day,but,[END]
gold,armor,[END]
her,voice,sounded,far,off,faint,[END]
he,floated,in,heat,in,memory,[END]
after,dancing,griffins,lost,the,battle,of,the,bells,aerys,exiled,him,[END]
why,am,i,telling,this,absurd,ugly,child,[END]
he,had,finally,realized,that,robert,was,no,mere,outlaw,lord,to,be,crushed,at,whim,but,the,greatest,threat,house,targaryen,had,faced,since,daemon,blackfyre,[END]
the,king,reminded,lewyn,martell,gracelessly,that,he,held,elia,and,sent,him,to,take,command,of,the,ten,thousand,dornishmen,coming,up,the,kingsroad,[END]
jon,darry,and,barristan,selmy,rode,to,stoney,sept,to,rally,what,they,could,of,griffins',men,and,prince,rhaegar,returned,from,the,south,and,persuaded,his,father,to,swallow,his,pride,and,summon,my,father,[END]
but,no,raven,returned,from,casterly,rock,and,that,made,the,king,even,more,afraid,[END]
he,saw,traitors,everywhere,and,varys,was,always,there,to,point,out,any,he,might,have,missed,[END]
so,his,grace,commanded,his,alchemists,to,place,caches,of,wildfire,all,over,king's,landing,[END]
beneath,baelor's,sept,and,the,hovels,of,flea,bottom,under,stables,and,storehouses,at,all,seven,gates,even,in,the,cellars,of,the,red,keep,itself,[END]
everything,was,done,in,the,utmost,secrecy,by,a,handful,of,master,pyromancers,[END]
they,did,not,even,trust,their,own,acolytes,to,help,[END]
the,queen's,eyes,had,been,closed,for,years,and,rhaegar,was,busy,marshaling,an,army,[END]
but,aerys's,new,mace-and-dagger,hand,was,not,utterly,stupid,and,with,rossart,belis,and,garigus,coming,and,going,night,and,day,he,became,suspicious,[END]
chelsted,that,was,his,name,lord,chelsted,[END]
it,had,come,back,to,him,suddenly,with,the,telling,[END]
i'd,thought,the,man,craven,but,the,day,he,confronted,aerys,he,found,some,courage,somewhere,[END]
he,did,all,he,could,to,dissuade,him,[END]
he,reasoned,he,jested,he,threatened,and,finally,he,begged,[END]
when,that,failed,he,took,off,his,chain,of,office,and,flung,it,down,on,the,floor,[END]
aerys,burnt,him,alive,for,that,and,hung,his,chain,about,the,neck,of,rossart,his,favorite,pyromancer,[END]
the,man,who,had,cooked,lord,rickard,stark,in,his,own,armor,[END]
and,all,the,time,i,stood,by,the,foot,of,the,iron,throne,in,my,white,plate,still,as,a,corpse,guarding,my,liege,and,all,his,sweet,secrets,[END]
my,sworn,brothers,were,all,away,you,see,but,aerys,liked,to,keep,me,close,[END]
i,was,my,father's,son,so,he,did,not,trust,me,[END]
he,wanted,me,where,varys,could,watch,me,day,and,night,[END]
so,i,heard,it,all,[END]
he,remembered,how,rossart's,eyes,would,shine,when,he,unrolled,his,maps,to,show,where,the,substance,must,be,placed,[END]
garigus,and,belis,were,the,same,[END]
rhaegar,met,robert,on,the,trident,and,you,know,what,happened,there,[END]
when,the,word,reached,court,aerys,packed,the,queen,off,to,dragonstone,with,prince,viserys,[END]
princess,elia,would,have,gone,as,well,but,he,forbade,it,[END]
somehow,he,had,gotten,it,in,his,head,that,prince,lewyn,must,have,betrayed,rhaegar,on,the,trident,but,he,thought,he,could,keep,dorne,loyal,so,long,as,he,kept,elia,and,aegon,by,his,side,[END]
the,traitors,want,my,city,i,heard,him,tell,rossart,but,i'll,give,them,naught,but,ashes,[END]
let,robert,be,king,over,charred,bones,and,cooked,meat,[END]
the,targaryens,never,bury,their,dead,they,burn,them,[END]
aerys,meant,to,have,the,greatest,funeral,pyre,of,them,all,[END]
though,if,truth,be,told,i,do,not,believe,he,truly,expected,to,die,[END]
like,aerion,brightfire,before,him,aerys,thought,the,fire,would,transform,him,[END]
that,he,would,rise,again,reborn,as,a,dragon,and,turn,all,his,enemies,to,ash,[END]
ned,stark,was,racing,south,with,robert's,van,but,my,father's,forces,reached,the,city,first,[END]
pycelle,convinced,the,king,that,his,warden,of,the,west,had,come,to,defend,him,so,he,opened,the,gates,[END]
the,one,time,he,should,have,heeded,varys,and,he,ignored,him,[END]
my,father,had,held,back,from,the,war,brooding,on,all,the,wrongs,aerys,had,done,him,and,determined,that,house,lannister,should,be,on,the,winning,side,[END]
the,trident,decided,him,[END]
it,fell,to,me,to,hold,the,red,keep,but,i,knew,we,were,lost,[END]
i,sent,to,aerys,asking,his,leave,to,make,terms,[END]
my,man,came,back,with,a,royal,command,[END]
bring,me,your,father's,head,if,you,are,no,traitor,',[END]
aerys,would,have,no,yielding,[END]
lord,rossart,was,with,him,my,messenger,said,[END]
i,knew,what,that,meant,[END]
when,i,came,on,rossart,he,was,dressed,as,a,common,man-at-arms,hurrying,to,a,postern,gate,[END]
i,slew,him,first,[END]
then,i,slew,aerys,before,he,could,find,someone,else,to,carry,his,message,to,the,pyromancers,[END]

there,are,no,tarbecks,or,reynes,said,jaime,[END]
my,point,precisely,[END]
lord,vargo,doubtless,hoped,that,lord,stannis,would,triumph,at,king's,landing,and,thence,confirm,him,in,his,possession,of,this,castle,in,gratitude,for,his,small,part,in,the,downfall,of,house,lannister,[END]

a,pity,the,wolf,is,so,young,[END]
boys,of,sixteen,always,believe,they,are,immortal,and,invincible,[END]
an,older,man,would,bend,the,knee,i'd,think,[END]

for,the,robb,starks,at,least,[END]
not,for,the,likes,of,vargo,hoat,[END]

you'll,forgive,me,if,i,don't,mourn,[END]
you,have,no,pity,for,our,wretched,doomed,goat,[END]
ah,but,the,gods,must,[END]
else,why,deliver,you,into,his,hands,[END]
bolton,chewed,another,chunk,of,meat,[END]
karhold,is,smaller,and,meaner,than,harrenhal,but,it,lies,well,beyond,the,reach,of,the,lion's,claws,[END]
once,wed,to,alys,karstark,hoat,might,be,a,lord,in,truth,[END]

his,price,would,be,the,maid,and,safe,refuge,[END]
but,to,sell,you,he,must,keep,you,and,the,riverlands,are,full,of,those,who,would,gladly,steal,you,away,[END]
glover,and,tallhart,were,broken,at,duskendale,but,remnants,of,their,host,are,still,abroad,with,the,mountain,slaughtering,the,stragglers,[END]
a,thousand,karstarks,prowl,the,lands,south,and,east,of,riverrun,hunting,you,[END]

the,lord,of,the,dreadfort,sopped,up,some,of,the,blood,with,a,chunk,of,bread,[END]
harrenhal,was,the,only,place,lord,vargo,could,hope,to,hold,you,safe,but,here,his,brave,companions,are,much,outnumbered,by,my,own,men,and,by,ser,aenys,and,his,freys,[END]
no,doubt,he,feared,i,might,return,you,to,ser,edmure,at,riverrun,[END]

for,he,is,my,man,as,i,am,king,robb's,man,[END]

we,were,in,oldtown,at,your,birth,and,all,the,city,talked,of,was,the,monster,that,had,been,born,to,the,king's,hand,and,what,such,an,omen,might,foretell,for,the,realm,[END]
famine,plague,and,war,no,doubt,[END]
tyrion,gave,a,sour,smile,[END]
it's,always,famine,plague,and,war,[END]
oh,and,winter,and,the,long,night,that,never,ends,[END]
all,that,said,prince,oberyn,and,your,father's,fall,as,well,[END]
lord,tywin,had,made,himself,greater,than,king,aerys,i,heard,one,begging,brother,preach,but,only,a,god,is,meant,to,stand,above,a,king,[END]
you,were,his,curse,a,punishment,sent,by,the,gods,to,teach,him,that,he,was,no,better,than,any,other,man,[END]
i,try,but,he,refuses,to,learn,[END]
tyrion,gave,a,sigh,[END]
but,do,go,on,i,pray,you,[END]
i,love,a,good,tale,[END]
and,well,you,might,since,you,were,said,to,have,one,a,stiff,curly,tail,like,a,swine's,[END]
your,head,was,monstrous,huge,we,heard,half,again,the,size,of,your,body,and,you,had,been,born,with,thick,black,hair,and,a,beard,besides,an,evil,eye,and,lion's,claws,[END]
your,teeth,were,so,long,you,could,not,close,your,mouth,and,between,your,legs,were,a,girl's,privates,as,well,as,a,boy's,[END]
life,would,be,much,simpler,if,men,could,fuck,themselves,don't,you,agree,[END]

even,so,i,begin,to,see,the,nature,of,your,complaint,[END]
bronn,gave,out,with,a,chuckle,but,oberyn,only,smiled,[END]
we,might,never,have,seen,you,at,all,but,for,your,sweet,sister,[END]
you,were,never,seen,at,table,or,hall,though,sometimes,at,night,we,could,hear,a,baby,howling,down,in,the,depths,of,the,rock,[END]
you,did,have,a,monstrous,great,voice,i,must,grant,you,that,[END]
you,would,wail,for,hours,and,nothing,would,quiet,you,but,a,woman's,teat,[END]
still,true,as,it,happens,[END]
this,time,prince,oberyn,did,laugh,[END]
a,taste,we,share,[END]
lord,gargalen,once,told,me,he,hoped,to,die,with,a,sword,in,his,hand,to,which,i,replied,that,i,would,sooner,go,with,a,breast,in,mine,[END]

the,day,before,we,were,to,sail,whilst,my,mother,and,your,father,were,closeted,together,she,and,jaime,took,us,down,to,your,nursery,[END]
your,wet,nurse,tried,to,send,us,off,but,your,sister,was,having,none,of,that,[END]
he's,mine,',she,said,and,you're,just,a,milk,cow,you,can't,tell,me,what,to,do,[END]
be,quiet,or,i'll,have,my,father,cut,your,tongue,out,[END]
a,cow,doesn't,need,a,tongue,only,udders,',[END]
her,grace,learned,charm,at,an,early,age,said,tyrion,amused,by,the,notion,of,his,sister,claiming,him,as,hers,[END]
she's,never,been,in,any,rush,to,claim,me,since,the,gods,know,[END]
cersei,even,undid,your,swaddling,clothes,to,give,us,a,better,look,the,dornish,prince,continued,[END]
you,did,have,one,evil,eye,and,some,black,fuzz,on,your,scalp,[END]
perhaps,your,head,was,larger,than,most,[END]
but,there,was,no,tail,no,beard,neither,teeth,nor,claws,and,nothing,between,your,legs,but,a,tiny,pink,cock,[END]
after,all,the,wonderful,whispers,lord,tywin's,doom,turned,out,to,be,just,a,hideous,red,infant,with,stunted,legs,[END]
elia,even,made,the,noise,that,young,girls,make,at,the,sight,of,infants,i'm,sure,you've,heard,it,[END]
the,same,noise,they,make,over,cute,kittens,and,playful,puppies,[END]
i,believe,she,wanted,to,nurse,you,herself,ugly,as,you,were,[END]
when,i,commented,that,you,seemed,a,poor,sort,of,monster,your,sister,said,he,killed,my,mother,',and,twisted,your,little,cock,so,hard,i,thought,she,was,like,to,pull,it,off,[END]
you,shrieked,but,it,was,only,when,your,brother,jaime,said,leave,him,be,you're,hurting,him,',that,cersei,let,go,of,you,[END]
it,doesn't,matter,',she,told,us,[END]
everyone,says,he's,like,to,die,soon,[END]
he,shouldn't,even,have,lived,this,long,',[END]
the,sun,was,shining,bright,above,them,and,the,day,was,pleasantly,warm,for,autumn,but,tyrion,lannister,went,cold,all,over,when,he,heard,that,[END]
my,sweet,sister,[END]
he,scratched,at,the,scar,of,his,nose,and,gave,the,dornishman,a,taste,of,his,evil,eye,[END]
now,why,would,he,tell,such,a,tale,[END]
is,he,testing,me,or,simply,twisting,my,cock,as,cersei,did,so,he,can,hear,me,scream,[END]
be,sure,and,tell,that,story,to,my,father,[END]
it,will,delight,him,as,much,as,it,did,me,[END]
the,part,about,my,tail,especially,[END]
i,did,have,one,but,he,had,it,lopped,off,[END]
prince,oberyn,had,a,chuckle,[END]
you've,grown,more,amusing,since,last,we,met,[END]
yes,but,i,meant,to,grow,taller,[END]
while,we,are,speaking,of,amusement,i,heard,a,curious,tale,from,lord,buckler's,steward,[END]
he,claimed,that,you,had,put,a,tax,on,women's,privy,purses,[END]
it,is,a,tax,on,whoring,said,tyrion,irritated,all,over,again,[END]
and,it,was,my,bloody,father's,notion,[END]
only,a,penny,for,each,ah,[END]
act,[END]
the,king's,hand,felt,it,might,help,improve,the,morals,of,the,city,[END]
and,pay,for,joffrey's,wedding,besides,[END]
needless,to,say,as,master,of,coin,tyrion,had,gotten,all,the,blame,for,it,[END]

i,have,hungered,for,a,long,time,[END]

we,shall,of,course,just,as,soon,as,we,may,[END]
any,help,that,dorne,might,be,able,to,provide,to,restore,the,king's,peace,would,only,hasten,the,beginning,of,my,lord,father's,inquiry,[END]

my,brother,is,not,a,bloodthirsty,man,but,neither,has,he,been,asleep,for,sixteen,years,[END]
jon,arryn,came,to,sunspear,the,year,after,robert,took,the,throne,and,you,can,be,sure,that,he,was,questioned,closely,[END]
him,and,a,hundred,more,[END]
i,did,not,come,for,some,mummer's,show,of,an,inquiry,[END]
i,came,for,justice,for,elia,and,her,children,and,i,will,have,it,[END]
starting,with,this,lummox,gregor,clegane,[END]

before,he,dies,the,enormity,that,rides,will,tell,me,whence,came,his,orders,please,assure,your,lord,father,of,that,[END]
he,smiled,[END]
an,old,septon,once,claimed,i,was,living,proof,of,the,goodness,of,the,gods,[END]
do,you,know,why,that,is,imp,[END]
no,tyrion,admitted,warily,[END]
why,if,the,gods,were,cruel,they,would,have,made,me,my,mother's,firstborn,and,doran,her,third,[END]
i,am,a,bloodthirsty,man,you,see,[END]
and,it,is,me,you,must,contend,with,now,not,my,patient,prudent,and,gouty,brother,[END]
tyrion,could,see,the,sun,shining,on,the,blackwater,rush,half,a,mile,ahead,and,on,the,walls,and,towers,and,hills,of,king's,landing,beyond,[END]
he,glanced,over,his,shoulder,at,the,glittering,column,following,them,up,the,kingsroad,[END]
you,speak,like,a,man,with,a,great,host,at,his,back,he,said,yet,all,i,see,are,three,hundred,[END]
do,you,spy,that,city,there,north,of,the,river,[END]
the,midden,heap,you,call,king's,landing,[END]
that's,the,very,one,[END]
not,only,do,i,see,it,i,believe,i,smell,it,now,[END]
then,take,a,good,sniff,my,lord,[END]
fill,up,your,nose,[END]
half,a,million,people,stink,more,than,three,hundred,you'll,find,[END]
do,you,smell,the,gold,cloaks,[END]
there,are,near,five,thousand,of,them,[END]
my,father's,own,sworn,swords,must,account,for,another,twenty,thousand,[END]
and,then,there,are,the,roses,[END]
roses,smell,so,sweet,don't,they,[END]
especially,when,there,are,so,many,of,them,[END]
fifty,sixty,seventy,thousand,roses,in,the,city,or,camped,outside,it,i,can't,really,say,how,many,are,left,but,there's,more,than,i,care,to,count,anyway,[END]
martell,gave,a,shrug,[END]
in,dorne,of,old,before,we,married,daeron,it,was,said,that,all,flowers,bow,before,the,sun,[END]

as,you,trampled,willas,tyrell,[END]
the,dornishman,did,not,react,as,expected,[END]
i,had,a,letter,from,willas,not,half,a,year,past,[END]
we,share,an,interest,in,fine,horseflesh,[END]
he,has,never,borne,me,any,ill,will,for,what,happened,in,the,lists,[END]
i,struck,his,breastplate,clean,but,his,foot,caught,in,a,stirrup,as,he,fell,and,his,horse,came,down,on,top,of,him,[END]
i,sent,a,maester,to,him,afterward,but,it,was,all,he,could,do,to,save,the,boy's,leg,[END]
the,knee,was,far,past,mending,[END]
if,any,were,to,blame,it,was,his,fool,of,a,father,[END]
willas,tyrell,was,green,as,his,surcoat,and,had,no,business,riding,in,such,company,[END]
the,fat,flower,thrust,him,into,tourneys,at,too,tender,an,age,just,as,he,did,with,the,other,two,[END]
he,wanted,another,leo,longthorn,and,made,himself,a,cripple,[END]
there,are,those,who,say,ser,loras,is,better,than,leo,longthorn,ever,was,said,tyrion,[END]
renly's,little,rose,[END]
i,doubt,that,[END]
doubt,it,all,you,wish,said,tyrion,but,ser,loras,has,defeated,many,good,knights,including,my,brother,jaime,[END]

and,men,say,he,performed,prodigious,feats,of,valor,on,the,blackwater,fighting,beside,lord,renly's,ghost,[END]
so,these,same,men,who,saw,the,prodigious,feats,saw,the,ghost,as,well,yes,[END]
the,dornishman,laughed,lightly,[END]
tyrion,gave,him,a,long,look,[END]

i,would,advise,you,to,keep,one,or,the,other,by,your,side,at,all,times,my,lord,[END]
at,all,times,[END]
prince,oberyn,lifted,a,thin,black,eyebrow,[END]
and,why,is,that,my,good,imp,[END]
you,want,to,die,with,a,breast,in,hand,you,said,[END]
tyrion,cantered,on,ahead,to,where,the,ferry,barges,waited,on,the,south,bank,of,the,blackwater,[END]
he,had,suffered,all,he,meant,to,suffer,of,what,passed,for,dornish,wit,[END]
father,should,have,sent,joffrey,after,all,[END]
he,could,have,asked,prince,oberyn,if,he,knew,how,a,dornishman,differed,from,a,cowflop,[END]
that,made,him,grin,despite,himself,[END]
he,would,have,to,make,a,point,of,being,on,hand,when,the,red,viper,was,presented,to,the,king,[END]
arya,[END]
the,man,on,the,roof,was,the,first,to,die,[END]
he,was,crouched,down,by,the,chimney,two,hundred,yards,away,no,more,than,a,vague,shadow,in,the,predawn,gloom,but,as,the,sky,began,to,lighten,he,stirred,stretched,and,stood,[END]
anguy's,arrow,took,him,in,the,chest,[END]
he,tumbled,bonelessly,down,the,steep,slate,pitch,and,fell,in,front,of,the,septry,door,[END]
the,mummers,had,posted,two,guards,there,but,their,torch,left,them,night,blind,and,the,outlaws,had,crept,in,close,[END]
kyle,and,notch,let,fly,together,[END]
one,man,went,down,with,an,arrow,through,his,throat,the,other,through,his,belly,[END]
the,second,man,dropped,the,torch,and,the,flames,licked,up,at,him,[END]
he,screamed,as,his,clothes,took,fire,and,that,was,the,end,of,stealth,[END]
thoros,gave,a,shout,and,the,outlaws,attacked,in,earnest,[END]
arya,watched,from,atop,her,horse,on,the,crest,of,the,wooded,ridge,that,overlooked,the,septry,mill,brewhouse,and,stables,and,the,desolation,of,weeds,burnt,trees,and,mud,that,surrounded,them,[END]
the,trees,were,mostly,bare,now,and,the,few,withered,brown,leaves,that,still,clung,to,the,branches,did,little,to,obstruct,her,view,[END]
lord,beric,had,left,beardless,dick,and,mudge,to,guard,them,[END]
arya,hated,being,left,behind,like,she,was,some,stupid,child,but,at,least,gendry,had,been,kept,back,as,well,[END]
she,knew,better,than,to,try,and,argue,[END]
this,was,battle,and,in,battle,you,had,to,obey,[END]
the,eastern,horizon,glowed,gold,and,pink,and,overhead,a,half,moon,peeked,out,through,low,scuttling,clouds,[END]
the,wind,blew,cold,and,arya,could,hear,the,rush,of,water,and,the,creak,of,the,mill's,great,wooden,waterwheel,[END]
there,was,a,smell,of,rain,in,the,dawn,air,but,no,drops,were,falling,yet,[END]
flaming,arrows,flew,through,the,morning,mists,trailing,pale,ribbons,of,fire,and,thudded,into,the,wooden,walls,of,the,septry,[END]
a,few,smashed,through,shuttered,windows,and,soon,enough,thin,tendrils,of,smoke,were,rising,between,the,broken,shutters,[END]
two,mummers,came,bursting,from,the,septry,side,by,side,axes,in,their,hands,[END]
anguy,and,the,other,archers,were,waiting,[END]
one,axeman,died,at,once,[END]
the,other,managed,to,duck,so,the,shaft,ripped,through,his,shoulder,[END]
he,staggered,on,till,two,more,arrows,found,him,so,quickly,it,was,hard,to,say,which,had,struck,first,[END]
the,long,shafts,punched,through,his,breastplate,as,if,it,had,been,made,of,silk,instead,of,steel,[END]
he,fell,heavily,[END]
anguy,had,arrows,tipped,with,bodkins,as,well,as,broadheads,[END]
a,bodkin,could,pierce,even,heavy,plate,[END]
i'm,going,to,learn,to,shoot,a,bow,arya,thought,[END]
she,loved,swordfighting,but,she,could,see,how,arrows,were,good,too,[END]
flames,were,creeping,up,the,west,wall,of,the,septry,and,thick,smoke,poured,through,a,broken,window,[END]
a,myrish,crossbowman,poked,his,head,out,a,different,window,got,off,a,bolt,and,ducked,down,to,rewind,[END]
she,could,hear,fighting,from,the,stables,as,well,shouts,well,mingled,with,the,screams,of,horses,and,the,clang,of,steel,[END]
kill,them,all,she,thought,fiercely,[END]
she,bit,her,lip,so,hard,she,tasted,blood,[END]
kill,every,single,one,[END]
the,crossbowman,appeared,again,but,no,sooner,had,he,loosed,than,three,arrows,hissed,past,his,head,[END]
one,rattled,off,his,helm,[END]
he,vanished,bow,and,all,[END]
arya,could,see,flames,in,several,of,the,second-story,windows,[END]
between,the,smoke,and,the,morning,mists,the,air,was,a,haze,of,blowing,black,and,white,[END]
anguy,and,the,other,bowmen,were,creeping,closer,the,better,to,find,targets,[END]
then,the,septry,erupted,the,mummers,boiling,out,like,angry,ants,[END]
two,ibbenese,rushed,through,the,door,with,shaggy,brown,shields,held,high,before,them,and,behind,them,came,a,dothraki,with,a,great,curved,arakh,and,bells,in,his,braid,and,behind,him,three,volantene,sellswords,covered,with,fierce,tattoos,[END]
others,were,climbing,out,windows,and,leaping,to,the,ground,[END]
arya,saw,a,man,take,an,arrow,through,the,chest,with,one,leg,across,a,windowsill,and,heard,his,scream,as,he,fell,[END]
the,smoke,was,thickening,[END]
quarrels,and,arrows,sped,back,and,forth,[END]
watty,fell,with,a,grunt,his,bow,slipping,from,his,hand,[END]
kyle,was,trying,to,nock,another,shaft,to,his,string,when,a,man,in,black,mail,flung,a,spear,through,his,belly,[END]
she,heard,lord,beric,shout,[END]
from,out,of,the,ditches,and,trees,the,rest,of,his,band,came,pouring,steel,in,hand,[END]
arya,saw,lem's,bright,yellow,cloak,flapping,behind,him,as,he,rode,down,the,man,who'd,killed,kyle,[END]
thoros,and,lord,beric,were,everywhere,their,swords,swirling,fire,[END]
the,red,priest,hacked,at,a,hide,shield,until,it,flew,to,pieces,while,his,horse,kicked,the,man,in,the,face,[END]
a,dothraki,screamed,and,charged,the,lightning,lord,and,the,flaming,sword,leapt,out,to,meet,his,arakh,[END]
the,blades,kissed,and,spun,and,kissed,again,[END]
then,the,dothraki's,hair,was,ablaze,and,a,moment,later,he,was,dead,[END]
she,spied,ned,too,fighting,at,the,lightning,lord's,side,[END]
it's,not,fair,he's,only,a,little,older,than,me,they,should,have,let,me,fight,[END]
the,battle,did,not,last,very,long,[END]
the,brave,companions,still,on,their,feet,soon,died,or,threw,down,their,swords,[END]
two,of,the,dothraki,managed,to,regain,their,horses,and,flee,but,only,because,lord,beric,let,them,go,[END]
let,them,carry,the,word,back,to,harrenhal,he,said,with,flaming,sword,in,hand,[END]
it,will,give,the,leech,lord,and,his,goat,a,few,more,sleepless,nights,[END]
jack-be-lucky,harwin,and,merrit,o',moontown,braved,the,burning,septry,to,search,for,captives,[END]
they,emerged,from,the,smoke,and,flames,a,few,moments,later,with,eight,brown,brothers,one,so,weak,that,merrit,had,to,carry,him,across,a,shoulder,[END]
there,was,a,septon,with,them,as,well,round-shouldered,and,balding,but,he,wore,black,chainmail,over,his,grey,robes,[END]
found,him,hiding,under,the,cellar,steps,said,jack,coughing,[END]

bran,[END]
the,tower,stood,upon,an,island,its,twin,reflected,on,the,still,blue,waters,[END]
when,the,wind,blew,ripples,moved,across,the,surface,of,the,lake,chasing,one,another,like,boys,at,play,[END]
oak,trees,grew,thick,along,the,lakeshore,a,dense,stand,of,them,with,a,litter,of,fallen,acorns,on,the,ground,beneath,[END]
beyond,them,was,the,village,or,what,remained,of,it,[END]
it,was,the,first,village,they,had,seen,since,leaving,the,foothills,[END]
meera,had,scouted,ahead,to,make,certain,there,was,no,one,lurking,amongst,the,ruins,[END]
sliding,in,and,amongst,oaks,and,apple,trees,with,her,net,and,spear,in,hand,she,startled,three,red,deer,and,sent,them,bounding,away,through,the,brush,[END]
summer,saw,the,flash,of,motion,and,was,after,them,at,once,[END]
bran,watched,the,direwolf,lope,off,and,for,a,moment,wanted,nothing,so,much,as,to,slip,his,skin,and,run,with,him,but,meera,was,waving,for,them,to,come,ahead,[END]
reluctantly,he,turned,away,from,summer,and,urged,hodor,on,into,the,village,[END]
jojen,walked,with,them,[END]
the,ground,from,here,to,the,wall,was,grasslands,bran,knew,fallow,fields,and,low,rolling,hills,high,meadows,and,lowland,bogs,[END]
it,would,be,much,easier,going,than,the,mountains,behind,but,so,much,open,space,made,meera,uneasy,[END]
i,feel,naked,she,confessed,[END]
there's,no,place,to,hide,[END]
who,holds,this,land,[END]
jojen,asked,bran,[END]
the,night's,watch,he,answered,[END]
this,is,the,gift,[END]
the,new,gift,and,north,of,that,brandon's,gift,[END]
maester,luwin,had,taught,him,the,history,[END]
brandon,the,builder,gave,all,the,land,south,of,the,wall,to,the,black,brothers,to,a,distance,of,twenty-five,leagues,[END]
for,their,[END]
for,their,sustenance,and,support,[END]
he,was,proud,that,he,still,remembered,that,part,[END]
some,maesters,say,it,was,some,other,brandon,not,the,builder,but,it's,still,brandon's,gift,[END]
thousands,of,years,later,good,queen,alysanne,visited,the,wall,on,her,dragon,silverwing,and,she,thought,the,night's,watch,was,so,brave,that,she,had,the,old,king,double,the,size,of,their,lands,to,fifty,leagues,[END]
so,that,was,the,new,gift,[END]
he,waved,a,hand,[END]
here,[END]
all,this,[END]
no,one,had,lived,in,the,village,for,long,years,bran,could,see,[END]
all,the,houses,were,falling,down,[END]
even,the,inn,[END]
it,had,never,been,much,of,an,inn,to,look,at,it,but,now,all,that,remained,was,a,stone,chimney,and,two,cracked,walls,set,amongst,a,dozen,apple,trees,[END]
one,was,growing,up,through,the,common,room,where,a,layer,of,wet,brown,leaves,and,rotting,apples,carpeted,the,floor,[END]
the,air,was,thick,with,the,smell,of,them,a,cloying,cidery,scent,that,was,almost,overwhelming,[END]
meera,stabbed,a,few,apples,with,her,frog,spear,trying,to,find,some,still,good,enough,to,eat,but,they,were,all,too,brown,and,wormy,[END]
it,was,a,peaceful,spot,still,and,tranquil,and,lovely,to,behold,but,bran,thought,there,was,something,sad,about,an,empty,inn,and,hodor,seemed,to,feel,it,too,[END]
hodor,[END]
he,said,in,a,confused,sort,of,way,[END]
hodor,[END]
hodor,[END]
this,is,good,land,[END]
jojen,picked,up,a,handful,of,dirt,rubbing,it,between,his,fingers,[END]
a,village,an,inn,a,stout,holdfast,in,the,lake,all,these,apple,trees,[END]
but,where,are,the,people,bran,[END]
why,would,they,leave,such,a,place,[END]
they,were,afraid,of,the,wildlings,said,bran,[END]
wildlings,come,over,the,wall,or,through,the,mountains,to,raid,and,steal,and,carry,off,women,[END]
if,they,catch,you,they,make,your,skull,into,a,cup,to,drink,blood,old,nan,used,to,say,[END]
the,night's,watch,isn't,so,strong,as,it,was,in,brandon's,day,or,queen,alysanne's,so,more,get,through,[END]
the,places,nearest,the,wall,got,raided,so,much,the,smallfolk,moved,south,into,the,mountains,or,onto,the,umber,lands,east,of,the,kingsroad,[END]
the,greatjon's,people,get,raided,too,but,not,so,much,as,the,people,who,used,to,live,in,the,gift,[END]
jojen,reed,turned,his,head,slowly,listening,to,music,only,he,could,hear,[END]
we,need,to,shelter,here,[END]
there's,a,storm,coming,[END]
a,bad,one,[END]
bran,looked,up,at,the,sky,[END]
it,had,been,a,beautiful,crisp,clear,autumn,day,sunny,and,almost,warm,but,there,were,dark,clouds,off,to,the,west,now,that,was,true,and,the,wind,seemed,to,be,picking,up,[END]
there's,no,roof,on,the,inn,and,only,the,two,walls,he,pointed,out,[END]
we,should,go,out,to,the,holdfast,[END]
hodor,said,hodor,[END]
maybe,he,agreed,[END]
we,have,no,boat,bran,[END]
meera,poked,through,the,leaves,idly,with,her,frog,spear,[END]
there's,a,causeway,[END]
a,stone,causeway,hidden,under,the,water,[END]
we,could,walk,out,[END]
they,could,anyway,he,would,have,to,ride,on,hodor's,back,but,at,least,he'd,stay,dry,that,way,[END]
the,reeds,exchanged,a,look,[END]
how,do,you,know,that,[END]
asked,jojen,[END]
have,you,been,here,before,my,prince,[END]
no,[END]
old,nan,told,me,[END]
the,holdfast,has,a,golden,crown,see,[END]
he,pointed,across,the,lake,[END]
you,could,see,patches,of,flaking,gold,paint,up,around,the,crenellations,[END]
queen,alysanne,slept,there,so,they,painted,the,merlons,gold,in,her,honor,[END]
a,causeway,[END]
jojen,studied,the,lake,[END]
you,are,certain,[END]
certain,said,bran,[END]
meera,found,the,foot,of,it,easily,enough,once,she,knew,to,look,a,stone,pathway,three,feet,wide,leading,right,out,into,the,lake,[END]
she,took,them,out,step,by,careful,step,probing,ahead,with,her,frog,spear,[END]
they,could,see,where,the,path,emerged,again,climbing,from,the,water,onto,the,island,and,turning,into,a,short,flight,of,stone,steps,that,led,to,the,holdfast,door,[END]
path,steps,and,door,were,in,a,straight,line,which,made,you,think,the,causeway,ran,straight,but,that,wasn't,so,[END]
under,the,lake,it,zigged,and,zagged,going,a,third,of,a,way,around,the,island,before,jagging,back,[END]
the,turns,were,treacherous,and,the,long,path,meant,that,anyone,approaching,would,be,exposed,to,arrow,fire,from,the,tower,for,a,long,time,[END]
the,hidden,stones,were,slimy,and,slippery,too,twice,hodor,almost,lost,his,footing,and,shouted,hodor,[END]
in,alarm,before,regaining,his,balance,[END]
the,second,time,scared,bran,badly,[END]
if,hodor,fell,into,the,lake,with,him,in,his,basket,he,could,well,drown,especially,if,the,huge,stableboy,panicked,and,forgot,that,bran,was,there,the,way,he,did,sometimes,[END]
maybe,we,should,have,stayed,at,the,inn,under,the,apple,tree,he,thought,but,by,then,it,was,too,late,[END]
thankfully,there,was,no,third,time,and,the,water,never,got,up,past,hodor's,waist,though,the,reeds,were,in,it,up,to,their,chests,[END]
and,before,long,they,were,on,the,island,climbing,the,steps,to,the,holdfast,[END]
the,door,was,still,stout,though,its,heavy,oak,planks,had,warped,over,the,years,and,it,could,no,longer,be,closed,completely,[END]
meera,shoved,it,open,all,the,way,the,rusted,iron,hinges,screaming,[END]
the,lintel,was,low,[END]
duck,down,hodor,bran,said,and,he,did,but,not,enough,to,keep,bran,from,hitting,his,head,[END]
that,hurt,he,complained,[END]
hodor,said,hodor,straightening,[END]
they,found,themselves,in,a,gloomy,strongroom,barely,large,enough,to,hold,the,four,of,them,[END]
steps,built,into,the,inner,wall,of,the,tower,curved,away,upward,to,their,left,downward,to,their,right,behind,iron,grates,[END]
bran,looked,up,and,saw,another,grate,just,above,his,head,[END]
a,murder,hole,[END]
he,was,glad,there,was,no,one,up,there,now,to,pour,boiling,oil,down,on,them,[END]
the,grates,were,locked,but,the,iron,bars,were,red,with,rust,[END]
hodor,grabbed,hold,of,the,lefthand,door,and,gave,it,a,pull,grunting,with,effort,[END]
nothing,happened,[END]
he,tried,pushing,with,no,more,success,[END]
he,shook,the,bars,kicked,shoved,against,them,and,rattled,them,and,punched,the,hinges,with,a,huge,hand,until,the,air,was,filled,with,flakes,of,rust,but,the,iron,door,would,not,budge,[END]
the,one,down,to,the,undervault,was,no,more,accommodating,[END]
no,way,in,said,meera,shrugging,[END]
the,murder,hole,was,just,above,bran's,head,as,he,sat,in,his,basket,on,hodor's,back,[END]
he,reached,up,and,grabbed,the,bars,to,give,them,a,try,[END]
when,he,pulled,down,the,grating,came,out,of,the,ceiling,in,a,cascade,of,rust,and,crumbling,stone,[END]
hodor,[END]
hodor,shouted,[END]
the,heavy,iron,grate,gave,bran,another,bang,in,the,head,and,crashed,down,near,jojen's,feet,when,he,shoved,it,off,of,him,[END]
meera,laughed,[END]
look,at,that,my,prince,she,said,you're,stronger,than,hodor,[END]
bran,blushed,[END]
with,the,grate,gone,hodor,was,able,to,boost,meera,and,jojen,up,through,the,gaping,murder,hole,[END]
the,crannogmen,took,bran,by,the,arms,and,drew,him,up,after,them,[END]
getting,hodor,inside,was,the,hard,part,[END]
he,was,too,heavy,for,the,reeds,to,lift,the,way,they'd,lifted,bran,[END]
finally,bran,told,him,to,go,look,for,some,big,rocks,[END]
the,island,had,no,lack,of,those,and,hodor,was,able,to,pile,them,high,enough,to,grab,the,crumbling,edges,of,the,hole,and,climb,through,[END]
hodor,he,panted,happily,grinning,at,all,of,them,[END]
they,found,themselves,in,a,maze,of,small,cells,dark,and,empty,but,meera,explored,until,she,found,the,way,back,to,the,steps,[END]
the,higher,they,climbed,the,better,the,light,on,the,third,story,the,thick,outer,wall,was,pierced,by,arrow,slits,the,fourth,had,actual,windows,and,the,fifth,and,highest,was,one,big,round,chamber,with,arched,doors,on,three,sides,opening,onto,small,stone,balconies,[END]
on,the,fourth,side,was,a,privy,chamber,perched,above,a,sewer,chute,that,dropped,straight,down,into,the,lake,[END]
by,the,time,they,reached,the,roof,the,sky,was,completely,overcast,and,the,clouds,to,the,west,were,black,[END]
the,wind,was,blowing,so,strong,it,lifted,up,bran's,cloak,and,made,it,flap,and,snap,[END]
hodor,hodor,said,at,the,noise,[END]
meera,spun,in,a,circle,[END]
i,feel,almost,a,giant,standing,high,above,the,world,[END]
there,are,trees,in,the,neck,that,stand,twice,as,tall,as,this,her,brother,reminded,her,[END]
aye,but,they,have,other,trees,around,them,just,as,high,said,meera,[END]
the,world,presses,close,in,the,neck,and,the,sky,is,so,much,smaller,[END]
here,[END]
feel,that,wind,brother,[END]
and,look,how,large,the,world,has,grown,[END]
it,was,true,you,could,see,a,long,ways,from,up,here,[END]
to,the,south,the,foothills,rose,with,the,mountains,grey,and,green,beyond,them,[END]
the,rolling,plains,of,the,new,gift,stretched,away,to,all,the,other,directions,as,far,as,the,eye,could,see,[END]
i,was,hoping,we,could,see,the,wall,from,here,said,bran,disappointed,[END]
that,was,stupid,we,must,still,be,fifty,leagues,away,[END]
just,speaking,of,it,made,him,feel,tired,and,cold,as,well,[END]
jojen,what,will,we,do,when,we,reach,the,wall,[END]
my,uncle,always,said,how,big,it,was,[END]
seven,hundred,feet,high,and,so,thick,at,the,base,that,the,gates,are,more,like,tunnels,through,the,ice,[END]
how,are,we,going,to,get,past,to,find,the,three-eyed,crow,[END]
there,are,abandoned,castles,along,the,wall,i've,heard,jojen,answered,[END]
fortresses,built,by,the,night's,watch,but,now,left,empty,[END]
one,of,them,may,give,us,our,way,through,[END]
the,ghost,castles,old,nan,had,called,them,[END]
maester,luwin,had,once,made,bran,learn,the,names,of,every,one,of,the,forts,along,the,wall,[END]
that,had,been,hard,there,were,nineteen,of,them,all,told,though,no,more,than,seventeen,had,ever,been,manned,at,any,one,time,[END]

benjen,stark,had,laughed,and,said,you,know,them,better,than,i,do,bran,[END]
perhaps,you,should,be,first,ranger,[END]
i'll,stay,here,in,your,place,[END]
that,was,before,bran,fell,though,[END]

some,little,lordling,lived,there,once,with,his,family,and,a,few,sworn,men,[END]

his,lord,father,had,once,talked,about,raising,new,lords,and,settling,them,in,the,abandoned,holdfasts,as,a,shield,against,wildlings,[END]
the,plan,would,have,required,the,watch,to,yield,back,a,large,part,of,the,gift,but,his,uncle,benjen,believed,the,lord,commander,could,be,won,around,so,long,as,the,new,lordlings,paid,taxes,to,castle,black,rather,than,winterfell,[END]
it,is,a,dream,for,spring,though,lord,eddard,had,said,[END]

wildling,to,the,bone,he,thought,again,with,a,sick,sad,feeling,in,the,pit,of,his,stomach,[END]
he,flexed,the,fingers,of,his,sword,hand,and,wondered,what,ygritte,would,do,if,she,knew,his,heart,[END]
would,she,betray,him,if,he,sat,her,down,and,told,her,that,he,was,still,ned,stark's,son,and,a,man,of,the,night's,watch,[END]
he,hoped,not,but,he,dare,not,take,that,risk,[END]
too,many,lives,depended,on,his,somehow,reaching,castle,black,before,the,magnar,[END]
assuming,he,found,a,chance,to,escape,the,wildlings,[END]
they,had,descended,the,south,face,of,the,wall,at,greyguard,abandoned,for,two,hundred,years,[END]
a,section,of,the,huge,stone,steps,had,collapsed,a,century,before,but,even,so,the,descent,was,a,good,deal,easier,than,the,climb,[END]
from,there,styr,marched,them,deep,into,the,gift,to,avoid,the,watch's,customary,patrols,[END]
grigg,the,goat,led,them,past,the,few,inhabited,villages,that,remained,in,these,lands,[END]
aside,from,a,few,scattered,roundtowers,poking,the,sky,like,stone,fingers,they,saw,no,sign,of,man,[END]

day,and,night,the,thenns,watched,him,alert,for,any,signs,of,betrayal,[END]

too,blatant,a,lie,would,betray,him,[END]
but,the,truth,was,terrible,[END]
castle,black,had,no,defenses,but,for,the,wall,itself,[END]
it,lacked,even,wooden,palisades,or,earthen,dikes,[END]
the,castle,was,nothing,more,than,a,cluster,of,towers,and,keeps,two-thirds,of,them,falling,into,ruin,[END]
as,for,the,garrison,the,old,bear,had,taken,two,hundred,on,his,ranging,[END]

jon,could,not,know,[END]
perhaps,four,hundred,remained,at,the,castle,but,most,of,those,were,builders,or,stewards,not,rangers,[END]
the,thenns,were,hardened,warriors,and,more,disciplined,than,the,common,run,of,wildling,no,doubt,that,was,why,mance,had,chosen,them,[END]
the,defenders,of,castle,black,would,include,blind,maester,aemon,and,his,half-blind,steward,clydas,one-armed,donal,noye,drunken,septon,cellador,deaf,dick,follard,three-finger,hobb,the,cook,old,ser,wynton,stout,as,well,as,halder,and,toad,and,pyp,and,albett,and,the,rest,of,the,boys,who'd,trained,with,jon,[END]

he,was,never,sent,out,to,forage,or,hunt,nor,allowed,to,stand,a,watch,alone,[END]

he,could,not,take,her,but,if,he,left,her,would,the,magnar,make,her,answer,for,his,treachery,[END]
two,hearts,that,beat,as,one,[END]

the,smell,of,her,had,become,a,part,of,him,[END]
her,crooked,teeth,the,feel,of,her,breast,when,he,cupped,it,in,his,hand,the,taste,of,her,mouth,[END]
they,were,his,joy,and,his,despair,[END]
many,a,night,he,lay,with,ygritte,warm,beside,him,wondering,if,his,lord,father,had,felt,this,confused,about,his,mother,whoever,she,had,been,[END]
ygritte,set,the,trap,and,mance,rayder,pushed,me,into,it,[END]
every,day,he,spent,among,the,wildlings,made,what,he,had,to,do,that,much,harder,[END]
he,was,going,to,have,to,find,some,way,to,betray,these,men,and,when,he,did,they,would,die,[END]

and,yet,[END]
the,thenns,spoke,the,old,tongue,and,seldom,talked,to,jon,at,all,but,it,was,different,with,jarl's,raiders,the,men,who'd,climbed,the,wall,[END]

the,worst,of,the,lot,was,del,a,horsefaced,youth,near,jon's,own,age,who,would,talk,dreamily,of,this,wildling,girl,he,meant,to,steal,[END]
she's,lucky,like,your,ygritte,[END]
she's,kissed,by,fire,[END]
jon,had,to,bite,his,tongue,[END]

then,the,light,was,gone,and,the,shape,was,spinning,away,snarling,and,another,man,went,down,in,the,dark,[END]
there,were,curses,shouts,howls,of,pain,[END]
jon,saw,big,boil,stumble,backward,and,knock,down,three,men,behind,him,[END]
ghost,he,thought,for,one,mad,instant,[END]
ghost,leapt,the,wall,[END]
then,the,lightning,turned,the,night,to,day,and,he,saw,the,wolf,standing,on,del's,chest,blood,running,black,from,his,jaws,[END]
grey,[END]
he's,grey,[END]
darkness,descended,with,the,thunderclap,[END]
the,thenns,were,jabbing,with,their,spears,as,the,wolf,darted,between,them,[END]
the,old,man's,mare,reared,maddened,by,the,smell,of,slaughter,and,lashed,out,with,her,hooves,[END]
longclaw,was,still,in,his,hand,[END]
all,at,once,jon,snow,knew,he,would,never,get,a,better,chance,[END]
he,cut,down,the,first,man,as,he,turned,toward,the,wolf,shoved,past,a,second,slashed,at,a,third,[END]

the,thenn,fighting,to,control,the,horse,never,saw,him,[END]
longclaw,was,feather-light,[END]
he,swung,at,the,back,of,the,man's,calf,and,felt,the,steel,bite,down,to,the,bone,[END]
when,the,wildling,fell,the,mare,bolted,but,somehow,jon,managed,to,grab,her,mane,with,his,off,hand,and,vault,himself,onto,her,back,[END]
a,hand,closed,round,his,ankle,and,he,hacked,down,and,saw,bodger's,face,dissolve,in,a,welter,of,blood,[END]
the,horse,reared,lashing,out,[END]
one,hoof,caught,a,thenn,in,the,temple,with,a,crunch,[END]

jon,made,no,effort,to,guide,the,horse,[END]
it,was,all,he,could,do,to,stay,on,her,as,they,plunged,through,mud,and,rain,and,thunder,[END]
wet,grass,whipped,at,his,face,and,a,spear,flew,past,his,ear,[END]
if,the,horse,stumbles,and,breaks,a,leg,they,will,run,me,down,and,kill,me,he,thought,but,the,old,gods,were,with,him,and,the,horse,did,not,stumble,[END]
lightning,shivered,through,the,black,dome,of,sky,and,thunder,rolled,across,the,plains,[END]
the,shouts,dwindled,and,died,behind,him,[END]
long,hours,later,the,rain,stopped,[END]
jon,found,himself,alone,in,a,sea,of,tall,black,grass,[END]
there,was,a,deep,throbbing,ache,in,his,right,thigh,[END]
when,he,looked,down,he,was,surprised,to,see,an,arrow,jutting,out,the,back,of,it,[END]
when,did,that,happen,[END]
he,grabbed,hold,of,the,shaft,and,gave,it,a,tug,but,the,arrowhead,was,sunk,deep,in,the,meat,of,his,leg,and,the,pain,when,he,pulled,on,it,was,excruciating,[END]
he,tried,to,think,back,on,the,madness,at,the,inn,but,all,he,could,remember,was,the,beast,gaunt,and,grey,and,terrible,[END]
it,was,too,large,to,be,a,common,wolf,[END]
a,direwolf,then,[END]
it,had,to,be,[END]
he,had,never,seen,an,animal,move,so,fast,[END]
like,a,grey,wind,[END]
could,robb,have,returned,to,the,north,[END]
jon,shook,his,head,[END]
he,had,no,answers,[END]
it,was,too,hard,to,think,[END]
about,the,wolf,the,old,man,ygritte,any,of,it,[END]
clumsily,he,slid,down,off,the,mare's,back,[END]
his,wounded,leg,buckled,under,him,and,he,had,to,swallow,a,scream,[END]
this,is,going,to,be,agony,[END]
the,arrow,had,to,come,out,though,and,nothing,good,could,come,of,waiting,[END]
jon,curled,his,hand,around,the,fletching,took,a,deep,breath,and,shoved,the,arrow,forward,[END]
he,grunted,then,cursed,[END]
it,hurt,so,much,he,had,to,stop,[END]
i,am,bleeding,like,a,butchered,pig,he,thought,but,there,was,nothing,to,be,done,for,it,until,the,arrow,was,out,[END]
he,grimaced,and,tried,again,[END]
and,soon,stopped,again,trembling,[END]
once,more,[END]
this,time,he,screamed,but,when,he,was,done,the,arrowhead,was,poking,through,the,front,of,his,thigh,[END]
jon,pushed,back,his,bloody,breeches,to,get,a,better,grip,grimaced,and,slowly,drew,the,shaft,through,his,leg,[END]
how,he,got,through,that,without,fainting,he,never,knew,[END]
he,lay,on,the,ground,afterward,clutching,his,prize,and,bleeding,quietly,too,weak,to,move,[END]
after,a,while,he,realized,that,if,he,did,not,make,himself,move,he,was,like,to,bleed,to,death,[END]
jon,crawled,to,the,shallow,stream,where,the,mare,was,drinking,washed,his,thigh,in,the,cold,water,and,bound,it,tight,with,a,strip,of,cloth,torn,from,his,cloak,[END]
he,washed,the,arrow,too,turning,it,in,his,hands,[END]
was,the,fletching,grey,or,white,[END]
ygritte,fletched,her,arrows,with,pale,grey,goose,feathers,[END]
did,she,loose,a,shaft,at,me,as,i,fled,[END]
jon,could,not,blame,her,for,that,[END]
he,wondered,if,she'd,been,aiming,for,him,or,the,horse,[END]
if,the,mare,had,gone,down,he,would,have,been,doomed,[END]
a,lucky,thing,my,leg,got,in,the,way,he,muttered,[END]
he,rested,for,a,while,to,let,the,horse,graze,[END]
she,did,not,wander,far,[END]
that,was,good,[END]
hobbled,with,a,bad,leg,he,could,never,have,caught,her,[END]
it,was,all,he,could,do,to,force,himself,back,to,his,feet,and,climb,onto,her,back,[END]
how,did,i,ever,mount,her,before,without,saddle,or,stirrups,and,a,sword,in,one,hand,[END]
that,was,another,question,he,could,not,answer,[END]
thunder,rumbled,softly,in,the,distance,but,above,him,the,clouds,were,breaking,up,[END]
jon,searched,the,sky,until,he,found,the,ice,dragon,then,turned,the,mare,north,for,the,wall,and,castle,black,[END]
the,throb,of,pain,in,his,thigh,muscle,made,him,wince,as,he,put,his,heels,into,the,old,man's,horse,[END]
i,am,going,home,he,told,himself,[END]
but,if,that,was,true,why,did,he,feel,so,hollow,[END]
he,rode,till,dawn,while,the,stars,stared,down,like,eyes,[END]

your,grey,worm,hopes,to,show,you,[END]
one,of,the,first,things,dany,had,done,after,the,fall,of,astapor,was,abolish,the,custom,of,giving,the,unsullied,new,slave,names,every,day,[END]
most,of,those,born,free,had,returned,to,their,birth,names,those,who,still,remembered,them,at,least,[END]

the,man,is,as,dangerous,to,his,employers,as,to,his,foes,[END]
that's,why,you,find,him,out,here,[END]
none,of,the,free,cities,will,hire,him,any,longer,[END]

a,pity,[END]
well,perhaps,we,will,not,need,to,fight,[END]
let,us,wait,and,hear,what,the,yunkai'i,have,to,say,[END]
the,envoys,from,yunkai,arrived,as,the,sun,was,going,down,fifty,men,on,magnificent,black,horses,and,one,on,a,great,white,camel,[END]
their,helms,were,twice,as,tall,as,their,heads,so,as,not,to,crush,the,bizarre,twists,and,towers,and,shapes,of,their,oiled,hair,beneath,[END]
they,dyed,their,linen,skirts,and,tunics,a,deep,yellow,and,sewed,copper,disks,to,their,cloaks,[END]
the,man,on,the,white,camel,named,himself,grazdan,mo,eraz,[END]
lean,and,hard,he,had,a,white,smile,such,as,kraznys,had,worn,until,drogon,burned,off,his,face,[END]
his,hair,was,drawn,up,in,a,unicorn's,horn,that,jutted,from,his,brow,and,his,tokar,was,fringed,with,golden,myrish,lace,[END]
ancient,and,glorious,is,yunkai,the,queen,of,cities,he,said,when,dany,welcomed,him,to,her,tent,[END]
our,walls,are,strong,our,nobles,proud,and,fierce,our,common,folk,without,fear,[END]
ours,is,the,blood,of,ancient,ghis,whose,empire,was,old,when,valyria,was,yet,a,squalling,child,[END]
you,were,wise,to,sit,and,speak,khaleesi,[END]
you,shall,find,no,easy,conquest,here,[END]
good,[END]
my,unsullied,will,relish,a,bit,of,a,fight,[END]
she,looked,to,grey,worm,who,nodded,[END]
grazdan,shrugged,expansively,[END]
if,blood,is,what,you,wish,let,it,flow,[END]
i,am,told,you,have,freed,your,eunuchs,[END]
freedom,means,as,much,to,an,unsullied,as,a,hat,to,a,haddock,[END]
he,smiled,at,grey,worm,but,the,eunuch,might,have,been,made,of,stone,[END]
those,who,survive,we,shall,enslave,again,and,use,to,retake,astapor,from,the,rabble,[END]
we,can,make,a,slave,of,you,as,well,do,not,doubt,it,[END]
there,are,pleasure,houses,in,lys,and,tyrosh,where,men,would,pay,handsomely,to,bed,the,last,targaryen,[END]
it,is,good,to,see,you,know,who,i,am,said,dany,mildly,[END]
i,pride,myself,on,my,knowledge,of,the,savage,senseless,west,[END]
grazdan,spread,his,hands,a,gesture,of,conciliation,[END]
and,yet,why,should,we,speak,thus,harshly,to,one,another,[END]
it,is,true,that,you,committed,savageries,in,astapor,but,we,yunkai'i,are,a,most,forgiving,people,[END]
your,quarrel,is,not,with,us,your,grace,[END]
why,squander,your,strength,against,our,mighty,walls,when,you,will,need,every,man,to,regain,your,father's,throne,in,far,westeros,[END]
yunkai,wishes,you,only,well,in,that,endeavor,[END]
and,to,prove,the,truth,of,that,i,have,brought,you,a,gift,[END]
he,clapped,his,hands,and,two,of,his,escort,came,forward,bearing,a,heavy,cedar,chest,bound,in,bronze,and,gold,[END]
they,set,it,at,her,feet,[END]
fifty,thousand,golden,marks,grazdan,said,smoothly,[END]
yours,as,a,gesture,of,friendship,from,the,wise,masters,of,yunkai,[END]
gold,given,freely,is,better,than,plunder,bought,with,blood,surely,[END]
so,i,say,to,you,daenerys,targaryen,take,this,chest,and,go,[END]
dany,pushed,open,the,lid,of,the,chest,with,a,small,slippered,foot,[END]
it,was,full,of,gold,coins,just,as,the,envoy,said,[END]
she,grabbed,a,handful,and,let,them,run,through,her,fingers,[END]
they,shone,brightly,as,they,tumbled,and,fell,new,minted,most,of,them,stamped,with,a,stepped,pyramid,on,one,face,and,the,harpy,of,ghis,on,the,other,[END]
very,pretty,[END]
i,wonder,how,many,chests,like,this,i,shall,find,when,i,take,your,city,[END]
he,chuckled,[END]
none,for,that,you,shall,never,do,[END]
i,have,a,gift,for,you,as,well,[END]
she,slammed,the,chest,shut,[END]
three,days,[END]
on,the,morning,of,the,third,day,send,out,your,slaves,[END]
all,of,them,[END]
every,man,woman,and,child,shall,be,given,a,weapon,and,as,much,food,clothing,coin,and,goods,as,he,or,she,can,carry,[END]
these,they,shall,be,allowed,to,choose,freely,from,among,their,masters',possessions,as,payment,for,their,years,of,servitude,[END]
when,all,the,slaves,have,departed,you,will,open,your,gates,and,allow,my,unsullied,to,enter,and,search,your,city,to,make,certain,none,remain,in,bondage,[END]
if,you,do,this,yunkai,will,not,be,burned,or,plundered,and,none,of,your,people,shall,be,molested,[END]
the,wise,masters,will,have,the,peace,they,desire,and,will,have,proved,themselves,wise,indeed,[END]
what,say,you,[END]
i,say,you,are,mad,[END]

it,touched,the,drape,of,grazdan's,tokar,and,the,silk,caught,in,half,a,heartbeat,[END]
golden,marks,spilled,across,the,carpets,as,the,envoy,stumbled,over,the,chest,shouting,curses,and,beating,at,his,arm,until,whitebeard,flung,a,flagon,of,water,over,him,to,douse,the,flames,[END]
you,swore,i,should,have,safe,conduct,[END]

grazdan,mo,eraz,pointed,a,finger,[END]
you,shall,rue,this,arrogance,whore,[END]
these,little,lizards,will,not,keep,you,safe,i,promise,you,[END]
we,will,fill,the,air,with,arrows,if,they,come,within,a,league,of,yunkai,[END]
do,you,think,it,is,so,hard,to,kill,a,dragon,[END]
harder,than,to,kill,a,slaver,[END]
three,days,grazdan,[END]
tell,them,[END]
by,the,end,of,the,third,day,i,will,be,in,yunkai,whether,you,open,your,gates,for,me,or,no,[END]
full,dark,had,fallen,by,the,time,the,yunkai'i,departed,from,her,camp,[END]
it,promised,to,be,a,gloomy,night,moonless,starless,with,a,chill,wet,wind,blowing,from,the,west,[END]
a,fine,black,night,thought,dany,[END]
the,fires,burned,all,around,her,small,orange,stars,strewn,across,hill,and,field,[END]
ser,jorah,she,said,summon,my,bloodriders,[END]
dany,seated,herself,on,a,mound,of,cushions,to,await,them,her,dragons,all,about,her,[END]
when,they,were,assembled,she,said,an,hour,past,midnight,should,be,time,enough,[END]
yes,khaleesi,said,rakharo,[END]
time,for,what,[END]
to,mount,our,attack,[END]
ser,jorah,mormont,scowled,[END]
you,told,the,sellswords,[END]
that,i,wanted,their,answers,on,the,morrow,[END]
i,made,no,promises,about,tonight,[END]
the,stormcrows,will,be,arguing,about,my,offer,[END]
the,second,sons,will,be,drunk,on,the,wine,i,gave,mero,[END]
and,the,yunkai'i,believe,they,have,three,days,[END]
we,will,take,them,under,cover,of,this,darkness,[END]
they,will,have,scouts,watching,for,us,[END]
and,in,the,dark,they,will,see,hundreds,of,campfires,burning,said,dany,[END]
if,they,see,anything,at,all,[END]
khaleesi,said,jhogo,i,will,deal,with,these,scouts,[END]
they,are,no,riders,only,slavers,on,horses,[END]
just,so,she,agreed,[END]
i,think,we,should,attack,from,three,sides,[END]
grey,worm,your,unsullied,shall,strike,at,them,from,right,and,left,while,my,kos,lead,my,horse,in,wedge,for,a,thrust,through,their,center,[END]

she,smiled,[END]
to,be,sure,i,am,only,a,young,girl,and,know,little,of,war,[END]
what,do,you,think,my,lords,[END]
i,think,you,are,rhaegar,targaryen's,sister,ser,jorah,said,with,a,rueful,half,smile,[END]
aye,said,arstan,whitebeard,and,a,queen,as,well,[END]
it,took,an,hour,to,work,out,all,the,details,[END]
now,begins,the,most,dangerous,time,dany,thought,as,her,captains,departed,to,their,commands,[END]
she,could,only,pray,that,the,gloom,of,the,night,would,hide,her,preparations,from,the,foe,[END]
near,midnight,she,got,a,scare,when,ser,jorah,bulled,his,way,past,strong,belwas,[END]
the,unsullied,caught,one,of,the,sellswords,trying,to,sneak,into,the,camp,[END]
a,spy,[END]
that,frightened,her,[END]
if,they'd,caught,one,how,many,others,might,have,gotten,away,[END]
he,claims,to,come,bearing,gifts,[END]
it's,the,yellow,fool,with,the,blue,hair,[END]
daario,naharis,[END]
that,one,[END]
i'll,hear,him,then,[END]
when,the,exile,knight,delivered,him,she,asked,herself,whether,two,men,had,ever,been,so,different,[END]
the,tyroshi,was,fair,where,ser,jorah,was,swarthy,lithe,where,the,knight,was,brawny,graced,with,flowing,locks,where,the,other,was,balding,yet,smooth-skinned,where,mormont,was,hairy,[END]
and,her,knight,dressed,plainly,while,this,other,made,a,peacock,look,drab,though,he,had,thrown,a,heavy,black,cloak,over,his,bright,yellow,finery,for,this,visit,[END]
he,carried,a,heavy,canvas,sack,slung,over,one,shoulder,[END]
khaleesi,he,cried,i,bring,gifts,and,glad,tidings,[END]
the,stormcrows,are,yours,[END]
a,golden,tooth,gleamed,in,his,mouth,when,he,smiled,[END]
and,so,is,daario,naharis,[END]
dany,was,dubious,[END]
if,this,tyroshi,had,come,to,spy,this,declaration,might,be,no,more,than,a,desperate,plot,to,save,his,head,[END]
what,do,prendahl,na,ghezn,and,sallor,say,of,this,[END]
little,[END]
daario,upended,the,sack,and,the,heads,of,sallor,the,bald,and,prendahl,na,ghezn,spilled,out,upon,her,carpets,[END]
my,gifts,to,the,dragon,queen,[END]
viserion,sniffed,the,blood,leaking,from,prendahl's,neck,and,let,loose,a,gout,of,flame,that,took,the,dead,man,full,in,the,face,blackening,and,blistering,his,bloodless,cheeks,[END]
drogon,and,rhaegal,stirred,at,the,smell,of,roasted,meat,[END]
you,did,this,[END]
dany,asked,queasily,[END]
none,other,[END]
if,her,dragons,discomfited,daario,naharis,he,hid,it,well,[END]
for,all,the,mind,he,paid,them,they,might,have,been,three,kittens,playing,with,a,mouse,[END]
why,[END]
because,you,are,so,beautiful,[END]
his,hands,were,large,and,strong,and,there,was,something,in,his,hard,blue,eyes,and,great,curving,nose,that,suggested,the,fierceness,of,some,splendid,bird,of,prey,[END]
prendahl,talked,too,much,and,said,too,little,[END]
his,garb,rich,as,it,was,had,seen,hard,wear,salt,stains,patterned,his,boots,the,enamel,of,his,nails,was,chipped,his,lace,was,soiled,by,sweat,and,she,could,see,where,the,end,of,his,cloak,was,fraying,[END]
and,sallor,picked,his,nose,as,if,his,snot,was,gold,[END]
he,stood,with,his,hands,crossed,at,the,wrists,his,palms,resting,on,the,pommels,of,his,blades,a,curving,dothraki,arakh,on,his,left,hip,a,myrish,stiletto,on,his,right,[END]
their,hilts,were,a,matched,pair,of,golden,women,naked,and,wanton,[END]

i,make,of,slaughter,a,thing,of,beauty,and,many,a,tumbler,and,fire,dancer,has,wept,to,the,gods,that,they,might,be,half,so,quick,a,quarter,so,graceful,[END]
i,would,tell,you,the,names,of,all,the,men,i,have,slain,but,before,i,could,finish,your,dragons,would,grow,large,as,castles,the,walls,of,yunkai,would,crumble,into,yellow,dust,and,winter,would,come,and,go,and,come,again,[END]
dany,laughed,[END]
she,liked,the,swagger,she,saw,in,this,daario,naharis,[END]
draw,your,sword,and,swear,it,to,my,service,[END]
in,a,blink,daario's,arakh,was,free,of,its,sheath,[END]
his,submission,was,as,outrageous,as,the,rest,of,him,a,great,swoop,that,brought,his,face,down,to,her,toes,[END]
my,sword,is,yours,[END]
my,life,is,yours,[END]

ser,jorah,gave,daario,a,cold,hard,stare,[END]
keep,this,one,here,under,guard,until,the,battle's,fought,and,won,[END]
she,considered,a,moment,then,shook,her,head,[END]
if,he,can,give,us,the,stormcrows,surprise,is,certain,[END]
and,if,he,betrays,you,surprise,is,lost,[END]
dany,looked,down,at,the,sellsword,again,[END]
he,gave,her,such,a,smile,that,she,flushed,and,turned,away,[END]
he,won't,[END]
how,can,you,know,that,[END]
she,pointed,to,the,lumps,of,blackened,flesh,the,dragons,were,consuming,bite,by,bloody,bite,[END]
i,would,call,that,proof,of,his,sincerity,[END]

five,hundred,sellswords,of,uncertain,loyalty,[END]

a,notable,event,[END]
besides,the,jousting,there,was,a,mêlée,in,the,old,style,fought,between,seven,teams,of,knights,as,well,as,archery,and,axe-throwing,a,horse,race,a,tournament,of,singers,a,mummer,show,and,many,feasts,and,frolics,[END]

said,dany,[END]

it,is,not,for,such,as,me,to,say,what,might,have,been,in,your,brother's,heart,your,grace,[END]

the,same,song,as,before,[END]
he,asked,[END]
oh,aye,[END]
my,jenny's,song,[END]

not,long,after,the,sky,opened,[END]
lightning,cracked,and,thunder,rolled,across,the,hills,and,the,rain,fell,in,blinding,sheets,[END]
the,dwarf,woman,vanished,as,suddenly,as,she,had,appeared,while,the,outlaws,gathered,branches,and,threw,up,crude,shelters,[END]
it,rained,all,through,that,night,and,come,morning,ned,lem,and,watty,the,miller,awoke,with,chills,[END]
watty,could,not,keep,his,breakfast,down,and,young,ned,was,feverish,and,shivering,by,turns,with,skin,clammy,to,the,touch,[END]
there,was,an,abandoned,village,half,a,day's,ride,to,the,north,notch,told,lord,beric,they'd,find,better,shelter,there,a,place,to,wait,out,the,worst,of,the,rains,[END]
so,they,dragged,themselves,back,into,the,saddles,and,urged,their,horses,down,the,great,hill,[END]
the,rains,did,not,let,up,[END]
they,rode,through,woods,and,fields,fording,swollen,streams,where,the,rushing,water,came,up,to,the,bellies,of,their,horses,[END]
arya,pulled,up,the,hood,of,her,cloak,and,hunched,down,sodden,and,shivering,but,determined,not,to,falter,[END]
merrit,and,mudge,were,soon,coughing,as,bad,as,watty,and,poor,ned,seemed,to,grow,more,miserable,with,every,mile,[END]
when,i,wear,my,helm,the,rain,beats,against,the,steel,and,gives,me,headaches,he,complained,[END]
but,when,i,take,it,off,my,hair,gets,soaked,and,sticks,to,my,face,and,in,my,mouth,[END]
you,have,a,knife,gendry,suggested,[END]
if,your,hair,annoys,you,so,much,shave,your,bloody,head,[END]
he,doesn't,like,ned,[END]
the,squire,seemed,nice,enough,to,arya,maybe,a,little,shy,but,good-natured,[END]
she,had,always,heard,that,dornishmen,were,small,and,swarthy,with,black,hair,and,small,black,eyes,but,ned,had,big,blue,eyes,so,dark,that,they,looked,almost,purple,[END]
and,his,hair,was,a,pale,blond,more,ash,than,honey,[END]
how,long,have,you,been,lord,beric's,squire,[END]
she,asked,to,take,his,mind,from,his,misery,[END]
he,took,me,for,his,page,when,he,espoused,my,aunt,[END]
he,coughed,[END]
i,was,seven,but,when,i,turned,ten,he,raised,me,to,squire,[END]

you've,been,in,battles,though,[END]

he,did,not,sound,very,proud,of,it,[END]
i,was,at,the,mummer's,ford,[END]
when,lord,beric,fell,into,the,river,i,dragged,him,up,onto,the,bank,so,he,wouldn't,drown,and,stood,over,him,with,my,sword,[END]
i,never,had,to,fight,though,[END]
he,had,a,broken,lance,sticking,out,of,him,so,no,one,bothered,us,[END]
when,we,regrouped,green,gergen,helped,pull,his,lordship,back,onto,a,horse,[END]
arya,was,remembering,the,stableboy,at,king's,landing,[END]
after,him,there'd,been,that,guard,whose,throat,she,cut,at,harrenhal,and,ser,amory's,men,at,that,holdfast,by,the,lake,[END]

she,thought,as,ned's,voice,trailed,off,into,an,awkward,silence,[END]
their,horses',hooves,made,sucking,sounds,as,they,pulled,free,of,the,mud,[END]
my,lady,[END]

jon,snow,[END]
he's,with,the,night's,watch,on,the,wall,[END]
maybe,i,should,go,to,the,wall,instead,of,riverrun,[END]
jon,wouldn't,care,who,i,killed,or,whether,i,brushed,my,hair,[END]
jon,looks,like,me,even,though,he's,bastard-born,[END]
he,used,to,muss,my,hair,and,call,me,little,sister,',[END]
arya,missed,jon,most,of,all,[END]

how,do,you,know,about,jon,[END]

what,kind,of,lady,throws,crabapples,at,people,[END]
the,bad,kind,said,arya,suddenly,contrite,[END]
she,turned,back,to,ned,[END]
i'm,sorry,i,didn't,know,who,you,were,[END]
my,lord,[END]
the,fault,is,mine,my,lady,[END]
he,was,very,polite,[END]
jon,has,a,mother,[END]
wylla,her,name,is,wylla,[END]
she,would,need,to,remember,so,she,could,tell,him,the,next,time,she,saw,him,[END]
she,wondered,if,he,would,still,call,her,little,sister,[END]
i'm,not,so,little,anymore,[END]
he'd,have,to,call,me,something,else,[END]
maybe,once,she,got,to,riverrun,she,could,write,jon,a,letter,and,tell,him,what,ned,dayne,had,said,[END]
there,was,an,arthur,dayne,she,remembered,[END]
the,one,they,called,the,sword,of,the,morning,[END]
my,father,was,ser,arthur's,elder,brother,[END]
lady,ashara,was,my,aunt,[END]
i,never,knew,her,though,[END]
she,threw,herself,into,the,sea,from,atop,the,palestone,sword,before,i,was,born,[END]
why,would,she,do,that,[END]
said,arya,startled,[END]
ned,looked,wary,[END]
maybe,he,was,afraid,that,she,was,going,to,throw,something,at,him,[END]
your,lord,father,never,spoke,of,her,[END]
he,said,[END]
the,lady,ashara,dayne,of,starfall,[END]
no,[END]
did,he,know,her,[END]
before,robert,was,king,[END]
she,met,your,father,and,his,brothers,at,harrenhal,during,the,year,of,the,false,spring,[END]
oh,[END]
arya,did,not,know,what,else,to,say,[END]
why,did,she,jump,in,the,sea,though,[END]
her,heart,was,broken,[END]
sansa,would,have,sighed,and,shed,a,tear,for,true,love,but,arya,just,thought,it,was,stupid,[END]
she,couldn't,say,that,to,ned,though,not,about,his,own,aunt,[END]
did,someone,break,it,[END]
he,hesitated,[END]
perhaps,it's,not,my,place,[END]
tell,me,[END]
he,looked,at,her,uncomfortably,[END]
my,aunt,allyria,says,lady,ashara,and,your,father,fell,in,love,at,harrenhal,[END]
that's,not,so,[END]
he,loved,my,lady,mother,[END]
i'm,sure,he,did,my,lady,but,[END]
she,was,the,only,one,he,loved,[END]
he,must,have,found,that,bastard,under,a,cabbage,leaf,then,gendry,said,behind,them,[END]
arya,wished,she,had,another,crabapple,to,bounce,off,his,face,[END]
my,father,had,honor,she,said,angrily,[END]

why,don't,you,go,back,to,stoney,sept,and,ring,that,girl's,stupid,bells,[END]

at,least,your,father,raised,his,bastard,not,like,mine,[END]
i,don't,even,know,my,father's,name,[END]
some,smelly,drunk,i'd,wager,like,the,others,my,mother,dragged,home,from,the,alehouse,[END]
whenever,she,got,mad,at,me,she'd,say,if,your,father,was,here,he'd,beat,you,bloody,',[END]
that's,all,i,know,of,him,[END]
he,spat,[END]
well,if,he,was,here,now,might,be,i'd,beat,him,bloody,[END]
but,he's,dead,i,figure,and,your,father's,dead,too,so,what,does,it,matter,who,he,lay,with,[END]
it,mattered,to,arya,though,she,could,not,have,said,why,[END]
ned,was,trying,to,apologize,for,upsetting,her,but,she,did,not,want,to,hear,it,[END]
she,pressed,her,heels,into,her,horse,and,left,them,both,[END]
anguy,the,archer,was,riding,a,few,yards,ahead,[END]
when,she,caught,up,with,him,she,said,dornishmen,lie,don't,they,[END]
they're,famous,for,it,[END]
the,bowman,grinned,[END]
of,course,they,say,the,same,of,us,marchers,so,there,you,are,[END]
what's,the,trouble,now,[END]
ned's,a,good,lad,[END]
he's,just,a,stupid,liar,[END]
arya,left,the,trail,leapt,a,rotten,log,and,splashed,across,a,streambed,ignoring,the,shouts,of,the,outlaws,behind,her,[END]
they,just,want,to,tell,me,more,lies,[END]
she,thought,about,trying,to,get,away,from,them,but,there,were,too,many,and,they,knew,these,lands,too,well,[END]
what,was,the,use,of,running,if,they,caught,you,[END]
it,was,harwin,who,rode,up,beside,her,in,the,end,[END]
where,do,you,think,you're,going,milady,[END]
you,shouldn't,run,off,[END]
there,are,wolves,in,these,woods,and,worse,things,[END]
i'm,not,afraid,she,said,[END]
that,boy,ned,said,[END]
aye,he,told,me,[END]
lady,ashara,dayne,[END]
it's,an,old,tale,that,one,[END]
i,heard,it,once,at,winterfell,when,i,was,no,older,than,you,are,now,[END]
he,took,hold,of,her,bridle,firmly,and,turned,her,horse,around,[END]
i,doubt,there's,any,truth,to,it,[END]
but,if,there,is,what,of,it,[END]
when,ned,met,this,dornish,lady,his,brother,brandon,was,still,alive,and,it,was,him,betrothed,to,lady,catelyn,so,there's,no,stain,on,your,father's,honor,[END]
there's,nought,like,a,tourney,to,make,the,blood,run,hot,so,maybe,some,words,were,whispered,in,a,tent,of,a,night,who,can,say,[END]
words,or,kisses,maybe,more,but,where's,the,harm,in,that,[END]
spring,had,come,or,so,they,thought,and,neither,one,of,them,was,pledged,[END]
she,killed,herself,though,said,arya,uncertainly,[END]
ned,says,she,jumped,from,a,tower,into,the,sea,[END]
so,she,did,harwin,admitted,as,he,led,her,back,but,that,was,for,grief,i'd,wager,[END]
she'd,lost,a,brother,the,sword,of,the,morning,[END]
he,shook,his,head,[END]
let,it,lie,my,lady,[END]
they're,dead,all,of,them,[END]
let,it,lie,[END]
and,please,when,we,come,to,riverrun,say,naught,of,this,to,your,mother,[END]
the,village,was,just,where,notch,had,promised,it,would,be,[END]
they,took,shelter,in,a,grey,stone,stable,[END]
only,half,a,roof,remained,but,that,was,half,a,roof,more,than,any,other,building,in,the,village,[END]
it's,not,a,village,it's,only,black,stones,and,old,bones,[END]

and,by,the,time,the,sun,came,up,they,were,halfway,back,to,harrenhal,[END]
jaime,pushed,his,horse,much,harder,than,he,had,the,day,before,and,steelshanks,and,the,northmen,were,forced,to,match,his,pace,[END]

it,was,not,until,qyburn,and,steelshanks,added,their,voices,that,a,head,finally,appeared,on,the,battlements,above,them,[END]
he,goggled,down,at,them,then,vanished,[END]
a,short,time,later,they,heard,the,portcullis,being,drawn,upward,[END]
the,gates,swung,open,and,jaime,lannister,spurred,his,horse,through,the,walls,scarcely,glancing,at,the,murder,holes,as,he,passed,beneath,them,[END]
he,had,been,worried,that,the,goat,might,not,admit,them,but,it,seemed,as,if,the,brave,companions,still,thought,of,them,as,allies,[END]
fools,[END]
the,outer,ward,was,deserted,only,the,long,slate-roofed,stables,showed,any,signs,of,life,and,it,was,not,horses,that,interested,jaime,just,then,[END]

he,could,hear,sounds,from,somewhere,behind,the,tower,of,ghosts,and,men,shouting,in,half,a,dozen,tongues,[END]
steelshanks,and,qyburn,rode,up,on,either,side,[END]

all,of,a,sudden,he,knew,what,was,happening,[END]

his,stomach,did,a,lurch,and,he,slammed,his,spurs,into,his,horse,galloping,across,the,outer,ward,beneath,an,arched,stone,bridge,around,the,wailing,tower,and,through,the,flowstone,yard,[END]
they,had,her,in,the,bear,pit,[END]

no,shield,no,breastplate,no,chainmail,not,even,boiled,leather,only,pink,satin,and,myrish,lace,[END]

half,her,gown,was,hanging,off,in,tatters,and,her,left,arm,dripped,blood,where,the,bear,had,raked,her,[END]
at,least,they,gave,her,a,sword,[END]

that's,no,good,the,ring's,too,small,[END]
she,needed,to,attack,to,make,a,quick,end,to,it,[END]
good,steel,was,a,match,for,any,bear,[END]
but,the,wench,seemed,afraid,to,close,[END]
the,mummers,showered,her,with,insults,and,obscene,suggestions,[END]

instead,she,poked,out,ineffectually,with,the,point,of,her,blade,[END]

by,catelyn's,lights,that,was,queer,garb,for,a,lady,yet,dacey,and,lady,maege,seemed,more,comfortable,both,as,warriors,and,as,women,than,ever,the,girl,from,tarth,had,been,[END]

it,was,a,question,catelyn,dared,not,dwell,on,though,robb,dwelt,on,little,else,[END]

she,remembered,her,own,childish,disappointment,the,first,time,she,had,laid,eyes,on,eddard,stark,[END]
she,had,pictured,him,as,a,younger,version,of,his,brother,brandon,but,that,was,wrong,[END]

even,when,he,took,her,maidenhood,their,love,had,more,of,duty,to,it,than,of,passion,[END]

as,the,gods,would,have,it,their,route,took,them,through,the,whispering,wood,where,robb,had,won,his,first,great,victory,[END]
they,followed,the,course,of,the,twisting,stream,on,the,floor,of,that,pinched,narrow,valley,much,as,jaime,lannister's,men,had,done,that,fateful,night,[END]
it,was,warmer,then,catelyn,remembered,the,trees,were,still,green,and,the,stream,did,not,overflow,its,banks,[END]

only,the,spruce,and,the,soldier,pines,still,showed,green,thrusting,up,at,the,belly,of,the,clouds,like,tall,dark,spears,[END]

if,theon,had,died,in,place,of,lord,karstark's,sons,how,much,ill,would,have,been,undone,[END]

once,she,saw,a,face,peering,out,at,her,the,shape,of,the,skull,beginning,to,emerge,from,beneath,the,melting,brown,flesh,[END]
it,made,her,wonder,where,ned,had,come,to,rest,[END]

thirty-five,hundred,riders,wound,their,way,along,the,valley,floor,through,the,heart,of,the,whispering,wood,but,catelyn,stark,had,seldom,felt,lonelier,[END]
every,league,she,crossed,took,her,farther,from,riverrun,and,she,found,herself,wondering,whether,she,would,ever,see,the,castle,again,[END]
or,was,it,lost,to,her,forever,like,so,much,else,[END]
five,days,later,their,scouts,rode,back,to,warn,them,that,the,rising,waters,had,washed,out,the,wooden,bridge,at,fairmarket,[END]

its,foundations,remained,amongst,the,weeds,to,show,where,the,walls,and,keeps,had,stood,but,the,local,smallfolk,had,long,ago,made,off,with,most,of,the,stones,to,raise,their,barns,and,septs,and,holdfasts,[END]

samwell,[END]
whitetree,sam,thought,[END]
please,let,this,be,whitetree,[END]
he,remembered,whitetree,[END]
whitetree,was,on,the,maps,he'd,drawn,on,their,way,north,[END]
if,this,village,was,whitetree,he,knew,where,they,were,[END]
please,it,has,to,be,[END]
he,wanted,that,so,badly,that,he,forgot,his,feet,for,a,little,bit,he,forgot,the,ache,in,his,calves,and,his,lower,back,and,the,stiff,frozen,fingers,he,could,scarcely,feel,[END]
he,even,forgot,about,lord,mormont,and,craster,and,the,wights,and,the,others,[END]
whitetree,sam,prayed,to,any,god,that,might,be,listening,[END]
all,wildling,villages,looked,much,alike,though,[END]
a,huge,weirwood,grew,in,the,center,of,this,one,[END]
but,a,white,tree,did,not,mean,whitetree,necessarily,[END]
hadn't,the,weirwood,at,whitetree,been,bigger,than,this,one,[END]
maybe,he,was,remembering,it,wrong,[END]
the,face,carved,into,the,bone,pale,trunk,was,long,and,sad,red,tears,of,dried,sap,leaked,from,its,eyes,[END]
was,that,how,it,looked,when,we,came,north,[END]
sam,couldn't,recall,[END]
around,the,tree,stood,a,handful,of,one-room,hovels,with,sod,roofs,a,longhall,built,of,logs,and,grown,over,with,moss,a,stone,well,a,sheepfold,[END]
but,no,sheep,nor,any,people,[END]
the,wildlings,had,gone,to,join,mance,rayder,in,the,frostfangs,taking,all,they,owned,except,their,houses,[END]
sam,was,thankful,for,that,[END]
night,was,coming,on,and,it,would,be,good,to,sleep,beneath,a,roof,for,once,[END]
he,was,so,tired,[END]
it,seemed,as,though,he,had,been,walking,half,his,life,[END]
his,boots,were,falling,to,pieces,and,all,the,blisters,on,his,feet,had,burst,and,turned,to,callus,but,now,he,had,new,blisters,under,the,callus,and,his,toes,were,getting,frostbitten,[END]
but,it,was,either,walk,or,die,sam,knew,[END]
gilly,was,still,weak,from,childbirth,and,carrying,the,babe,besides,she,needed,the,horse,more,than,he,did,[END]
the,second,horse,had,died,on,them,three,days,out,from,craster's,keep,[END]
it,was,a,wonder,she,lasted,that,long,poor,half-starved,thing,[END]
sam's,weight,had,probably,done,for,her,[END]
they,might,have,tried,riding,double,but,he,was,afraid,the,same,thing,would,happen,again,[END]
it's,better,that,i,walk,[END]
sam,left,gilly,in,the,longhall,to,make,a,fire,while,he,poked,his,head,into,the,hovels,[END]
she,was,better,at,making,fires,he,could,never,seem,to,get,the,kindling,to,catch,and,the,last,time,he'd,tried,to,strike,a,spark,off,flint,and,steel,he,managed,to,cut,himself,on,his,knife,[END]
gilly,bound,up,the,gash,for,him,but,his,hand,was,stiff,and,sore,even,clumsier,than,it,had,been,before,[END]
he,knew,he,should,wash,the,wound,and,change,the,binding,but,he,was,afraid,to,look,at,it,[END]
besides,it,was,so,cold,that,he,hated,taking,off,his,gloves,[END]
sam,did,not,know,what,he,hoped,to,find,in,the,empty,houses,[END]
maybe,the,wildlings,had,left,some,food,behind,[END]
he,had,to,take,a,look,[END]
jon,had,searched,the,huts,at,whitetree,on,their,way,north,[END]
inside,one,hovel,sam,heard,a,rustling,of,rats,from,a,dark,corner,but,otherwise,there,was,nothing,in,any,of,them,but,old,straw,old,smells,and,some,ashes,beneath,the,smoke,hole,[END]
he,turned,back,to,the,weirwood,and,studied,the,carved,face,a,moment,[END]
it,is,not,the,face,we,saw,he,admitted,to,himself,[END]
the,tree's,not,half,as,big,as,the,one,at,whitetree,[END]
the,red,eyes,wept,blood,and,he,didn't,remember,that,either,[END]
clumsily,sam,sank,to,his,knees,[END]
old,gods,hear,my,prayer,[END]
the,seven,were,my,father's,gods,but,i,said,my,words,to,you,when,i,joined,the,watch,[END]
help,us,now,[END]
i,fear,we,might,be,lost,[END]
we're,hungry,too,and,so,cold,[END]
i,don't,know,what,gods,i,believe,in,now,but,[END]
please,if,you're,there,help,us,[END]
gilly,has,a,little,son,[END]
that,was,all,that,he,could,think,to,say,[END]
the,dusk,was,deepening,the,leaves,of,the,weirwood,rustling,softly,waving,like,a,thousand,blood-red,hands,[END]
whether,jon's,gods,had,heard,him,or,not,he,could,not,say,[END]
by,the,time,he,returned,to,the,longhall,gilly,had,the,fire,going,[END]
she,sat,close,to,it,with,her,furs,opened,the,babe,at,her,breast,[END]
he's,as,hungry,as,we,are,sam,thought,[END]
the,old,women,had,smuggled,out,food,for,them,from,craster's,but,they,had,eaten,most,of,it,by,now,[END]
sam,had,been,a,hopeless,hunter,even,at,horn,hill,where,game,was,plentiful,and,he,had,hounds,and,huntsmen,to,help,him,here,in,this,endless,empty,forest,the,chances,of,him,catching,anything,were,remote,[END]
his,efforts,at,fishing,the,lakes,and,half-frozen,streams,had,been,dismal,failures,as,well,[END]
how,much,longer,sam,[END]
gilly,asked,[END]
is,it,far,still,[END]
not,so,far,[END]
not,so,far,as,it,was,[END]
sam,shrugged,out,of,his,pack,eased,himself,awkwardly,to,the,floor,and,tried,to,cross,his,legs,[END]
his,back,ached,so,abominably,from,the,walking,that,he,would,have,liked,to,lean,up,against,one,of,the,carved,wooden,pillars,that,supported,the,roof,but,the,fire,was,in,the,center,of,the,hall,beneath,the,smoke,hole,and,he,craved,warmth,even,more,than,comfort,[END]
another,few,days,should,see,us,there,[END]
sam,had,his,maps,but,if,this,wasn't,whitetree,then,they,weren't,going,to,be,much,use,[END]
we,went,too,far,east,to,get,around,that,lake,he,fretted,or,maybe,too,far,west,when,i,tried,to,double,back,[END]
he,was,coming,to,hate,lakes,and,rivers,[END]
up,here,there,was,never,a,ferry,or,bridge,which,meant,walking,all,the,way,around,the,lakes,and,searching,for,places,to,ford,the,rivers,[END]
it,was,easier,to,follow,a,game,trail,than,to,struggle,through,the,brush,easier,to,circle,a,ridge,instead,of,climbing,it,[END]
if,bannen,or,dywen,were,with,us,we'd,be,at,castle,black,by,now,warming,our,feet,in,the,common,room,[END]
bannen,was,dead,though,and,dywen,gone,with,grenn,and,dolorous,edd,and,the,others,[END]
the,wall,is,three,hundred,miles,long,and,seven,hundred,feet,high,sam,reminded,himself,[END]
if,they,kept,going,south,they,had,to,find,it,sooner,or,later,[END]
and,he,was,certain,that,they,had,been,going,south,[END]
by,day,he,took,directions,from,the,sun,and,on,clear,nights,they,could,follow,the,ice,dragon's,tail,though,they,hadn't,traveled,much,by,night,since,the,second,horse,had,died,[END]
even,when,the,moon,was,full,it,was,too,dark,beneath,the,trees,and,it,would,have,been,so,easy,for,sam,or,the,last,garron,to,break,a,leg,[END]
we,have,to,be,well,south,by,now,we,have,to,be,[END]
what,he,wasn't,so,certain,of,was,how,far,east,or,west,they,might,have,strayed,[END]
they,would,reach,the,wall,yes,[END]
in,a,day,or,a,fortnight,it,couldn't,be,farther,than,that,surely,surely,[END]
but,where,[END]
it,was,the,gate,at,castle,black,they,needed,to,find,the,only,way,through,the,wall,for,a,hundred,leagues,[END]
is,the,wall,as,big,as,craster,used,to,say,[END]
gilly,asked,[END]
bigger,[END]
sam,tried,to,sound,cheerful,[END]
so,big,you,can't,even,see,the,castles,hidden,behind,it,[END]
but,they're,there,you'll,see,[END]
the,wall,is,all,ice,but,the,castles,are,stone,and,wood,[END]
there,are,tall,towers,and,deep,vaults,and,a,huge,longhall,with,a,great,fire,burning,in,the,hearth,day,and,night,[END]
it's,so,hot,in,there,gilly,you'll,hardly,believe,it,[END]
could,i,stand,by,the,fire,[END]
me,and,the,boy,[END]
not,for,a,long,time,just,till,we're,good,and,warm,[END]
you,can,stand,by,the,fire,as,long,as,you,like,[END]
you'll,have,food,and,drink,too,[END]
hot,mulled,wine,and,a,bowl,of,venison,stewed,with,onions,and,hobb's,bread,right,out,of,the,oven,so,hot,it,will,burn,your,fingers,[END]
sam,peeled,a,glove,off,to,wriggle,his,own,fingers,near,the,flames,and,soon,regretted,it,[END]
they,had,been,numb,with,cold,but,as,feeling,returned,they,hurt,so,much,he,almost,cried,[END]
sometimes,one,of,the,brothers,will,sing,he,said,to,take,his,mind,off,the,pain,[END]
dareon,sang,best,but,they,sent,him,to,eastwatch,[END]
there's,still,halder,though,[END]
and,toad,[END]
his,real,name,is,todder,but,he,looks,like,a,toad,so,we,call,him,that,[END]
he,likes,to,sing,but,he,has,an,awful,voice,[END]

gilly,rearranged,her,furs,and,she,moved,the,babe,from,one,breast,to,the,other,[END]
sam,blushed,[END]
i,[END]
i,know,some,songs,[END]
when,i,was,little,i,liked,to,sing,[END]
i,danced,too,but,my,lord,father,never,liked,me,to,[END]
he,said,if,i,wanted,to,prance,around,i,should,do,it,in,the,yard,with,a,sword,in,my,hand,[END]
could,you,sing,some,southron,song,[END]
for,the,babe,[END]
if,you,like,[END]
sam,thought,for,a,moment,[END]
there's,a,song,our,septon,used,to,sing,to,me,and,my,sisters,when,we,were,little,and,it,was,time,for,us,to,go,to,sleep,[END]
the,song,of,the,seven,',it's,called,[END]
he,cleared,his,throat,and,softly,sang,[END]
the,father's,face,is,stern,and,strong,[END]
he,sits,and,judges,right,from,wrong,[END]
he,weighs,our,lives,the,short,and,long,[END]
and,loves,the,little,children,[END]
the,mother,gives,the,gift,of,life,[END]
and,watches,over,every,wife,[END]
her,gentle,smile,ends,all,strife,[END]

the,warrior,stands,before,the,foe,[END]
protecting,us,where,e'er,we,go,[END]
with,sword,and,shield,and,spear,and,bow,[END]

the,smith,he,labors,day,and,night,[END]
to,put,the,world,of,men,to,right,[END]
with,hammer,plow,and,fire,bright,[END]

the,maiden,dances,through,the,sky,[END]
she,lives,in,every,lover's,sigh,[END]
her,smiles,teach,the,birds,to,fly,[END]

the,seven,gods,who,made,us,all,[END]

so,close,your,eyes,you,shall,not,fall,[END]
they,see,you,little,children,[END]
just,close,your,eyes,you,shall,not,fall,[END]
they,see,you,little,children,[END]
sam,remembered,the,last,time,he'd,sung,the,song,with,his,mother,to,lull,baby,dickon,to,sleep,[END]
his,father,had,heard,their,voices,and,come,barging,in,angry,[END]
i,will,have,no,more,of,that,lord,randyll,told,his,wife,harshly,[END]
you,ruined,one,boy,with,those,soft,septon's,songs,do,you,mean,to,do,the,same,to,this,babe,[END]
then,he,looked,at,sam,and,said,go,sing,to,your,sisters,if,you,must,sing,[END]
i,don't,want,you,near,my,son,[END]
gilly's,babe,had,gone,to,sleep,[END]
he,was,such,a,tiny,thing,and,so,quiet,that,sam,feared,for,him,[END]
he,didn't,even,have,a,name,[END]
he,had,asked,gilly,about,that,but,she,said,it,was,bad,luck,to,name,a,child,before,he,was,two,[END]
so,many,of,them,died,[END]
she,tucked,her,nipple,back,inside,her,furs,[END]
that,was,pretty,sam,[END]
you,sing,good,[END]
you,should,hear,dareon,[END]
his,voice,is,sweet,as,mead,[END]
we,drank,the,sweetest,mead,the,day,craster,made,me,a,wife,[END]
it,was,summer,then,and,not,so,cold,[END]
gilly,gave,him,a,puzzled,look,[END]
did,you,only,sing,of,six,gods,[END]
craster,always,told,us,you,southrons,had,seven,[END]
seven,he,agreed,but,no,one,sings,of,the,stranger,[END]
the,stranger's,face,was,the,face,of,death,[END]
even,talking,of,him,made,sam,uncomfortable,[END]
we,should,eat,something,[END]
a,bite,or,two,[END]
nothing,was,left,but,a,few,black,sausages,as,hard,as,wood,[END]
sam,sawed,off,a,few,thin,slices,for,each,of,them,[END]
the,effort,made,his,wrist,ache,but,he,was,hungry,enough,to,persist,[END]
if,you,chewed,the,slices,long,enough,they,softened,up,and,tasted,good,[END]
craster's,wives,seasoned,them,with,garlic,[END]
after,they,had,finished,sam,begged,her,pardon,and,went,out,to,relieve,himself,and,look,after,the,horse,[END]
a,biting,wind,was,blowing,from,the,north,and,the,leaves,in,the,trees,rattled,at,him,as,he,passed,[END]
he,had,to,break,the,thin,scum,of,ice,on,top,of,the,stream,so,the,horse,could,get,a,drink,[END]
i,had,better,bring,her,inside,[END]
he,did,not,want,to,wake,up,at,break,of,day,to,find,that,their,horse,had,frozen,to,death,during,the,night,[END]
gilly,would,keep,going,even,if,that,happened,[END]
the,girl,was,very,brave,not,like,him,[END]
he,wished,he,knew,what,he,was,going,to,do,with,her,back,at,castle,black,[END]
she,kept,saying,how,she'd,be,his,wife,if,he,wanted,but,black,brothers,didn't,keep,wives,besides,he,was,a,tarly,of,horn,hill,he,could,never,wed,a,wildling,[END]
i'll,have,to,think,of,something,[END]
so,long,as,we,reach,the,wall,alive,the,rest,doesn't,matter,it,doesn't,matter,one,little,bit,[END]
leading,the,horse,to,the,longhall,was,simple,enough,[END]
getting,her,through,the,door,was,not,but,sam,persisted,[END]
gilly,was,already,dozing,by,the,time,he,got,the,garron,inside,[END]
he,hobbled,the,horse,in,a,corner,fed,some,fresh,wood,to,the,fire,took,off,his,heavy,cloak,and,wriggled,down,under,the,furs,beside,the,wildling,woman,[END]
his,cloak,was,big,enough,to,cover,all,three,of,them,and,keep,in,the,warmth,of,their,bodies,[END]
gilly,smelled,of,milk,and,garlic,and,musty,old,fur,but,he,was,used,to,that,by,now,[END]
they,were,good,smells,so,far,as,sam,was,concerned,[END]
he,liked,sleeping,next,to,her,[END]
it,made,him,remember,times,long,past,when,he,had,shared,a,huge,bed,at,horn,hill,with,two,of,his,sisters,[END]
that,had,ended,when,lord,randyll,decided,it,was,making,him,soft,as,a,girl,[END]
sleeping,alone,in,my,own,cold,cell,never,made,me,any,harder,or,braver,though,[END]
he,wondered,what,his,father,would,say,if,he,could,see,him,now,[END]
i,killed,one,of,the,others,my,lord,he,imagined,saying,[END]
i,stabbed,him,with,an,obsidian,dagger,and,my,sworn,brothers,call,me,sam,the,slayer,now,[END]
but,even,in,his,fancies,lord,randyll,only,scowled,disbelieving,[END]
his,dreams,were,strange,that,night,[END]
he,was,back,at,horn,hill,at,the,castle,but,his,father,was,not,there,[END]
it,was,sam's,castle,now,[END]
jon,snow,was,with,him,[END]
lord,mormont,too,the,old,bear,and,grenn,and,dolorous,edd,and,pyp,and,toad,and,all,his,other,brothers,from,the,watch,but,they,wore,bright,colors,instead,of,black,[END]
sam,sat,at,the,high,table,and,feasted,them,all,cutting,thick,slices,off,a,roast,with,his,father's,greatsword,heartsbane,[END]
there,were,sweet,cakes,to,eat,and,honeyed,wine,to,drink,there,was,singing,and,dancing,and,everyone,was,warm,[END]
when,the,feast,was,done,he,went,up,to,sleep,not,to,the,lord's,bedchamber,where,his,mother,and,father,lived,but,to,the,room,he,had,once,shared,with,his,sisters,[END]
only,instead,of,his,sisters,it,was,gilly,waiting,in,the,huge,soft,bed,wearing,nothing,but,a,big,shaggy,fur,milk,leaking,from,her,breasts,[END]
he,woke,suddenly,in,cold,and,dread,[END]
the,fire,had,burned,down,to,smouldering,red,embers,[END]
the,air,itself,seemed,frozen,it,was,so,cold,[END]
in,the,corner,the,garron,was,whinnying,and,kicking,the,logs,with,her,hind,legs,[END]
gilly,sat,beside,the,fire,hugging,her,babe,[END]

he,clutched,the,dagger,with,both,hands,to,hold,it,steady,[END]
the,wight,did,not,seem,to,fear,the,dragonglass,[END]
perhaps,he,did,not,know,what,it,was,[END]
he,moved,slowly,but,small,paul,had,never,been,quick,even,when,he'd,been,alive,[END]
behind,him,gilly,murmured,to,calm,the,garron,and,tried,to,urge,it,toward,the,door,[END]
but,the,horse,must,have,caught,a,whiff,of,the,wight's,queer,cold,scent,[END]
suddenly,she,balked,rearing,her,hooves,lashing,at,the,frosty,air,[END]
paul,swung,toward,the,sound,and,seemed,to,lose,all,interest,in,sam,[END]
there,was,no,time,to,think,or,pray,or,be,afraid,[END]

you're,dead,[END]
sam,screamed,as,he,stabbed,[END]
you're,dead,you're,dead,[END]
he,stabbed,and,screamed,again,and,again,tearing,huge,rents,in,paul's,heavy,black,cloak,[END]
shards,of,dragonglass,flew,everywhere,as,the,blade,shattered,on,the,iron,mail,beneath,the,wool,[END]
sam's,wail,made,a,white,mist,in,the,black,air,[END]
he,dropped,the,useless,hilt,and,took,a,hasty,step,backwards,as,small,paul,twisted,around,[END]
before,he,could,get,out,his,other,knife,the,steel,knife,that,every,brother,carried,the,wight's,black,hands,locked,beneath,his,chins,[END]

his,fumbling,fingers,finally,found,the,dagger,but,when,he,slammed,it,up,into,the,wight's,belly,the,point,skidded,off,the,iron,links,and,the,blade,went,spinning,from,sam's,hand,[END]
small,paul's,fingers,tightened,inexorably,and,began,to,twist,[END]

the,world,shrank,to,two,blue,stars,a,terrible,crushing,pain,and,a,cold,so,fierce,that,his,tears,froze,over,his,eyes,[END]
sam,squirmed,and,pulled,desperate,[END]
and,then,he,lurched,forward,[END]
small,paul,was,big,and,powerful,but,sam,still,outweighed,him,and,the,wights,were,clumsy,he,had,seen,that,on,the,fist,[END]
the,sudden,shift,sent,paul,staggering,back,a,step,and,the,living,man,and,the,dead,one,went,crashing,down,together,[END]
the,impact,knocked,one,hand,from,sam's,throat,and,he,was,able,to,suck,in,a,quick,breath,of,air,before,the,icy,black,fingers,returned,[END]
the,taste,of,blood,filled,his,mouth,[END]
he,twisted,his,neck,around,looking,for,his,knife,and,saw,a,dull,orange,glow,[END]
the,fire,[END]
only,ember,and,ashes,remained,but,still,[END]
he,could,not,breathe,or,think,[END]

his,arms,flailed,against,the,dirt,floor,groping,reaching,scattering,the,ashes,until,at,last,they,found,something,hot,[END]
a,chunk,of,charred,wood,smouldering,red,and,orange,within,the,black,[END]
his,fingers,closed,around,it,and,he,smashed,it,into,paul's,mouth,so,hard,he,felt,teeth,shatter,[END]

sam's,last,thoughts,were,for,the,mother,who,had,loved,him,and,the,father,he,had,failed,[END]
the,longhall,was,spinning,around,him,when,he,saw,the,wisp,of,smoke,rising,from,between,paul's,broken,teeth,[END]
then,the,dead,man's,face,burst,into,flame,and,the,hands,were,gone,[END]
sam,sucked,in,air,and,rolled,feebly,away,[END]
the,wight,was,burning,hoarfrost,dripping,from,his,beard,as,the,flesh,beneath,blackened,[END]

the,wen,on,chett's,neck,was,black,his,boils,covered,with,a,thin,film,of,ice,[END]
and,that,one,looked,like,hake,though,it,was,hard,to,know,for,certain,with,half,his,head,missing,[END]
they,had,torn,the,poor,garron,apart,and,were,pulling,out,her,entrails,with,dripping,red,hands,[END]

it,flapped,its,wings,and,screamed,along,with,gilly,[END]
the,wights,were,almost,on,her,[END]
he,heard,the,dark,red,leaves,of,the,weirwood,rustling,whispering,to,one,another,in,a,tongue,he,did,not,know,[END]
the,starlight,itself,seemed,to,stir,and,all,around,them,the,trees,groaned,and,creaked,[END]

ravens,[END]
they,were,in,the,weirwood,hundreds,of,them,thousands,perched,on,the,bone-white,branches,peering,between,the,leaves,[END]

shrieking,flapping,they,descended,on,the,wights,in,angry,clouds,[END]
they,swarmed,round,chett's,face,and,pecked,at,his,blue,eyes,they,covered,the,sisterman,like,flies,they,plucked,gobbets,from,inside,hake's,shattered,head,[END]
there,were,so,many,that,when,sam,looked,up,he,could,not,see,the,moon,[END]

sam,ran,puffs,of,frost,exploding,from,his,mouth,[END]
all,around,him,the,wights,flailed,at,the,black,wings,and,sharp,beaks,that,assailed,them,falling,in,an,eerie,silence,with,never,a,grunt,nor,cry,[END]
but,the,ravens,ignored,sam,[END]
he,took,gilly,by,the,hand,and,pulled,her,away,from,the,weirwood,[END]

the,shout,cut,through,the,night,through,the,shrieks,of,a,thousand,ravens,[END]
beneath,the,trees,a,man,muffled,head,to,heels,in,mottled,blacks,and,greys,sat,astride,an,elk,[END]
here,the,rider,called,[END]
a,hood,shadowed,his,face,[END]
he's,wearing,blacks,[END]
sam,urged,gilly,toward,him,[END]
the,elk,was,huge,a,great,elk,ten,feet,tall,at,the,shoulder,with,a,rack,of,antlers,near,as,wide,[END]
the,creature,sank,to,his,knees,to,let,them,mount,[END]

then,it,was,sam's,turn,[END]
my,thanks,he,puffed,[END]
only,when,he,grasped,the,offered,hand,did,he,realize,that,the,rider,wore,no,glove,[END]
his,hand,was,black,and,cold,with,fingers,hard,as,stone,[END]
arya,[END]
when,they,reached,the,top,of,the,ridge,and,saw,the,river,sandor,clegane,reined,up,hard,and,cursed,[END]
the,rain,was,falling,from,a,black,iron,sky,pricking,the,green,and,brown,torrent,with,ten,thousand,swords,[END]
it,must,be,a,mile,across,arya,thought,[END]
the,tops,of,half,a,hundred,trees,poked,up,out,the,swirling,waters,their,limbs,clutching,for,the,sky,like,the,arms,of,drowning,men,[END]
thick,mats,of,sodden,leaves,choked,the,shoreline,and,farther,out,in,the,channel,she,glimpsed,something,pale,and,swollen,a,deer,or,perhaps,a,dead,horse,moving,swiftly,downstream,[END]
there,was,a,sound,too,a,low,rumble,at,the,edge,of,hearing,like,the,sound,a,dog,makes,just,before,he,growls,[END]
arya,squirmed,in,the,saddle,and,felt,the,links,of,the,hound's,mail,digging,into,her,back,[END]
his,arms,encircled,her,on,the,left,the,burned,arm,he'd,donned,a,steel,vambrace,for,protection,but,she'd,seen,him,change,the,dressings,and,the,flesh,beneath,was,still,raw,and,seeping,[END]
if,the,burns,pained,him,though,sandor,clegane,gave,no,hint,of,it,[END]
is,this,the,blackwater,rush,[END]
they,had,ridden,so,far,in,rain,and,darkness,through,trackless,woods,and,nameless,villages,that,arya,had,lost,all,sense,of,where,they,were,[END]
it's,a,river,we,need,to,cross,that's,all,you,need,to,know,[END]
clegane,would,answer,her,from,time,to,time,but,he,had,warned,her,not,to,talk,back,[END]
he,had,given,her,a,lot,of,warnings,that,first,day,[END]
the,next,time,you,hit,me,i'll,tie,your,hands,behind,your,back,he'd,said,[END]
the,next,time,you,try,and,run,off,i'll,bind,your,feet,together,[END]
scream,or,shout,or,bite,me,again,and,i'll,gag,you,[END]
we,can,ride,double,or,i,can,throw,you,across,the,back,of,the,horse,trussed,up,like,a,sow,for,slaughter,[END]
your,choice,[END]
she,had,chosen,to,ride,but,the,first,time,they,made,camp,she'd,waited,until,she,thought,he,was,asleep,and,found,a,big,jagged,rock,to,smash,his,ugly,head,in,[END]
quiet,as,a,shadow,she,told,herself,as,she,crept,toward,him,but,that,wasn't,quiet,enough,[END]
the,hound,hadn't,been,asleep,after,all,[END]
or,maybe,he'd,woken,[END]
whichever,it,was,his,eyes,opened,his,mouth,twitched,and,he,took,the,rock,away,from,her,as,if,she,were,a,baby,[END]
the,best,she,could,do,was,kick,him,[END]
i'll,give,you,that,one,he,said,when,he,flung,the,rock,into,the,bushes,[END]
but,if,you're,stupid,enough,to,try,again,i'll,hurt,you,[END]
why,don't,you,just,kill,me,like,you,did,mycah,[END]
arya,had,screamed,at,him,[END]
she,was,still,defiant,then,more,angry,than,scared,[END]
he,answered,by,grabbing,the,front,of,her,tunic,and,yanking,her,within,an,inch,of,his,burned,face,[END]
the,next,time,you,say,that,name,i'll,beat,you,so,bad,you'll,wish,i,killed,you,[END]
after,that,he,rolled,her,in,his,horse,blanket,every,night,when,he,went,to,sleep,and,tied,ropes,around,her,top,and,bottom,so,she,was,bound,up,as,tight,as,a,babe,in,swaddling,clothes,[END]
it,has,to,be,the,blackwater,arya,decided,as,she,watched,the,rain,lash,the,river,[END]
the,hound,was,joffrey's,dog,he,was,taking,her,back,to,the,red,keep,to,hand,to,joffrey,and,the,queen,[END]
she,wished,that,the,sun,would,come,out,so,she,could,tell,which,way,they,were,going,[END]
the,more,she,looked,at,the,moss,on,the,trees,the,more,confused,she,got,[END]
the,blackwater,wasn't,so,wide,at,king's,landing,but,that,was,before,the,rains,[END]
the,fords,will,all,be,gone,sandor,clegane,said,and,i,wouldn't,care,to,try,and,swim,over,neither,[END]
there's,no,way,across,she,thought,[END]
lord,beric,will,catch,us,for,sure,[END]
clegane,had,pushed,his,big,black,stallion,hard,doubling,back,thrice,to,throw,off,pursuit,once,even,riding,half,a,mile,up,the,center,of,a,swollen,stream,[END]
but,arya,still,expected,to,see,the,outlaws,every,time,she,looked,back,[END]
she,had,tried,to,help,them,by,scratching,her,name,on,the,trunks,of,trees,when,she,went,in,the,bushes,to,make,water,but,the,fourth,time,she,did,it,he,caught,her,and,that,was,the,end,of,that,[END]
it,doesn't,matter,arya,told,herself,thoros,will,find,me,in,his,flames,[END]
only,he,hadn't,[END]
not,yet,anyway,and,once,they,crossed,the,river,[END]
harroway,town,shouldn't,be,far,the,hound,said,[END]
where,lord,roote,stables,old,king,andahar's,two-headed,water,horse,[END]
maybe,we'll,ride,across,[END]
arya,had,never,heard,of,old,king,andahar,[END]
she'd,never,seen,a,horse,with,two,heads,either,especially,not,one,who,could,run,on,water,but,she,knew,better,than,to,ask,[END]
she,held,her,tongue,and,sat,stiff,as,the,hound,turned,the,stallion's,head,and,trotted,along,the,ridgeline,following,the,river,downstream,[END]
at,least,the,rain,was,at,their,backs,this,way,[END]
she'd,had,enough,of,it,stinging,her,eyes,half-blind,and,washing,down,her,cheeks,like,she,was,crying,[END]
wolves,never,cry,she,reminded,herself,again,[END]
it,could,not,have,been,much,past,noon,but,the,sky,was,dark,as,dusk,[END]
they,had,not,seen,the,sun,in,more,days,than,she,could,count,[END]
arya,was,soaked,to,the,bone,saddle-sore,sniffling,and,achy,[END]
she,had,a,fever,too,and,sometimes,shivered,uncontrollably,but,when,she'd,told,the,hound,that,she,was,sick,he'd,only,snarled,at,her,[END]
wipe,your,nose,and,shut,your,mouth,he,told,her,[END]
half,the,time,he,slept,in,the,saddle,now,trusting,his,stallion,to,follow,whatever,rutted,farm,track,or,game,trail,they,were,on,[END]
the,horse,was,a,heavy,courser,almost,as,big,as,a,destrier,but,much,faster,[END]
stranger,the,hound,called,him,[END]
arya,had,tried,to,steal,him,once,when,clegane,was,taking,a,piss,against,a,tree,thinking,she,could,ride,off,before,he,could,catch,her,[END]
stranger,had,almost,bitten,her,face,off,[END]
he,was,gentle,as,an,old,gelding,with,his,master,but,otherwise,he,had,a,temper,as,black,as,he,was,[END]
she,had,never,known,a,horse,so,quick,to,bite,or,kick,[END]
they,rode,beside,the,river,for,hours,splashing,across,two,muddy,vassal,streams,before,they,reached,the,place,that,sandor,clegane,had,spoken,of,[END]
lord,harroway's,town,he,said,and,then,when,he,saw,it,seven,hells,[END]
the,town,was,drowned,and,desolate,[END]
the,rising,waters,had,overflowed,the,riverbanks,[END]
all,that,remained,of,harroway,town,was,the,upper,story,of,a,daub-and-wattle,inn,the,seven-sided,dome,of,a,sunken,sept,two-thirds,of,a,stone,roundtower,some,moldy,thatch,roofs,and,a,forest,of,chimneys,[END]
but,there,was,smoke,coming,from,the,tower,arya,saw,and,below,one,arched,window,a,wide,flat-bottomed,boat,was,chained,up,tight,[END]
the,boat,had,a,dozen,oarlocks,and,a,pair,of,great,carved,wooden,horse,heads,mounted,fore,and,aft,[END]
the,two-headed,horse,she,realized,[END]
there,was,a,wooden,house,with,a,sod,roof,right,in,the,middle,of,the,deck,and,when,the,hound,cupped,his,hands,around,his,mouth,and,shouted,two,men,came,spilling,out,[END]
a,third,appeared,in,the,window,of,the,roundtower,clutching,a,loaded,crossbow,[END]
what,do,you,want,[END]
he,shouted,across,the,swirling,brown,waters,[END]
take,us,over,the,hound,shouted,back,[END]
the,men,in,the,boat,conferred,with,one,another,[END]
one,of,them,a,grizzled,grey-haired,man,with,thick,arms,and,a,bent,back,stepped,to,the,rail,[END]
it,will,cost,you,[END]
then,i'll,pay,[END]
with,what,[END]
arya,wondered,[END]
the,outlaws,had,taken,clegane's,gold,but,maybe,lord,beric,had,left,him,some,silver,and,copper,[END]
a,ferry,ride,shouldn't,cost,more,than,a,few,coppers,[END]
the,ferrymen,were,talking,again,[END]
finally,the,bent-backed,one,turned,away,and,gave,a,shout,[END]
six,more,men,appeared,pulling,up,hoods,to,keep,the,rain,off,their,heads,[END]
still,more,squirmed,out,the,holdfast,window,and,leapt,down,onto,the,deck,[END]
half,of,them,looked,enough,like,the,bent-backed,man,to,be,his,kin,[END]
some,of,them,undid,the,chains,and,took,up,long,poles,while,the,others,slid,heavy,wide-bladed,oars,through,the,locks,[END]
the,ferry,swung,about,and,began,to,creep,slowly,toward,the,shallows,oars,stroking,smoothly,on,either,side,[END]
sandor,clegane,rode,down,the,hill,to,meet,it,[END]
when,the,aft,end,of,the,boat,slammed,into,the,hillside,the,ferrymen,opened,a,wide,door,beneath,the,carved,horse's,head,and,extended,a,heavy,oaken,plank,[END]
stranger,balked,at,the,water's,edge,but,the,hound,put,his,heels,into,the,courser's,flank,and,urged,him,up,the,gangway,[END]
the,bent-backed,man,was,waiting,for,them,on,deck,[END]
wet,enough,for,you,ser,[END]
he,asked,smiling,[END]
the,hound's,mouth,gave,a,twitch,[END]
i,need,your,boat,not,your,bloody,wit,[END]
he,dismounted,and,pulled,arya,down,beside,him,[END]
one,of,the,boatmen,reached,for,stranger's,bridle,[END]
i,wouldn't,clegane,said,as,the,horse,kicked,[END]
the,man,leapt,back,slipped,on,the,rain-slick,deck,and,crashed,onto,his,arse,cursing,[END]
the,ferryman,with,the,bent,back,wasn't,smiling,any,longer,[END]
we,can,get,you,across,he,said,sourly,[END]
it,will,cost,you,a,gold,piece,[END]
another,for,the,horse,[END]
a,third,for,the,boy,[END]
three,dragons,[END]
clegane,gave,a,bark,of,laughter,[END]
for,three,dragons,i,should,own,the,bloody,ferry,[END]
last,year,might,be,you,could,[END]
but,with,this,river,i'll,need,extra,hands,on,the,poles,and,oars,just,to,see,we,don't,get,swept,a,hundred,miles,out,to,sea,[END]
here's,your,choice,[END]
three,dragons,or,you,teach,that,hellhorse,how,to,walk,on,water,[END]
i,like,an,honest,brigand,[END]
have,it,your,way,[END]
three,dragons,[END]
when,you,put,us,ashore,safe,on,the,north,bank,[END]
i'll,have,them,now,or,we,don't,go,[END]
the,man,thrust,out,a,thick,callused,hand,palm,up,[END]
clegane,rattled,his,longsword,to,loosen,the,blade,in,the,scabbard,[END]
here's,your,choice,[END]
gold,on,the,north,bank,or,steel,on,the,south,[END]
the,ferryman,looked,up,at,the,hound's,face,[END]
arya,could,tell,that,he,didn't,like,what,he,saw,there,[END]
he,had,a,dozen,men,behind,him,strong,men,with,oars,and,hardwood,poles,in,their,hands,but,none,of,them,were,rushing,forward,to,help,him,[END]
together,they,could,overwhelm,sandor,clegane,though,he'd,likely,kill,three,or,four,of,them,before,they,took,him,down,[END]
how,do,i,know,you're,good,for,it,[END]
the,bent-backed,man,asked,after,a,moment,[END]
he's,not,she,wanted,to,shout,[END]
instead,she,bit,her,lip,[END]
knight's,honor,the,hound,said,unsmiling,[END]
he's,not,even,a,knight,[END]
she,did,not,say,that,either,[END]
that,will,do,[END]
the,ferryman,spat,[END]
come,on,then,we,can,have,you,across,before,dark,[END]
tie,the,horse,up,i,don't,want,him,spooking,when,we're,under,way,[END]
there's,a,brazier,in,the,cabin,if,you,and,your,son,want,to,get,warm,[END]
i'm,not,his,stupid,son,[END]
said,arya,furiously,[END]
that,was,even,worse,than,being,taken,for,a,boy,[END]
she,was,so,angry,that,she,might,have,told,them,who,she,really,was,only,sandor,clegane,grabbed,her,by,the,back,of,the,collar,and,hoisted,her,one-handed,off,the,deck,[END]
how,many,times,do,i,need,to,tell,you,to,shut,your,bloody,mouth,[END]
he,shook,her,so,hard,her,teeth,rattled,then,let,her,fall,[END]
get,in,there,and,get,dry,like,the,man,said,[END]

the,big,iron,brazier,was,glowing,red,filling,the,room,with,a,sullen,suffocating,heat,[END]
it,felt,pleasant,to,stand,beside,it,to,warm,her,hands,and,dry,off,a,little,bit,but,as,soon,as,she,felt,the,deck,move,under,her,feet,she,slipped,back,out,through,the,forward,door,[END]
the,two-headed,horse,eased,slowly,through,the,shallows,picking,its,way,between,the,chimneys,and,rooftops,of,drowned,harroway,[END]
a,dozen,men,labored,at,the,oars,while,four,more,used,the,long,poles,to,push,off,whenever,they,came,too,close,to,a,rock,a,tree,or,a,sunken,house,[END]
the,bent-backed,man,had,the,rudder,[END]
rain,pattered,against,the,smooth,planks,of,the,deck,and,splashed,off,the,tall,carved,horseheads,fore,and,aft,[END]
arya,was,getting,soaked,again,but,she,didn't,care,[END]
she,wanted,to,see,[END]
the,man,with,the,crossbow,still,stood,in,the,window,of,the,roundtower,she,saw,[END]
his,eyes,followed,her,as,the,ferry,slid,by,underneath,[END]
she,wondered,if,he,was,this,lord,roote,that,the,hound,had,mentioned,[END]
he,doesn't,look,much,like,a,lord,[END]
but,then,she,didn't,look,much,like,a,lady,either,[END]
once,they,were,beyond,the,town,and,out,in,the,river,proper,the,current,grew,much,stronger,[END]
through,the,grey,haze,of,rain,arya,could,make,out,a,tall,stone,pillar,on,the,far,shore,that,surely,marked,the,ferry,landing,but,no,sooner,had,she,seen,it,than,she,realized,that,they,were,being,pushed,away,from,it,downstream,[END]
the,oarsmen,were,rowing,more,vigorously,now,fighting,the,rage,of,the,river,[END]
leaves,and,broken,branches,swirled,past,as,fast,as,if,they'd,been,fired,from,a,scorpion,[END]
the,men,with,the,poles,leaned,out,and,shoved,away,anything,that,came,too,close,[END]
it,was,windier,out,here,too,[END]
whenever,she,turned,to,look,upstream,arya,got,a,face,full,of,blowing,rain,[END]
stranger,was,screaming,and,kicking,as,the,deck,moved,underfoot,[END]
if,i,jumped,over,the,side,the,river,would,wash,me,away,before,the,hound,even,knew,that,i,was,gone,[END]
she,looked,back,over,a,shoulder,and,saw,sandor,clegane,struggling,with,his,frightened,horse,trying,to,calm,him,[END]
she,would,never,have,a,better,chance,to,get,away,from,him,[END]
i,might,drown,though,[END]

still,drowning,might,be,better,than,king's,landing,[END]
she,thought,about,joffrey,and,crept,up,to,the,prow,[END]
the,river,was,murky,brown,with,mud,and,lashed,by,rain,looking,more,like,soup,than,water,[END]
arya,wondered,how,cold,it,would,be,[END]
i,couldn't,get,much,wetter,than,i,am,now,[END]
she,put,a,hand,on,the,rail,[END]
but,a,sudden,shout,snapped,her,head,about,before,she,could,leap,[END]
the,ferrymen,were,rushing,forward,poles,in,hand,[END]
for,a,moment,she,did,not,understand,what,was,happening,[END]
then,she,saw,it,an,uprooted,tree,huge,and,dark,coming,straight,at,them,[END]
a,tangle,of,roots,and,limbs,poked,up,out,of,the,water,as,it,came,like,the,reaching,arms,of,a,great,kraken,[END]
the,oarsmen,were,backing,water,frantically,trying,to,avoid,a,collision,that,could,capsize,them,or,stove,their,hull,in,[END]
the,old,man,had,wrenched,the,rudder,about,and,the,horse,at,the,prow,was,swinging,downstream,but,too,slowly,[END]
glistening,brown,and,black,the,tree,rushed,toward,them,like,a,battering,ram,[END]
it,could,not,have,been,more,than,ten,feet,from,their,prow,when,two,of,the,boatmen,somehow,caught,it,with,their,long,poles,[END]
one,snapped,and,the,long,splintering,craaaack,made,it,sound,as,if,the,ferry,were,breaking,up,beneath,them,[END]
but,the,second,man,managed,to,give,the,trunk,a,hard,shove,just,enough,to,deflect,it,away,from,them,[END]
the,tree,swept,past,the,ferry,with,inches,to,spare,its,branches,scrabbling,like,claws,against,the,horsehead,[END]
only,just,when,it,seemed,as,if,they,were,clear,one,of,the,monster's,upper,limbs,dealt,them,a,glancing,thump,[END]
the,ferry,seemed,to,shudder,and,arya,slipped,landing,painfully,on,one,knee,[END]
the,man,with,the,broken,pole,was,not,so,lucky,[END]
she,heard,him,shout,as,he,stumbled,over,the,side,[END]
then,the,raging,brown,water,closed,over,him,and,he,was,gone,in,the,time,it,took,arya,to,climb,back,to,her,feet,[END]
one,of,the,other,boatmen,snatched,up,a,coil,of,rope,but,there,was,no,one,to,throw,it,to,[END]
maybe,he'll,wash,up,someplace,downstream,arya,tried,to,tell,herself,but,the,thought,had,a,hollow,ring,[END]
she,had,lost,all,desire,to,go,swimming,[END]
when,sandor,clegane,shouted,at,her,to,get,back,inside,before,he,beat,her,bloody,she,went,meekly,[END]
the,ferry,was,fighting,to,turn,back,on,course,by,then,against,a,river,that,wanted,nothing,more,than,to,carry,it,down,to,the,sea,[END]
when,they,finally,came,ashore,it,was,a,good,two,miles,downriver,of,their,usual,landing,[END]
the,boat,slammed,into,the,bank,so,hard,that,another,pole,snapped,and,arya,almost,lost,her,feet,again,[END]
sandor,clegane,lifted,her,onto,stranger's,back,as,if,she,weighed,no,more,than,a,doll,[END]
the,boatmen,stared,at,them,with,dull,exhausted,eyes,all,but,the,bent-backed,man,who,held,his,hand,out,[END]
six,dragons,he,demanded,[END]
three,for,the,passage,and,three,for,the,man,i,lost,[END]

now,we,should,be,safe,she,thought,[END]
knowing,how,petty,the,old,man,could,be,she,had,expected,their,rooms,to,be,bleak,and,cheerless,[END]
but,the,freys,had,made,more,than,ample,provision,for,them,it,seemed,[END]
the,bridal,chamber,was,large,and,richly,appointed,dominated,by,a,great,featherbed,with,corner,posts,carved,in,the,likeness,of,castle,towers,[END]

sweet-smelling,carpets,covered,a,plank,floor,and,a,tall,shuttered,window,opened,to,the,south,[END]
catelyn's,own,room,was,smaller,but,handsomely,furnished,and,comfortable,with,a,fire,burning,in,the,hearth,[END]
lame,lothar,assured,them,that,robb,would,have,an,entire,suite,as,befit,a,king,[END]
if,there,is,anything,you,require,you,need,only,tell,one,of,the,guards,[END]

a,few,more,days,and,robb,will,be,off,to,battle,and,me,to,a,comfortable,captivity,at,seagard,[END]

he,looked,perplexed,[END]
why,would,the,old,weasel,refuse,to,let,me,choose,unless,he,meant,to,foist,off,someone,hideous,[END]
your,fondness,for,a,pretty,face,is,well,known,catelyn,reminded,him,[END]
perhaps,lord,walder,actually,wants,you,to,be,happy,with,your,bride,[END]
or,more,like,he,did,not,want,you,balking,over,a,boil,and,upsetting,all,his,plans,[END]
or,it,may,be,that,roslin,is,the,old,man's,favorite,[END]
the,lord,of,riverrun,is,a,much,better,match,than,most,of,his,daughters,can,hope,for,[END]
true,[END]
her,brother,still,seemed,uncertain,however,[END]
is,it,possible,the,girl,is,barren,[END]

there,are,illnesses,a,girl,can,have,in,childhood,that,leave,her,unable,to,conceive,[END]

edmure,laughed,[END]
a,few,barbed,words,and,some,unseemly,gloating,[END]
from,him,that's,courtesy,[END]

i,may,nap,an,hour,[END]
she,retreated,to,her,own,room,[END]
the,chest,of,clothes,she'd,brought,from,riverrun,had,been,carried,up,and,laid,at,the,foot,of,the,bed,[END]
after,she'd,undressed,and,hung,her,wet,clothing,by,the,fire,she,donned,a,warm,wool,dress,of,tully,red,and,blue,washed,and,brushed,her,hair,and,let,it,dry,and,went,in,search,of,freys,[END]

i,shall,give,him,your,regards,[END]
i,know,he,will,regret,having,missed,you,[END]
surely,he,will,return,in,time,for,lady,roslin's,wedding,[END]
he,had,hoped,to,said,lame,lothar,but,with,this,rain,[END]
you,saw,how,the,rivers,ran,my,lady,[END]
i,did,indeed,said,catelyn,[END]
i,wonder,if,you,would,be,so,good,as,to,direct,me,to,your,maester,[END]
are,you,unwell,my,lady,[END]
asked,ser,hosteen,a,powerful,man,with,a,square,strong,jaw,[END]
a,woman's,complaint,[END]
nothing,to,concern,you,ser,[END]
lothar,ever,gracious,escorted,her,from,the,hall,up,some,steps,and,across,a,covered,bridge,to,another,stair,[END]
you,should,find,maester,brenett,in,the,turret,on,the,top,my,lady,[END]
catelyn,half,expected,that,the,maester,would,be,yet,another,son,of,walder,frey's,but,brenett,did,not,have,the,look,[END]
he,was,a,great,fat,man,bald,and,double-chinned,and,none,too,clean,to,judge,from,the,raven,droppings,that,stained,the,sleeves,of,his,robes,yet,he,seemed,amiable,enough,[END]
when,she,told,him,of,edmure's,concerns,about,lady,roslin's,fertility,he,chuckled,[END]
your,lord,brother,need,have,no,fear,lady,catelyn,[END]
she's,small,i'll,grant,you,and,narrow,in,the,hips,but,her,mother,was,the,same,and,lady,bethany,gave,lord,walder,a,child,every,year,[END]
how,many,lived,past,infancy,[END]
she,asked,bluntly,[END]
five,[END]
he,ticked,them,off,on,fingers,plump,as,sausages,[END]
ser,perwyn,[END]
ser,benfrey,[END]
maester,willamen,who,took,his,vows,last,year,and,now,serves,lord,hunter,in,the,vale,[END]
olyvar,who,squired,for,your,son,[END]
and,lady,roslin,the,youngest,[END]
four,boys,to,one,girl,[END]
lord,edmure,will,have,more,sons,than,he,knows,what,to,do,with,[END]
i,am,sure,that,will,please,him,[END]
so,the,girl,was,like,to,be,fertile,as,well,as,fair,of,face,[END]
that,should,put,edmure's,mind,at,ease,[END]
lord,walder,had,left,her,brother,no,cause,for,complaint,so,far,as,she,could,see,[END]
catelyn,did,not,return,to,her,own,room,after,leaving,the,maester,instead,she,went,to,robb,[END]
she,found,robin,flint,and,ser,wendel,manderly,with,him,along,with,the,greatjon,and,his,son,who,was,still,called,the,smalljon,though,he,threatened,to,overtop,his,father,[END]
they,were,all,damp,[END]
another,man,still,wetter,stood,before,the,fire,in,a,pale,pink,cloak,trimmed,with,white,fur,[END]
lord,bolton,she,said,[END]
lady,catelyn,he,replied,his,voice,faint,it,is,a,pleasure,to,look,on,you,again,even,in,such,trying,times,[END]
you,are,kind,to,say,so,[END]
catelyn,could,feel,gloom,in,the,room,[END]
even,the,greatjon,seemed,somber,and,subdued,[END]
she,looked,at,their,grim,faces,and,said,what's,happened,[END]
lannisters,on,the,trident,said,ser,wendel,unhappily,[END]
my,brother,is,taken,again,[END]
and,lord,bolton,has,brought,us,further,word,of,winterfell,robb,added,[END]
ser,rodrik,was,not,the,only,good,man,to,die,[END]
cley,cerwyn,and,leobald,tallhart,were,slain,as,well,[END]

all,dead,and,winterfell,gone,[END]
bolton's,pale,eyes,met,her,own,[END]
the,ironmen,burned,both,castle,and,winter,town,[END]
some,of,your,people,were,taken,back,to,the,dreadfort,by,my,son,ramsay,[END]
your,bastard,was,accused,of,grievous,crimes,catelyn,reminded,him,sharply,[END]
of,murder,rape,and,worse,[END]
yes,roose,bolton,said,[END]
his,blood,is,tainted,that,cannot,be,denied,[END]
yet,he,is,a,good,fighter,as,cunning,as,he,is,fearless,[END]
when,the,ironmen,cut,down,ser,rodrik,and,leobald,tallhart,soon,after,it,fell,to,ramsay,to,lead,the,battle,and,he,did,[END]
he,swears,that,he,shall,not,sheathe,his,sword,so,long,as,a,single,greyjoy,remains,in,the,north,[END]
perhaps,such,service,might,atone,in,some,small,measure,for,whatever,crimes,his,bastard,blood,has,led,him,to,commit,[END]
he,shrugged,[END]
or,not,[END]
when,the,war,is,done,his,grace,must,weigh,and,judge,[END]
by,then,i,hope,to,have,a,trueborn,son,by,lady,walda,[END]
this,is,a,cold,man,catelyn,realized,not,for,the,first,time,[END]
did,ramsay,mention,theon,greyjoy,[END]
robb,demanded,[END]
was,he,slain,as,well,or,did,he,flee,[END]
roose,bolton,removed,a,ragged,strip,of,leather,from,the,pouch,at,his,belt,[END]
my,son,sent,this,with,his,letter,[END]

i,want,his,head,not,his,skin,[END]
he,is,balon,greyjoy's,only,living,son,lord,bolton,said,softly,as,if,they,had,forgotten,and,now,rightful,king,of,the,iron,islands,[END]
a,captive,king,has,great,value,as,a,hostage,[END]
hostage,[END]
the,word,raised,catelyn's,hackles,[END]

very,well,[END]
keep,him,alive,then,[END]
for,the,present,[END]
hold,him,secure,at,the,dreadfort,till,we've,retaken,the,north,[END]
catelyn,turned,back,to,roose,bolton,[END]
ser,wendel,said,something,of,lannisters,on,the,trident,[END]
he,did,my,lady,[END]
i,blame,myself,[END]
i,delayed,too,long,before,leaving,harrenhal,[END]
aenys,frey,departed,several,days,before,me,and,crossed,the,trident,at,the,ruby,ford,though,not,without,difficulty,[END]
but,by,the,time,we,came,up,the,river,was,a,torrent,[END]
i,had,no,choice,but,to,ferry,my,men,across,in,small,boats,of,which,we,had,too,few,[END]
two-thirds,of,my,strength,was,on,the,north,side,when,the,lannisters,attacked,those,still,waiting,to,cross,[END]
norrey,locke,and,burley,men,chiefly,with,ser,wylis,manderly,and,his,white,harbor,knights,as,rear,guard,[END]
i,was,on,the,wrong,side,of,the,trident,powerless,to,help,them,[END]
ser,wylis,rallied,our,men,as,best,he,could,but,gregor,clegane,attacked,with,heavy,horse,and,drove,them,into,the,river,[END]
as,many,drowned,as,were,cut,down,[END]
more,fled,and,the,rest,were,taken,captive,[END]
gregor,clegane,was,always,ill,news,catelyn,reflected,[END]

or,was,the,mountain,coming,here,[END]

clegane,cracked,his,whip,at,the,team,a,pair,of,old,drays,that,had,known,better,days,[END]
the,wayn,was,creaking,and,swaying,its,two,huge,wooden,wheels,squeezing,mud,up,out,of,the,deep,ruts,in,the,road,with,every,turn,[END]
stranger,followed,tied,to,the,wagon,[END]
the,big,bad-tempered,courser,wore,neither,armor,barding,nor,harness,and,the,hound,himself,was,garbed,in,splotchy,green,roughspun,and,a,soot-grey,mantle,with,a,hood,that,swallowed,his,head,[END]
so,long,as,he,kept,his,eyes,down,you,could,not,see,his,face,only,the,whites,of,his,eyes,peering,out,[END]
he,looked,like,some,down-at-heels,farmer,[END]
a,big,farmer,though,[END]

the,riders,split,and,circled,them,for,a,look,before,they,came,up,close,[END]

the,badges,on,their,jerkins,were,smaller,versions,of,the,sigil,sewn,on,their,master's,surcoat,a,black,pitchfork,on,a,golden,bar,sinister,upon,a,russet,field,[END]
arya,had,thought,of,revealing,herself,to,the,first,outriders,they,encountered,but,she,had,always,pictured,grey-cloaked,men,with,the,direwolf,on,their,breasts,[END]
she,might,have,risked,it,even,if,they'd,worn,the,umber,giant,or,the,glover,fist,but,she,did,not,know,this,pitchfork,knight,or,whom,he,served,[END]
the,closest,thing,to,a,pitchfork,she,had,ever,seen,at,winterfell,was,the,trident,in,the,hand,of,lord,manderly's,merman,[END]

sandor,clegane's,burns,would,not,be,easy,to,forget,once,you,saw,them,[END]
he,couldn't,hide,the,scars,behind,a,helm,either,not,so,long,as,the,helm,was,made,in,the,shape,of,a,snarling,dog,[END]
that,was,why,they'd,needed,the,wayn,and,the,pickled,pigs',feet,[END]
i'm,not,going,to,be,dragged,before,your,brother,in,chains,the,hound,had,told,her,and,i'd,just,as,soon,not,have,to,cut,through,his,men,to,get,to,him,[END]
so,we,play,a,little,game,[END]
a,farmer,chance-met,on,the,kingsroad,had,provided,them,with,wayn,horses,garb,and,casks,though,not,willingly,[END]
the,hound,had,taken,them,at,swordpoint,[END]

if,anything,it,had,only,gotten,stronger,[END]
fear,cuts,deeper,than,swords,[END]
she,had,to,be,strong,now,the,way,her,father,told,her,[END]
there,was,nothing,between,her,and,her,mother,but,a,castle,gate,a,river,and,an,army,[END]
but,it,was,robb's,army,so,there,was,no,real,danger,there,[END]
was,there,[END]
roose,bolton,was,one,of,them,though,[END]
the,leech,lord,as,the,outlaws,called,him,[END]
that,made,her,uneasy,[END]
she,had,fled,harrenhal,to,get,away,from,bolton,as,much,as,from,the,bloody,mummers,and,she'd,had,to,cut,the,throat,of,one,of,his,guards,to,escape,[END]

what,would,he,do,if,he,saw,her,[END]
he,probably,won't,even,know,me,[END]
she,looked,more,like,a,drowned,rat,than,a,lord's,cupbearer,these,days,[END]
a,drowned,boy,rat,[END]
the,hound,had,hacked,handfuls,of,her,hair,off,only,two,days,past,[END]

the,road,had,been,running,mostly,northwest,but,now,it,turned,due,west,between,an,apple,orchard,and,a,field,of,drowned,corn,beaten,down,by,the,rain,[END]
they,passed,the,last,of,the,apple,trees,and,crested,a,rise,and,the,castles,river,and,camps,all,appeared,at,once,[END]
there,were,hundreds,of,horses,and,thousands,of,men,most,of,them,milling,about,the,three,huge,feast,tents,that,stood,side,by,side,facing,the,castle,gates,like,three,great,canvas,longhalls,[END]
robb,had,made,his,camp,well,back,from,the,walls,on,higher,drier,ground,but,the,green,fork,had,overflown,its,bank,and,even,claimed,a,few,carelessly,placed,tents,[END]
the,music,from,the,castles,was,louder,here,[END]
the,sound,of,the,drums,and,horns,rolled,across,the,camp,[END]
the,musicians,in,the,nearer,castle,were,playing,a,different,song,than,the,ones,in,the,castle,on,the,far,bank,though,so,it,sounded,more,like,a,battle,than,a,song,[END]
they're,not,very,good,arya,observed,[END]

the,rain,had,dwindled,down,to,a,fine,drizzle,almost,a,mist,but,an,earlier,downpour,had,left,the,banners,wet,as,dishrags,sodden,and,unreadable,[END]
a,hedge,of,wagons,and,carts,had,been,drawn,up,along,the,perimeter,to,make,a,crude,wooden,wall,against,any,attack,[END]

the,hound's,whip,spurred,the,team,toward,the,tents,[END]
no,one,seemed,to,pay,them,any,mind,[END]
they,splashed,past,rows,of,brightly,colored,pavilions,their,walls,of,wet,silk,lit,up,like,magic,lanterns,by,lamps,and,braziers,inside,pink,and,gold,and,green,they,glimmered,striped,and,fretty,and,chequy,emblazoned,with,birds,and,beasts,chevrons,and,stars,wheels,and,weapons,[END]

there,were,barracks,tents,too,big,enough,to,shelter,two,score,footsoldiers,though,even,those,were,dwarfed,by,the,three,great,feast,tents,[END]
the,drinking,had,been,going,on,for,hours,it,seemed,[END]

the,music,grew,still,louder,as,they,approached,the,castle,but,under,that,was,a,deeper,darker,sound,the,river,the,swollen,green,fork,growling,like,a,lion,in,its,den,[END]
arya,twisted,and,turned,trying,to,look,everywhere,at,once,hoping,for,a,glimpse,of,a,direwolf,badge,for,a,tent,done,up,in,grey,and,white,for,a,face,she,knew,from,winterfell,[END]
all,she,saw,were,strangers,[END]
she,stared,at,a,man,relieving,himself,in,the,reeds,but,he,wasn't,alebelly,[END]
she,saw,a,half-dressed,girl,burst,from,a,tent,laughing,but,the,tent,was,pale,blue,not,grey,like,she'd,thought,at,first,and,the,man,who,went,running,after,her,wore,a,treecat,on,his,doublet,not,a,wolf,[END]
beneath,a,tree,four,archers,were,slipping,waxed,strings,over,the,notches,of,their,longbows,but,they,were,not,her,father's,archers,[END]

arya,gazed,up,at,the,twins,their,high,tower,windows,glowing,softly,wherever,a,light,was,burning,[END]
through,the,haze,of,rain,the,castles,looked,spooky,and,mysterious,like,something,from,one,of,old,nan's,tales,but,they,weren't,winterfell,[END]
the,press,was,thickest,at,the,feast,tents,[END]
the,wide,flaps,were,tied,back,and,men,were,pushing,in,and,out,with,drinking,horns,and,tankards,in,their,hands,some,with,camp,followers,[END]
arya,glanced,inside,as,the,hound,drove,past,the,first,of,the,three,and,saw,hundreds,of,men,crowding,the,benches,and,jostling,around,the,casks,of,mead,and,ale,and,wine,[END]
there,was,hardly,room,to,move,inside,but,none,of,them,seemed,to,mind,[END]

they,all,drank,and,someone,yelled,here's,to,the,young,wolf,and,queen,jeyne,[END]
who,is,queen,jeyne,[END]
arya,wondered,briefly,[END]
the,only,queen,she,knew,was,cersei,[END]
firepits,had,been,dug,outside,the,feast,tents,sheltered,beneath,rude,canopies,of,woven,wood,and,hides,that,kept,the,rain,out,so,long,as,it,fell,straight,down,[END]
the,wind,was,blowing,off,the,river,though,so,the,drizzle,came,in,anyway,enough,to,make,the,fires,hiss,and,swirl,[END]

the,smells,made,arya's,mouth,water,[END]

catelyn,[END]
the,drums,were,pounding,pounding,pounding,and,her,head,with,them,[END]
pipes,wailed,and,flutes,trilled,from,the,musicians',gallery,at,the,foot,of,the,hall,fiddles,screeched,horns,blew,the,skins,skirled,a,lively,tune,but,the,drumming,drove,them,all,[END]
the,sounds,echoed,off,the,rafters,whilst,the,guests,ate,drank,and,shouted,at,one,another,below,[END]
walder,frey,must,be,deaf,as,a,stone,to,call,this,music,[END]
catelyn,sipped,a,cup,of,wine,and,watched,jinglebell,prance,to,the,sounds,of,alysanne,[END]
at,least,she,thought,it,was,meant,to,be,alysanne,[END]
with,these,players,it,might,as,easily,have,been,the,bear,and,the,maiden,fair,[END]
outside,the,rain,still,fell,but,within,the,twins,the,air,was,thick,and,hot,[END]
a,fire,roared,in,the,hearth,and,rows,of,torches,burned,smokily,from,iron,sconces,on,the,walls,[END]
yet,most,of,the,heat,came,off,the,bodies,of,the,wedding,guests,jammed,in,so,thick,along,the,benches,that,every,man,who,tried,to,lift,his,cup,poked,his,neighbor,in,the,ribs,[END]
even,on,the,dais,they,were,closer,than,catelyn,would,have,liked,[END]
she,had,been,placed,between,ser,ryman,frey,and,roose,bolton,and,had,gotten,a,good,noseful,of,both,[END]
ser,ryman,drank,as,if,westeros,was,about,to,run,short,of,wine,and,sweated,it,all,out,under,his,arms,[END]
he,had,bathed,in,lemonwater,she,judged,but,no,lemon,could,mask,so,much,sour,sweat,[END]
roose,bolton,had,a,sweeter,smell,to,him,yet,no,more,pleasant,[END]
he,sipped,hippocras,in,preference,to,wine,or,mead,and,ate,but,little,[END]
catelyn,could,not,fault,him,for,his,lack,of,appetite,[END]
the,wedding,feast,began,with,a,thin,leek,soup,followed,by,a,salad,of,green,beans,onions,and,beets,river,pike,poached,in,almond,milk,mounds,of,mashed,turnips,that,were,cold,before,they,reached,the,table,jellied,calves',brains,and,a,leche,of,stringy,beef,[END]
it,was,poor,fare,to,set,before,a,king,and,the,calves',brains,turned,catelyn's,stomach,[END]
yet,robb,ate,it,uncomplaining,and,her,brother,was,too,caught,up,with,his,bride,to,pay,much,attention,[END]
you,would,never,guess,edmure,complained,of,roslin,all,the,way,from,riverrun,to,the,twins,[END]
husband,and,wife,ate,from,a,single,plate,drank,from,a,single,cup,and,exchanged,chaste,kisses,between,sips,[END]
most,of,the,dishes,edmure,waved,away,[END]
she,could,not,blame,him,for,that,[END]
she,remembered,little,of,the,food,served,at,her,own,wedding,feast,[END]
did,i,even,taste,it,[END]
or,spend,the,whole,time,gazing,at,ned's,face,wondering,who,he,was,[END]
poor,roslin's,smile,had,a,fixed,quality,to,it,as,if,someone,had,sewn,it,onto,her,face,[END]
well,she,is,a,maid,wedded,but,the,bedding's,yet,to,come,[END]
no,doubt,she's,as,terrified,as,i,was,[END]
robb,was,seated,between,alyx,frey,and,fair,walda,two,of,the,more,nubile,frey,maidens,[END]
at,the,wedding,feast,i,hope,you,will,not,refuse,to,dance,with,my,daughters,walder,frey,had,said,[END]
it,would,please,an,old,man's,heart,[END]
his,heart,should,be,well,pleased,then,robb,had,done,his,duty,like,a,king,[END]
he,had,danced,with,each,of,the,girls,with,edmure's,bride,and,the,eighth,lady,frey,with,the,widow,ami,and,roose,bolton's,wife,fat,walda,with,the,pimply,twins,serra,and,sarra,even,with,shirei,lord,walder's,youngest,who,must,have,been,all,of,six,[END]
catelyn,wondered,whether,the,lord,of,the,crossing,would,be,satisfied,or,if,he,would,find,cause,for,complaint,in,all,the,other,daughters,and,granddaughters,who,had,not,had,a,turn,with,the,king,[END]
your,sisters,dance,very,well,she,said,to,ser,ryman,frey,trying,to,be,pleasant,[END]
they're,aunts,and,cousins,[END]
ser,ryman,drank,a,swallow,of,wine,the,sweat,trickling,down,his,cheek,into,his,beard,[END]
a,sour,man,and,in,his,cups,catelyn,thought,[END]
the,late,lord,frey,might,be,niggardly,when,it,came,to,feeding,his,guests,but,he,did,not,stint,on,the,drink,[END]
the,ale,wine,and,mead,were,flowing,as,fast,as,the,river,outside,[END]
the,greatjon,was,already,roaring,drunk,[END]
lord,walder's,son,merrett,was,matching,him,cup,for,cup,but,ser,whalen,frey,had,passed,out,trying,to,keep,up,with,the,two,of,them,[END]
catelyn,would,sooner,lord,umber,had,seen,fit,to,stay,sober,but,telling,the,greatjon,not,to,drink,was,like,telling,him,not,to,breathe,for,a,few,hours,[END]
smalljon,umber,and,robin,flint,sat,near,robb,to,the,other,side,of,fair,walda,and,alyx,respectively,[END]
neither,of,them,was,drinking,along,with,patrek,mallister,and,dacey,mormont,they,were,her,son's,guards,this,evening,[END]
a,wedding,feast,was,not,a,battle,but,there,were,always,dangers,when,men,were,in,their,cups,and,a,king,should,never,be,unguarded,[END]
catelyn,was,glad,of,that,and,even,more,glad,of,the,swordbelts,hanging,on,pegs,along,the,walls,[END]
no,man,needs,a,longsword,to,deal,with,jellied,calves',brains,[END]
everyone,thought,my,lord,would,choose,fair,walda,lady,walda,bolton,told,ser,wendel,shouting,to,be,heard,above,the,music,[END]
fat,walda,was,a,round,pink,butterball,of,a,girl,with,watery,blue,eyes,limp,yellow,hair,and,a,huge,bosom,yet,her,voice,was,a,fluttering,squeak,[END]
it,was,hard,to,picture,her,in,the,dreadfort,in,her,pink,lace,and,cape,of,vair,[END]
my,lord,grandfather,offered,roose,his,bride's,weight,in,silver,as,a,dowry,though,so,my,lord,of,bolton,picked,me,[END]
the,girl's,chins,jiggled,when,she,laughed,[END]
i,weigh,six,stone,more,than,fair,walda,but,that,was,the,first,time,i,was,glad,of,it,[END]
i'm,lady,bolton,now,and,my,cousin's,still,a,maid,and,she'll,be,nineteen,soon,poor,thing,[END]
the,lord,of,the,dreadfort,paid,the,chatter,no,mind,catelyn,saw,[END]
sometimes,he,tasted,a,bite,of,this,a,spoon,of,that,tearing,bread,from,the,loaf,with,short,strong,fingers,but,the,meal,could,not,distract,him,[END]
bolton,had,made,a,toast,to,lord,walder's,grandsons,when,the,wedding,feast,began,pointedly,mentioning,that,walder,and,walder,were,in,the,care,of,his,bastard,son,[END]
from,the,way,the,old,man,had,squinted,at,him,his,mouth,sucking,at,the,air,catelyn,knew,he,had,heard,the,unspoken,threat,[END]
was,there,ever,a,wedding,less,joyful,[END]
she,wondered,until,she,remembered,her,poor,sansa,and,her,marriage,to,the,imp,[END]
mother,take,mercy,on,her,[END]
she,has,a,gentle,soul,[END]
the,heat,and,smoke,and,noise,were,making,her,sick,[END]
the,musicians,in,the,gallery,might,be,numerous,and,loud,but,they,were,not,especially,gifted,[END]
catelyn,took,another,swallow,of,wine,and,allowed,a,page,to,refill,her,cup,[END]
a,few,more,hours,and,the,worst,will,be,over,[END]
by,this,hour,tomorrow,robb,would,be,off,to,another,battle,this,time,with,the,ironmen,at,moat,cailin,[END]
strange,how,that,prospect,seemed,almost,a,relief,[END]
he,will,win,his,battle,[END]
he,wins,all,his,battles,and,the,ironborn,are,without,a,king,[END]
besides,ned,taught,him,well,[END]
the,drums,were,pounding,[END]
jinglebell,hopped,past,her,once,again,but,the,music,was,so,loud,she,could,scarcely,hear,his,bells,[END]
above,the,din,came,a,sudden,snarling,as,two,dogs,fell,upon,each,other,over,a,scrap,of,meat,[END]
they,rolled,across,the,floor,snapping,and,biting,as,a,howl,of,mirth,went,up,[END]
someone,doused,them,with,a,flagon,of,ale,and,they,broke,apart,[END]
one,limped,toward,the,dais,[END]
lord,walder's,toothless,mouth,opened,in,a,bark,of,laughter,as,the,dripping,wet,dog,shook,ale,and,hair,all,over,three,of,his,grandsons,[END]
the,sight,of,the,dogs,made,catelyn,wish,once,more,for,grey,wind,but,robb's,direwolf,was,nowhere,to,be,seen,[END]

the,light,shone,dully,against,the,wet,mail,and,helms,[END]
more,torches,were,moving,on,the,dark,stone,bridge,that,joined,the,twins,a,column,of,them,streaming,from,the,west,bank,to,the,east,[END]

the,portcullis,was,being,drawn,upward,even,as,she,watched,and,the,drawbridge,had,already,been,lowered,to,span,the,swollen,moat,[END]

the,hound,reined,up,so,suddenly,that,she,almost,fell,off,the,wayn,[END]
seven,bloody,buggering,hells,arya,heard,him,curse,as,their,left,wheel,began,to,sink,in,soft,mud,[END]
the,wayn,tilted,slowly,[END]

she,screamed,[END]
the,hound,had,leapt,down,as,well,[END]
he,tore,the,seat,off,the,front,of,the,wayn,and,reached,in,for,the,swordbelt,he'd,hidden,beneath,it,[END]
it,was,only,then,that,she,heard,the,riders,pouring,out,the,castle,gate,in,a,river,of,steel,and,fire,the,thunder,of,their,destriers,crossing,the,drawbridge,almost,lost,beneath,the,drumming,from,the,castles,[END]

somewhere,far,off,she,heard,a,wolf,howling,[END]
it,wasn't,very,loud,compared,to,the,camp,noise,and,the,music,and,the,low,ominous,growl,of,the,river,running,wild,but,she,heard,it,all,the,same,[END]
only,maybe,it,wasn't,her,ears,that,heard,it,[END]
the,sound,shivered,through,arya,like,a,knife,sharp,with,rage,and,grief,[END]
more,and,more,riders,were,emerging,from,the,castle,a,column,four,wide,with,no,end,to,it,knights,and,squires,and,freeriders,torches,and,longaxes,[END]
and,there,was,noise,coming,from,behind,as,well,[END]
when,arya,looked,around,she,saw,that,there,were,only,two,of,the,huge,feast,tents,where,once,there,had,been,three,[END]
the,one,in,the,middle,had,collapsed,[END]
for,a,moment,she,did,not,understand,what,she,was,seeing,[END]
then,the,flames,went,licking,up,from,the,fallen,tent,and,now,the,other,two,were,collapsing,heavy,oiled,cloth,settling,down,on,the,men,beneath,[END]
a,flight,of,fire,arrows,streaked,through,the,air,[END]
the,second,tent,took,fire,and,then,the,third,[END]
the,screams,grew,so,loud,she,could,hear,words,through,the,music,[END]
dark,shapes,moved,in,front,of,the,flames,the,steel,of,their,armor,shining,orange,from,afar,[END]
a,battle,arya,knew,[END]
it's,a,battle,[END]
and,the,riders,[END]
she,had,no,more,time,to,watch,the,tents,then,[END]
with,the,river,overflowing,its,banks,the,dark,swirling,waters,at,the,end,of,the,drawbridge,reached,as,high,as,a,horse's,belly,but,the,riders,splashed,through,them,all,the,same,spurred,on,by,the,music,[END]
for,once,the,same,song,was,coming,from,both,castles,[END]
i,know,this,song,arya,realized,suddenly,[END]
tom,o',sevens,had,sung,it,for,them,that,rainy,night,the,outlaws,had,sheltered,in,the,brewhouse,with,the,brothers,[END]
and,who,are,you,the,proud,lord,said,that,i,must,bow,so,low,[END]
the,frey,riders,were,struggling,through,the,mud,and,reeds,but,some,of,them,had,seen,the,wayn,[END]
she,watched,as,three,riders,left,the,main,column,pounding,through,the,shallows,[END]
only,a,cat,of,a,different,coat,that's,all,the,truth,i,know,[END]
clegane,cut,stranger,loose,with,a,single,slash,of,his,sword,and,leapt,onto,his,back,[END]
the,courser,knew,what,was,wanted,of,him,[END]
he,pricked,up,his,ears,and,wheeled,toward,the,charging,destriers,[END]
in,a,coat,of,gold,or,a,coat,of,red,a,lion,still,has,claws,[END]

there,was,a,rock,in,her,hand,slimy,with,mud,and,she,didn't,even,remember,picking,it,up,[END]
who,do,i,throw,it,at,[END]
she,jumped,at,the,clash,of,metal,as,clegane,turned,aside,the,first,longaxe,[END]
while,he,was,engaged,with,the,first,man,the,second,circled,behind,him,and,aimed,a,blow,for,the,small,of,his,back,[END]
stranger,was,wheeling,so,the,hound,took,only,a,glancing,blow,enough,to,rip,a,great,gash,in,his,baggy,peasant's,blouse,and,expose,the,mail,below,[END]
he,is,one,against,three,[END]
arya,still,clutched,her,rock,[END]
they're,sure,to,kill,him,[END]
she,thought,of,mycah,the,butcher's,boy,who,had,been,her,friend,so,briefly,[END]
then,she,saw,the,third,rider,coming,her,way,[END]
arya,moved,behind,the,wayn,[END]
fear,cuts,deeper,than,swords,[END]
she,could,hear,drums,and,warhorns,and,pipes,stallions,trumpeting,the,shriek,of,steel,on,steel,but,all,the,sounds,seemed,so,far,away,[END]
there,was,only,the,oncoming,horseman,and,the,longaxe,in,his,hand,[END]
he,wore,a,surcoat,over,his,armor,and,she,saw,the,two,towers,that,marked,him,for,a,frey,[END]
she,did,not,understand,[END]
her,uncle,was,marrying,lord,frey's,daughter,the,freys,were,her,brother's,friends,[END]
don't,[END]
she,screamed,as,he,rode,around,the,wayn,but,he,paid,no,mind,[END]
when,he,charged,arya,threw,the,rock,the,way,she'd,once,thrown,a,crabapple,at,gendry,[END]
she'd,gotten,gendry,right,between,the,eyes,but,this,time,her,aim,was,off,and,the,stone,caromed,sideways,off,his,temple,[END]
it,was,enough,to,break,his,charge,but,no,more,[END]
she,retreated,darting,across,the,muddy,ground,on,the,balls,of,her,feet,putting,the,wayn,between,them,once,more,[END]
the,knight,followed,at,a,trot,only,darkness,behind,his,eyeslit,[END]
she,hadn't,even,dented,his,helm,[END]
they,went,round,once,twice,a,third,time,[END]
the,knight,cursed,her,[END]
you,can't,run,for,[END]
the,axehead,caught,him,square,in,the,back,of,the,head,crashing,through,his,helm,and,the,skull,beneath,and,sending,him,flying,face,first,from,his,saddle,[END]
behind,him,was,the,hound,still,mounted,on,stranger,[END]
how,did,you,get,an,axe,[END]
she,almost,asked,before,she,saw,[END]
one,of,the,other,freys,was,trapped,beneath,his,dying,horse,drowning,in,a,foot,of,water,[END]
the,third,man,was,sprawled,on,his,back,unmoving,[END]
he,hadn't,worn,a,gorget,and,a,foot,of,broken,sword,jutted,from,beneath,his,chin,[END]
get,my,helm,clegane,growled,at,her,[END]
it,was,stuffed,at,the,bottom,of,a,sack,of,dried,apples,in,the,back,of,the,wayn,behind,the,pickled,pigs',feet,[END]
arya,upended,the,sack,and,tossed,it,to,him,[END]
he,snatched,it,one-handed,from,the,air,and,lowered,it,over,his,head,and,where,the,man,had,sat,only,a,steel,dog,remained,snarling,at,the,fires,[END]
my,brother,[END]
dead,he,shouted,back,at,her,[END]
do,you,think,they'd,slaughter,his,men,and,leave,him,alive,[END]
he,turned,his,head,back,toward,the,camp,[END]
look,[END]
look,damn,you,[END]
the,camp,had,become,a,battlefield,[END]
no,a,butcher's,den,[END]
the,flames,from,the,feasting,tents,reached,halfway,up,the,sky,[END]
some,of,the,barracks,tents,were,burning,too,and,half,a,hundred,silk,pavilions,[END]
everywhere,swords,were,singing,[END]
and,now,the,rains,weep,o'er,his,hall,with,not,a,soul,to,hear,[END]
she,saw,two,knights,ride,down,a,running,man,[END]
a,wooden,barrel,came,crashing,onto,one,of,the,burning,tents,and,burst,apart,and,the,flames,leapt,twice,as,high,[END]

stranger,tossed,his,head,impatiently,his,nostrils,flaring,at,the,scent,of,blood,[END]
the,song,was,done,[END]
there,was,only,one,solitary,drum,its,slow,monotonous,beats,echoing,across,the,river,like,the,pounding,of,some,monstrous,heart,[END]
the,black,sky,wept,the,river,grumbled,men,cursed,and,died,[END]

the,portcullis,was,coming,down,but,slowly,[END]

the,mud,slowed,her,though,and,then,the,water,[END]

the,drawbridge,had,begun,to,lift,the,water,running,off,it,in,a,sheet,the,mud,falling,in,heavy,clots,[END]
faster,[END]
she,heard,loud,splashing,and,looked,back,to,see,stranger,pounding,after,her,sending,up,gouts,of,water,with,every,stride,[END]
she,saw,the,longaxe,too,still,wet,with,blood,and,brains,[END]
and,arya,ran,[END]
not,for,her,brother,now,not,even,for,her,mother,but,for,herself,[END]
she,ran,faster,than,she,had,ever,run,before,her,head,down,and,her,feet,churning,up,the,river,she,ran,from,him,as,mycah,must,have,run,[END]
his,axe,took,her,in,the,back,of,the,head,[END]

the,pease,are,overcooked,his,wife,ventured,once,[END]
no,matter,he,said,[END]
so,is,the,mutton,[END]
it,was,a,jest,but,sansa,took,it,for,criticism,[END]
i,am,sorry,my,lord,[END]
why,[END]
some,cook,should,be,sorry,[END]
not,you,[END]
the,pease,are,not,your,province,sansa,[END]
i,[END]
i,am,sorry,that,my,lord,husband,is,displeased,[END]
any,displeasure,i'm,feeling,has,naught,to,do,with,pease,[END]
i,have,joffrey,and,my,sister,to,displease,me,and,my,lord,father,and,three,hundred,bloody,dornishmen,[END]
he,had,settled,prince,oberyn,and,his,lords,in,a,cornerfort,facing,the,city,as,far,from,the,tyrells,as,he,could,put,them,without,evicting,them,from,the,red,keep,entirely,[END]
it,was,not,nearly,far,enough,[END]
already,there,had,been,a,brawl,in,a,flea,bottom,pot-shop,that,left,one,tyrell,man-at-arms,dead,and,two,of,lord,gargalen's,scalded,and,an,ugly,confrontation,in,the,yard,when,mace,tyrell's,wizened,little,mother,called,ellaria,sand,the,serpent's,whore,[END]
every,time,he,chanced,to,see,oberyn,martell,the,prince,asked,when,the,justice,would,be,served,[END]
overcooked,pease,were,the,least,of,tyrion's,troubles,but,he,saw,no,point,in,burdening,his,young,wife,with,any,of,that,[END]
sansa,had,enough,griefs,of,her,own,[END]
the,pease,suffice,he,told,her,curtly,[END]
they,are,green,and,round,what,more,can,one,expect,of,pease,[END]
here,i'll,have,another,serving,if,it,please,my,lady,[END]
he,beckoned,and,podrick,payne,spooned,so,many,pease,onto,his,plate,that,tyrion,lost,sight,of,his,mutton,[END]
that,was,stupid,he,told,himself,[END]
now,i,have,to,eat,them,all,or,she'll,be,sorry,all,over,again,[END]
the,supper,ended,in,a,strained,silence,as,so,many,of,their,suppers,did,[END]
afterward,as,pod,was,removing,the,cups,and,platters,sansa,asked,tyrion,for,leave,to,visit,the,godswood,[END]
as,you,wish,[END]
he,had,become,accustomed,to,his,wife's,nightly,devotions,[END]
she,prayed,at,the,royal,sept,as,well,and,often,lit,candles,to,mother,maid,and,crone,[END]
tyrion,found,all,this,piety,excessive,if,truth,be,told,but,in,her,place,he,might,want,the,help,of,the,gods,as,well,[END]
i,confess,i,know,little,of,the,old,gods,he,said,trying,to,be,pleasant,[END]
perhaps,someday,you,might,enlighten,me,[END]
i,could,even,accompany,you,[END]
no,sansa,said,at,once,[END]
you,[END]
you,are,kind,to,offer,but,[END]
there,are,no,devotions,my,lord,[END]
no,priests,or,songs,or,candles,[END]
only,trees,and,silent,prayer,[END]
you,would,be,bored,[END]
no,doubt,you're,right,[END]
she,knows,me,better,than,i,thought,[END]
though,the,sound,of,rustling,leaves,might,be,a,pleasant,change,from,some,septon,droning,on,about,the,seven,aspects,of,grace,[END]
tyrion,waved,her,off,[END]
i,won't,intrude,[END]
dress,warmly,my,lady,the,wind,is,brisk,out,there,[END]
he,was,tempted,to,ask,what,she,prayed,for,but,sansa,was,so,dutiful,she,might,actually,tell,him,and,he,didn't,think,he,wanted,to,know,[END]
he,went,back,to,work,after,she,left,trying,to,track,some,golden,dragons,through,the,labyrinth,of,littlefinger's,ledgers,[END]
petyr,baelish,had,not,believed,in,letting,gold,sit,about,and,grow,dusty,that,was,for,certain,but,the,more,tyrion,tried,to,make,sense,of,his,accounts,the,more,his,head,hurt,[END]
it,was,all,very,well,to,talk,of,breeding,dragons,instead,of,locking,them,up,in,the,treasury,but,some,of,these,ventures,smelled,worse,than,week-old,fish,[END]
i,wouldn't,have,been,so,quick,to,let,joffrey,fling,the,antler,men,over,the,walls,if,i'd,known,how,many,of,the,bloody,bastards,had,taken,loans,from,the,crown,[END]
he,would,have,to,send,bronn,to,find,their,heirs,but,he,feared,that,would,prove,as,fruitful,as,trying,to,squeeze,silver,from,a,silverfish,[END]
when,the,summons,from,his,lord,father,arrived,it,was,the,first,time,tyrion,could,ever,recall,being,pleased,to,see,ser,boros,blount,[END]
he,closed,the,ledgers,gratefully,blew,out,the,oil,lamp,tied,a,cloak,around,his,shoulders,and,waddled,across,the,castle,to,the,tower,of,the,hand,[END]
the,wind,was,brisk,just,as,he'd,warned,sansa,and,there,was,a,smell,of,rain,in,the,air,[END]
perhaps,when,lord,tywin,was,done,with,him,he,should,go,to,the,godswood,and,fetch,her,home,before,she,got,soaked,[END]
but,all,that,went,straight,out,of,his,head,when,he,entered,the,hand's,solar,to,find,cersei,ser,kevan,and,grand,maester,pycelle,gathered,about,lord,tywin,and,the,king,[END]
joffrey,was,almost,bouncing,and,cersei,was,savoring,a,smug,little,smile,though,lord,tywin,looked,as,grim,as,ever,[END]
i,wonder,if,he,could,smile,even,if,he,wanted,to,[END]
what's,happened,[END]
tyrion,asked,[END]
his,father,offered,him,a,roll,of,parchment,[END]
someone,had,flattened,it,but,it,still,wanted,to,curl,[END]
roslin,caught,a,fine,fat,trout,the,message,read,[END]
her,brothers,gave,her,a,pair,of,wolf,pelts,for,her,wedding,[END]
tyrion,turned,it,over,to,inspect,the,broken,seal,[END]
the,wax,was,silvery-grey,and,pressed,into,it,were,the,twin,towers,of,house,frey,[END]
does,the,lord,of,the,crossing,imagine,he's,being,poetic,[END]
or,is,this,meant,to,confound,us,[END]
tyrion,snorted,[END]
the,trout,would,be,edmure,tully,the,pelts,[END]
he's,dead,[END]
joffrey,sounded,so,proud,and,happy,you,might,have,thought,he'd,skinned,robb,stark,himself,[END]
first,greyjoy,and,now,stark,[END]
tyrion,thought,of,his,child,wife,praying,in,the,godswood,even,now,[END]
praying,to,her,father's,gods,to,bring,her,brother,victory,and,keep,her,mother,safe,no,doubt,[END]
the,old,gods,paid,no,more,heed,to,prayer,than,the,new,ones,it,would,seem,[END]
perhaps,he,should,take,comfort,in,that,[END]
kings,are,falling,like,leaves,this,autumn,he,said,[END]
it,would,seem,our,little,war,is,winning,itself,[END]

the,part,about,you,hiding,under,casterly,rock,does,sound,like,robert,[END]
tyrion,didn't,want,lord,tywin,forgetting,that,bit,[END]
yes,i,recall,now,cersei,said,robert,often,told,joff,that,a,king,must,be,bold,[END]
and,what,were,you,telling,him,pray,[END]
i,did,not,fight,a,war,to,seat,robert,the,second,on,the,iron,throne,[END]
you,gave,me,to,understand,the,boy,cared,nothing,for,his,father,[END]
why,would,he,[END]
robert,ignored,him,[END]
he,would,have,beat,him,if,i'd,allowed,it,[END]
that,brute,you,made,me,marry,once,hit,the,boy,so,hard,he,knocked,out,two,of,his,baby,teeth,over,some,mischief,with,a,cat,[END]
i,told,him,i'd,kill,him,in,his,sleep,if,he,ever,did,it,again,and,he,never,did,but,sometimes,he,would,say,things,[END]
it,appears,things,needed,to,be,said,[END]
lord,tywin,waved,two,fingers,at,her,a,brusque,dismissal,[END]
go,[END]
she,went,seething,[END]
not,robert,the,second,tyrion,said,[END]
aerys,the,third,[END]
the,boy,is,thirteen,[END]
there,is,time,yet,[END]
lord,tywin,paced,to,the,window,[END]
that,was,unlike,him,he,was,more,upset,than,he,wished,to,show,[END]
he,requires,a,sharp,lesson,[END]
tyrion,had,gotten,his,own,sharp,lesson,at,thirteen,[END]
he,felt,almost,sorry,for,his,nephew,[END]
on,the,other,hand,no,one,deserved,it,more,[END]
enough,of,joffrey,he,said,[END]
wars,are,won,with,quills,and,ravens,wasn't,that,what,you,said,[END]
i,must,congratulate,you,[END]
how,long,have,you,and,walder,frey,been,plotting,this,[END]
i,mislike,that,word,lord,tywin,said,stiffly,[END]
and,i,mislike,being,left,in,the,dark,[END]
there,was,no,reason,to,tell,you,[END]
you,had,no,part,in,this,[END]
was,cersei,told,[END]
tyrion,demanded,to,know,[END]
no,one,was,told,save,those,who,had,a,part,to,play,[END]
and,they,were,only,told,as,much,as,they,needed,to,know,[END]
you,ought,to,know,that,there,is,no,other,way,to,keep,a,secret,here,especially,[END]
my,object,was,to,rid,us,of,a,dangerous,enemy,as,cheaply,as,i,could,not,to,indulge,your,curiosity,or,make,your,sister,feel,important,[END]
he,closed,the,shutters,frowning,[END]
you,have,a,certain,cunning,tyrion,but,the,plain,truth,is,you,talk,too,much,[END]
that,loose,tongue,of,yours,will,be,your,undoing,[END]
you,should,have,let,joff,tear,it,out,suggested,tyrion,[END]
you,would,do,well,not,to,tempt,me,lord,tywin,said,[END]
i'll,hear,no,more,of,this,[END]
i,have,been,considering,how,best,to,appease,oberyn,martell,and,his,entourage,[END]
oh,[END]
is,this,something,i'm,allowed,to,know,or,should,i,leave,so,you,can,discuss,it,with,yourself,[END]
his,father,ignored,the,sally,[END]
prince,oberyn's,presence,here,is,unfortunate,[END]
his,brother,is,a,cautious,man,a,reasoned,man,subtle,deliberate,even,indolent,to,a,degree,[END]
he,is,a,man,who,weighs,the,consequences,of,every,word,and,every,action,[END]
but,oberyn,has,always,been,half-mad,[END]
is,it,true,he,tried,to,raise,dorne,for,viserys,[END]
no,one,speaks,of,it,but,yes,[END]
ravens,flew,and,riders,rode,with,what,secret,messages,i,never,knew,[END]
jon,arryn,sailed,to,sunspear,to,return,prince,lewyn's,bones,sat,down,with,prince,doran,and,ended,all,the,talk,of,war,[END]
but,robert,never,went,to,dorne,thereafter,and,prince,oberyn,seldom,left,it,[END]
well,he's,here,now,with,half,the,nobility,of,dorne,in,his,tail,and,he,grows,more,impatient,every,day,said,tyrion,[END]
perhaps,i,should,show,him,the,brothels,of,king's,landing,that,might,distract,him,[END]
a,tool,for,every,task,isn't,that,how,it,works,[END]
my,tool,is,yours,father,[END]
never,let,it,be,said,that,house,lannister,blew,its,trumpets,and,i,did,not,respond,[END]
lord,tywin's,mouth,tightened,[END]
very,droll,[END]
shall,i,have,them,sew,you,a,suit,of,motley,and,a,little,hat,with,bells,on,it,[END]
if,i,wear,it,do,i,have,leave,to,say,anything,i,want,about,his,grace,king,joffrey,[END]
lord,tywin,seated,himself,again,and,said,i,was,made,to,suffer,my,father's,follies,[END]
i,will,not,suffer,yours,[END]
enough,[END]
very,well,as,you,ask,so,pleasantly,[END]
the,red,viper,is,not,going,to,be,pleasant,i,fear,[END]
nor,will,he,content,himself,with,ser,gregor's,head,alone,[END]
all,the,more,reason,not,to,give,it,to,him,[END]
not,to,[END]
tyrion,was,shocked,[END]
i,thought,we,were,agreed,that,the,woods,were,full,of,beasts,[END]
lesser,beasts,[END]
lord,tywin's,fingers,laced,together,under,his,chin,[END]
ser,gregor,has,served,us,well,[END]
no,other,knight,in,the,realm,inspires,such,terror,in,our,enemies,[END]
oberyn,knows,that,gregor,was,the,one,who,[END]
he,knows,nothing,[END]
he,has,heard,tales,[END]
stable,gossip,and,kitchen,calumnies,[END]
he,has,no,crumb,of,proof,[END]
ser,gregor,is,certainly,not,about,to,confess,to,him,[END]
i,mean,to,keep,him,well,away,for,so,long,as,the,dornishmen,are,in,king's,landing,[END]
and,when,oberyn,demands,the,justice,he's,come,for,[END]
i,will,tell,him,that,ser,amory,lorch,killed,elia,and,her,children,lord,tywin,said,calmly,[END]
so,will,you,if,he,asks,[END]
ser,amory,lorch,is,dead,tyrion,said,flatly,[END]
precisely,[END]
vargo,hoat,had,ser,amory,torn,apart,by,a,bear,after,the,fall,of,harrenhal,[END]
that,ought,to,be,sufficiently,grisly,to,appease,even,oberyn,martell,[END]
you,may,call,that,justice,[END]
it,is,justice,[END]
it,was,ser,amory,who,brought,me,the,girl's,body,if,you,must,know,[END]
he,found,her,hiding,under,her,father's,bed,as,if,she,believed,rhaegar,could,still,protect,her,[END]
princess,elia,and,the,babe,were,in,the,nursery,a,floor,below,[END]
well,it's,a,tale,and,ser,amory's,not,like,to,deny,it,[END]
what,will,you,tell,oberyn,when,he,asks,who,gave,lorch,his,orders,[END]
ser,amory,acted,on,his,own,in,the,hope,of,winning,favor,from,the,new,king,[END]
robert's,hatred,for,rhaegar,was,scarcely,a,secret,[END]
it,might,serve,tyrion,had,to,concede,but,the,snake,will,not,be,happy,[END]
far,be,it,from,me,to,question,your,cunning,father,but,in,your,place,i,do,believe,i'd,have,let,robert,baratheon,bloody,his,own,hands,[END]
lord,tywin,stared,at,him,as,if,he,had,lost,his,wits,[END]
you,deserve,that,motley,then,[END]
we,had,come,late,to,robert's,cause,[END]
it,was,necessary,to,demonstrate,our,loyalty,[END]
when,i,laid,those,bodies,before,the,throne,no,man,could,doubt,that,we,had,forsaken,house,targaryen,forever,[END]
and,robert's,relief,was,palpable,[END]
as,stupid,as,he,was,even,he,knew,that,rhaegar's,children,had,to,die,if,his,throne,was,ever,to,be,secure,[END]
yet,he,saw,himself,as,a,hero,and,heroes,do,not,kill,children,[END]
his,father,shrugged,[END]
i,grant,you,it,was,done,too,brutally,[END]
elia,need,not,have,been,harmed,at,all,that,was,sheer,folly,[END]
by,herself,she,was,nothing,[END]
then,why,did,the,mountain,kill,her,[END]
because,i,did,not,tell,him,to,spare,her,[END]
i,doubt,i,mentioned,her,at,all,[END]
i,had,more,pressing,concerns,[END]
ned,stark's,van,was,rushing,south,from,the,trident,and,i,feared,it,might,come,to,swords,between,us,[END]
and,it,was,in,aerys,to,murder,jaime,with,no,more,cause,than,spite,[END]
that,was,the,thing,i,feared,most,[END]
that,and,what,jaime,himself,might,do,[END]
he,closed,a,fist,[END]
nor,did,i,yet,grasp,what,i,had,in,gregor,clegane,only,that,he,was,huge,and,terrible,in,battle,[END]
the,rape,[END]
even,you,will,not,accuse,me,of,giving,that,command,i,would,hope,[END]
ser,amory,was,almost,as,bestial,with,rhaenys,[END]
i,asked,him,afterward,why,it,had,required,half,a,hundred,thrusts,to,kill,a,girl,of,[END]
two,[END]
three,[END]
he,said,she'd,kicked,him,and,would,not,stop,screaming,[END]
if,lorch,had,half,the,wits,the,gods,gave,a,turnip,he,would,have,calmed,her,with,a,few,sweet,words,and,used,a,soft,silk,pillow,[END]
his,mouth,twisted,in,distaste,[END]
the,blood,was,in,him,[END]
but,not,in,you,father,[END]
there,is,no,blood,in,tywin,lannister,[END]
was,it,a,soft,silk,pillow,that,slew,robb,stark,[END]
it,was,to,be,an,arrow,at,edmure,tully's,wedding,feast,[END]
the,boy,was,too,wary,in,the,field,[END]
he,kept,his,men,in,good,order,and,surrounded,himself,with,outriders,and,bodyguards,[END]
so,lord,walder,slew,him,under,his,own,roof,at,his,own,table,[END]
tyrion,made,a,fist,[END]
what,of,lady,catelyn,[END]
slain,as,well,i'd,say,[END]
a,pair,of,wolfskins,[END]
frey,had,intended,to,keep,her,captive,but,perhaps,something,went,awry,[END]
so,much,for,guest,right,[END]
the,blood,is,on,walder,frey's,hands,not,mine,[END]
walder,frey,is,a,peevish,old,man,who,lives,to,fondle,his,young,wife,and,brood,over,all,the,slights,he's,suffered,[END]
i,have,no,doubt,he,hatched,this,ugly,chicken,but,he,would,never,have,dared,such,a,thing,without,a,promise,of,protection,[END]
i,suppose,you,would,have,spared,the,boy,and,told,lord,frey,you,had,no,need,of,his,allegiance,[END]
that,would,have,driven,the,old,fool,right,back,into,stark's,arms,and,won,you,another,year,of,war,[END]
explain,to,me,why,it,is,more,noble,to,kill,ten,thousand,men,in,battle,than,a,dozen,at,dinner,[END]
when,tyrion,had,no,reply,to,that,his,father,continued,[END]
the,price,was,cheap,by,any,measure,[END]
the,crown,shall,grant,riverrun,to,ser,emmon,frey,once,the,blackfish,yields,[END]
lancel,and,daven,must,marry,frey,girls,joy,is,to,wed,one,of,lord,walder's,natural,sons,when,she's,old,enough,and,roose,bolton,becomes,warden,of,the,north,and,takes,home,arya,stark,[END]
arya,stark,[END]
tyrion,cocked,his,head,[END]
and,bolton,[END]
i,might,have,known,frey,would,not,have,the,stomach,to,act,alone,[END]
but,arya,[END]
varys,and,ser,jacelyn,searched,for,her,for,more,than,half,a,year,[END]
arya,stark,is,surely,dead,[END]
so,was,renly,until,the,blackwater,[END]
what,does,that,mean,[END]
perhaps,littlefinger,succeeded,where,you,and,varys,failed,[END]
lord,bolton,will,wed,the,girl,to,his,bastard,son,[END]
we,shall,allow,the,dreadfort,to,fight,the,ironborn,for,a,few,years,and,see,if,he,can,bring,stark's,other,bannermen,to,heel,[END]
come,spring,all,of,them,should,be,at,the,end,of,their,strength,and,ready,to,bend,the,knee,[END]
the,north,will,go,to,your,son,by,sansa,stark,[END]
if,you,ever,find,enough,manhood,in,you,to,breed,one,[END]
lest,you,forget,it,is,not,only,joffrey,who,must,needs,take,a,maidenhead,[END]
i,had,not,forgotten,though,i'd,hoped,you,had,[END]
and,when,do,you,imagine,sansa,will,be,at,her,most,fertile,[END]
tyrion,asked,his,father,in,tones,that,dripped,acid,[END]
before,or,after,i,tell,her,how,we,murdered,her,mother,and,her,brother,[END]
davos,[END]
for,a,moment,it,seemed,as,though,the,king,had,not,heard,[END]
stannis,showed,no,pleasure,at,the,news,no,anger,no,disbelief,not,even,relief,[END]
he,stared,at,his,painted,table,with,teeth,clenched,hard,[END]

the,red,wedding,the,smallfolk,are,calling,it,[END]
they,swear,lord,frey,had,the,boy's,head,hacked,off,sewed,the,head,of,his,direwolf,in,its,place,and,nailed,a,crown,about,his,ears,[END]
his,lady,mother,was,slain,as,well,and,thrown,naked,in,the,river,[END]
at,a,wedding,thought,davos,[END]
as,he,sat,at,his,slayer's,board,a,guest,beneath,his,roof,[END]
these,freys,are,cursed,[END]
he,could,smell,the,burning,blood,again,and,hear,the,leech,hissing,and,spitting,on,the,brazier's,hot,coals,[END]
it,was,the,lord's,wrath,that,slew,him,ser,axell,florent,declared,[END]

his,efforts,often,gave,him,headaches,and,made,him,feel,as,big,a,fool,as,patchface,besides,[END]
his,son,devan,was,not,yet,twelve,yet,he,was,well,ahead,of,his,father,and,for,princess,shireen,and,edric,storm,reading,seemed,as,natural,as,breathing,[END]
when,it,came,to,books,davos,was,more,a,child,than,any,of,them,[END]
yet,he,persisted,[END]
he,was,the,king's,hand,now,and,a,king's,hand,should,read,[END]
the,narrow,twisting,steps,of,sea,dragon,tower,had,been,a,sore,trial,to,maester,cressen,after,he,broke,his,hip,[END]
davos,still,found,himself,missing,the,old,man,[END]
he,thought,stannis,must,as,well,[END]
pylos,seemed,clever,and,diligent,and,well-meaning,but,he,was,so,young,and,the,king,did,not,confide,in,him,as,he,had,in,cressen,[END]
the,old,man,had,been,with,stannis,so,long,[END]
until,he,ran,afoul,of,melisandre,and,died,for,it,[END]
at,the,top,of,the,steps,davos,heard,a,soft,jingle,of,bells,that,could,only,herald,patchface,[END]
the,princess's,fool,was,waiting,outside,the,maester's,door,for,her,like,a,faithful,hound,[END]
dough-soft,and,slump-shouldered,his,broad,face,tattooed,in,a,motley,pattern,of,red,and,green,squares,patchface,wore,a,helm,made,of,a,rack,of,deer,antlers,strapped,to,a,tin,bucket,[END]
a,dozen,bells,hung,from,the,tines,and,rang,when,he,moved,[END]
which,meant,constantly,since,the,fool,seldom,stood,still,[END]

under,the,sea,the,old,fish,eat,the,young,fish,the,fool,muttered,at,davos,[END]

it,might,have,been,different,if,aged,master,cressen,had,been,the,one,teaching,him,but,pylos,was,young,enough,to,be,his,son,[END]
he,found,the,maester,seated,at,his,long,wooden,table,covered,with,books,and,scrolls,across,from,the,three,children,[END]
princess,shireen,sat,between,the,two,boys,[END]
even,now,davos,could,take,great,pleasure,in,the,sight,of,his,own,blood,keeping,company,with,a,princess,and,a,king's,bastard,[END]
devan,will,be,a,lord,now,not,merely,a,knight,[END]

he,reads,and,he,writes,as,if,he,had,been,born,to,it,[END]
pylos,had,naught,but,praise,for,his,diligence,and,the,master-at-arms,said,devan,was,showing,promise,with,sword,and,lance,as,well,[END]

his,eldest,had,never,dressed,so,fine,as,devan,in,his,squire's,raiment,to,be,sure,but,they,shared,the,same,square,plain,face,the,same,forthright,brown,eyes,the,same,thin,brown,flyaway,hair,[END]
devan's,cheeks,and,chin,were,dusted,with,blond,hair,a,fuzz,that,would,have,shamed,a,proper,peach,though,the,boy,was,fiercely,proud,of,his,beard,[END]
just,as,dale,was,proud,of,his,once,[END]
devan,was,the,oldest,of,the,three,children,at,the,table,[END]

the,wildlings,took,their,sweet,time,about,departing,the,next,morning,stripping,the,bodies,of,their,dead,and,the,old,man,they'd,killed,even,pulling,a,few,fish,from,the,lake,and,there,was,a,scary,moment,when,three,of,them,found,the,causeway,and,started,to,walk,out,[END]
but,the,path,turned,and,they,didn't,and,two,of,them,nearly,drowned,before,the,others,pulled,them,out,[END]
the,tall,bald,man,yelled,at,them,his,words,echoing,across,the,water,in,some,tongue,that,even,jojen,did,not,know,and,a,little,while,later,they,gathered,up,their,shields,and,spears,and,marched,off,north,by,east,the,same,way,jon,had,gone,[END]
bran,wanted,to,leave,too,to,look,for,summer,but,the,reeds,said,no,[END]
we,will,stay,another,night,said,jojen,put,some,leagues,between,us,and,the,wildlings,[END]
you,don't,want,to,meet,them,again,do,you,[END]
late,that,afternoon,summer,returned,from,wherever,he'd,been,hiding,dragging,his,back,leg,[END]
he,ate,parts,of,the,bodies,in,the,inn,driving,off,the,crows,then,swam,out,to,the,island,[END]
meera,had,drawn,the,broken,arrow,from,his,leg,and,rubbed,the,wound,with,the,juice,of,some,plants,she,found,growing,around,the,base,of,the,tower,[END]
the,direwolf,was,still,limping,but,a,little,less,each,day,it,seemed,to,bran,[END]
the,gods,had,heard,[END]
maybe,we,should,try,another,castle,meera,said,to,her,brother,[END]
maybe,we,could,get,through,the,gate,somewhere,else,[END]
i,could,go,scout,if,you,wanted,i'd,make,better,time,by,myself,[END]

all,the,gates,are,sealed,except,the,ones,at,castle,black,eastwatch,and,the,shadow,tower,[END]
hodor,said,hodor,to,that,and,the,reeds,exchanged,a,look,[END]
at,least,i,should,climb,to,the,top,of,the,wall,meera,decided,[END]
maybe,i'll,see,something,up,there,[END]
what,could,you,hope,to,see,[END]
jojen,asked,[END]
something,said,meera,and,for,once,she,was,adamant,[END]
it,should,be,me,[END]
bran,raised,his,head,to,look,up,at,the,wall,and,imagined,himself,climbing,inch,by,inch,squirming,his,fingers,into,cracks,in,the,ice,and,kicking,footholds,with,his,toes,[END]
that,made,him,smile,in,spite,of,everything,the,dreams,and,the,wildlings,and,jon,and,everything,[END]
he,had,climbed,the,walls,of,winterfell,when,he,was,little,and,all,the,towers,too,but,none,of,them,had,been,so,high,and,they,were,only,stone,[END]
the,wall,could,look,like,stone,all,grey,and,pitted,but,then,the,clouds,would,break,and,the,sun,would,hit,it,differently,and,all,at,once,it,would,transform,and,stand,there,white,and,blue,and,glittering,[END]
it,was,the,end,of,the,world,old,nan,always,said,[END]
on,the,other,side,were,monsters,and,giants,and,ghouls,but,they,could,not,pass,so,long,as,the,wall,stood,strong,[END]
i,want,to,stand,on,top,with,meera,bran,thought,[END]
i,want,to,stand,on,top,and,see,[END]
but,he,was,a,broken,boy,with,useless,legs,so,all,he,could,do,was,watch,from,below,as,meera,went,up,in,his,stead,[END]
she,wasn't,really,climbing,the,way,he,used,to,climb,[END]
she,was,only,walking,up,some,steps,that,the,night's,watch,had,hewn,hundreds,and,thousands,of,years,ago,[END]
he,remembered,maester,luwin,saying,the,nightfort,was,the,only,castle,where,the,steps,had,been,cut,from,the,ice,of,the,wall,itself,[END]
or,maybe,it,had,been,uncle,benjen,[END]
the,newer,castles,had,wooden,steps,or,stone,ones,or,long,ramps,of,earth,and,gravel,[END]
ice,is,too,treacherous,[END]
it,was,his,uncle,who'd,told,him,that,[END]
he,said,that,the,outer,surface,of,the,wall,wept,icy,tears,sometimes,though,the,core,inside,stayed,frozen,hard,as,rock,[END]
the,steps,must,have,melted,and,refrozen,a,thousand,times,since,the,last,black,brothers,left,the,castle,and,every,time,they,did,they,shrunk,a,little,and,got,smoother,and,rounder,and,more,treacherous,[END]
and,smaller,[END]
it's,almost,like,the,wall,was,swallowing,them,back,into,itself,[END]
meera,reed,was,very,surefooted,but,even,so,she,was,going,slowly,moving,from,nub,to,nub,[END]
in,two,places,where,the,steps,were,hardly,there,at,all,she,got,down,on,all,fours,[END]
it,will,be,worse,when,she,comes,down,bran,thought,watching,[END]
even,so,he,wished,it,was,him,up,there,[END]
when,she,reached,the,top,crawling,up,the,icy,knobs,that,were,all,that,remained,of,the,highest,steps,meera,vanished,from,his,sight,[END]
when,will,she,come,down,[END]
bran,asked,jojen,[END]
when,she,is,ready,[END]
she,will,want,to,have,a,good,look,[END]
at,the,wall,and,what's,beyond,[END]
we,should,do,the,same,down,here,[END]
hodor,[END]
said,hodor,doubtfully,[END]
we,might,find,something,jojen,insisted,[END]
or,something,might,find,us,[END]
bran,couldn't,say,it,though,he,did,not,want,jojen,to,think,he,was,craven,[END]
so,they,went,exploring,jojen,reed,leading,bran,in,his,basket,on,hodor's,back,summer,padding,by,their,side,[END]
once,the,direwolf,bolted,through,a,dark,door,and,returned,a,moment,later,with,a,grey,rat,between,his,teeth,[END]
the,rat,cook,bran,thought,but,it,was,the,wrong,color,and,only,as,big,as,a,cat,[END]
the,rat,cook,was,white,and,almost,as,huge,as,a,sow,[END]
there,were,a,lot,of,dark,doors,in,the,nightfort,and,a,lot,of,rats,[END]
bran,could,hear,them,scurrying,through,the,vaults,and,cellars,and,the,maze,of,pitch-black,tunnels,that,connected,them,[END]
jojen,wanted,to,go,poking,around,down,there,but,hodor,said,hodor,to,that,and,bran,said,no,[END]
there,were,worse,things,than,rats,down,in,the,dark,beneath,the,nightfort,[END]
this,seems,an,old,place,jojen,said,as,they,walked,down,a,gallery,where,the,sunlight,fell,in,dusty,shafts,through,empty,windows,[END]
twice,as,old,as,castle,black,bran,said,remembering,[END]
it,was,the,first,castle,on,the,wall,and,the,largest,[END]
but,it,had,also,been,the,first,abandoned,all,the,way,back,in,the,time,of,the,old,king,[END]
even,then,it,had,been,three-quarters,empty,and,too,costly,to,maintain,[END]
good,queen,alysanne,had,suggested,that,the,watch,replace,it,with,a,smaller,newer,castle,at,a,spot,only,seven,miles,east,where,the,wall,curved,along,the,shore,of,a,beautiful,green,lake,[END]
deep,lake,had,been,paid,for,by,the,queen's,jewels,and,built,by,the,men,the,old,king,had,sent,north,and,the,black,brothers,had,abandoned,the,nightfort,to,the,rats,[END]
that,was,two,centuries,past,though,[END]
now,deep,lake,stood,as,empty,as,the,castle,it,had,replaced,and,the,nightfort,[END]
there,are,ghosts,here,bran,said,[END]
hodor,had,heard,all,the,stories,before,but,jojen,might,not,have,[END]
old,ghosts,from,before,the,old,king,even,before,aegon,the,dragon,seventy-nine,deserters,who,went,south,to,be,outlaws,[END]
one,was,lord,ryswell's,youngest,son,so,when,they,reached,the,barrowlands,they,sought,shelter,at,his,castle,but,lord,ryswell,took,them,captive,and,returned,them,to,the,nightfort,[END]
the,lord,commander,had,holes,hewn,in,the,top,of,the,wall,and,he,put,the,deserters,in,them,and,sealed,them,up,alive,in,the,ice,[END]
they,have,spears,and,horns,and,they,all,face,north,[END]
the,seventy-nine,sentinels,they're,called,[END]
they,left,their,posts,in,life,so,in,death,their,watch,goes,on,forever,[END]
years,later,when,lord,ryswell,was,old,and,dying,he,had,himself,carried,to,the,nightfort,so,he,could,take,the,black,and,stand,beside,his,son,[END]
he'd,sent,him,back,to,the,wall,for,honor's,sake,but,he,loved,him,still,so,he,came,to,share,his,watch,[END]
they,spent,half,the,day,poking,through,the,castle,[END]
some,of,the,towers,had,fallen,down,and,others,looked,unsafe,but,they,climbed,the,bell,tower,the,bells,were,gone,and,the,rookery,the,birds,were,gone,[END]
beneath,the,brewhouse,they,found,a,vault,of,huge,oaken,casks,that,boomed,hollowly,when,hodor,knocked,on,them,[END]
they,found,a,library,the,shelves,and,bins,had,collapsed,the,books,were,gone,and,rats,were,everywhere,[END]
they,found,a,dank,and,dim-lit,dungeon,with,cells,enough,to,hold,five,hundred,captives,but,when,bran,grabbed,hold,of,one,of,the,rusted,bars,it,broke,off,in,his,hand,[END]
only,one,crumbling,wall,remained,of,the,great,hall,the,bathhouse,seemed,to,be,sinking,into,the,ground,and,a,huge,thornbush,had,conquered,the,practice,yard,outside,the,armory,where,black,brothers,had,once,labored,with,spear,and,shield,and,sword,[END]
the,armory,and,the,forge,still,stood,however,though,cobwebs,rats,and,dust,had,taken,the,places,of,blades,bellows,and,anvil,[END]
sometimes,summer,would,hear,sounds,that,bran,seemed,deaf,to,or,bare,his,teeth,at,nothing,the,fur,on,the,back,of,his,neck,bristling,[END]
but,the,rat,cook,never,put,in,an,appearance,nor,the,seventy-nine,sentinels,nor,mad,axe,[END]
bran,was,much,relieved,[END]
maybe,it,is,only,a,ruined,empty,castle,[END]
by,the,time,meera,returned,the,sun,was,only,a,sword's,breath,above,the,western,hills,[END]
what,did,you,see,[END]
her,brother,jojen,asked,her,[END]

hills,rising,wild,as,far,as,the,eye,can,see,covered,with,trees,that,no,axe,has,ever,touched,[END]
i,saw,the,sunlight,glinting,off,a,lake,and,clouds,sweeping,in,from,the,west,[END]
i,saw,patches,of,old,snow,and,icicles,long,as,pikes,[END]

no,[END]
it's,a,sheer,drop,and,the,ice,is,so,smooth,[END]

no,his,sister,agreed,[END]
are,you,sure,this,is,the,place,you,saw,in,your,dream,[END]
maybe,we,have,the,wrong,castle,[END]
no,[END]
this,is,the,castle,[END]
there,is,a,gate,here,[END]
yes,thought,bran,but,it's,blocked,by,stone,and,ice,[END]
as,the,sun,began,to,set,the,shadows,of,the,towers,lengthened,and,the,wind,blew,harder,sending,gusts,of,dry,dead,leaves,rattling,through,the,yards,[END]
the,gathering,gloom,put,bran,in,mind,of,another,of,old,nan's,stories,the,tale,of,night's,king,[END]
he,had,been,the,thirteenth,man,to,lead,the,night's,watch,she,said,a,warrior,who,knew,no,fear,[END]
and,that,was,the,fault,in,him,she,would,add,for,all,men,must,know,fear,[END]
a,woman,was,his,downfall,a,woman,glimpsed,from,atop,the,wall,with,skin,as,white,as,the,moon,and,eyes,like,blue,stars,[END]
fearing,nothing,he,chased,her,and,caught,her,and,loved,her,though,her,skin,was,cold,as,ice,and,when,he,gave,his,seed,to,her,he,gave,his,soul,as,well,[END]
he,brought,her,back,to,the,nightfort,and,proclaimed,her,a,queen,and,himself,her,king,and,with,strange,sorceries,he,bound,his,sworn,brothers,to,his,will,[END]
for,thirteen,years,they,had,ruled,night's,king,and,his,corpse,queen,till,finally,the,stark,of,winterfell,and,joramun,of,the,wildlings,had,joined,to,free,the,watch,from,bondage,[END]
after,his,fall,when,it,was,found,he,had,been,sacrificing,to,the,others,all,records,of,night's,king,had,been,destroyed,his,very,name,forbidden,[END]
some,say,he,was,a,bolton,old,nan,would,always,end,[END]
some,say,a,magnar,out,of,skagos,some,say,umber,flint,or,norrey,[END]
some,would,have,you,think,he,was,a,woodfoot,from,them,who,ruled,bear,island,before,the,ironmen,came,[END]
he,never,was,[END]
he,was,a,stark,the,brother,of,the,man,who,brought,him,down,[END]
she,always,pinched,bran,on,the,nose,then,he,would,never,forget,it,[END]
he,was,a,stark,of,winterfell,and,who,can,say,[END]
mayhaps,his,name,was,brandon,[END]
mayhaps,he,slept,in,this,very,bed,in,this,very,room,[END]
no,bran,thought,but,he,walked,in,this,castle,where,we'll,sleep,tonight,[END]
he,did,not,like,that,notion,very,much,at,all,[END]
night's,king,was,only,a,man,by,light,of,day,old,nan,would,always,say,but,the,night,was,his,to,rule,[END]
and,it's,getting,dark,[END]
the,reeds,decided,that,they,would,sleep,in,the,kitchens,a,stone,octagon,with,a,broken,dome,[END]
it,looked,to,offer,better,shelter,than,most,of,the,other,buildings,even,though,a,crooked,weirwood,had,burst,up,through,the,slate,floor,beside,the,huge,central,well,stretching,slantwise,toward,the,hole,in,the,roof,its,bone-white,branches,reaching,for,the,sun,[END]
it,was,a,queer,kind,of,tree,skinnier,than,any,other,weirwood,that,bran,had,ever,seen,and,faceless,as,well,but,it,made,him,feel,as,if,the,old,gods,were,with,him,here,at,least,[END]
that,was,the,only,thing,he,liked,about,the,kitchens,though,[END]
the,roof,was,mostly,there,so,they'd,be,dry,if,it,rained,again,but,he,didn't,think,they,would,ever,get,warm,here,[END]
you,could,feel,the,cold,seeping,up,through,the,slate,floor,[END]
bran,did,not,like,the,shadows,either,or,the,huge,brick,ovens,that,surrounded,them,like,open,mouths,or,the,rusted,meat,hooks,or,the,scars,and,stains,he,saw,in,the,butcher's,block,along,one,wall,[END]
that,was,where,the,rat,cook,chopped,the,prince,to,pieces,he,knew,and,he,baked,the,pie,in,one,of,these,ovens,[END]
the,well,was,the,thing,he,liked,the,least,though,[END]
it,was,a,good,twelve,feet,across,all,stone,with,steps,built,into,its,side,circling,down,and,down,into,darkness,[END]
the,walls,were,damp,and,covered,with,niter,but,none,of,them,could,see,the,water,at,the,bottom,not,even,meera,with,her,sharp,hunter's,eyes,[END]
maybe,it,doesn't,have,a,bottom,bran,said,uncertainly,[END]
hodor,peered,over,the,knee-high,lip,of,the,well,and,said,hodor,[END]
the,word,echoed,down,the,well,hodorhodorhodorhodor,fainter,and,fainter,hodorhodorhodorhodor,until,it,was,less,than,a,whisper,[END]

hodor,don't,[END]

hodor,tossed,the,slate,over,the,edge,[END]
you,shouldn't,have,done,that,[END]
you,don't,know,what's,down,there,[END]
you,might,have,hurt,something,or,[END]

hodor,[END]
far,far,far,below,they,heard,the,sound,as,the,stone,found,water,[END]
it,wasn't,a,splash,not,truly,[END]

faint,echoes,traveled,up,the,well,and,for,a,moment,bran,thought,he,heard,something,moving,thrashing,about,in,the,water,[END]

by,the,well,[END]

she,laughed,and,sent,hodor,out,to,gather,wood,[END]
summer,went,too,[END]
it,was,almost,dark,by,then,and,the,direwolf,wanted,to,hunt,[END]
hodor,returned,alone,with,both,arms,full,of,deadwood,and,broken,branches,[END]
jojen,reed,took,his,flint,and,knife,and,set,about,lighting,a,fire,while,meera,boned,the,fish,she'd,caught,at,the,last,stream,they'd,crossed,[END]
bran,wondered,how,many,years,had,passed,since,there,had,last,been,a,supper,cooked,in,the,kitchens,of,the,nightfort,[END]
he,wondered,who,had,cooked,it,too,though,maybe,it,was,better,not,to,know,[END]
when,the,flames,were,blazing,nicely,meera,put,the,fish,on,[END]
at,least,it's,not,a,meat,pie,[END]
the,rat,cook,had,cooked,the,son,of,the,andal,king,in,a,big,pie,with,onions,carrots,mushrooms,lots,of,pepper,and,salt,a,rasher,of,bacon,and,a,dark,red,dornish,wine,[END]
then,he,served,him,to,his,father,who,praised,the,taste,and,had,a,second,slice,[END]
afterward,the,gods,transformed,the,cook,into,a,monstrous,white,rat,who,could,only,eat,his,own,young,[END]
he,had,roamed,the,nightfort,ever,since,devouring,his,children,but,still,his,hunger,was,not,sated,[END]
it,was,not,for,murder,that,the,gods,cursed,him,old,nan,said,nor,for,serving,the,andal,king,his,son,in,a,pie,[END]
a,man,has,a,right,to,vengeance,[END]

we,should,sleep,jojen,said,solemnly,after,they,were,full,[END]
the,fire,was,burning,low,[END]
he,stirred,it,with,a,stick,[END]

from,time,to,time,he,thrashed,beneath,his,cloak,and,whimpered,something,that,might,have,been,hodor,[END]
bran,wriggled,closer,to,the,fire,[END]
the,warmth,felt,good,and,the,soft,crackling,of,flames,soothed,him,but,sleep,would,not,come,[END]
outside,the,wind,was,sending,armies,of,dead,leaves,marching,across,the,courtyards,to,scratch,faintly,at,the,doors,and,windows,[END]
the,sounds,made,him,think,of,old,nan's,stories,[END]
he,could,almost,hear,the,ghostly,sentinels,calling,to,each,other,atop,the,wall,and,winding,their,ghostly,warhorns,[END]
pale,moonlight,slanted,down,through,the,hole,in,the,dome,painting,the,branches,of,the,weirwood,as,they,strained,up,toward,the,roof,[END]

old,gods,bran,prayed,if,you,hear,me,don't,send,a,dream,tonight,[END]

the,gods,made,no,answer,[END]

a,soft,scuffling,sound,far,off,[END]

tyrion,[END]
tyrion,dressed,himself,in,darkness,listening,to,his,wife's,soft,breathing,from,the,bed,they,shared,[END]
she,dreams,he,thought,when,sansa,murmured,something,softly,a,name,perhaps,though,it,was,too,faint,to,say,and,turned,onto,her,side,[END]
as,man,and,wife,they,shared,a,marriage,bed,but,that,was,all,[END]
even,her,tears,she,hoards,to,herself,[END]
he,had,expected,anguish,and,anger,when,he,told,her,of,her,brother's,death,but,sansa's,face,had,remained,so,still,that,for,a,moment,he,feared,she,had,not,understood,[END]
it,was,only,later,with,a,heavy,oaken,door,between,them,that,he,heard,her,sobbing,[END]
tyrion,had,considered,going,to,her,then,to,offer,what,comfort,he,could,[END]
no,he,had,to,remind,himself,she,will,not,look,for,solace,from,a,lannister,[END]
the,most,he,could,do,was,to,shield,her,from,the,uglier,details,of,the,red,wedding,as,they,came,down,from,the,twins,[END]
sansa,did,not,need,to,hear,how,her,brother's,body,had,been,hacked,and,mutilated,he,decided,nor,how,her,mother's,corpse,had,been,dumped,naked,into,the,green,fork,in,a,savage,mockery,of,house,tully's,funeral,customs,[END]
the,last,thing,the,girl,needed,was,more,fodder,for,her,nightmares,[END]
it,was,not,enough,though,[END]
he,had,wrapped,his,cloak,around,her,shoulders,and,sworn,to,protect,her,but,that,was,as,cruel,a,jape,as,the,crown,the,freys,had,placed,atop,the,head,of,robb,stark's,direwolf,after,they'd,sewn,it,onto,his,headless,corpse,[END]
sansa,knew,that,as,well,[END]
the,way,she,looked,at,him,her,stiffness,when,she,climbed,into,their,bed,[END]
when,he,was,with,her,never,for,an,instant,could,he,forget,who,he,was,or,what,he,was,[END]
no,more,than,she,did,[END]
she,still,went,nightly,to,the,godswood,to,pray,and,tyrion,wondered,if,she,were,praying,for,his,death,[END]
she,had,lost,her,home,her,place,in,the,world,and,everyone,she,had,ever,loved,or,trusted,[END]
winter,is,coming,warned,the,stark,words,and,truly,it,had,come,for,them,with,a,vengeance,[END]
but,it,is,high,summer,for,house,lannister,[END]
so,why,am,i,so,bloody,cold,[END]
he,pulled,on,his,boots,fastened,his,cloak,with,a,lion's,head,brooch,and,slipped,out,into,the,torchlit,hall,[END]
there,was,this,much,to,be,said,for,his,marriage,it,had,allowed,him,to,escape,maegor's,holdfast,[END]
now,that,he,had,a,wife,and,household,his,lord,father,had,agreed,that,more,suitable,accommodations,were,required,and,lord,gyles,had,found,himself,abruptly,dispossessed,of,his,spacious,apartments,atop,the,kitchen,keep,[END]
and,splendid,apartments,they,were,too,with,a,large,bedchamber,and,adequate,solar,a,bath,and,dressing,room,for,his,wife,and,small,adjoining,chambers,for,pod,and,sansa's,maids,[END]
even,bronn's,cell,by,the,stair,had,a,window,of,sorts,[END]
well,more,an,arrow,slit,but,it,lets,in,light,[END]
the,castle's,main,kitchen,was,just,across,the,courtyard,true,but,tyrion,found,those,sounds,and,smells,infinitely,preferable,to,sharing,maegor's,with,his,sister,[END]
the,less,he,had,to,see,of,cersei,the,happier,he,was,like,to,be,[END]
tyrion,could,hear,brella's,snoring,as,he,passed,her,cell,[END]
shae,complained,of,that,but,it,seemed,a,small,enough,price,to,pay,[END]
varys,had,suggested,the,woman,to,him,in,former,days,she,had,run,lord,renly's,household,in,the,city,which,had,given,her,a,deal,of,practice,at,being,blind,deaf,and,mute,[END]
lighting,a,taper,he,made,his,way,back,to,the,servants',steps,and,descended,[END]
the,floors,below,his,own,were,still,and,he,heard,no,footsteps,but,his,own,[END]
down,he,went,to,the,ground,floor,and,beyond,to,emerge,in,a,gloomy,cellar,with,a,vaulted,stone,ceiling,[END]
much,of,the,castle,was,connected,underground,and,the,kitchen,keep,was,no,exception,[END]
tyrion,waddled,along,a,long,dark,passageway,until,he,found,the,door,he,wanted,and,pushed,through,[END]
within,the,dragon,skulls,were,waiting,and,so,was,shae,[END]
i,thought,m'lord,had,forgotten,me,[END]
her,dress,was,draped,over,a,black,tooth,near,as,tall,as,she,was,and,she,stood,within,the,dragon's,jaws,nude,[END]
balerion,he,thought,[END]
or,was,it,vhagar,[END]
one,dragon,skull,looked,much,like,another,[END]
just,the,sight,of,her,made,him,hard,[END]
come,out,of,there,[END]
i,won't,[END]
she,smiled,her,wickedest,smile,[END]
m'lord,will,pluck,me,from,the,dragon's,jaws,i,know,[END]
but,when,he,waddled,closer,she,leaned,forward,and,blew,out,the,taper,[END]
shae,[END]
he,reached,but,she,spun,and,slipped,free,[END]
you,have,to,catch,me,[END]

m'lord,must,have,played,monsters,and,maidens,when,he,was,little,[END]
are,you,calling,me,a,monster,[END]
no,more,than,i'm,a,maiden,[END]
she,was,behind,him,her,steps,soft,against,the,floor,[END]
you,need,to,catch,me,all,the,same,[END]
he,did,finally,but,only,because,she,let,herself,be,caught,[END]
by,the,time,she,slipped,into,his,arms,he,was,flushed,and,out,of,breath,from,stumbling,into,dragon,skulls,[END]
all,that,was,forgotten,in,an,instant,when,he,felt,her,small,breasts,pressed,against,his,face,in,the,dark,her,stiff,little,nipples,brushing,lightly,over,his,lips,and,the,scar,where,his,nose,had,been,[END]
tyrion,pulled,her,down,onto,the,floor,[END]
my,giant,she,breathed,as,he,entered,her,[END]
my,giant's,come,to,save,me,[END]
after,as,they,lay,entwined,amongst,the,dragon,skulls,he,rested,his,head,against,her,inhaling,the,smooth,clean,smell,of,her,hair,[END]
we,should,go,back,he,said,reluctantly,[END]
it,must,be,near,dawn,[END]
sansa,will,be,waking,[END]

a,cup,before,she,goes,to,sleep,and,we,could,fuck,in,bed,beside,her,without,her,waking,[END]
she,giggled,[END]
maybe,we,should,some,night,[END]
would,m'lord,like,that,[END]
her,hand,found,his,shoulder,and,began,to,knead,the,muscles,there,[END]
your,neck,is,hard,as,stone,[END]
what,troubles,you,[END]
tyrion,could,not,see,his,fingers,in,front,of,his,face,but,he,ticked,his,woes,off,on,them,all,the,same,[END]

maybe,we'll,have,to,go,naked,[END]
and,if,we're,seen,my,lord,father,will,hang,you,[END]
hiring,shae,as,one,of,sansa's,maids,had,given,him,an,excuse,to,be,seen,talking,with,her,but,tyrion,did,not,delude,himself,that,they,were,safe,[END]
varys,had,warned,him,[END]
i,gave,shae,a,false,history,but,it,was,meant,for,lollys,and,lady,tanda,[END]

my,wife,wants,no,part,of,me,and,most,especially,not,the,part,that,seems,to,want,her,[END]
perhaps,he,ought,to,tell,her,about,shae,[END]
it,was,not,as,though,he,was,the,first,man,ever,to,keep,a,concubine,[END]
sansa's,own,oh-so-honorable,father,had,given,her,a,bastard,brother,[END]

the,only,safe,course,was,to,rid,himself,of,shae,[END]

or,if,she,was,tired,of,earning,her,bread,on,her,back,he,might,arrange,a,marriage,for,her,[END]
bronn,perhaps,[END]
the,sellsword,had,never,balked,at,eating,off,his,master's,plate,and,he,was,a,knight,now,a,better,match,than,she,could,elsewise,hope,for,[END]

that,was,such,a,sweet,dream,sansa,thought,drowsily,[END]
she,had,been,back,in,winterfell,running,through,the,godswood,with,her,lady,[END]
her,father,had,been,there,and,her,brothers,all,of,them,warm,and,safe,[END]

all,of,them,are,dead,but,me,[END]
she,was,alone,in,the,world,now,[END]
her,lord,husband,was,not,beside,her,but,she,was,used,to,that,[END]
tyrion,was,a,bad,sleeper,and,often,rose,before,the,dawn,[END]
usually,she,found,him,in,the,solar,hunched,beside,a,candle,lost,in,some,old,scroll,or,leatherbound,book,[END]
sometimes,the,smell,of,the,morning,bread,from,the,ovens,took,him,to,the,kitchens,and,sometimes,he,would,climb,up,to,the,roof,garden,or,wander,all,alone,down,traitor's,walk,[END]
she,threw,back,the,shutters,and,shivered,as,gooseprickles,rose,along,her,arms,[END]
there,were,clouds,massing,in,the,eastern,sky,pierced,by,shafts,of,sunlight,[END]
they,look,like,two,huge,castles,afloat,in,the,morning,sky,[END]
sansa,could,see,their,walls,of,tumbled,stone,their,mighty,keeps,and,barbicans,[END]
wispy,banners,swirled,from,atop,their,towers,and,reached,for,the,fast-fading,stars,[END]
the,sun,was,coming,up,behind,them,and,she,watched,them,go,from,black,to,grey,to,a,thousand,shades,of,rose,and,gold,and,crimson,[END]
soon,the,wind,mushed,them,together,and,there,was,only,one,castle,where,there,had,been,two,[END]
she,heard,the,door,open,as,her,maids,brought,the,hot,water,for,her,bath,[END]

it,was,traditional,in,the,reach,to,give,presents,to,bride,and,groom,on,the,morning,of,their,wedding,on,the,morrow,they,would,receive,more,presents,as,a,couple,but,today's,tokens,were,for,their,separate,persons,[END]

but,for,once,the,dwarf,filled,his,mouth,with,wine,instead,of,words,[END]

a,great,sword,must,have,a,great,name,my,lords,[END]
what,shall,i,call,it,[END]
sansa,remembered,lion's,tooth,the,sword,arya,had,flung,into,the,trident,and,hearteater,the,one,he'd,made,her,kiss,before,the,battle,[END]

the,guests,were,shouting,out,names,for,the,new,blade,[END]
joff,dismissed,a,dozen,before,he,heard,one,he,liked,[END]

it,took,him,half,a,dozen,further,cuts,to,hack,the,thick,tome,apart,and,the,boy,was,breathless,by,the,time,he,was,done,[END]
sansa,could,feel,her,husband,struggling,with,his,fury,as,ser,osmund,kettleblack,shouted,i,pray,you,never,turn,that,wicked,edge,on,me,sire,[END]

joffrey,flicked,a,chunk,of,lives,of,four,kings,off,the,table,at,swordpoint,then,slid,widow's,wail,back,into,its,scabbard,[END]
your,grace,ser,garlan,tyrell,said,[END]

in,all,of,westeros,there,were,but,four,copies,of,that,book,illuminated,in,kaeth's,own,hand,[END]
now,there,are,three,[END]

you,and,lady,sansa,owe,me,a,better,present,uncle,imp,[END]
this,one,is,all,chopped,to,pieces,[END]
tyrion,was,staring,at,his,nephew,with,his,mismatched,eyes,[END]

to,match,your,sword,[END]
a,dagger,of,the,same,fine,valyrian,steel,[END]
with,a,dragonbone,hilt,say,[END]
joff,gave,him,a,sharp,look,[END]

a,[END]
a,gold,hilt,with,rubies,in,it,[END]
dragonbone,is,too,plain,[END]
as,you,wish,your,grace,[END]
tyrion,drank,another,cup,of,wine,[END]
he,might,have,been,all,alone,in,his,solar,for,all,the,attention,he,paid,sansa,[END]
but,when,the,time,came,to,leave,for,the,wedding,he,took,her,by,the,hand,[END]
as,they,were,crossing,the,yard,prince,oberyn,of,dorne,fell,in,beside,them,his,black-haired,paramour,on,his,arm,[END]
sansa,glanced,at,the,woman,curiously,[END]
she,was,baseborn,and,unwed,and,had,borne,two,bastard,daughters,for,the,prince,but,she,did,not,fear,to,look,even,the,queen,in,the,eye,[END]
shae,had,told,her,that,this,ellaria,worshiped,some,lysene,love,goddess,[END]
she,was,almost,a,whore,when,he,found,her,m'lady,her,maid,confided,and,now,she's,near,a,princess,[END]
sansa,had,never,been,this,close,to,the,dornishwoman,before,[END]
she,is,not,truly,beautiful,she,thought,but,something,about,her,draws,the,eye,[END]
i,once,had,the,great,good,fortune,to,see,the,citadel's,copy,of,lives,of,four,kings,prince,oberyn,was,telling,her,lord,husband,[END]
the,illuminations,were,wondrous,to,behold,but,kaeth,was,too,kind,by,half,to,king,viserys,[END]
tyrion,gave,him,a,sharp,look,[END]
too,kind,[END]
he,scants,viserys,shamefully,in,my,view,[END]
it,should,have,been,lives,of,five,kings,[END]
the,prince,laughed,[END]
viserys,hardly,reigned,a,fortnight,[END]
he,reigned,more,than,a,year,said,tyrion,[END]
oberyn,gave,a,shrug,[END]
a,year,or,a,fortnight,what,does,it,matter,[END]
he,poisoned,his,own,nephew,to,gain,the,throne,and,then,did,nothing,once,he,had,it,[END]
baelor,starved,himself,to,death,fasting,said,tyrion,[END]
his,uncle,served,him,loyally,as,hand,as,he,had,served,the,young,dragon,before,him,[END]
viserys,might,only,have,reigned,a,year,but,he,ruled,for,fifteen,while,daeron,warred,and,baelor,prayed,[END]
he,made,a,sour,face,[END]
and,if,he,did,remove,his,nephew,can,you,blame,him,[END]
someone,had,to,save,the,realm,from,baelor's,follies,[END]
sansa,was,shocked,[END]
but,baelor,the,blessed,was,a,great,king,[END]
he,walked,the,boneway,barefoot,to,make,peace,with,dorne,and,rescued,the,dragonknight,from,a,snakepit,[END]
the,vipers,refused,to,strike,him,because,he,was,so,pure,and,holy,[END]
prince,oberyn,smiled,[END]
if,you,were,a,viper,my,lady,would,you,want,to,bite,a,bloodless,stick,like,baelor,the,blessed,[END]
i'd,sooner,save,my,fangs,for,someone,juicier,[END]
my,prince,is,playing,with,you,lady,sansa,said,the,woman,ellaria,sand,[END]
the,septons,and,singers,like,to,say,that,the,snakes,did,not,bite,baelor,but,the,truth,is,very,different,[END]
he,was,bitten,half,a,hundred,times,and,should,have,died,from,it,[END]
if,he,had,viserys,would,have,reigned,a,dozen,years,said,tyrion,and,the,seven,kingdoms,might,have,been,better,served,[END]
some,believe,baelor,was,deranged,by,all,that,venom,[END]
yes,said,prince,oberyn,but,i've,seen,no,snakes,in,this,red,keep,of,yours,[END]
so,how,do,you,account,for,joffrey,[END]
i,prefer,not,to,[END]
tyrion,inclined,his,head,stiffly,[END]
if,you,will,excuse,us,[END]
our,litter,awaits,[END]
the,dwarf,helped,sansa,up,inside,and,clambered,awkwardly,after,her,[END]
close,the,curtains,my,lady,if,you'd,be,so,good,[END]
must,we,my,lord,[END]
sansa,did,not,want,to,be,shut,behind,the,curtains,[END]
the,day,is,so,lovely,[END]
the,good,people,of,king's,landing,are,like,to,throw,dung,at,the,litter,if,they,see,me,inside,it,[END]
do,us,both,a,kindness,my,lady,[END]
close,the,curtains,[END]
she,did,as,he,bid,her,[END]
they,sat,for,a,time,as,the,air,grew,warm,and,stuffy,around,them,[END]
i,was,sorry,about,your,book,my,lord,she,made,herself,say,[END]
it,was,joffrey's,book,[END]
he,might,have,learned,a,thing,or,two,if,he'd,read,it,[END]
he,sounded,distracted,[END]
i,should,have,known,better,[END]
i,should,have,seen,[END]
a,good,many,things,[END]
perhaps,the,dagger,will,please,him,more,[END]
when,the,dwarf,grimaced,his,scar,tightened,and,twisted,[END]
the,boy's,earned,himself,a,dagger,wouldn't,you,say,[END]
thankfully,tyrion,did,not,wait,for,her,reply,[END]

everyone,loved,him,[END]
he,and,tommen,fought,with,wooden,swords,i,remember,but,just,for,play,[END]
tyrion,lapsed,back,into,moody,silence,[END]
sansa,heard,the,distant,clank,of,chains,from,outside,the,portcullis,was,being,drawn,up,[END]
a,moment,later,there,was,a,shout,and,their,litter,swayed,into,motion,[END]
deprived,of,the,passing,scenery,she,chose,to,stare,at,her,folded,hands,uncomfortably,aware,of,her,husband's,mismatched,eyes,[END]
why,is,he,looking,at,me,that,way,[END]
you,loved,your,brothers,much,as,i,love,jaime,[END]
is,this,some,lannister,trap,to,make,me,speak,treason,[END]
my,brothers,were,traitors,and,they've,gone,to,traitors',graves,[END]
it,is,treason,to,love,a,traitor,[END]
her,little,husband,snorted,[END]
robb,rose,in,arms,against,his,rightful,king,[END]
by,law,that,made,him,a,traitor,[END]

that,is,good,to,know,my,lord,[END]
he,wanted,something,from,her,but,sansa,did,not,know,what,it,was,[END]
he,looks,like,a,starving,child,but,i,have,no,food,to,give,him,[END]
why,won't,he,leave,me,be,[END]
tyrion,rubbed,at,his,scarred,scabby,nose,yet,again,an,ugly,habit,that,drew,the,eye,to,his,ugly,face,[END]
you,have,never,asked,me,how,robb,died,or,your,lady,mother,[END]
i,[END]

rainbow,light,flashed,and,shimmered,every,time,the,high,septon,moved,his,head,but,tyrion,had,to,wonder,how,the,man,could,bear,the,weight,[END]
and,even,he,had,to,concede,that,joffrey,and,margaery,made,a,regal,couple,as,they,stood,side-by-side,between,the,towering,gilded,statues,of,the,father,and,the,mother,[END]
the,bride,was,lovely,in,ivory,silk,and,myrish,lace,her,skirts,decorated,with,floral,patterns,picked,out,in,seed,pearls,[END]
as,renly's,widow,she,might,have,worn,the,baratheon,colors,gold,and,black,yet,she,came,to,them,a,tyrell,in,a,maiden's,cloak,made,of,a,hundred,cloth-of-gold,roses,sewn,to,green,velvet,[END]
he,wondered,if,she,really,was,a,maiden,[END]
not,that,joffrey,is,like,to,know,the,difference,[END]
the,king,looked,near,as,splendid,as,his,bride,in,his,doublet,of,dusky,rose,beneath,a,cloak,of,deep,crimson,velvet,blazoned,with,his,stag,and,lion,[END]

if,i,ever,do,[END]
the,steps,seemed,longer,and,steeper,than,before,or,perhaps,it,was,just,that,he,was,tired,[END]

the,wind,came,in,strong,with,the,smell,of,salt,and,sea,and,pulled,at,his,plain,brown,cloak,[END]
at,the,north,window,he,leaned,against,the,sill,for,a,breath,of,the,cold,night,air,hoping,to,catch,a,glimpse,of,mad,prendos,raising,sail,but,the,sea,seemed,black,and,empty,as,far,as,the,eye,could,see,[END]

the,wings,of,the,stone,dragons,cast,great,black,shadows,in,the,light,from,the,nightfire,[END]

when,davos,left,the,window,his,shadow,went,before,him,tall,and,thin,and,fell,across,the,painted,table,like,a,sword,[END]

the,pain,in,his,leg,seemed,duller,nothing,he,could,not,stand,[END]
he,had,slept,in,his,breeches,and,tunic,and,smallclothes,for,the,added,warmth,so,he,had,only,to,pull,on,his,boots,and,don,leather,and,mail,and,cloak,[END]
the,horn,blew,again,two,long,blasts,so,he,slung,longclaw,over,one,shoulder,found,his,crutch,and,hobbled,down,the,steps,[END]

that,was,good,[END]
we,will,fight,a,battle,and,then,we'll,rest,[END]
alive,or,dead,we'll,rest,[END]

jon,took,a,heel,from,him,and,gnawed,on,it,[END]

satin,asked,anxiously,[END]
we,can,hope,so,[END]
there,were,worse,things,than,wildlings,in,the,dark,[END]

those,went,backward,too,the,giants,and,wildlings,behind,them,scrambling,to,get,out,of,their,way,[END]
in,half,a,heartbeat,the,whole,center,was,collapsing,[END]
the,horsemen,on,the,flanks,saw,themselves,being,abandoned,and,decided,to,fall,back,as,well,not,one,so,much,as,blooded,[END]
even,the,chariots,rumbled,off,having,done,nothing,but,look,fearsome,and,make,a,lot,of,noise,[END]
when,they,break,they,break,hard,jon,snow,thought,as,he,watched,them,reel,away,[END]
the,drums,had,all,gone,silent,[END]
how,do,you,like,that,music,mance,[END]
how,do,you,like,the,taste,of,the,dornishman's,wife,[END]

the,bloody,buggers,got,my,leg,[END]

the,wooden,one,[END]
a,ragged,cheer,went,up,[END]
zei,grabbed,owen,by,the,hands,spun,him,around,in,a,circle,and,gave,him,a,long,wet,kiss,right,there,for,all,to,see,[END]
she,tried,to,kiss,jon,too,but,he,held,her,by,the,shoulder,and,pushed,her,gently,but,firmly,away,[END]
no,he,said,[END]
i,am,done,with,kissing,[END]
suddenly,he,was,too,weary,to,stand,and,his,leg,was,agony,from,knee,to,groin,[END]
he,fumbled,for,his,crutch,[END]
pyp,help,me,to,the,cage,[END]
grenn,you,have,the,wall,[END]
me,[END]

him,[END]

it,was,hard,to,tell,which,of,them,was,more,horrified,[END]
but,grenn,stammered,b-but,what,do,i,do,if,the,wildlings,attack,again,[END]
stop,them,jon,told,him,[END]
as,they,rode,down,in,the,cage,pyp,took,off,his,helm,and,wiped,his,brow,[END]
frozen,sweat,[END]
is,there,anything,as,disgusting,as,frozen,sweat,[END]

when,he,saw,jon's,face,his,smile,died,[END]
what's,wrong,[END]
is,it,your,leg,[END]
my,leg,jon,agreed,[END]
even,the,words,were,an,effort,[END]
not,the,battle,though,[END]
we,won,the,battle,[END]

i,want,a,fire,a,hot,meal,a,warm,bed,and,something,to,make,my,leg,stop,hurting,he,told,himself,[END]
but,first,he,had,to,check,the,tunnel,and,find,what,had,become,of,donal,noye,[END]
after,the,battle,with,the,thenns,it,had,taken,them,almost,a,day,to,clear,the,ice,and,broken,beams,away,from,the,inner,gate,[END]
spotted,pate,and,kegs,and,some,of,the,other,builders,had,argued,heatedly,that,they,ought,just,leave,the,debris,there,another,obstacle,for,mance,[END]
that,would,have,meant,abandoning,the,defense,of,the,tunnel,though,and,noye,was,having,none,of,it,[END]
with,men,in,the,murder,holes,and,archers,and,spears,behind,each,inner,grate,a,few,determined,brothers,could,hold,off,a,hundred,times,as,many,wildlings,and,clog,the,way,with,corpses,[END]
he,did,not,mean,to,give,mance,rayder,free,passage,through,the,ice,[END]
so,with,pick,and,spade,and,ropes,they,had,moved,the,broken,steps,aside,and,dug,back,down,to,the,gate,[END]
jon,waited,by,the,cold,iron,bars,while,pyp,went,to,maester,aemon,for,the,spare,key,[END]
surprisingly,the,maester,himself,returned,with,him,and,clydas,with,a,lantern,[END]
come,see,me,when,we,are,done,the,old,man,told,jon,while,pyp,was,fumbling,with,the,chains,[END]

jon,nodded,weakly,[END]
the,door,swung,open,[END]
pyp,led,them,in,followed,by,clydas,and,the,lantern,[END]
it,was,all,jon,could,do,to,keep,up,with,maester,aemon,[END]
the,ice,pressed,close,around,them,and,he,could,feel,the,cold,seeping,into,his,bones,the,weight,of,the,wall,above,his,head,[END]
it,felt,like,walking,down,the,gullet,of,an,ice,dragon,[END]
the,tunnel,took,a,twist,and,then,another,[END]
pyp,unlocked,a,second,iron,gate,[END]
they,walked,farther,turned,again,and,saw,light,ahead,faint,and,pale,through,the,ice,[END]
that's,bad,jon,knew,at,once,[END]
that's,very,bad,[END]
then,pyp,said,there's,blood,on,the,floor,[END]
the,last,twenty,feet,of,the,tunnel,was,where,they'd,fought,and,died,[END]
the,outer,door,of,studded,oak,had,been,hacked,and,broken,and,finally,torn,off,its,hinges,and,one,of,the,giants,had,crawled,in,through,the,splinters,[END]
the,lantern,bathed,the,grisly,scene,in,a,sullen,reddish,light,[END]
pyp,turned,aside,to,retch,and,jon,found,himself,envying,maester,aemon,his,blindness,[END]
noye,and,his,men,had,been,waiting,within,behind,a,gate,of,heavy,iron,bars,like,the,two,pyp,had,just,unlocked,[END]
the,two,crossbows,had,gotten,off,a,dozen,quarrels,as,the,giant,struggled,toward,them,[END]
then,the,spearmen,must,have,come,to,the,fore,stabbing,through,the,bars,[END]
still,the,giant,found,the,strength,to,reach,through,twist,the,head,off,spotted,pate,seize,the,iron,gate,and,wrench,the,bars,apart,[END]
links,of,broken,chain,lay,strewn,across,the,floor,[END]
one,giant,[END]
all,this,was,the,work,of,one,giant,[END]
are,they,all,dead,[END]
maester,aemon,asked,softly,[END]
yes,[END]
donal,was,the,last,[END]
noye's,sword,was,sunk,deep,in,the,giant's,throat,halfway,to,the,hilt,[END]
the,armorer,had,always,seemed,such,a,big,man,to,jon,but,locked,in,the,giant's,massive,arms,he,looked,almost,like,a,child,[END]
the,giant,crushed,his,spine,[END]
i,don't,know,who,died,first,[END]
he,took,the,lantern,and,moved,forward,for,a,better,look,[END]
mag,[END]
i,am,the,last,of,the,giants,[END]
he,could,feel,the,sadness,there,but,he,had,no,time,for,sadness,[END]
it,was,mag,the,mighty,[END]
the,king,of,the,giants,[END]
he,needed,sun,then,[END]
it,was,too,cold,and,dark,inside,the,tunnel,and,the,stench,of,blood,and,death,was,suffocating,[END]
jon,gave,the,lantern,back,to,clydas,squeezed,around,the,bodies,and,through,the,twisted,bars,and,walked,toward,the,daylight,to,see,what,lay,beyond,the,splintered,door,[END]
the,huge,carcass,of,a,dead,mammoth,partially,blocked,the,way,[END]
one,of,the,beast's,tusks,snagged,his,cloak,and,tore,it,as,he,edged,past,[END]
three,more,giants,lay,outside,half,buried,beneath,stone,and,slush,and,hardened,pitch,[END]
he,could,see,where,the,fire,had,melted,the,wall,where,great,sheets,of,ice,had,come,sloughing,off,in,the,heat,to,shatter,on,the,blackened,ground,[END]
he,looked,up,at,where,they'd,come,from,[END]
when,you,stand,here,it,seems,immense,as,if,it,were,about,to,crush,you,[END]
jon,went,back,inside,to,where,the,others,waited,[END]
we,need,to,repair,the,outer,gate,as,best,we,can,and,then,block,up,this,section,of,the,tunnel,[END]
rubble,chunks,of,ice,anything,[END]
all,the,way,to,the,second,gate,if,we,can,[END]

we,have,to,tell,him,[END]
tell,him,what,you,will,said,maester,aemon,gently,[END]
he,will,smile,nod,and,forget,[END]
thirty,years,ago,ser,wynton,stout,came,within,a,dozen,votes,of,being,lord,commander,[END]
he,would,have,made,a,fine,one,[END]

no,longer,[END]
you,know,that,as,well,as,donal,did,jon,[END]
it,was,true,[END]
you,give,the,order,then,jon,told,the,maester,[END]

arya,[END]
she,could,feel,the,hole,inside,her,every,morning,when,she,woke,[END]
it,wasn't,hunger,though,sometimes,there,was,that,too,[END]
it,was,a,hollow,place,an,emptiness,where,her,heart,had,been,where,her,brothers,had,lived,and,her,parents,[END]
her,head,hurt,too,[END]
not,as,bad,as,it,had,at,first,but,still,pretty,bad,[END]
arya,was,used,to,that,though,and,at,least,the,lump,was,going,down,[END]
but,the,hole,inside,her,stayed,the,same,[END]
the,hole,will,never,feel,any,better,she,told,herself,when,she,went,to,sleep,[END]
some,mornings,arya,did,not,want,to,wake,at,all,[END]
she,would,huddle,beneath,her,cloak,with,her,eyes,squeezed,shut,and,try,to,will,herself,back,to,sleep,[END]
if,the,hound,would,only,have,left,her,alone,she,would,have,slept,all,day,and,all,night,[END]
and,dreamed,[END]
that,was,the,best,part,the,dreaming,[END]
she,dreamed,of,wolves,most,every,night,[END]
a,great,pack,of,wolves,with,her,at,the,head,[END]
she,was,bigger,than,any,of,them,stronger,swifter,faster,[END]
she,could,outrun,horses,and,outfight,lions,[END]
when,she,bared,her,teeth,even,men,would,run,from,her,her,belly,was,never,empty,long,and,her,fur,kept,her,warm,even,when,the,wind,was,blowing,cold,[END]
and,her,brothers,and,sisters,were,with,her,many,and,more,of,them,fierce,and,terrible,and,hers,[END]
they,would,never,leave,her,[END]
but,if,her,nights,were,full,of,wolves,her,days,belonged,to,the,dog,[END]
sandor,clegane,made,her,get,up,every,morning,whether,she,wanted,to,or,not,[END]
he,would,curse,at,her,in,his,raspy,voice,or,yank,her,to,her,feet,and,shake,her,[END]
once,he,dumped,a,helm,full,of,cold,water,all,over,her,head,[END]
she,bounced,up,sputtering,and,shivering,and,tried,to,kick,him,but,he,only,laughed,[END]
dry,off,and,feed,the,bloody,horses,he,told,her,and,she,did,[END]
they,had,two,now,stranger,and,a,sorrel,palfrey,mare,arya,had,named,craven,because,sandor,said,she'd,likely,run,off,from,the,twins,the,same,as,them,[END]
they'd,found,her,wandering,riderless,through,a,field,the,morning,after,the,slaughter,[END]
she,was,a,good,enough,horse,but,arya,could,not,love,a,coward,[END]
stranger,would,have,fought,[END]
still,she,tended,the,mare,as,best,she,knew,[END]
it,was,better,than,riding,double,with,the,hound,[END]
and,craven,might,have,been,a,coward,but,she,was,young,and,strong,as,well,[END]
arya,thought,that,she,might,be,able,to,outrun,stranger,if,it,came,to,it,[END]
the,hound,no,longer,watched,her,as,closely,as,he,had,[END]
sometimes,he,did,not,seem,to,care,whether,she,stayed,or,went,and,he,no,longer,bound,her,up,in,a,cloak,at,night,[END]
one,night,i'll,kill,him,in,his,sleep,she,told,herself,but,she,never,did,[END]
one,day,i'll,ride,away,on,craven,and,he,won't,be,able,to,catch,me,she,thought,but,she,never,did,that,either,[END]
where,would,she,go,[END]
winterfell,was,gone,[END]
her,grandfather's,brother,was,at,riverrun,but,he,didn't,know,her,no,more,than,she,knew,him,[END]
maybe,lady,smallwood,would,take,her,in,at,acorn,hall,but,maybe,she,wouldn't,[END]
besides,arya,wasn't,even,sure,she,could,find,acorn,hall,again,[END]
sometimes,she,thought,she,might,go,back,to,sharna's,inn,if,the,floods,hadn't,washed,it,away,[END]
she,could,stay,with,hot,pie,or,maybe,lord,beric,would,find,her,there,[END]
anguy,would,teach,her,to,use,a,bow,and,she,could,ride,with,gendry,and,be,an,outlaw,like,wenda,the,white,fawn,in,the,songs,[END]
but,that,was,just,stupid,like,something,sansa,might,dream,[END]
hot,pie,and,gendry,had,left,her,just,as,soon,as,they,could,and,lord,beric,and,the,outlaws,only,wanted,to,ransom,her,just,like,the,hound,[END]
none,of,them,wanted,her,around,[END]
they,were,never,my,pack,not,even,hot,pie,and,gendry,[END]
i,was,stupid,to,think,so,just,a,stupid,little,girl,and,no,wolf,at,all,[END]
so,she,stayed,with,the,hound,[END]
they,rode,every,day,never,sleeping,twice,in,the,same,place,avoiding,towns,and,villages,and,castles,as,best,they,could,[END]
once,she,asked,sandor,clegane,where,they,were,going,[END]
away,he,said,[END]
that's,all,you,need,to,know,[END]
you're,not,worth,spit,to,me,now,and,i,don't,want,to,hear,your,whining,[END]
i,should,have,let,you,run,into,that,bloody,castle,[END]
you,should,have,she,agreed,thinking,of,her,mother,[END]
you'd,be,dead,if,i,had,[END]
you,ought,to,thank,me,[END]
you,ought,to,sing,me,a,pretty,little,song,the,way,your,sister,did,[END]
did,you,hit,her,with,an,axe,too,[END]
i,hit,you,with,the,flat,of,the,axe,you,stupid,little,bitch,[END]
if,i'd,hit,you,with,the,blade,there'd,still,be,chunks,of,your,head,floating,down,the,green,fork,[END]
now,shut,your,bloody,mouth,[END]
if,i,had,any,sense,i'd,give,you,to,the,silent,sisters,[END]
they,cut,the,tongues,out,of,girls,who,talk,too,much,[END]
that,wasn't,fair,of,him,to,say,[END]
aside,from,that,one,time,arya,hardly,talked,at,all,[END]
whole,days,passed,when,neither,of,them,said,anything,[END]
she,was,too,empty,to,talk,and,the,hound,was,too,angry,[END]
she,could,feel,the,fury,in,him,she,could,see,it,on,his,face,the,way,his,mouth,would,tighten,and,twist,the,looks,he,gave,her,[END]
whenever,he,took,his,axe,to,chop,some,wood,for,a,fire,he,would,slide,into,a,cold,rage,hacking,savagely,at,the,tree,or,the,deadfall,or,the,broken,limb,until,they,had,twenty,times,as,much,kindling,and,firewood,as,they'd,needed,[END]
sometimes,he,would,be,so,sore,and,tired,afterward,that,he,would,lie,down,and,go,right,to,sleep,without,even,lighting,a,fire,[END]
arya,hated,it,when,that,happened,and,hated,him,too,[END]
those,were,the,nights,when,she,stared,the,longest,at,the,axe,[END]
it,looks,awfully,heavy,but,i,bet,i,could,swing,it,[END]
she,wouldn't,hit,him,with,the,flat,either,[END]
sometimes,in,their,wanderings,they,glimpsed,other,people,farmers,in,their,fields,swineherds,with,their,pigs,a,milkmaid,leading,a,cow,a,squire,carrying,a,message,down,a,rutted,road,[END]
she,never,wanted,to,speak,to,them,either,[END]
it,was,as,if,they,lived,in,some,distant,land,and,spoke,a,queer,alien,tongue,they,had,nothing,to,do,with,her,or,her,with,them,[END]
besides,it,wasn't,safe,to,be,seen,[END]
from,time,to,time,columns,of,horsemen,passed,down,the,winding,farm,roads,the,twin,towers,of,frey,flying,before,them,[END]
hunting,for,stray,northmen,the,hound,said,when,they,had,passed,[END]
any,time,you,hear,hooves,get,your,head,down,fast,it's,not,like,to,be,a,friend,[END]
one,day,in,an,earthen,hollow,made,by,the,roots,of,a,fallen,oak,they,came,face,to,face,with,another,survivor,of,the,twins,[END]
the,badge,on,his,breast,showed,a,pink,maiden,dancing,in,a,swirl,of,silk,and,he,told,them,he,was,ser,marq,piper's,man,a,bowman,though,he'd,lost,his,bow,[END]
his,left,shoulder,was,all,twisted,and,swollen,where,it,met,his,arm,a,blow,from,a,mace,he,said,it,had,broken,his,shoulder,and,smashed,his,chainmail,deep,into,his,flesh,[END]
a,northman,it,was,he,wept,[END]
his,badge,was,a,bloody,man,and,he,saw,mine,and,made,a,jape,red,man,and,pink,maiden,maybe,they,should,get,together,[END]
i,drank,to,his,lord,bolton,he,drank,to,ser,marq,and,we,drank,together,to,lord,edmure,and,lady,roslin,and,the,king,in,the,north,[END]
and,then,he,killed,me,[END]
his,eyes,were,fever,bright,when,he,said,that,and,arya,could,tell,that,it,was,true,[END]
his,shoulder,was,swollen,grotesquely,and,pus,and,blood,had,stained,his,whole,left,side,[END]
there,was,a,stink,to,him,too,[END]
he,smells,like,a,corpse,[END]
the,man,begged,them,for,a,drink,of,wine,[END]
if,i'd,had,any,wine,i'd,have,drunk,it,myself,the,hound,told,him,[END]
i,can,give,you,water,and,the,gift,of,mercy,[END]
the,archer,looked,at,him,a,long,while,before,he,said,you're,joffrey's,dog,[END]
my,own,dog,now,[END]
do,you,want,the,water,[END]
aye,[END]
the,man,swallowed,[END]
and,the,mercy,[END]
please,[END]
they,had,passed,a,small,pond,a,short,ways,back,[END]
sandor,gave,arya,his,helm,and,told,her,to,fill,it,so,she,trudged,back,to,the,water's,edge,[END]
mud,squished,over,the,toe,of,her,boots,[END]
she,used,the,dog's,head,as,a,pail,[END]
water,ran,out,through,the,eyeholes,but,the,bottom,of,the,helm,still,held,a,lot,[END]
when,she,came,back,the,archer,turned,his,face,up,and,she,poured,the,water,into,his,mouth,[END]
he,gulped,it,down,as,fast,as,she,could,pour,and,what,he,couldn't,gulp,ran,down,his,cheeks,into,the,brown,blood,that,crusted,his,whiskers,until,pale,pink,tears,dangled,from,his,beard,[END]
when,the,water,was,gone,he,clutched,the,helm,and,licked,the,steel,[END]
good,he,said,[END]
i,wish,it,was,wine,though,[END]
i,wanted,wine,[END]
me,too,[END]
the,hound,eased,his,dagger,into,the,man's,chest,almost,tenderly,the,weight,of,his,body,driving,the,point,through,his,surcoat,ringmail,and,the,quilting,beneath,[END]
as,he,slid,the,blade,back,out,and,wiped,it,on,the,dead,man,he,looked,at,arya,[END]
that's,where,the,heart,is,girl,[END]
that's,how,you,kill,a,man,[END]
that's,one,way,[END]
will,we,bury,him,[END]
why,[END]
sandor,said,[END]
he,don't,care,and,we've,got,no,spade,[END]
leave,him,for,the,wolves,and,wild,dogs,[END]
your,brothers,and,mine,[END]
he,gave,her,a,hard,look,[END]
first,we,rob,him,though,[END]
there,were,two,silver,stags,in,the,archer's,purse,and,almost,thirty,coppers,[END]
his,dagger,had,a,pretty,pink,stone,in,the,hilt,[END]
the,hound,hefted,the,knife,in,his,hand,then,flipped,it,toward,arya,[END]
she,caught,it,by,the,hilt,slid,it,through,her,belt,and,felt,a,little,better,[END]
it,wasn't,needle,but,it,was,steel,[END]
the,dead,man,had,a,quiver,of,arrows,too,but,arrows,weren't,much,good,without,a,bow,[END]
his,boots,were,too,big,for,arya,and,too,small,for,the,hound,so,those,they,left,[END]
she,took,his,kettle,helm,as,well,even,though,it,came,down,almost,past,her,nose,so,she,had,to,tilt,it,back,to,see,[END]
he,must,have,had,a,horse,as,well,or,he,wouldn't,have,got,away,clegane,said,peering,about,but,it's,bloody,well,gone,i'd,say,[END]
no,telling,how,long,he's,been,here,[END]
by,the,time,they,found,themselves,in,the,foothills,of,the,mountains,of,the,moon,the,rains,had,mostly,stopped,[END]
arya,could,see,the,sun,and,moon,and,stars,and,it,seemed,to,her,that,they,were,heading,eastward,[END]
where,are,we,going,[END]
she,asked,again,[END]
this,time,the,hound,answered,her,[END]
you,have,an,aunt,in,the,eyrie,[END]
might,be,she'll,want,to,ransom,your,scrawny,arse,though,the,gods,know,why,[END]

the,thought,left,arya,feeling,empty,[END]
it,was,her,mother,she,wanted,not,her,mother's,sister,[END]
she,didn't,know,her,mother's,sister,any,more,than,she,knew,her,great,uncle,blackfish,[END]
we,should,have,gone,into,the,castle,[END]
they,didn't,really,know,that,her,mother,was,dead,or,robb,either,[END]
it,wasn't,like,they'd,seen,them,die,or,anything,[END]
maybe,lord,frey,had,just,taken,them,captive,[END]
maybe,they,were,chained,up,in,his,dungeon,or,maybe,the,freys,were,taking,them,to,king's,landing,so,joffrey,could,chop,their,heads,off,[END]
they,didn't,know,[END]
we,should,go,back,she,suddenly,decided,[END]
we,should,go,back,to,the,twins,and,get,my,mother,[END]
she,can't,be,dead,[END]
we,have,to,help,her,[END]
i,thought,your,sister,was,the,one,with,a,head,full,of,songs,the,hound,growled,[END]
frey,might,have,kept,your,mother,alive,to,ransom,that's,true,[END]
but,there's,no,way,in,seven,hells,i'm,going,to,pluck,her,out,of,his,castle,all,by,my,bloody,self,[END]
not,by,yourself,[END]
i'd,come,too,[END]
he,made,a,sound,that,was,almost,a,laugh,[END]
that,will,scare,the,piss,out,of,the,old,man,[END]
you're,just,afraid,to,die,[END]
she,said,scornfully,[END]
now,clegane,did,laugh,[END]
death,don't,scare,me,[END]
only,fire,[END]
now,be,quiet,or,i'll,cut,your,tongue,out,myself,and,save,the,silent,sisters,the,bother,[END]
it's,the,vale,for,us,[END]
arya,didn't,think,he'd,really,cut,her,tongue,out,he,was,just,saying,that,the,way,pinkeye,used,to,say,he'd,beat,her,bloody,[END]
all,the,same,she,wasn't,going,to,try,him,[END]
sandor,clegane,was,no,pinkeye,[END]
pinkeye,didn't,cut,people,in,half,or,hit,them,with,axes,[END]
not,even,with,the,flat,of,axes,[END]
that,night,she,went,to,sleep,thinking,of,her,mother,and,wondering,if,she,should,kill,the,hound,in,his,sleep,and,rescue,lady,catelyn,herself,[END]
when,she,closed,her,eyes,she,saw,her,mother's,face,against,the,back,of,her,eyelids,[END]
she's,so,close,i,could,almost,smell,her,[END]
and,then,she,could,smell,her,[END]
the,scent,was,faint,beneath,the,other,smells,beneath,moss,and,mud,and,water,and,the,stench,of,rotting,reeds,and,rotting,men,[END]
she,padded,slowly,through,the,soft,ground,to,the,river's,edge,lapped,up,a,drink,the,lifted,her,head,to,sniff,[END]
the,sky,was,grey,and,thick,with,cloud,the,river,green,and,full,of,floating,things,[END]
dead,men,clogged,the,shallows,some,still,moving,as,the,water,pushed,them,others,washed,up,on,the,banks,[END]
her,brothers,and,sisters,swarmed,around,them,tearing,at,the,rich,ripe,flesh,[END]
the,crows,were,there,too,screaming,at,the,wolves,and,filling,the,air,with,feathers,[END]
their,blood,was,hotter,and,one,of,her,sisters,had,snapped,at,one,as,it,took,flight,and,caught,it,by,the,wing,[END]
it,made,her,want,a,crow,herself,[END]
she,wanted,to,taste,the,blood,to,hear,the,bones,crunch,between,her,teeth,to,fill,her,belly,with,warm,flesh,instead,of,cold,[END]
she,was,hungry,and,the,meat,was,all,around,but,she,knew,she,could,not,eat,[END]
the,scent,was,stronger,now,[END]
she,pricked,her,ears,up,and,listened,to,the,grumbles,of,her,pack,the,shriek,of,angry,crows,the,whirr,of,wings,and,sound,of,running,water,[END]
somewhere,far,off,she,could,hear,horses,and,the,calls,of,living,men,but,they,were,not,what,mattered,[END]
only,the,scent,mattered,[END]
she,sniffed,the,air,again,[END]
there,it,was,and,now,she,saw,it,too,something,pale,and,white,drifting,down,the,river,turning,where,it,brushed,against,a,snag,[END]
the,reeds,bowed,down,before,it,[END]
she,splashed,noisily,through,the,shallows,and,threw,herself,into,the,deeper,water,her,legs,churning,[END]
the,current,was,strong,but,she,was,stronger,[END]
she,swam,following,her,nose,[END]
the,river,smells,were,rich,and,wet,but,those,were,not,the,smells,that,pulled,her,[END]
she,paddled,after,the,sharp,red,whisper,of,cold,blood,the,sweet,cloying,stench,of,death,[END]
she,chased,them,as,she,had,often,chased,a,red,deer,through,the,trees,and,in,the,end,she,ran,them,down,and,her,jaw,closed,around,a,pale,white,arm,[END]
she,shook,it,to,make,it,move,but,there,was,only,death,and,blood,in,her,mouth,[END]
by,now,she,was,tiring,and,it,was,all,she,could,do,to,pull,the,body,back,to,shore,[END]
as,she,dragged,it,up,the,muddy,bank,one,of,her,little,brothers,came,prowling,his,tongue,lolling,from,his,mouth,[END]
she,had,to,snarl,to,drive,him,off,or,else,he,would,have,fed,[END]
only,then,did,she,stop,to,shake,the,water,from,her,fur,[END]
the,white,thing,lay,facedown,in,the,mud,her,dead,flesh,wrinkled,and,pale,cold,blood,trickling,from,her,throat,[END]
rise,she,thought,[END]
rise,and,eat,and,run,with,us,[END]
the,sound,of,horses,turned,her,head,[END]
men,[END]
they,were,coming,from,downwind,so,she,had,not,smelled,them,but,now,they,were,almost,here,[END]
men,on,horses,with,flapping,black,and,yellow,and,pink,wings,and,long,shiny,claws,in,hand,[END]
some,of,her,younger,brothers,bared,their,teeth,to,defend,the,food,they'd,found,but,she,snapped,at,them,until,they,scattered,[END]
that,was,the,way,of,the,wild,[END]
deer,and,hares,and,crows,fled,before,wolves,and,wolves,fled,from,men,[END]
she,abandoned,the,cold,white,prize,in,the,mud,where,she,had,dragged,it,and,ran,and,felt,no,shame,[END]
when,morning,came,the,hound,did,not,need,to,shout,at,arya,or,shake,her,awake,[END]
she,had,woken,before,him,for,a,change,and,even,watered,the,horses,[END]
they,broke,their,fast,in,silence,until,sandor,said,this,thing,about,your,mother,[END]
it,doesn't,matter,arya,said,in,a,dull,voice,[END]
i,know,she's,dead,[END]
i,saw,her,in,a,dream,[END]
the,hound,looked,at,her,a,long,time,then,nodded,[END]
no,more,was,said,of,it,[END]
they,rode,on,toward,the,mountains,[END]
in,the,higher,hills,they,came,upon,a,tiny,isolated,village,surrounded,by,grey-green,sentinels,and,tall,blue,soldier,pines,and,clegane,decided,to,risk,going,in,[END]
we,need,food,he,said,and,a,roof,over,our,heads,[END]
they're,not,like,to,know,what,happened,at,the,twins,and,with,any,luck,they,won't,know,me,[END]
the,villagers,were,building,a,wooden,palisade,around,their,homes,and,when,they,saw,the,breadth,of,the,hound's,shoulders,they,offered,them,food,and,shelter,and,even,coin,for,work,[END]
if,there's,wine,as,well,i'll,do,it,he,growled,at,them,[END]
in,the,end,he,settled,for,ale,and,drank,himself,to,sleep,each,night,[END]
his,dream,of,selling,arya,to,lady,arryn,died,there,in,the,hills,though,[END]
there's,frost,above,us,and,snow,in,the,high,passes,the,village,elder,said,[END]
if,you,don't,freeze,or,starve,the,shadowcats,will,get,you,or,the,cave,bears,[END]
there's,the,clans,as,well,[END]
the,burned,men,are,fearless,since,timett,one-eye,came,back,from,the,war,[END]
and,half,a,year,ago,gunthor,son,of,gurn,led,the,stone,crows,down,on,a,village,not,eight,miles,from,here,[END]
they,took,every,woman,and,every,scrap,of,grain,and,killed,half,the,men,[END]
they,have,steel,now,good,swords,and,mail,hauberks,and,they,watch,the,high,road,the,stone,crows,the,milk,snakes,the,sons,of,the,mist,all,of,them,[END]
might,be,you'd,take,a,few,with,you,but,in,the,end,they'd,kill,you,and,make,off,with,your,daughter,[END]
i'm,not,his,daughter,arya,might,have,shouted,if,she,hadn't,felt,so,tired,[END]
she,was,no,one's,daughter,now,[END]
she,was,no,one,[END]
not,arya,not,weasel,not,nan,nor,arry,nor,squab,not,even,lumpyhead,[END]
she,was,only,some,girl,who,ran,with,a,dog,by,day,and,dreamed,of,wolves,by,night,[END]
it,was,quiet,in,the,village,[END]
they,had,beds,stuffed,with,straw,and,not,too,many,lice,the,food,was,plain,but,filling,and,the,air,smelled,of,pines,[END]
all,the,same,arya,soon,decided,that,she,hated,it,[END]
the,villagers,were,cowards,[END]
none,of,them,would,even,look,at,the,hound's,face,at,least,not,for,long,[END]
some,of,the,women,tried,to,put,her,in,a,dress,and,make,her,do,needlework,but,they,weren't,lady,smallwood,and,she,was,having,none,of,it,[END]
and,there,was,one,girl,who,took,to,following,her,the,village,elder's,daughter,[END]
she,was,of,an,age,with,arya,but,just,a,child,she,cried,if,she,skinned,a,knee,and,carried,a,stupid,cloth,doll,with,her,everywhere,she,went,[END]
the,doll,was,made,up,to,look,like,a,man-at-arms,sort,of,so,the,girl,called,him,ser,soldier,and,bragged,how,he,kept,her,safe,[END]
go,away,arya,told,her,half,a,hundred,times,[END]
just,leave,me,be,[END]
she,wouldn't,though,so,finally,arya,took,the,doll,away,from,her,ripped,it,open,and,pulled,the,rag,stuffing,out,of,its,belly,with,a,finger,[END]
now,he,really,looks,like,a,soldier,[END]
she,said,before,she,threw,the,doll,in,a,brook,[END]
after,that,the,girl,stopped,pestering,her,and,arya,spent,her,days,grooming,craven,and,stranger,or,walking,in,the,woods,[END]
sometimes,she,would,find,a,stick,and,practice,her,needlework,but,then,she,would,remember,what,had,happened,at,the,twins,and,smash,it,against,a,tree,until,it,broke,[END]
might,be,we,should,stay,here,awhile,the,hound,told,her,after,a,fortnight,[END]
he,was,drunk,on,ale,but,more,brooding,than,sleepy,[END]
we'd,never,reach,the,eyrie,and,the,freys,will,still,be,hunting,survivors,in,the,riverlands,[END]
sounds,like,they,need,swords,here,with,these,clansmen,raiding,[END]
we,can,rest,up,maybe,find,a,way,to,get,a,letter,to,your,aunt,[END]
arya's,face,darkened,when,she,heard,that,[END]
she,didn't,want,to,stay,but,there,was,nowhere,to,go,either,[END]
the,next,morning,when,the,hound,went,off,to,chop,down,trees,and,haul,logs,she,crawled,back,into,bed,[END]
but,when,the,work,was,done,and,the,tall,wooden,palisade,was,finished,the,village,elder,made,it,plain,that,there,was,no,place,for,them,[END]
come,winter,we,will,be,hard,pressed,to,feed,our,own,he,explained,[END]
and,you,[END]
a,man,like,you,brings,blood,with,him,[END]
sandor's,mouth,tightened,[END]
so,you,do,know,who,i,am,[END]
aye,[END]
we,don't,get,travelers,here,that's,so,but,we,go,to,market,and,to,fairs,[END]
we,know,about,king,joffrey's,dog,[END]
when,these,stone,crows,come,calling,you,might,be,glad,to,have,a,dog,[END]
might,be,[END]
the,man,hesitated,then,gathered,up,his,courage,[END]
but,they,say,you,lost,your,belly,for,fighting,at,the,blackwater,[END]
they,say,[END]
i,know,what,they,say,[END]
sandor's,voice,sounded,like,two,woodsaws,grinding,together,[END]
pay,me,and,we'll,be,gone,[END]
when,they,left,the,hound,had,a,pouch,full,of,coppers,a,skin,of,sour,ale,and,a,new,sword,[END]
it,was,a,very,old,sword,if,truth,be,told,though,new,to,him,[END]
he,swapped,its,owner,the,longaxe,he'd,taken,at,the,twins,the,one,he'd,used,to,raise,the,lump,on,arya's,head,[END]
the,ale,was,gone,in,less,than,a,day,but,clegane,sharpened,the,sword,every,night,cursing,the,man,he'd,swapped,with,for,every,nick,and,spot,of,rust,[END]
if,he,lost,his,belly,for,fighting,why,does,he,care,if,his,sword,is,sharp,[END]
it,was,not,a,question,arya,dared,ask,him,but,she,thought,on,it,a,lot,[END]
was,that,why,he'd,run,from,the,twins,and,carried,her,off,[END]
back,in,the,riverlands,they,found,that,the,rains,had,ebbed,away,and,the,flood,waters,had,begun,to,recede,[END]
the,hound,turned,south,back,toward,the,trident,[END]
we'll,make,for,riverrun,he,told,arya,as,they,roasted,a,hare,he'd,killed,[END]
maybe,the,blackfish,wants,to,buy,himself,a,she-wolf,[END]
he,doesn't,know,me,[END]
he,won't,even,know,i'm,really,me,[END]
arya,was,tired,of,making,for,riverrun,[END]
she,had,been,making,for,riverrun,for,years,it,seemed,without,ever,getting,there,[END]
every,time,she,made,for,riverrun,she,ended,up,someplace,worse,[END]
he,won't,give,you,any,ransom,[END]
he'll,probably,just,hang,you,[END]
he's,free,to,try,[END]
he,turned,the,spit,[END]
he,doesn't,talk,like,he's,lost,his,belly,for,fighting,[END]
i,know,where,we,could,go,arya,said,[END]
she,still,had,one,brother,left,[END]
jon,will,want,me,even,if,no,one,else,does,[END]
he'll,call,me,little,sister,and,muss,my,hair,[END]
it,was,a,long,way,though,and,she,didn't,think,she,could,get,there,by,herself,[END]
she,hadn't,even,been,able,to,reach,riverrun,[END]
we,could,go,to,the,wall,[END]
sandor's,laugh,was,half,a,growl,[END]
the,little,wolf,bitch,wants,to,join,the,night's,watch,does,she,[END]
my,brother's,on,the,wall,she,said,stubbornly,[END]
his,mouth,gave,a,twitch,[END]
the,wall's,a,thousand,leagues,from,here,[END]
we'd,need,to,fight,through,the,bloody,freys,just,to,reach,the,neck,[END]
there's,lizard,lions,in,those,swamps,that,eat,wolves,every,day,for,breakfast,[END]
and,if,we,did,reach,the,north,with,our,skins,intact,there's,ironborn,in,half,the,castles,and,thousands,of,bloody,buggering,northmen,as,well,[END]
are,you,scared,of,them,[END]
she,asked,[END]
have,you,lost,your,belly,for,fighting,[END]
for,a,moment,she,thought,he,was,going,to,hit,her,[END]
by,then,the,hare,was,brown,though,skin,crackling,and,grease,popping,as,it,dripped,down,into,the,cookfire,[END]
sandor,took,it,off,the,stick,ripped,it,apart,with,his,big,hands,and,tossed,half,of,it,into,arya's,lap,[END]
there's,nothing,wrong,with,my,belly,he,said,as,he,pulled,off,a,leg,but,i,don't,give,a,rat's,arse,for,you,or,your,brother,[END]
i,have,a,brother,too,[END]
tyrion,[END]
tyrion,ser,kevan,lannister,said,wearily,if,you,are,indeed,innocent,of,joffrey's,death,you,should,have,no,difficulty,proving,it,at,trial,[END]
tyrion,turned,from,the,window,[END]
who,is,to,judge,me,[END]
justice,belongs,to,the,throne,[END]
the,king,is,dead,but,your,father,remains,hand,[END]
since,it,is,his,own,son,who,stands,accused,and,his,grandson,who,was,the,victim,he,has,asked,lord,tyrell,and,prince,oberyn,to,sit,in,judgment,with,him,[END]
tyrion,was,scarcely,reassured,[END]
mace,tyrell,had,been,joffrey's,good-father,however,briefly,and,the,red,viper,was,[END]
well,a,snake,[END]
will,i,be,allowed,to,demand,trial,by,battle,[END]

the,bitch,checks,my,moves,before,i,make,them,[END]
a,pity,she,didn't,choose,a,kettleblack,[END]

i,shall,need,to,sleep,on,this,[END]
i,need,to,speak,with,bronn,and,soon,[END]
he,didn't,want,to,think,about,what,this,was,like,to,cost,him,[END]
bronn,had,a,lofty,notion,of,what,his,skin,was,worth,[END]
does,cersei,have,witnesses,against,me,[END]

when,did,i,make,so,many,enemies,[END]

how,do,i,prove,anything,penned,up,here,[END]
perhaps,the,time,has,come,for,you,to,confess,[END]
even,through,the,thick,stone,walls,of,the,red,keep,tyrion,could,hear,the,steady,wash,of,rain,[END]
say,that,again,uncle,[END]

naught,was,said,of,forgiveness,ser,kevan,said,sternly,[END]

were,i,you,i'd,change,my,mood,[END]
your,sister,wants,your,head,and,lord,tyrell,at,least,is,inclined,to,give,it,to,her,[END]
so,one,of,my,judges,has,already,condemned,me,without,hearing,a,word,in,my,defense,[END]

you,are,my,brother's,son,[END]

tywin,seems,a,hard,man,to,you,i,know,but,he,is,no,harder,than,he's,had,to,be,[END]

just,as,it,fell,to,him,to,rule,this,realm,when,he,was,no,more,than,twenty,[END]
he,bore,that,heavy,burden,for,twenty,years,and,all,it,earned,him,was,a,mad,king's,envy,[END]
instead,of,the,honor,he,deserved,he,was,made,to,suffer,slights,beyond,count,yet,he,gave,the,seven,kingdoms,peace,plenty,and,justice,[END]

he,thought,of,little,else,that,night,but,come,morning,was,no,closer,to,deciding,if,his,father,could,be,trusted,[END]
a,servant,brought,him,porridge,and,honey,to,break,his,fast,but,all,he,could,taste,was,bile,at,the,thought,of,confession,[END]

for,a,thousand,years,or,more,if,i,am,remembered,at,all,it,will,be,as,the,monstrous,dwarf,who,poisoned,his,young,nephew,at,his,wedding,feast,[END]
the,thought,made,him,so,bloody,angry,that,he,flung,the,bowl,and,spoon,across,the,room,and,left,a,smear,of,porridge,on,the,wall,[END]

powdered,primped,and,smelling,of,rosewater,the,spider,rubbed,his,hands,one,over,the,other,all,the,time,he,spoke,[END]
washing,my,life,away,tyrion,thought,as,he,listened,to,the,eunuch's,mournful,account,of,how,the,imp,had,schemed,to,part,joffrey,from,the,hound's,protection,and,spoken,with,bronn,of,the,benefits,of,having,tommen,as,king,[END]
half-truths,are,worth,more,than,outright,lies,[END]

so,much,material,that,its,recitation,took,all,day,and,so,much,of,it,damning,[END]
varys,confirmed,tyrion's,midnight,visit,to,grand,maester,pycelle's,chambers,and,the,theft,of,his,poisons,and,potions,confirmed,the,threat,he'd,made,to,cersei,the,night,of,their,supper,confirmed,every,bloody,thing,but,the,poisoning,itself,[END]
when,prince,oberyn,asked,him,how,he,could,possibly,know,all,this,not,having,been,present,at,any,of,these,events,the,eunuch,only,giggled,and,said,my,little,birds,told,me,[END]
knowing,is,their,purpose,and,mine,[END]
how,do,i,question,a,little,bird,[END]
thought,tyrion,[END]
i,should,have,had,the,eunuch's,head,off,my,first,day,in,king's,landing,[END]
damn,him,[END]
and,damn,me,for,whatever,trust,i,put,in,him,[END]
have,we,heard,it,all,[END]
lord,tywin,asked,his,daughter,as,varys,left,the,hall,[END]
almost,said,cersei,[END]
i,beg,your,leave,to,bring,one,final,witness,before,you,on,the,morrow,[END]
as,you,wish,lord,tywin,said,[END]
oh,good,thought,tyrion,savagely,[END]
after,this,farce,of,a,trial,execution,will,almost,come,as,a,relief,[END]
that,night,as,he,sat,by,his,window,drinking,he,heard,voices,outside,his,door,[END]
ser,kevan,come,for,my,answer,he,thought,at,once,but,it,was,not,his,uncle,who,entered,[END]
tyrion,rose,to,give,prince,oberyn,a,mocking,bow,[END]
are,judges,permitted,to,visit,the,accused,[END]
princes,are,permitted,to,go,where,they,will,[END]
or,so,i,told,your,guards,[END]
the,red,viper,took,a,seat,[END]
my,father,will,be,displeased,with,you,[END]
the,happiness,of,tywin,lannister,has,never,been,high,on,my,list,of,concerns,[END]
is,it,dornish,wine,you're,drinking,[END]
from,the,arbor,[END]
oberyn,made,a,face,[END]
red,water,[END]
did,you,poison,him,[END]
no,[END]
did,you,[END]
the,prince,smiled,[END]
do,all,dwarfs,have,tongues,like,yours,[END]
someone,is,going,to,cut,it,out,one,of,these,days,[END]
you,are,not,the,first,to,tell,me,that,[END]
perhaps,i,should,cut,it,out,myself,it,seems,to,make,no,end,of,trouble,[END]
so,i've,seen,[END]
i,think,i,may,drink,some,of,lord,redwyne's,grape,juice,after,all,[END]
as,you,like,[END]
tyrion,served,him,a,cup,[END]
the,man,took,a,sip,sloshed,it,about,in,his,mouth,and,swallowed,[END]
it,will,serve,for,the,moment,[END]
i,will,send,you,up,some,strong,dornish,wine,on,the,morrow,[END]
he,took,another,sip,[END]
i,have,turned,up,that,golden-haired,whore,i,was,hoping,for,[END]
so,you,found,chataya's,[END]
at,chataya's,i,bedded,the,black-skinned,girl,[END]
alayaya,i,believe,she,is,called,[END]
exquisite,despite,the,stripes,on,her,back,[END]
but,the,whore,i,referred,to,is,your,sister,[END]
has,she,seduced,you,yet,[END]
tyrion,asked,unsurprised,[END]
oberyn,laughed,aloud,[END]
no,but,she,will,if,i,meet,her,price,[END]
the,queen,has,even,hinted,at,marriage,[END]
her,grace,needs,another,husband,and,who,better,than,a,prince,of,dorne,[END]
ellaria,believes,i,should,accept,[END]
just,the,thought,of,cersei,in,our,bed,makes,her,wet,the,randy,wench,[END]
and,we,should,not,even,need,to,pay,the,dwarf's,penny,[END]
all,your,sister,requires,from,me,is,one,head,somewhat,overlarge,and,missing,a,nose,[END]
and,[END]
said,tyrion,waiting,[END]
by,way,of,answer,prince,oberyn,swirled,his,wine,and,said,when,the,young,dragon,conquered,dorne,so,long,ago,he,left,the,lord,of,highgarden,to,rule,us,after,the,submission,of,sunspear,[END]
this,tyrell,moved,with,his,tail,from,keep,to,keep,chasing,rebels,and,making,certain,that,our,knees,stayed,bent,[END]
he,would,arrive,in,force,take,a,castle,for,his,own,stay,a,moon's,turn,and,ride,on,to,the,next,castle,[END]
it,was,his,custom,to,turn,the,lords,out,of,their,own,chambers,and,take,their,beds,for,himself,[END]
one,night,he,found,himself,beneath,a,heavy,velvet,canopy,[END]
a,sash,hung,down,near,the,pillows,should,he,wish,to,summon,a,wench,[END]
he,had,a,taste,for,dornish,women,this,lord,tyrell,and,who,can,blame,him,[END]
so,he,pulled,upon,the,sash,and,when,he,did,the,canopy,above,him,split,open,and,a,hundred,red,scorpions,fell,down,upon,his,head,[END]
his,death,lit,a,fire,that,soon,swept,across,dorne,undoing,all,the,young,dragon's,victories,in,a,fortnight,[END]
the,kneeling,men,stood,up,and,we,were,free,again,[END]
i,know,the,tale,said,tyrion,[END]
what,of,it,[END]
just,this,[END]
if,i,should,ever,find,a,sash,beside,my,own,bed,and,pull,on,it,i,would,sooner,have,the,scorpions,fall,upon,me,than,the,queen,in,all,her,naked,beauty,[END]
tyrion,grinned,[END]
we,have,that,much,in,common,then,[END]
to,be,sure,i,have,much,to,thank,your,sister,for,[END]
if,not,for,her,accusation,at,the,feast,it,might,well,be,you,judging,me,instead,of,me,judging,you,[END]
the,prince's,eyes,were,dark,with,amusement,[END]
who,knows,more,of,poison,than,the,red,viper,of,dorne,after,all,[END]
who,has,better,reason,to,want,to,keep,the,tyrells,far,from,the,crown,[END]
and,with,joffrey,in,his,grave,by,dornish,law,the,iron,throne,should,pass,next,to,his,sister,myrcella,who,as,it,happens,is,betrothed,to,mine,own,nephew,thanks,to,you,[END]
dornish,law,does,not,apply,[END]
tyrion,had,been,so,ensnared,in,his,own,troubles,that,he'd,never,stopped,to,consider,the,succession,[END]
my,father,will,crown,tommen,count,on,that,[END]
he,may,indeed,crown,tommen,here,in,king's,landing,[END]
which,is,not,to,say,that,my,brother,may,not,crown,myrcella,down,in,sunspear,[END]
will,your,father,make,war,on,your,niece,on,behalf,of,your,nephew,[END]
will,your,sister,[END]
he,gave,a,shrug,[END]
perhaps,i,should,marry,queen,cersei,after,all,on,the,condition,that,she,support,her,daughter,over,her,son,[END]
do,you,think,she,would,[END]
never,tyrion,wanted,to,say,but,the,word,caught,in,his,throat,[END]
cersei,always,resented,being,excluded,from,power,on,account,of,her,sex,[END]
if,dornish,law,applied,in,the,west,she,would,be,the,heir,to,casterly,rock,in,her,own,right,[END]
she,and,jaime,were,twins,but,cersei,had,come,first,into,the,world,and,that,was,all,it,took,[END]
by,championing,myrcella's,cause,she,would,be,championing,her,own,[END]
i,do,not,know,how,my,sister,would,choose,between,tommen,and,myrcella,he,admitted,[END]
it,makes,no,matter,[END]
my,father,will,never,give,her,that,choice,[END]
your,father,said,prince,oberyn,may,not,live,forever,[END]
something,about,the,way,he,said,it,made,the,hairs,on,the,back,of,tyrion's,neck,bristle,[END]
suddenly,he,was,mindful,of,elia,again,and,all,that,oberyn,had,said,as,they,crossed,the,field,of,ashes,[END]
he,wants,the,head,that,spoke,the,words,not,just,the,hand,that,swung,the,sword,[END]
it,is,not,wise,to,speak,such,treasons,in,the,red,keep,my,prince,[END]
the,little,birds,are,listening,[END]
let,them,[END]
is,it,treason,to,say,a,man,is,mortal,[END]
valar,morghulis,was,how,they,said,it,in,valyria,of,old,[END]
all,men,must,die,[END]
and,the,doom,came,and,proved,it,true,[END]
the,dornishman,went,to,the,window,to,gaze,out,into,the,night,[END]
it,is,being,said,that,you,have,no,witnesses,for,us,[END]
i,was,hoping,one,look,at,this,sweet,face,of,mine,would,be,enough,to,persuade,you,all,of,my,innocence,[END]
you,are,mistaken,my,lord,[END]
the,fat,flower,of,highgarden,is,quite,convinced,of,your,guilt,and,determined,to,see,you,die,[END]
his,precious,margaery,was,drinking,from,that,chalice,too,as,he,has,reminded,us,half,a,hundred,times,[END]
and,you,[END]
said,tyrion,[END]
men,are,seldom,as,they,appear,[END]
you,look,so,very,guilty,that,i,am,convinced,of,your,innocence,[END]
still,you,will,likely,be,condemned,[END]
justice,is,in,short,supply,this,side,of,the,mountains,[END]
there,has,been,none,for,elia,aegon,or,rhaenys,[END]
why,should,there,be,any,for,you,[END]
perhaps,joffrey's,real,killer,was,eaten,by,a,bear,[END]
that,seems,to,happen,quite,often,in,king's,landing,[END]
oh,wait,the,bear,was,at,harrenhal,now,i,remember,[END]
is,that,the,game,we,are,playing,[END]
tyrion,rubbed,at,his,scarred,nose,[END]
he,had,nothing,to,lose,by,telling,oberyn,the,truth,[END]
there,was,a,bear,at,harrenhal,and,it,did,kill,ser,amory,lorch,[END]
how,sad,for,him,said,the,red,viper,[END]
and,for,you,[END]
do,all,noseless,men,lie,so,badly,i,wonder,[END]
i,am,not,lying,[END]
ser,amory,dragged,princess,rhaenys,out,from,under,her,father's,bed,and,stabbed,her,to,death,[END]
he,had,some,men-at-arms,with,him,but,i,do,not,know,their,names,[END]
he,leaned,forward,[END]
it,was,ser,gregor,clegane,who,smashed,prince,aegon's,head,against,a,wall,and,raped,your,sister,elia,with,his,blood,and,brains,still,on,his,hands,[END]
what,is,this,now,[END]
truth,from,a,lannister,[END]
oberyn,smiled,coldly,[END]
your,father,gave,the,commands,yes,[END]
no,[END]
he,spoke,the,lie,without,hesitation,and,never,stopped,to,ask,himself,why,he,should,[END]
the,dornishman,raised,one,thin,black,eyebrow,[END]
such,a,dutiful,son,[END]
and,such,a,very,feeble,lie,[END]
it,was,lord,tywin,who,presented,my,sister's,children,to,king,robert,all,wrapped,up,in,crimson,lannister,cloaks,[END]
perhaps,you,ought,to,have,this,discussion,with,my,father,[END]
he,was,there,[END]
i,was,at,the,rock,and,still,so,young,that,i,thought,the,thing,between,my,legs,was,only,good,for,pissing,[END]
yes,but,you,are,here,now,and,in,some,difficulty,i,would,say,[END]
your,innocence,may,be,as,plain,as,the,scar,on,your,face,but,it,will,not,save,you,[END]
no,more,than,your,father,will,[END]
the,dornish,prince,smiled,[END]
but,i,might,[END]
you,[END]
tyrion,studied,him,[END]
you,are,one,judge,in,three,[END]
how,could,you,save,me,[END]
not,as,your,judge,[END]
as,your,champion,[END]
jaime,[END]
a,white,book,sat,on,a,white,table,in,a,white,room,[END]
the,room,was,round,its,walls,of,whitewashed,stone,hung,with,white,woolen,tapestries,[END]
it,formed,the,first,floor,of,white,sword,tower,a,slender,structure,of,four,stories,built,into,an,angle,of,the,castle,wall,overlooking,the,bay,[END]
the,undercroft,held,arms,and,armor,the,second,and,third,floors,the,small,spare,sleeping,cells,of,the,six,brothers,of,the,kingsguard,[END]
one,of,those,cells,had,been,his,for,eighteen,years,but,this,morning,he,had,moved,his,things,to,the,topmost,floor,which,was,given,over,entirely,to,the,lord,commander's,apartments,[END]
those,rooms,were,spare,as,well,though,spacious,and,they,were,above,the,outer,walls,which,meant,he,would,have,a,view,of,the,sea,[END]
i,will,like,that,he,thought,[END]
the,view,and,all,the,rest,[END]

a,longsword,hung,from,his,hip,[END]
from,the,wrong,hip,[END]
before,he,had,always,worn,his,sword,on,his,left,and,drawn,it,across,his,body,when,he,unsheathed,[END]
he,had,shifted,it,to,his,right,hip,this,morning,so,as,to,be,able,to,draw,it,with,his,left,hand,in,the,same,manner,but,the,weight,of,it,felt,strange,there,and,when,he,had,tried,to,pull,the,blade,from,the,scabbard,the,whole,motion,seemed,clumsy,and,unnatural,[END]
his,clothing,fit,badly,as,well,[END]
he,had,donned,the,winter,raiment,of,the,kingsguard,a,tunic,and,breeches,of,bleached,white,wool,and,a,heavy,white,cloak,but,it,all,seemed,to,hang,loose,on,him,[END]
jaime,had,spent,his,days,at,his,brother's,trial,standing,well,to,the,back,of,the,hall,[END]
either,tyrion,never,saw,him,there,or,he,did,not,know,him,but,that,was,no,surprise,[END]
half,the,court,no,longer,seemed,to,know,him,[END]
i,am,a,stranger,in,my,own,house,[END]
his,son,was,dead,his,father,had,disowned,him,and,his,sister,[END]
she,had,not,allowed,him,to,be,alone,with,her,once,after,that,first,day,in,the,royal,sept,where,joffrey,lay,amongst,the,candles,[END]
even,when,they,bore,him,across,the,city,to,his,tomb,in,the,great,sept,of,baelor,cersei,kept,a,careful,distance,[END]

my,father,is,an,old,man,my,lord,[END]
well,past,forty,[END]
his,fighting,days,are,done,[END]
and,your,brother,[END]
donnel,was,wounded,in,the,battle,and,yielded,to,ser,elwood,harte,[END]
he,was,ransomed,afterward,and,pledged,his,fealty,to,king,joffrey,as,did,many,other,captives,[END]
so,he,did,said,jaime,[END]
even,so,[END]
renly,stannis,joffrey,tommen,[END]
how,did,he,come,to,omit,balon,greyjoy,and,robb,stark,[END]
he,might,have,been,the,first,knight,in,the,realm,to,swear,fealty,to,all,six,kings,[END]
ser,balon's,unease,was,plain,[END]

you,have,my,word,[END]
it's,not,ser,donnel,the,constant,who,concerns,me,[END]
it's,you,[END]
jaime,leaned,forward,[END]
what,will,you,do,if,brave,ser,donnel,gives,his,sword,to,yet,another,usurper,and,one,day,comes,storming,into,the,throne,room,[END]
and,there,you,stand,all,in,white,between,your,king,and,your,blood,[END]
what,will,you,do,[END]
i,[END]
my,lord,that,will,never,happen,[END]
it,happened,to,me,jaime,said,[END]

you,have,no,answer,[END]
my,lord,[END]

return,to,your,duties,[END]
and,tell,ser,donnel,to,add,a,weathervane,to,his,shield,[END]
and,then,he,was,alone,with,the,knight,of,flowers,[END]

his,hair,was,a,soft,brown,tumble,and,his,eyes,were,brown,as,well,and,bright,with,insolence,[END]
he,thinks,this,is,a,tourney,and,his,tilt,has,just,been,called,[END]
seventeen,and,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,said,jaime,[END]
you,must,be,proud,[END]

did,you,know,that,[END]
yes,my,lord,[END]
and,did,you,know,that,i,was,fifteen,[END]
that,as,well,my,lord,[END]

i,was,better,than,you,ser,loras,[END]
i,was,bigger,i,was,stronger,and,i,was,quicker,[END]
and,now,you're,older,the,boy,said,[END]
my,lord,[END]
he,had,to,laugh,[END]
this,is,too,absurd,[END]
tyrion,would,mock,me,unmercifully,if,he,could,hear,me,now,comparing,cocks,with,this,green,boy,[END]
older,and,wiser,ser,[END]
you,should,learn,from,me,[END]
as,you,learned,from,ser,boros,and,ser,meryn,[END]
that,arrow,hit,too,close,to,the,mark,[END]
i,learned,from,the,white,bull,and,barristan,the,bold,jaime,snapped,[END]
i,learned,from,ser,arthur,dayne,the,sword,of,the,morning,who,could,have,slain,all,five,of,you,with,his,left,hand,while,he,was,taking,with,a,piss,with,the,right,[END]
i,learned,from,prince,lewyn,of,dorne,and,ser,oswell,whent,and,ser,jonothor,darry,good,men,every,one,[END]

he's,me,jaime,realized,suddenly,[END]
i,am,speaking,to,myself,as,i,was,all,cocksure,arrogance,and,empty,chivalry,[END]
this,is,what,it,does,to,you,to,be,too,good,too,young,[END]
as,in,a,swordfight,sometimes,it,is,best,to,try,a,different,stroke,[END]
it's,said,you,fought,magnificently,in,the,battle,[END]
almost,as,well,as,lord,renly's,ghost,beside,you,[END]
a,sworn,brother,has,no,secrets,from,his,lord,commander,[END]
tell,me,ser,[END]
who,was,wearing,renly's,armor,[END]
for,a,moment,loras,tyrell,looked,as,though,he,might,refuse,but,in,the,end,he,remembered,his,vows,[END]
my,brother,he,said,sullenly,[END]
renly,was,taller,than,me,and,broader,in,the,chest,[END]
his,armor,was,too,loose,on,me,but,it,suited,garlan,well,[END]
was,the,masquerade,your,notion,or,his,[END]
lord,littlefinger,suggested,it,[END]
he,said,it,would,frighten,stannis's,ignorant,men-at-arms,[END]
and,so,it,did,[END]
and,some,knights,and,lordlings,too,[END]
well,you,gave,the,singers,something,to,make,rhymes,about,i,suppose,that's,not,to,be,despised,[END]
what,did,you,do,with,renly,[END]
i,buried,him,with,mine,own,hands,in,a,place,he,showed,me,once,when,i,was,a,squire,at,storm's,end,[END]
no,one,shall,ever,find,him,there,to,disturb,his,rest,[END]

i,will,give,my,life,for,his,if,need,be,[END]
but,i,will,never,betray,renly,by,word,or,deed,[END]
he,was,the,king,that,should,have,been,[END]
he,was,the,best,of,them,[END]
the,best,dressed,perhaps,jaime,thought,but,for,once,he,did,not,say,it,[END]
the,arrogance,had,gone,out,of,ser,loras,the,moment,he,began,to,speak,of,renly,[END]
he,answered,truly,[END]
he,is,proud,and,reckless,and,full,of,piss,but,he,is,not,false,[END]
not,yet,[END]
as,you,say,[END]
one,more,thing,and,you,may,return,to,your,duties,[END]
yes,my,lord,[END]
i,still,have,brienne,of,tarth,in,a,tower,cell,[END]
the,boy's,mouth,hardened,[END]
a,black,cell,would,be,better,[END]
you,are,certain,that's,what,she,deserves,[END]
she,deserves,death,[END]
i,told,renly,that,a,woman,had,no,place,in,the,rainbow,guard,[END]
she,won,the,mêlée,with,a,trick,[END]
i,seem,to,recall,another,knight,who,was,fond,of,tricks,[END]
he,once,rode,a,mare,in,heat,against,a,foe,mounted,on,a,bad-tempered,stallion,[END]
what,sort,of,trickery,did,brienne,use,[END]
ser,loras,flushed,[END]
she,leapt,[END]
it,makes,no,matter,[END]
she,won,i,grant,her,that,[END]
his,grace,put,a,rainbow,cloak,around,her,shoulders,[END]
and,she,killed,him,[END]
or,let,him,die,[END]
a,large,difference,there,[END]
the,difference,between,my,crime,and,the,shame,of,boros,blount,[END]
she,had,sworn,to,protect,him,[END]
ser,emmon,cuy,ser,robar,royce,ser,parmen,crane,they'd,sworn,as,well,[END]
how,could,anyone,have,hurt,him,with,her,inside,his,tent,and,the,others,just,outside,[END]
unless,they,were,part,of,it,[END]
there,were,five,of,you,at,the,wedding,feast,jaime,pointed,out,[END]
how,could,joffrey,die,[END]
unless,you,were,part,of,it,[END]
ser,loras,drew,himself,up,stiffly,[END]
there,was,nothing,we,could,have,done,[END]
the,wench,says,the,same,[END]
she,grieves,for,renly,as,you,do,[END]
i,promise,you,i,never,grieve,for,aerys,[END]
brienne's,ugly,and,pighead,stubborn,[END]
but,she,lacks,the,wits,to,be,a,liar,and,she,is,loyal,past,the,point,of,sense,[END]
she,swore,an,oath,to,bring,me,to,king's,landing,and,here,i,sit,[END]
this,hand,i,lost,[END]
well,that,was,my,doing,as,much,as,hers,[END]
considering,all,she,did,to,protect,me,i,have,no,doubt,that,she,would,have,fought,for,renly,had,there,been,a,foe,to,fight,[END]
but,a,shadow,[END]
jaime,shook,his,head,[END]
draw,your,sword,ser,loras,[END]
show,me,how,you'd,fight,a,shadow,[END]
i,should,like,to,see,that,[END]
ser,loras,made,no,move,to,rise,[END]
she,fled,he,said,[END]
she,and,catelyn,stark,they,left,him,in,his,blood,and,ran,[END]
why,would,they,if,it,was,not,their,work,[END]
he,stared,at,the,table,[END]
renly,gave,me,the,van,[END]
otherwise,it,would,have,been,me,helping,him,don,his,armor,[END]
he,often,entrusted,that,task,to,me,[END]
we,had,[END]
we,had,prayed,together,that,night,[END]
i,left,him,with,her,[END]
ser,parmen,and,ser,emmon,were,guarding,the,tent,and,ser,robar,royce,was,there,as,well,[END]
ser,emmon,swore,brienne,had,[END]
although,[END]
yes,[END]
jaime,prompted,sensing,a,doubt,[END]
the,gorget,was,cut,through,[END]
one,clean,stroke,through,a,steel,gorget,[END]
renly's,armor,was,the,best,the,finest,steel,[END]
how,could,she,do,that,[END]
i,tried,myself,and,it,was,not,possible,[END]
she's,freakish,strong,for,a,woman,but,even,the,mountain,would,have,needed,a,heavy,axe,[END]
and,why,armor,him,and,then,cut,his,throat,[END]
he,gave,jaime,a,confused,look,[END]
if,not,her,though,[END]
how,could,it,be,a,shadow,[END]
ask,her,[END]
jaime,came,to,a,decision,[END]
go,to,her,cell,[END]
ask,your,questions,and,hear,her,answers,[END]
if,you,are,still,convinced,that,she,murdered,lord,renly,i,will,see,that,she,answers,for,it,[END]
the,choice,will,be,yours,[END]
accuse,her,or,release,her,[END]
all,i,ask,is,that,you,judge,her,fairly,on,your,honor,as,a,knight,[END]
ser,loras,stood,[END]
i,shall,[END]
on,my,honor,[END]
we,are,done,then,[END]
the,younger,man,started,for,the,door,[END]
but,there,he,turned,back,[END]
renly,thought,she,was,absurd,[END]
a,woman,dressed,in,man's,mail,pretending,to,be,a,knight,[END]
if,he'd,ever,seen,her,in,pink,satin,and,myrish,lace,he,would,not,have,complained,[END]
i,asked,him,why,he,kept,her,close,if,he,thought,her,so,grotesque,[END]
he,said,that,all,his,other,knights,wanted,things,of,him,castles,or,honors,or,riches,but,all,that,brienne,wanted,was,to,die,for,him,[END]
when,i,saw,him,all,bloody,with,her,fled,and,the,three,of,them,unharmed,[END]
if,she's,innocent,then,robar,and,emmon,[END]
he,could,not,seem,to,say,the,words,[END]
jaime,had,not,stopped,to,consider,that,aspect,of,it,[END]
i,would,have,done,the,same,ser,[END]
the,lie,came,easy,but,ser,loras,seemed,grateful,for,it,[END]
when,he,was,gone,the,lord,commander,sat,alone,in,the,white,room,wondering,[END]
the,knight,of,flowers,had,been,so,mad,with,grief,for,renly,that,he,had,cut,down,two,of,his,own,sworn,brothers,but,it,had,never,occurred,to,jaime,to,do,the,same,with,the,five,who,had,failed,joffrey,[END]
he,was,my,son,my,secret,son,[END]
what,am,i,if,i,do,not,lift,the,hand,i,have,left,to,avenge,mine,own,blood,and,seed,[END]
he,ought,to,kill,ser,boros,at,least,just,to,be,rid,of,him,[END]
he,looked,at,his,stump,and,grimaced,[END]
i,must,do,something,about,that,[END]
if,the,late,ser,jacelyn,bywater,could,wear,an,iron,hand,he,should,have,a,gold,one,[END]
cersei,might,like,that,[END]
a,golden,hand,to,stroke,her,golden,hair,and,hold,her,hard,against,me,[END]
his,hand,could,wait,though,[END]
there,were,other,things,to,tend,to,first,[END]
there,were,other,debts,to,pay,[END]

the,ladder,to,the,forecastle,was,steep,and,splintery,so,sansa,accepted,a,hand,up,from,lothor,brune,[END]

a,square-faced,stocky,man,with,a,squashed,nose,and,a,mat,of,nappy,grey,hair,brune,spoke,seldom,[END]
he,is,stronger,than,he,looks,though,[END]
she,could,tell,by,the,ease,with,which,he,lifted,her,as,if,she,weighed,nothing,at,all,[END]
off,the,bow,of,the,merling,king,stretched,a,bare,and,stony,strand,windswept,treeless,and,uninviting,[END]

they,had,been,a,long,while,clawing,their,way,back,on,course,[END]
the,last,storm,had,swept,them,out,of,sight,of,land,and,sent,such,waves,crashing,over,the,sides,of,the,galley,that,sansa,had,been,certain,they,were,all,going,to,drown,[END]
two,men,had,been,swept,overboard,she,had,heard,old,oswell,saying,and,another,had,fallen,from,the,mast,and,broken,his,neck,[END]
she,had,seldom,ventured,out,on,deck,herself,[END]
her,little,cabin,was,dank,and,cold,but,sansa,had,been,sick,for,most,of,the,voyage,[END]
sick,with,terror,sick,with,fever,or,seasick,[END]
she,could,keep,nothing,down,and,even,sleep,came,hard,[END]
whenever,she,closed,her,eyes,she,saw,joffrey,tearing,at,his,collar,clawing,at,the,soft,skin,of,his,throat,dying,with,flakes,of,pie,crust,on,his,lips,and,wine,stains,on,his,doublet,[END]
and,the,wind,keening,in,the,lines,reminded,her,of,the,terrible,thin,sucking,sound,he'd,made,as,he,fought,to,draw,in,air,[END]
sometimes,she,dreamed,of,tyrion,as,well,[END]
he,did,nothing,she,told,littlefinger,once,when,he,paid,a,visit,to,her,cabin,to,see,if,she,were,feeling,any,better,[END]
he,did,not,kill,joffrey,true,but,the,dwarf's,hands,are,far,from,clean,[END]
he,had,a,wife,before,you,did,you,know,that,[END]
he,told,me,[END]
and,did,he,tell,you,that,when,he,grew,bored,with,her,he,made,a,gift,of,her,to,his,father's,guardsmen,[END]
he,might,have,done,the,same,to,you,in,time,[END]
shed,no,tears,for,the,imp,my,lady,[END]
the,wind,ran,salty,fingers,through,her,hair,and,sansa,shivered,[END]
even,this,close,to,shore,the,rolling,of,the,ship,made,her,tummy,queasy,[END]
she,desperately,needed,a,bath,and,a,change,of,clothes,[END]

ah,cold,salt,mutton,[END]

when,i,break,my,fast,on,gulls',eggs,and,seaweed,soup,i'll,be,certain,of,it,[END]
if,you,like,m'lord,said,the,old,woman,grisel,[END]
lord,petyr,made,a,face,[END]
come,let's,see,if,my,hall,is,as,dreary,as,i,recall,[END]
he,led,them,up,the,strand,over,rocks,slick,with,rotting,seaweed,[END]
a,handful,of,sheep,were,wandering,about,the,base,of,the,flint,tower,grazing,on,the,thin,grass,that,grew,between,the,sheepfold,and,thatched,stable,[END]
sansa,had,to,step,carefully,there,were,pellets,everywhere,[END]
within,the,tower,seemed,even,smaller,[END]
an,open,stone,stair,wound,round,the,inside,wall,from,undercroft,to,roof,[END]
each,floor,was,but,a,single,room,[END]
the,servants,lived,and,slept,in,the,kitchen,at,ground,level,sharing,the,space,with,a,huge,brindled,mastiff,and,a,half-dozen,sheep-dogs,[END]
above,that,was,a,modest,hall,and,higher,still,the,bedchamber,[END]
there,were,no,windows,but,arrowslits,were,embedded,in,the,outer,wall,at,intervals,along,the,curve,of,the,stair,[END]
above,the,hearth,hung,a,broken,longsword,and,a,battered,oaken,shield,its,paint,cracked,and,flaking,[END]
the,device,painted,on,the,shield,was,one,sansa,did,not,know,a,grey,stone,head,with,fiery,eyes,upon,a,light,green,field,[END]
my,grandfather's,shield,petyr,explained,when,he,saw,her,gazing,at,it,[END]
his,own,father,was,born,in,braavos,and,came,to,the,vale,as,a,sellsword,in,the,hire,of,lord,corbray,so,my,grandfather,took,the,head,of,the,titan,as,his,sigil,when,he,was,knighted,[END]
it's,very,fierce,said,sansa,[END]
rather,too,fierce,for,an,amiable,fellow,like,me,said,petyr,[END]
i,much,prefer,my,mockingbird,[END]
oswell,made,two,more,trips,out,to,the,merling,king,to,offload,provisions,[END]
among,the,loads,he,brought,ashore,were,several,casks,of,wine,[END]
petyr,poured,sansa,a,cup,as,promised,[END]
here,my,lady,that,should,help,your,tummy,i,would,hope,[END]
having,solid,ground,beneath,her,feet,had,helped,already,but,sansa,dutifully,lifted,the,goblet,with,both,hands,and,took,a,sip,[END]
the,wine,was,very,fine,an,arbor,vintage,she,thought,[END]
it,tasted,of,oak,and,fruit,and,hot,summer,nights,the,flavors,blossoming,in,her,mouth,like,flowers,opening,to,the,sun,[END]
she,only,prayed,that,she,could,keep,it,down,[END]
lord,petyr,was,being,so,kind,she,did,not,want,to,spoil,it,all,by,retching,on,him,[END]
he,was,studying,her,over,his,own,goblet,his,bright,grey-green,eyes,full,of,[END]
was,it,amusement,[END]
or,something,else,[END]
sansa,was,not,certain,[END]
grisel,he,called,to,the,old,woman,bring,some,food,up,[END]
nothing,too,heavy,my,lady,has,a,tender,tummy,[END]
some,fruit,might,serve,perhaps,[END]
oswell's,brought,some,oranges,and,pomegranates,from,the,king,[END]
yes,m'lord,[END]
might,i,have,a,hot,bath,as,well,[END]
asked,sansa,[END]
i'll,have,kella,draw,some,water,m'lady,[END]
sansa,took,another,sip,of,wine,and,tried,to,think,of,some,polite,conversation,but,lord,petyr,saved,her,the,effort,[END]
when,grisel,and,the,other,servants,had,gone,he,said,lysa,will,not,come,alone,[END]
before,she,arrives,we,must,be,clear,on,who,you,are,[END]
who,i,[END]
i,don't,understand,[END]
varys,has,informers,everywhere,[END]
if,sansa,stark,should,be,seen,in,the,vale,the,eunuch,will,know,within,a,moon's,turn,and,that,would,create,unfortunate,[END]
complications,[END]
it,is,not,safe,to,be,a,stark,just,now,[END]
so,we,shall,tell,lysa's,people,that,you,are,my,natural,daughter,[END]
natural,[END]
sansa,was,aghast,[END]
you,mean,a,bastard,[END]
well,you,can,scarcely,be,my,trueborn,daughter,[END]
i've,never,taken,a,wife,that's,well,known,[END]
what,should,you,be,called,[END]
i,[END]
i,could,call,myself,after,my,mother,[END]
catelyn,[END]
a,bit,too,obvious,[END]
but,after,my,mother,that,would,serve,[END]
alayne,[END]
do,you,like,it,[END]
alayne,is,pretty,[END]
sansa,hoped,she,would,remember,[END]
but,couldn't,i,be,the,trueborn,daughter,of,some,knight,in,your,service,[END]
perhaps,he,died,gallantly,in,the,battle,and,[END]
i,have,no,gallant,knights,in,my,service,alayne,[END]
such,a,tale,would,draw,unwanted,questions,as,a,corpse,draws,crows,[END]
it,is,rude,to,pry,into,the,origins,of,a,man's,natural,children,however,[END]
he,cocked,his,head,[END]
so,who,are,you,[END]
alayne,[END]
stone,would,it,be,[END]
when,he,nodded,she,said,but,who,is,my,mother,[END]
kella,[END]
please,no,she,said,mortified,[END]
i,was,teasing,[END]
your,mother,was,a,gentlewoman,of,braavos,daughter,of,a,merchant,prince,[END]
we,met,in,gulltown,when,i,had,charge,of,the,port,[END]
she,died,giving,you,birth,and,entrusted,you,to,the,faith,[END]
i,have,some,devotional,books,you,can,look,over,[END]
learn,to,quote,from,them,[END]
nothing,discourages,unwanted,questions,as,much,as,a,flow,of,pious,bleating,[END]
in,any,case,at,your,flowering,you,decided,you,did,not,wish,to,be,a,septa,and,wrote,to,me,[END]
that,was,the,first,i,knew,of,your,existence,[END]
he,fingered,his,beard,[END]
do,you,think,you,can,remember,all,that,[END]
i,hope,[END]
it,will,be,like,playing,a,game,won't,it,[END]
are,you,fond,of,games,alayne,[END]
the,new,name,would,take,some,getting,used,to,[END]
games,[END]
i,[END]
i,suppose,it,would,depend,[END]
grisel,reappeared,before,he,could,say,more,balancing,a,large,platter,[END]
she,set,it,down,between,them,[END]
there,were,apples,and,pears,and,pomegranates,some,sad-looking,grapes,a,huge,blood,orange,[END]
the,old,woman,had,brought,a,round,of,bread,as,well,and,a,crock,of,butter,[END]
petyr,cut,a,pomegranate,in,two,with,his,dagger,offering,half,to,sansa,[END]
you,should,try,and,eat,my,lady,[END]
thank,you,my,lord,[END]
pomegranate,seeds,were,so,messy,sansa,chose,a,pear,instead,and,took,a,small,delicate,bite,[END]
it,was,very,ripe,[END]
the,juice,ran,down,her,chin,[END]
lord,petyr,loosened,a,seed,with,the,point,of,his,dagger,[END]
you,must,miss,your,father,terribly,i,know,[END]
lord,eddard,was,a,brave,man,honest,and,loyal,[END]
but,quite,a,hopeless,player,[END]
he,brought,the,seed,to,his,mouth,with,the,knife,[END]
in,king's,landing,there,are,two,sorts,of,people,[END]
the,players,and,the,pieces,[END]
and,i,was,a,piece,[END]
she,dreaded,the,answer,[END]
yes,but,don't,let,that,trouble,you,[END]
you're,still,half,a,child,[END]
every,man's,a,piece,to,start,with,and,every,maid,as,well,[END]
even,some,who,think,they,are,players,[END]
he,ate,another,seed,[END]
cersei,for,one,[END]
she,thinks,herself,sly,but,in,truth,she,is,utterly,predictable,[END]
her,strength,rests,on,her,beauty,birth,and,riches,[END]
only,the,first,of,those,is,truly,her,own,and,it,will,soon,desert,her,[END]
i,pity,her,then,[END]
she,wants,power,but,has,no,notion,what,to,do,with,it,when,she,gets,it,[END]
everyone,wants,something,alayne,[END]
and,when,you,know,what,a,man,wants,you,know,who,he,is,and,how,to,move,him,[END]
as,you,moved,ser,dontos,to,poison,joffrey,[END]
it,had,to,have,been,dontos,she,had,concluded,[END]
littlefinger,laughed,[END]
ser,dontos,the,red,was,a,skin,of,wine,with,legs,[END]
he,could,never,have,been,trusted,with,a,task,of,such,enormity,[END]
he,would,have,bungled,it,or,betrayed,me,[END]
no,all,dontos,had,to,do,was,lead,you,from,the,castle,[END]
and,make,certain,you,wore,your,silver,hair,net,[END]
the,black,amethysts,[END]
but,[END]
if,not,dontos,who,[END]
do,you,have,other,[END]
pieces,[END]
you,could,turn,king's,landing,upside,down,and,not,find,a,single,man,with,a,mockingbird,sewn,over,his,heart,but,that,does,not,mean,i,am,friendless,[END]
petyr,went,to,the,steps,[END]
oswell,come,up,here,and,let,the,lady,sansa,have,a,look,at,you,[END]
the,old,man,appeared,a,few,moments,later,grinning,and,bowing,[END]
sansa,eyed,him,uncertainly,[END]
what,am,i,supposed,to,see,[END]
do,you,know,him,[END]
asked,petyr,[END]
no,[END]
look,closer,[END]
she,studied,the,old,man's,lined,windburnt,face,hook,nose,white,hair,and,huge,knuckly,hands,[END]
there,was,something,familiar,about,him,yet,sansa,had,to,shake,her,head,[END]
i,don't,[END]
i,never,saw,oswell,before,i,got,into,his,boat,i'm,certain,[END]
oswell,grinned,showing,a,mouth,of,crooked,teeth,[END]
no,but,m'lady,might,of,met,my,three,sons,[END]
it,was,the,three,sons,and,that,smile,too,[END]
kettleblack,[END]
sansa's,eyes,went,wide,[END]
you're,a,kettleblack,[END]
aye,m'lady,as,it,please,you,[END]
she's,beside,herself,with,joy,[END]
lord,petyr,dismissed,him,with,a,wave,and,returned,to,the,pomegranate,again,as,oswell,shuffled,down,the,steps,[END]
tell,me,alayne,which,is,more,dangerous,the,dagger,brandished,by,an,enemy,or,the,hidden,one,pressed,to,your,back,by,someone,you,never,even,see,[END]
the,hidden,dagger,[END]
there's,a,clever,girl,[END]
he,smiled,his,thin,lips,bright,red,from,the,pomegranate,seeds,[END]
when,the,imp,sent,off,her,guards,the,queen,had,ser,lancel,hire,sellswords,for,her,[END]
lancel,found,her,the,kettleblacks,which,delighted,your,little,lord,husband,since,the,lads,were,in,his,pay,through,his,man,bronn,[END]
he,chuckled,[END]
but,it,was,me,who,told,oswell,to,get,his,sons,to,king's,landing,when,i,learned,that,bronn,was,looking,for,swords,[END]
three,hidden,daggers,alayne,now,perfectly,placed,[END]
so,one,of,the,kettleblacks,put,the,poison,in,joff's,cup,[END]
ser,osmund,had,been,near,the,king,all,night,she,remembered,[END]
did,i,say,that,[END]
lord,petyr,cut,the,blood,orange,in,two,with,his,dagger,and,offered,half,to,sansa,[END]
the,lads,are,far,too,treacherous,to,be,part,of,any,such,scheme,[END]
and,osmund,has,become,especially,unreliable,since,he,joined,the,kingsguard,[END]
that,white,cloak,does,things,to,a,man,i,find,[END]
even,a,man,like,him,[END]
he,tilted,his,chin,back,and,squeezed,the,blood,orange,so,the,juice,ran,down,into,his,mouth,[END]
i,love,the,juice,but,i,loathe,the,sticky,fingers,he,complained,wiping,his,hands,[END]
clean,hands,sansa,[END]
whatever,you,do,make,certain,your,hands,are,clean,[END]
sansa,spooned,up,some,juice,from,her,own,orange,[END]
but,if,it,wasn't,the,kettleblacks,and,it,wasn't,ser,dontos,[END]
you,weren't,even,in,the,city,and,it,couldn't,have,been,tyrion,[END]
no,more,guesses,sweetling,[END]
she,shook,her,head,[END]
i,don't,[END]
petyr,smiled,[END]
i,will,wager,you,that,at,some,point,during,the,evening,someone,told,you,that,your,hair,net,was,crooked,and,straightened,it,for,you,[END]
sansa,raised,a,hand,to,her,mouth,[END]
you,cannot,mean,[END]
she,wanted,to,take,me,to,highgarden,to,marry,me,to,her,grandson,[END]
gentle,pious,good-hearted,willas,tyrell,[END]
be,grateful,you,were,spared,he,would,have,bored,you,spitless,[END]
the,old,woman,is,not,boring,though,i'll,grant,her,that,[END]
a,fearsome,old,harridan,and,not,near,as,frail,as,she,pretends,[END]
when,i,came,to,highgarden,to,dicker,for,margaery's,hand,she,let,her,lord,son,bluster,while,she,asked,pointed,questions,about,joffrey's,nature,[END]
i,praised,him,to,the,skies,to,be,sure,[END]
whilst,my,men,spread,disturbing,tales,amongst,lord,tyrell's,servants,[END]
that,is,how,the,game,is,played,[END]
i,also,planted,the,notion,of,ser,loras,taking,the,white,[END]
not,that,i,suggested,it,that,would,have,been,too,crude,[END]
but,men,in,my,party,supplied,grisly,tales,about,how,the,mob,had,killed,ser,preston,greenfield,and,raped,the,lady,lollys,and,slipped,a,few,silvers,to,lord,tyrell's,army,of,singers,to,sing,of,ryam,redwyne,serwyn,of,the,mirror,shield,and,prince,aemon,the,dragonknight,[END]
a,harp,can,be,as,dangerous,as,a,sword,in,the,right,hands,[END]
mace,tyrell,actually,thought,it,was,his,own,idea,to,make,ser,loras's,inclusion,in,the,kingsguard,part,of,the,marriage,contract,[END]
who,better,to,protect,his,daughter,than,her,splendid,knightly,brother,[END]
and,it,relieved,him,of,the,difficult,task,of,trying,to,find,lands,and,a,bride,for,a,third,son,never,easy,and,doubly,difficult,in,ser,loras's,case,[END]
be,that,as,it,may,[END]
lady,olenna,was,not,about,to,let,joff,harm,her,precious,darling,granddaughter,but,unlike,her,son,she,also,realized,that,under,all,his,flowers,and,finery,ser,loras,is,as,hot-tempered,as,jaime,lannister,[END]
toss,joffrey,margaery,and,loras,in,a,pot,and,you've,got,the,makings,for,kingslayer,stew,[END]
the,old,woman,understood,something,else,as,well,[END]
her,son,was,determined,to,make,margaery,a,queen,and,for,that,he,needed,a,king,[END]
but,he,did,not,need,joffrey,[END]
we,shall,have,another,wedding,soon,wait,and,see,[END]
margaery,will,marry,tommen,[END]
she'll,keep,her,queenly,crown,and,her,maidenhead,neither,of,which,she,especially,wants,but,what,does,that,matter,[END]
the,great,western,alliance,will,be,preserved,[END]
for,a,time,at,least,[END]
margaery,and,tommen,[END]
sansa,did,not,know,what,to,say,[END]
she,had,liked,margaery,tyrell,and,her,small,sharp,grandmother,as,well,[END]
she,thought,wistfully,of,highgarden,with,its,courtyards,and,musicians,and,the,pleasure,barges,on,the,mander,a,far,cry,from,this,bleak,shore,[END]
at,least,i,am,safe,here,[END]
joffrey,is,dead,he,cannot,hurt,me,anymore,and,i,am,only,a,bastard,girl,now,[END]
alayne,stone,has,no,husband,and,no,claim,[END]
and,her,aunt,would,soon,be,here,as,well,[END]
the,long,nightmare,of,king's,landing,was,behind,her,and,her,mockery,of,a,marriage,as,well,[END]
she,could,make,herself,a,new,home,here,just,as,petyr,said,[END]
it,was,eight,long,days,until,lysa,arryn,arrived,[END]
on,five,of,them,it,rained,while,sansa,sat,bored,and,restless,by,the,fire,beside,the,old,blind,dog,[END]
he,was,too,sick,and,toothless,to,walk,guard,with,bryen,anymore,and,mostly,all,he,did,was,sleep,but,when,she,patted,him,he,whined,and,licked,her,hand,and,after,that,they,were,fast,friends,[END]
when,the,rains,let,up,petyr,walked,with,her,around,his,holdings,which,took,less,than,half,a,day,[END]
he,owned,a,lot,of,rocks,just,as,he,had,said,[END]
there,was,one,place,where,the,tide,came,jetting,up,out,of,a,blowhole,to,shoot,thirty,feet,into,the,air,and,another,where,someone,had,chiseled,the,seven-pointed,star,of,the,new,gods,upon,a,boulder,[END]
petyr,said,that,marked,one,of,the,places,the,andals,had,landed,when,they,came,across,the,sea,to,wrest,the,vale,from,the,first,men,[END]
farther,inland,a,dozen,families,lived,in,huts,of,piled,stone,beside,a,peat,bog,[END]
mine,own,smallfolk,petyr,said,though,only,the,oldest,seemed,to,know,him,[END]
there,was,a,hermit's,cave,on,his,land,as,well,but,no,hermit,[END]
he's,dead,now,but,when,i,was,a,boy,my,father,took,me,to,see,him,[END]
the,man,had,not,washed,in,forty,years,so,you,can,imagine,how,he,smelled,but,supposedly,he,had,the,gift,of,prophecy,[END]
he,groped,me,a,bit,and,said,i,would,be,a,great,man,and,for,that,my,father,gave,him,a,skin,of,wine,[END]
petyr,snorted,[END]
i,would,have,told,him,the,same,thing,for,half,a,cup,[END]
finally,on,a,grey,windy,afternoon,bryen,came,running,back,to,the,tower,with,his,dogs,barking,at,his,heels,to,announce,that,riders,were,approaching,from,the,southwest,[END]
lysa,lord,petyr,said,[END]
come,alayne,let,us,greet,her,[END]
they,put,on,their,cloaks,and,waited,outside,[END]
the,riders,numbered,no,more,than,a,score,a,very,modest,escort,for,the,lady,of,the,eyrie,[END]
three,maids,rode,with,her,and,a,dozen,household,knights,in,mail,and,plate,[END]
she,brought,a,septon,as,well,and,a,handsome,singer,with,a,wisp,of,a,mustache,and,long,sandy,curls,[END]
could,that,be,my,aunt,[END]
lady,lysa,was,two,years,younger,than,mother,but,this,woman,looked,ten,years,older,[END]
thick,auburn,tresses,fell,down,past,her,waist,but,beneath,the,costly,velvet,gown,and,jeweled,bodice,her,body,sagged,and,bulged,[END]
her,face,was,pink,and,painted,her,breasts,heavy,her,limbs,thick,[END]
she,was,taller,than,littlefinger,and,heavier,nor,did,she,show,any,grace,in,the,clumsy,way,she,climbed,down,off,her,horse,[END]
petyr,knelt,to,kiss,her,fingers,[END]
the,king's,small,council,commanded,me,to,woo,and,win,you,my,lady,[END]
do,you,think,you,might,have,me,for,your,lord,and,husband,[END]
lady,lysa,pooched,her,lips,and,pulled,him,up,to,plant,a,kiss,upon,his,cheek,[END]
oh,mayhaps,i,could,be,persuaded,[END]

my,daughter,[END]

my,lady,allow,me,to,present,you,alayne,stone,[END]
lysa,arryn,did,not,seem,greatly,pleased,to,see,her,[END]
sansa,did,a,deep,curtsy,her,head,bowed,[END]
a,bastard,[END]
she,heard,her,aunt,say,[END]

but,just,now,i,am,more,interested,in,what,i,might,do,with,you,my,lady,[END]
all,the,sternness,melted,off,her,aunt's,round,pink,face,and,for,a,moment,sansa,thought,lysa,arryn,was,about,to,cry,[END]

i,am,going,to,scream,so,loud,they'll,hear,me,in,the,eyrie,[END]
perhaps,i,could,bed,you,now,and,wed,you,later,[END]
the,lady,lysa,giggled,like,a,girl,[END]
oh,petyr,baelish,you,are,so,wicked,[END]
no,i,say,no,i,am,the,lady,of,the,eyrie,and,i,command,you,to,wed,me,this,very,moment,[END]
petyr,gave,a,shrug,[END]
as,my,lady,commands,then,[END]
i,am,helpless,before,you,as,ever,[END]
they,said,their,vows,within,the,hour,standing,beneath,a,sky-blue,canopy,as,the,sun,sank,in,the,west,[END]
afterward,trestle,tables,were,set,up,beneath,the,small,flint,tower,and,they,feasted,on,quail,venison,and,roast,boar,washing,it,down,with,a,fine,light,mead,[END]
torches,were,lit,as,dusk,crept,in,[END]
lysa's,singer,played,the,vow,unspoken,and,seasons,of,my,love,and,two,hearts,that,beat,as,one,[END]
several,younger,knights,even,asked,sansa,to,dance,[END]
her,aunt,danced,as,well,her,skirts,whirling,when,petyr,spun,her,in,his,arms,[END]
mead,and,marriage,had,taken,years,off,lady,lysa,[END]
she,laughed,at,everything,so,long,as,she,held,her,husband's,hand,and,her,eyes,seemed,to,glow,whenever,she,looked,at,him,[END]
when,it,was,time,for,the,bedding,her,knights,carried,her,up,to,the,tower,stripping,her,as,they,went,and,shouting,bawdy,jests,[END]
tyrion,spared,me,that,sansa,remembered,[END]
it,would,not,have,been,so,bad,being,undressed,for,a,man,she,loved,by,friends,who,loved,them,both,[END]
by,joffrey,though,[END]
she,shuddered,[END]
her,aunt,had,brought,only,three,ladies,with,her,so,they,pressed,sansa,to,help,them,undress,lord,petyr,and,march,him,up,to,his,marriage,bed,[END]
he,submitted,with,good,grace,and,a,wicked,tongue,giving,as,good,as,he,got,[END]
by,the,time,they,had,gotten,him,into,the,tower,and,out,of,his,clothes,the,other,women,were,flushed,with,laces,unlaced,kirtles,crooked,and,skirts,in,disarray,[END]
but,littlefinger,only,smiled,at,sansa,as,they,marched,him,up,to,the,bedchamber,where,his,lady,wife,was,waiting,[END]
lady,lysa,and,lord,petyr,had,the,third-story,bedchamber,to,themselves,but,the,tower,was,small,[END]
and,true,to,her,word,her,aunt,screamed,[END]
it,had,begun,to,rain,outside,driving,the,feasters,into,the,hall,one,floor,below,so,they,heard,most,every,word,[END]
petyr,her,aunt,moaned,[END]
oh,petyr,petyr,sweet,petyr,oh,oh,oh,[END]
there,petyr,there,[END]
that's,where,you,belong,[END]
lady,lysa's,singer,launched,into,a,bawdy,version,of,milady's,supper,but,even,his,singing,and,playing,could,not,drown,out,lysa's,cries,[END]
make,me,a,baby,petyr,she,screamed,make,me,another,sweet,little,baby,[END]
oh,petyr,my,precious,my,precious,peeeeeetyr,[END]
her,last,shriek,was,so,loud,that,it,set,the,dogs,to,barking,and,two,of,her,aunt's,ladies,could,scarce,contain,their,mirth,[END]
sansa,went,down,the,steps,and,out,into,the,night,[END]
a,light,rain,was,falling,on,the,remains,of,the,feast,but,the,air,smelled,fresh,and,clean,[END]
the,memory,of,her,own,wedding,night,with,tyrion,was,much,with,her,[END]
in,the,dark,i,am,the,knight,of,flowers,he,had,said,[END]
i,could,be,good,to,you,[END]
but,that,was,only,another,lannister,lie,[END]
a,dog,can,smell,a,lie,you,know,the,hound,had,told,her,once,[END]

look,around,you,and,take,a,good,whiff,[END]
they're,all,liars,here,and,every,one,better,than,you,[END]
she,wondered,what,had,become,of,sandor,clegane,[END]
did,he,know,that,they'd,killed,joffrey,[END]
would,he,care,[END]
he,had,been,the,prince's,sworn,shield,for,years,[END]
she,stayed,outside,for,a,long,time,[END]
when,at,last,she,sought,her,own,bed,wet,and,chilled,only,the,dim,glow,of,a,peat,fire,lit,the,darkened,hall,[END]
there,was,no,sound,from,above,[END]
the,young,singer,sat,in,a,corner,playing,a,slow,song,to,himself,[END]
one,of,her,aunt's,maids,was,kissing,a,knight,in,lord,petyr's,chair,their,hands,busy,beneath,each,other's,clothing,[END]
several,men,had,drunk,themselves,to,sleep,and,one,was,in,the,privy,being,noisily,sick,[END]
sansa,found,bryen's,old,blind,dog,in,her,little,alcove,beneath,the,steps,and,lay,down,next,to,him,[END]

the,old,dog,raised,his,head,and,growled,but,the,singer,gave,him,a,cuff,and,sent,him,slinking,off,whimpering,[END]
marillion,[END]
she,said,uncertain,[END]
you,are,[END]
kind,to,think,of,me,but,[END]

a,lay,for,your,eyes,a,ballad,for,your,lips,a,duet,to,your,breasts,[END]
i,will,not,sing,them,though,[END]
they,were,poor,things,unworthy,of,such,beauty,[END]
he,sat,on,her,bed,and,put,his,hand,on,her,leg,[END]
let,me,sing,to,you,with,my,body,instead,[END]
she,caught,a,whiff,of,his,breath,[END]
you're,drunk,[END]
i,never,get,drunk,[END]
mead,only,makes,me,merry,[END]
i,am,on,fire,[END]

oh,alayne,alayne,my,fair,maid,give,me,the,gift,of,your,innocence,[END]
you,will,thank,the,gods,you,did,[END]
i'll,have,you,singing,louder,than,the,lady,lysa,[END]
sansa,jerked,away,from,him,frightened,[END]
if,you,don't,leave,me,my,au,my,father,will,hang,you,[END]
lord,petyr,[END]
littlefinger,[END]
he,chuckled,[END]
lady,lysa,loves,me,well,and,i,am,lord,robert's,favorite,[END]
if,your,father,offends,me,i,will,destroy,him,with,a,verse,[END]
he,put,a,hand,on,her,breast,and,squeezed,[END]
let's,get,you,out,of,these,wet,clothes,[END]
you,wouldn't,want,them,ripped,i,know,[END]
come,sweet,lady,heed,your,heart,[END]
sansa,heard,the,soft,sound,of,steel,on,leather,[END]
singer,a,rough,voice,said,best,go,if,you,want,to,sing,again,[END]
the,light,was,dim,but,she,saw,a,faint,glimmer,of,a,blade,[END]
the,singer,saw,it,too,[END]
find,your,own,wench,the,knife,flashed,and,he,cried,out,[END]
you,cut,me,[END]
i'll,do,worse,if,you,don't,go,[END]
and,quick,as,that,marillion,was,gone,[END]
the,other,remained,looming,over,sansa,in,the,darkness,[END]
lord,petyr,said,watch,out,for,you,[END]
it,was,lothor,brune's,voice,she,realized,[END]
not,the,hound's,no,how,could,it,be,[END]
of,course,it,had,to,be,lothor,[END]
that,night,sansa,scarcely,slept,at,all,but,tossed,and,turned,just,as,she,had,aboard,the,merling,king,[END]
she,dreamt,of,joffrey,dying,but,as,he,clawed,at,his,throat,and,the,blood,ran,down,across,his,fingers,she,saw,with,horror,that,it,was,her,brother,robb,[END]
and,she,dreamed,of,her,wedding,night,too,of,tyrion's,eyes,devouring,her,as,she,undressed,[END]
only,then,he,was,bigger,than,tyrion,had,any,right,to,be,and,when,he,climbed,into,the,bed,his,face,was,scarred,only,on,one,side,[END]
i'll,have,a,song,from,you,he,rasped,and,sansa,woke,and,found,the,old,blind,dog,beside,her,once,again,[END]
i,wish,that,you,were,lady,she,said,[END]
come,the,morning,grisel,climbed,up,to,the,bedchamber,to,serve,the,lord,and,lady,a,tray,of,morning,bread,with,butter,honey,fruit,and,cream,[END]
she,returned,to,say,that,alayne,was,wanted,[END]
sansa,was,still,drowsy,from,sleep,[END]
it,took,her,a,moment,to,remember,that,she,was,alayne,[END]
lady,lysa,was,still,abed,but,lord,petyr,was,up,and,dressed,[END]
your,aunt,wishes,to,speak,with,you,he,told,sansa,as,he,pulled,on,a,boot,[END]
i've,told,her,who,you,are,[END]
gods,be,good,[END]
i,[END]
i,thank,you,my,lord,[END]
petyr,yanked,on,the,other,boot,[END]
i've,had,about,as,much,home,as,i,can,stomach,[END]
we'll,leave,for,the,eyrie,this,afternoon,[END]
he,kissed,his,lady,wife,and,licked,a,smear,of,honey,off,her,lips,then,headed,down,the,steps,[END]
sansa,stood,by,the,foot,of,the,bed,while,her,aunt,ate,a,pear,and,studied,her,[END]
i,see,it,now,the,lady,lysa,said,as,she,set,the,core,aside,[END]
you,look,so,much,like,catelyn,[END]
it's,kind,of,you,to,say,so,[END]
it,was,not,meant,as,flattery,[END]
if,truth,be,told,you,look,too,much,like,catelyn,[END]
something,must,be,done,[END]
we,shall,darken,your,hair,before,we,bring,you,back,to,the,eyrie,i,think,[END]
darken,my,hair,[END]
if,it,please,you,aunt,lysa,[END]
you,must,not,call,me,that,[END]
no,word,of,your,presence,here,must,be,allowed,to,reach,king's,landing,[END]
i,do,not,mean,to,have,my,son,endangered,[END]
she,nibbled,the,corner,of,a,honeycomb,[END]
i,have,kept,the,vale,out,of,this,war,[END]
our,harvest,has,been,plentiful,the,mountains,protect,us,and,the,eyrie,is,impregnable,[END]
even,so,it,would,not,do,to,draw,lord,tywin's,wroth,down,upon,us,[END]
lysa,set,the,comb,down,and,licked,honey,from,her,fingers,[END]
you,were,wed,to,tyrion,lannister,petyr,says,[END]
that,vile,dwarf,[END]
they,made,me,marry,him,[END]
i,never,wanted,it,[END]
no,more,than,i,did,her,aunt,said,[END]
jon,arryn,was,no,dwarf,but,he,was,old,[END]
you,may,not,think,so,to,see,me,now,but,on,the,day,we,wed,i,was,so,lovely,i,put,your,mother,to,shame,[END]
but,all,jon,desired,was,my,father's,swords,to,aid,his,darling,boys,[END]
i,should,have,refused,him,but,he,was,such,an,old,man,how,long,could,he,live,[END]
half,his,teeth,were,gone,and,his,breath,smelled,like,bad,cheese,[END]
i,cannot,abide,a,man,with,foul,breath,[END]
petyr's,breath,is,always,fresh,[END]
he,was,the,first,man,i,ever,kissed,you,know,[END]
my,father,said,he,was,too,lowborn,but,i,knew,how,high,he'd,rise,[END]
jon,gave,him,the,customs,for,gulltown,to,please,me,but,when,he,increased,the,incomes,tenfold,my,lord,husband,saw,how,clever,he,was,and,gave,him,other,appointments,even,brought,him,to,king's,landing,to,be,master,of,coin,[END]
that,was,hard,to,see,him,every,day,and,still,be,wed,to,that,old,cold,man,[END]
jon,did,his,duty,in,the,bedchamber,but,he,could,no,more,give,me,pleasure,than,he,could,give,me,children,[END]
his,seed,was,old,and,weak,[END]
all,my,babies,died,but,robert,three,girls,and,two,boys,[END]
all,my,sweet,little,babies,dead,and,that,old,man,just,went,on,and,on,with,his,stinking,breath,[END]
so,you,see,i,have,suffered,too,[END]
lady,lysa,sniffed,[END]
you,do,know,that,your,poor,mother,is,dead,[END]
tyrion,told,me,said,sansa,[END]
he,said,the,freys,murdered,her,at,the,twins,with,robb,[END]
tears,welled,suddenly,in,lady,lysa's,eyes,[END]
we,are,women,alone,now,you,and,i,are,you,afraid,child,[END]
be,brave,[END]
i,would,never,turn,away,cat's,daughter,[END]
we,are,bound,by,blood,[END]
she,beckoned,sansa,closer,[END]
you,may,come,kiss,my,cheek,alayne,[END]
dutifully,she,approached,and,knelt,beside,the,bed,[END]
her,aunt,was,drenched,in,sweet,scent,though,under,that,was,a,sour,milky,smell,[END]
her,cheek,tasted,of,paint,and,powder,[END]
as,sansa,stepped,back,lady,lysa,caught,her,wrist,[END]
now,tell,me,she,said,sharply,[END]
are,you,with,child,[END]
the,truth,now,i,will,know,if,you,lie,[END]
no,she,said,startled,by,the,question,[END]
you,are,a,woman,flowered,are,you,not,[END]
yes,[END]
sansa,knew,the,truth,of,her,flowering,could,not,be,long,hidden,in,the,eyrie,[END]
tyrion,didn't,[END]
he,never,[END]
she,could,feel,the,blush,creeping,up,her,cheeks,[END]
i,am,still,a,maid,[END]
was,the,dwarf,incapable,[END]
no,[END]
he,was,only,[END]
he,was,[END]
kind,[END]
she,could,not,say,that,not,here,not,to,this,aunt,who,hated,him,so,[END]
he,[END]
he,had,whores,my,lady,[END]
he,told,me,so,[END]
whores,[END]
lysa,released,her,wrist,[END]
of,course,he,did,[END]
what,woman,would,bed,such,a,creature,but,for,gold,[END]
i,should,have,killed,the,imp,when,he,was,in,my,power,but,he,tricked,me,[END]
he,is,full,of,low,cunning,that,one,[END]
his,sellsword,slew,my,good,ser,vardis,egen,[END]
catelyn,should,not,have,brought,him,here,i,told,her,that,[END]
she,made,off,with,our,uncle,too,[END]
that,was,wrong,of,her,[END]
the,blackfish,was,my,knight,of,the,gate,and,since,he,left,us,the,mountain,clans,are,growing,very,bold,[END]
petyr,will,soon,set,all,that,to,rights,though,[END]
i,shall,make,him,lord,protector,of,the,vale,[END]
her,aunt,smiled,for,the,first,time,almost,warmly,[END]
he,may,not,look,as,tall,or,strong,as,some,but,he,is,worth,more,than,all,of,them,[END]
trust,in,him,and,do,as,he,says,[END]
i,shall,aunt,[END]
my,lady,[END]
lady,lysa,seemed,pleased,by,that,[END]
i,knew,that,boy,joffrey,[END]
he,used,to,call,my,robert,cruel,names,and,once,he,slapped,him,with,a,wooden,sword,[END]
a,man,will,tell,you,poison,is,dishonorable,but,a,woman's,honor,is,different,[END]
the,mother,shaped,us,to,protect,our,children,and,our,only,dishonor,is,in,failure,[END]
you'll,know,that,when,you,have,a,child,[END]
a,child,[END]
said,sansa,uncertainly,[END]
lysa,waved,a,hand,negligently,[END]
not,for,many,years,[END]
you,are,too,young,to,be,a,mother,[END]
one,day,you,shall,want,children,though,[END]
just,as,you,will,want,to,marry,[END]
i,[END]
i,am,married,my,lady,[END]
yes,but,soon,a,widow,[END]
be,glad,the,imp,preferred,his,whores,[END]
it,would,not,be,fitting,for,my,son,to,take,that,dwarf's,leavings,but,as,he,never,touched,you,[END]
how,would,you,like,to,marry,your,cousin,the,lord,robert,[END]
the,thought,made,sansa,weary,[END]
all,she,knew,of,robert,arryn,was,that,he,was,a,little,boy,and,sickly,[END]
it,is,not,me,she,wants,her,son,to,marry,it,is,my,claim,[END]
no,one,will,ever,marry,me,for,love,[END]
but,lying,came,easy,to,her,now,[END]
i,[END]
can,scarcely,wait,to,meet,him,my,lady,[END]
but,he,is,still,a,child,is,he,not,[END]
he,is,eight,[END]
and,not,robust,[END]
but,such,a,good,boy,so,bright,and,clever,[END]
he,will,be,a,great,man,alayne,[END]
the,seed,is,strong,my,lord,husband,said,before,he,died,[END]
his,last,words,[END]
the,gods,sometimes,let,us,glimpse,the,future,as,we,lay,dying,[END]
i,see,no,reason,why,you,should,not,be,wed,as,soon,as,we,know,that,your,lannister,husband,is,dead,[END]
a,secret,wedding,to,be,sure,[END]
the,lord,of,the,eyrie,could,scarcely,be,thought,to,have,married,a,bastard,that,would,not,be,fitting,[END]
the,ravens,should,bring,us,the,word,from,king's,landing,once,the,imp's,head,rolls,[END]
you,and,robert,can,be,wed,the,next,day,won't,that,be,joyous,[END]
it,will,be,good,for,him,to,have,a,little,companion,[END]
he,played,with,vardis,egen's,boy,when,we,first,returned,to,the,eyrie,and,my,steward's,sons,as,well,but,they,were,much,too,rough,and,i,had,no,choice,but,to,send,them,away,[END]
do,you,read,well,alayne,[END]
septa,mordane,was,good,enough,to,say,so,[END]
robert,has,weak,eyes,but,he,loves,to,be,read,to,lady,lysa,confided,[END]
he,likes,stories,about,animals,the,best,[END]
do,you,know,the,little,song,about,the,chicken,who,dressed,as,a,fox,[END]
i,sing,him,that,all,the,time,he,never,grows,tired,of,it,[END]
and,he,likes,to,play,hopfrog,and,spin-the-sword,and,come-into-my-castle,but,you,must,always,let,him,win,[END]
that's,only,proper,don't,you,think,[END]
he,is,the,lord,of,the,eyrie,after,all,you,must,never,forget,that,[END]
you,are,well,born,and,the,starks,of,winterfell,were,always,proud,but,winterfell,has,fallen,and,you,are,really,just,a,beggar,now,so,put,that,pride,aside,[END]
gratitude,will,better,become,you,in,your,present,circumstances,[END]
yes,and,obedience,[END]
my,son,will,have,a,grateful,and,obedient,wife,[END]
jon,[END]
day,and,night,the,axes,rang,[END]
jon,could,not,remember,the,last,time,he,had,slept,[END]
when,he,closed,his,eyes,he,dreamed,of,fighting,when,he,woke,he,fought,[END]
even,in,the,king's,tower,he,could,hear,the,ceaseless,thunk,of,bronze,and,flint,and,stolen,steel,biting,into,wood,and,it,was,louder,when,he,tried,to,rest,in,the,warming,shed,atop,the,wall,[END]
mance,had,sledgehammers,at,work,as,well,and,long,saws,with,teeth,of,bone,and,flint,[END]
once,as,he,was,drifting,off,into,an,exhausted,sleep,there,came,a,great,cracking,from,the,haunted,forest,and,a,sentinel,tree,came,crashing,down,in,a,cloud,of,dirt,and,needles,[END]
he,was,awake,when,owen,came,to,him,lying,restless,under,a,pile,of,furs,on,the,floor,of,the,warming,shed,[END]
lord,snow,said,owen,shaking,his,shoulder,the,dawn,[END]
he,gave,jon,a,hand,to,help,pull,him,back,onto,his,feet,[END]
others,were,waking,as,well,jostling,one,another,as,they,pulled,on,their,boots,and,buckled,their,swordbelts,in,the,close,confines,of,the,shed,[END]
no,one,spoke,[END]
they,were,all,too,tired,for,talk,[END]
few,of,them,ever,left,the,wall,these,days,[END]
it,took,too,long,to,ride,up,and,down,in,the,cage,[END]
castle,black,had,been,abandoned,to,maester,aemon,ser,wynton,stout,and,a,few,others,too,old,or,ill,to,fight,[END]

maester,aemon,sent,a,raven,and,king,robert,came,with,all,his,strength,[END]
i,dreamed,i,saw,his,golden,banners,[END]
jon,made,himself,smile,[END]
that,would,be,a,welcome,sight,to,see,owen,[END]
ignoring,the,twinge,of,pain,in,his,leg,he,swept,a,black,fur,cloak,about,his,shoulders,gathered,up,his,crutch,and,went,out,onto,the,wall,to,face,another,day,[END]

the,men,beneath,the,wood,and,hides,would,be,pulling,hard,jon,knew,putting,their,shoulders,into,it,straining,to,keep,the,wheels,turning,but,once,the,turtle,was,flush,against,the,gate,they,would,exchange,their,ropes,for,axes,[END]

it,was,likely,to,be,a,futile,gesture,jon,knew,but,it,had,to,be,better,than,standing,helpless,[END]
cumbersome,and,slow-moving,the,turtle,made,for,an,easy,shot,and,his,archers,and,crossbowmen,soon,turned,it,into,a,lumbering,wooden,hedgehog,[END]

a,stone,from,one,of,the,trebuchets,might,have,crushed,it,but,the,one,machine,was,still,broken,and,the,wildlings,had,gone,wide,around,the,area,where,the,other,dropped,its,loads,[END]

to,his,left,the,catapult,made,a,thunk,and,filled,the,air,with,spinning,stones,[END]

their,only,hope,was,to,try,and,crush,the,turtle,when,it,reached,the,wall,[END]
for,that,they,needed,boulders,[END]
no,matter,how,stoutly,built,the,turtle,was,a,huge,chunk,of,rock,crashing,straight,down,on,top,of,it,from,seven,hundred,feet,was,bound,to,do,some,damage,[END]

yesterday,after,he'd,seen,the,free,folk,covering,the,turtle,with,sheepskins,jon,told,grenn,to,pour,water,into,the,barrels,as,much,as,they,would,take,[END]
the,water,would,seep,down,through,the,crushed,stone,and,overnight,the,whole,thing,would,freeze,solid,[END]

once,the,barrel,was,on,its,side,jon,grabbed,a,torch,and,waved,it,above,the,surface,of,the,wall,back,and,forth,just,enough,to,melt,the,ice,a,little,[END]
the,thin,film,of,water,helped,the,barrel,roll,more,easily,[END]
too,easily,in,fact,they,almost,lost,it,[END]
but,finally,with,four,of,them,pooling,their,efforts,they,rolled,their,boulder,to,the,edge,and,stood,it,up,again,[END]

again,jon,barked,and,grenn,and,kegs,slammed,their,shoulders,against,the,next,barrel,and,sent,it,tottering,out,into,empty,air,[END]
by,the,time,they,were,done,the,front,of,mance's,turtle,was,a,crushed,and,splintered,ruin,and,wildlings,were,spilling,out,the,other,end,and,scrambling,for,their,camp,[END]

so,i,have,heard,[END]
he,is,almost,eight,feet,tall,and,must,weigh,thirty,stone,all,of,it,muscle,[END]

the,trick,is,to,get,them,off,their,feet,[END]
once,they,go,down,they're,dead,[END]
the,dornishman,sounded,so,blithely,confident,that,tyrion,felt,almost,reassured,until,he,turned,and,said,daemon,my,spear,[END]
ser,daemon,tossed,it,to,him,and,the,red,viper,snatched,it,from,the,air,[END]
you,mean,to,face,the,mountain,with,a,spear,[END]
that,made,tyrion,uneasy,all,over,again,[END]
in,battle,ranks,of,massed,spears,made,for,a,formidable,front,but,single,combat,against,a,skilled,swordsman,was,a,very,different,matter,[END]
we,are,fond,of,spears,in,dorne,[END]
besides,it,is,the,only,way,to,counter,his,reach,[END]
have,a,look,lord,imp,but,see,you,do,not,touch,[END]
the,spear,was,turned,ash,eight,feet,long,the,shaft,smooth,thick,and,heavy,[END]
the,last,two,feet,of,that,was,steel,a,slender,leaf-shaped,spearhead,narrowing,to,a,wicked,spike,[END]
the,edges,looked,sharp,enough,to,shave,with,[END]
when,oberyn,spun,the,haft,between,the,palms,of,his,hand,they,glistened,black,[END]
oil,[END]
or,poison,[END]
tyrion,decided,that,he,would,sooner,not,know,[END]
i,hope,you,are,good,with,that,he,said,doubtfully,[END]
you,will,have,no,cause,for,complaint,[END]
though,ser,gregor,may,[END]

inside,the,elbow,and,knee,beneath,the,arms,[END]

he,set,the,spear,aside,[END]
it,is,said,that,a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts,[END]
perhaps,you,will,return,to,sunspear,with,me,when,the,day's,bloodletting,is,done,[END]
my,brother,doran,would,be,most,pleased,to,meet,the,rightful,heir,to,casterly,rock,[END]

does,the,snake,think,i,have,sansa,squirreled,away,somewhere,like,a,nut,i'm,hoarding,for,winter,[END]
if,so,tyrion,was,not,about,to,disabuse,him,[END]
a,trip,to,dorne,might,be,very,pleasant,now,that,i,reflect,on,it,[END]
plan,on,a,lengthy,visit,[END]
prince,oberyn,sipped,his,wine,[END]
you,and,doran,have,many,matters,of,mutual,interest,to,discuss,[END]
music,trade,history,wine,the,dwarf's,penny,[END]
the,laws,of,inheritance,and,succession,[END]
no,doubt,an,uncle's,counsel,would,be,of,benefit,to,queen,myrcella,in,the,trying,times,ahead,[END]

it,would,have,been,more,tempting,if,only,he,did,have,sansa,tucked,beneath,his,cloak,[END]
if,she,declared,for,myrcella,over,tommen,would,the,north,follow,[END]
what,the,red,viper,was,hinting,at,was,treason,[END]
could,tyrion,truly,take,up,arms,against,tommen,against,his,own,father,[END]

it,might,be,worth,it,for,that,alone,[END]
do,you,recall,the,tale,i,told,you,of,our,first,meeting,imp,[END]
prince,oberyn,asked,as,the,bastard,of,godsgrace,knelt,before,him,to,fasten,his,greaves,[END]
it,was,not,for,your,tail,alone,that,my,sister,and,i,came,to,casterly,rock,[END]
we,were,on,a,quest,of,sorts,[END]
a,quest,that,took,us,to,starfall,the,arbor,oldtown,the,shield,islands,crakehall,and,finally,casterly,rock,[END]
but,our,true,destination,was,marriage,[END]
doran,was,betrothed,to,lady,mellario,of,norvos,so,he,had,been,left,behind,as,castellan,of,sunspear,[END]
my,sister,and,i,were,yet,unpromised,[END]
elia,found,it,all,exciting,[END]
she,was,of,that,age,and,her,delicate,health,had,never,permitted,her,much,travel,[END]
i,preferred,to,amuse,myself,by,mocking,my,sister's,suitors,[END]
there,was,little,lord,lazyeye,squire,squishlips,one,i,named,the,whale,that,walks,that,sort,of,thing,[END]
the,only,one,who,was,even,halfway,presentable,was,young,baelor,hightower,[END]
a,pretty,lad,and,my,sister,was,half,in,love,with,him,until,he,had,the,misfortune,to,fart,once,in,our,presence,[END]
i,promptly,named,him,baelor,breakwind,and,after,that,elia,couldn't,look,at,him,without,laughing,[END]
i,was,a,monstrous,young,fellow,someone,should,have,sliced,out,my,vile,tongue,[END]
yes,tyrion,agreed,silently,[END]
baelor,hightower,was,no,longer,young,but,he,remained,lord,leyton's,heir,wealthy,handsome,and,a,knight,of,splendid,repute,[END]
baelor,brightsmile,they,called,him,now,[END]
had,elia,wed,him,in,place,of,rhaegar,targaryen,she,might,be,in,oldtown,with,her,children,growing,tall,around,her,[END]
he,wondered,how,many,lives,had,been,snuffed,out,by,that,fart,[END]
lannisport,was,the,end,of,our,voyage,prince,oberyn,went,on,as,ser,arron,qorgyle,helped,him,into,a,padded,leather,tunic,and,began,lacing,it,up,the,back,[END]
were,you,aware,that,our,mothers,knew,each,other,of,old,[END]
they,had,been,at,court,together,as,girls,i,seem,to,recall,[END]
companions,to,princess,rhaella,[END]
just,so,[END]
it,was,my,belief,that,the,mothers,had,cooked,up,this,plot,between,them,[END]
squire,squishlips,and,his,ilk,and,the,various,pimply,young,maidens,who'd,been,paraded,before,me,were,the,almonds,before,the,feast,meant,only,to,whet,our,appetites,[END]
the,main,course,was,to,be,served,at,casterly,rock,[END]
cersei,and,jaime,[END]
such,a,clever,dwarf,[END]
elia,and,i,were,older,to,be,sure,[END]
your,brother,and,sister,could,not,have,been,more,than,eight,or,nine,[END]
still,a,difference,of,five,or,six,years,is,little,enough,[END]
and,there,was,an,empty,cabin,on,our,ship,a,very,nice,cabin,such,as,might,be,kept,for,a,person,of,high,birth,[END]
as,if,it,were,intended,that,we,take,someone,back,to,sunspear,[END]
a,young,page,perhaps,[END]
or,a,companion,for,elia,[END]
your,lady,mother,meant,to,betroth,jaime,to,my,sister,or,cersei,to,me,[END]
perhaps,both,[END]
perhaps,said,tyrion,but,my,father,[END]
ruled,the,seven,kingdoms,but,was,ruled,at,home,by,his,lady,wife,or,so,my,mother,always,said,[END]
prince,oberyn,raised,his,arms,so,lord,dagos,manwoody,and,the,bastard,of,godsgrace,could,slip,a,chainmail,byrnie,down,over,his,head,[END]
at,oldtown,we,learned,of,your,mother's,death,and,the,monstrous,child,she,had,borne,[END]
we,might,have,turned,back,there,but,my,mother,chose,to,sail,on,[END]
i,told,you,of,the,welcome,we,found,at,casterly,rock,[END]
what,i,did,not,tell,you,was,that,my,mother,waited,as,long,as,was,decent,and,then,broached,your,father,about,our,purpose,[END]
years,later,on,her,deathbed,she,told,me,that,lord,tywin,had,refused,us,brusquely,[END]
his,daughter,was,meant,for,prince,rhaegar,he,informed,her,[END]
and,when,she,asked,for,jaime,to,espouse,elia,he,offered,her,you,instead,[END]
which,offer,she,took,for,an,outrage,[END]
it,was,[END]
even,you,can,see,that,surely,[END]
oh,surely,[END]
it,all,goes,back,and,back,tyrion,thought,to,our,mothers,and,fathers,and,theirs,before,them,[END]
we,are,puppets,dancing,on,the,strings,of,those,who,came,before,us,and,one,day,our,own,children,will,take,up,our,strings,and,dance,on,in,our,steads,[END]
well,prince,rhaegar,married,elia,of,dorne,not,cersei,lannister,of,casterly,rock,[END]
so,it,would,seem,your,mother,won,that,tilt,[END]
she,thought,so,prince,oberyn,agreed,but,your,father,is,not,a,man,to,forget,such,slights,[END]
he,taught,that,lesson,to,lord,and,lady,tarbeck,once,and,to,the,reynes,of,castamere,[END]
and,at,king's,landing,he,taught,it,to,my,sister,[END]
my,helm,dagos,[END]
manwoody,handed,it,to,him,a,high,golden,helm,with,a,copper,disk,mounted,on,the,brow,the,sun,of,dorne,[END]
the,visor,had,been,removed,tyrion,saw,[END]
elia,and,her,children,have,waited,long,for,justice,[END]
prince,oberyn,pulled,on,soft,red,leather,gloves,and,took,up,his,spear,again,[END]
but,this,day,they,shall,have,it,[END]
the,outer,ward,had,been,chosen,for,the,combat,[END]
tyrion,had,to,skip,and,run,to,keep,up,with,prince,oberyn's,long,strides,[END]
the,snake,is,eager,he,thought,[END]
let,us,hope,he,is,venomous,as,well,[END]
the,day,was,grey,and,windy,[END]
the,sun,was,struggling,to,break,through,the,clouds,but,tyrion,could,no,more,have,said,who,was,going,to,win,that,fight,than,the,one,on,which,his,life,depended,[END]
it,looked,as,though,a,thousand,people,had,come,to,see,if,he,would,live,or,die,[END]
they,lined,the,castle,wallwalks,and,elbowed,one,another,on,the,steps,of,keeps,and,towers,[END]
they,watched,from,the,stable,doors,from,windows,and,bridges,from,balconies,and,roofs,[END]
and,the,yard,was,packed,with,them,so,many,that,the,gold,cloaks,and,the,knights,of,the,kingsguard,had,to,shove,them,back,to,make,enough,room,for,the,fight,[END]
some,had,dragged,out,chairs,to,watch,more,comfortably,while,others,perched,on,barrels,[END]
we,should,have,done,this,in,the,dragonpit,tyrion,thought,sourly,[END]
we,could,have,charged,a,penny,a,head,and,paid,for,joffrey's,wedding,and,funeral,both,[END]
some,of,the,onlookers,even,had,small,children,sitting,on,their,shoulders,to,get,a,better,view,[END]
they,shouted,and,pointed,at,the,sight,of,tyrion,[END]
cersei,seemed,half,a,child,herself,beside,ser,gregor,[END]
in,his,armor,the,mountain,looked,bigger,than,any,man,had,any,right,to,be,[END]
beneath,a,long,yellow,surcoat,bearing,the,three,black,dogs,of,clegane,he,wore,heavy,plate,over,chainmail,dull,grey,steel,dinted,and,scarred,in,battle,[END]
beneath,that,would,be,boiled,leather,and,a,layer,of,quilting,[END]
a,flat-topped,greathelm,was,bolted,to,his,gorget,with,breaths,around,the,mouth,and,nose,and,a,narrow,slit,for,vision,[END]
the,crest,atop,it,was,a,stone,fist,[END]
if,ser,gregor,was,suffering,from,wounds,tyrion,could,see,no,sign,of,it,from,across,the,yard,[END]
he,looks,as,though,he,was,chiseled,out,of,rock,standing,there,[END]
his,greatsword,was,planted,in,the,ground,before,him,six,feet,of,scarred,metal,[END]
ser,gregor's,huge,hands,clad,in,gauntlets,of,lobstered,steel,clasped,the,crosshilt,to,either,side,of,the,grip,[END]
even,prince,oberyn's,paramour,paled,at,the,sight,of,him,[END]
you,are,going,to,fight,that,[END]
ellaria,sand,said,in,a,hushed,voice,[END]
i,am,going,to,kill,that,her,lover,replied,carelessly,[END]
tyrion,had,his,own,doubts,now,that,they,stood,on,the,brink,[END]
when,he,looked,at,prince,oberyn,he,found,himself,wishing,he,had,bronn,defending,him,[END]
or,even,better,jaime,[END]
the,red,viper,was,lightly,armored,greaves,vambraces,gorget,spaulder,steel,codpiece,[END]
elsewise,oberyn,was,clad,in,supple,leather,and,flowing,silks,[END]
over,his,byrnie,he,wore,his,scales,of,gleaming,copper,but,mail,and,scale,together,would,not,give,him,a,quarter,the,protection,of,gregor's,heavy,plate,[END]
with,its,visor,removed,the,prince's,helm,was,effectively,no,better,than,a,half-helm,lacking,even,a,nasal,[END]
his,round,steel,shield,was,brightly,polished,and,showed,the,sun-and-spear,in,red,gold,yellow,gold,white,gold,and,copper,[END]
dance,around,him,until,he's,so,tired,he,can,hardly,lift,his,arm,then,put,him,on,his,back,[END]
the,red,viper,seemed,to,have,the,same,notion,as,bronn,[END]
but,the,sellsword,had,been,blunt,about,the,risks,of,such,tactics,[END]
i,hope,to,seven,hells,that,you,know,what,you,are,doing,snake,[END]
a,platform,had,been,erected,beside,the,tower,of,the,hand,halfway,between,the,two,champions,[END]
that,was,where,lord,tywin,sat,with,his,brother,ser,kevan,[END]
king,tommen,was,not,in,evidence,for,that,at,least,tyrion,was,grateful,[END]
lord,tywin,glanced,briefly,at,his,dwarf,son,then,lifted,his,hand,[END]
a,dozen,trumpeters,blew,a,fanfare,to,quiet,the,crowd,[END]
the,high,septon,shuffled,forward,in,his,tall,crystal,crown,and,prayed,that,the,father,above,would,help,them,in,this,judgment,and,that,the,warrior,would,lend,his,strength,to,the,arm,of,the,man,whose,cause,was,just,[END]
that,would,be,me,tyrion,almost,shouted,but,they,would,only,laugh,and,he,was,sick,unto,death,of,laughter,[END]

the,star's,master,and,one,who,claims,to,speak,for,astapor,[END]
i,will,see,the,envoy,first,[END]

i,left,a,council,to,rule,astapor,[END]
a,healer,a,scholar,and,a,priest,[END]
your,worship,those,sly,rogues,betrayed,your,trust,[END]
it,was,revealed,that,they,were,scheming,to,restore,the,good,masters,to,power,and,the,people,to,chains,[END]
great,cleon,exposed,their,plots,and,hacked,their,heads,off,with,a,cleaver,and,the,grateful,folk,of,astapor,have,crowned,him,for,his,valor,[END]
noble,ghael,said,missandei,in,the,dialect,of,astapor,is,this,the,same,cleon,once,owned,by,grazdan,mo,ullhor,[END]
her,voice,was,guileless,yet,the,question,plainly,made,the,envoy,anxious,[END]
the,same,he,admitted,[END]
a,great,man,[END]
missandei,leaned,close,to,dany,[END]
he,was,a,butcher,in,grazdan's,kitchen,the,girl,whispered,in,her,ear,[END]
it,was,said,he,could,slaughter,a,pig,faster,than,any,man,in,astapor,[END]
i,have,given,astapor,a,butcher,king,[END]
dany,felt,ill,but,she,knew,she,must,not,let,the,envoy,see,it,[END]
i,will,pray,that,king,cleon,rules,well,and,wisely,[END]
what,would,he,have,of,me,[END]

perhaps,we,should,speak,more,privily,your,grace,[END]
i,have,no,secrets,from,my,captains,and,commanders,[END]
as,you,wish,[END]
great,cleon,bids,me,declare,his,devotion,to,the,mother,of,dragons,[END]
your,enemies,are,his,enemies,he,says,and,chief,among,them,are,the,wise,masters,of,yunkai,[END]
he,proposes,a,pact,between,astapor,and,meereen,against,the,yunkai'i,[END]
i,swore,no,harm,would,come,to,yunkai,if,they,released,their,slaves,said,dany,[END]
these,yunkish,dogs,cannot,be,trusted,your,worship,[END]

a,marriage,[END]
to,me,[END]
ghael,smiled,[END]
his,teeth,were,brown,and,rotten,[END]
great,cleon,will,give,you,many,strong,sons,[END]
dany,found,herself,bereft,of,words,but,little,missandei,came,to,her,rescue,[END]
did,his,first,wife,give,him,sons,[END]
the,envoy,looked,at,her,unhappily,[END]
great,cleon,has,three,daughters,by,his,first,wife,[END]
two,of,his,newer,wives,are,with,child,[END]
but,he,means,to,put,all,of,them,aside,if,the,mother,of,dragons,will,consent,to,wed,him,[END]
how,noble,of,him,said,dany,[END]
i,will,consider,all,you've,said,my,lord,[END]
she,gave,orders,that,ghael,be,given,chambers,for,the,night,somewhere,lower,in,the,pyramid,[END]
all,my,victories,turn,to,dross,in,my,hands,she,thought,[END]
whatever,i,do,all,i,make,is,death,and,horror,[END]
when,word,of,what,had,befallen,astapor,reached,the,streets,as,it,surely,would,tens,of,thousands,of,newly,freed,meereenese,slaves,would,doubtless,decide,to,follow,her,when,she,went,west,for,fear,of,what,awaited,them,if,they,stayed,[END]
yet,it,might,well,be,that,worse,would,await,them,on,the,march,[END]
even,if,she,emptied,every,granary,in,the,city,and,left,meereen,to,starve,how,could,she,feed,so,many,[END]
the,way,before,her,was,fraught,with,hardship,bloodshed,and,danger,[END]
ser,jorah,had,warned,her,of,that,[END]
he'd,warned,her,of,so,many,things,[END]
he'd,[END]
no,i,will,not,think,of,jorah,mormont,[END]
let,him,keep,a,little,longer,[END]
i,shall,see,this,trader,captain,she,announced,[END]
perhaps,he,would,have,some,better,tidings,[END]
that,proved,to,be,a,forlorn,hope,[END]
the,master,of,the,indigo,star,was,qartheen,so,he,wept,copiously,when,asked,about,astapor,[END]
the,city,bleeds,[END]
dead,men,rot,unburied,in,the,streets,each,pyramid,is,an,armed,camp,and,the,markets,have,neither,food,nor,slaves,for,sale,[END]
and,the,poor,children,[END]
king,cleaver's,thugs,have,seized,every,highborn,boy,in,astapor,to,make,new,unsullied,for,the,trade,though,it,will,be,years,before,they,are,trained,[END]
the,thing,that,surprised,dany,most,was,how,unsurprised,she,was,[END]
she,found,herself,remembering,eroeh,the,lhazarene,girl,she,had,once,tried,to,protect,and,what,had,happened,to,her,[END]
it,will,be,the,same,in,meereen,once,i,march,she,thought,[END]
the,slaves,from,the,fighting,pits,bred,and,trained,to,slaughter,were,already,proving,themselves,unruly,and,quarrelsome,[END]
they,seemed,to,think,they,owned,the,city,now,and,every,man,and,woman,in,it,[END]
two,of,them,had,been,among,the,eight,she'd,hanged,[END]
there,is,no,more,i,can,do,she,told,herself,[END]
what,do,you,want,of,me,captain,[END]
slaves,he,said,[END]
my,holds,are,full,to,bursting,with,ivory,ambergris,zorse,hides,and,other,fine,goods,[END]
i,would,trade,them,here,for,slaves,to,sell,in,lys,and,volantis,[END]
we,have,no,slaves,for,sale,said,dany,[END]
my,queen,[END]
daario,stepped,forward,[END]
the,riverside,is,full,of,meereenese,begging,leave,to,be,allowed,to,sell,themselves,to,this,qartheen,[END]
they,are,thicker,than,the,flies,[END]
dany,was,shocked,[END]
they,want,to,be,slaves,[END]
the,ones,who,come,are,well,spoken,and,gently,born,sweet,queen,[END]
such,slaves,are,prized,[END]
in,the,free,cities,they,will,be,tutors,scribes,bed,slaves,even,healers,and,priests,[END]
they,will,sleep,in,soft,beds,eat,rich,foods,and,dwell,in,manses,[END]
here,they,have,lost,all,and,live,in,fear,and,squalor,[END]
i,see,[END]
perhaps,it,was,not,so,shocking,if,these,tales,of,astapor,were,true,[END]
dany,thought,a,moment,[END]
any,man,who,wishes,to,sell,himself,into,slavery,may,do,so,[END]
or,woman,[END]
she,raised,a,hand,[END]
but,they,may,not,sell,their,children,nor,a,man,his,wife,[END]
in,astapor,the,city,took,a,tenth,part,of,the,price,each,time,a,slave,changed,hands,missandei,told,her,[END]
we'll,do,the,same,dany,decided,[END]
wars,were,won,with,gold,as,much,as,swords,[END]
a,tenth,part,[END]
in,gold,or,silver,coin,or,ivory,[END]
meereen,has,no,need,of,saffron,cloves,or,zorse,hides,[END]
it,shall,be,done,as,you,command,glorious,queen,said,daario,[END]
my,stormcrows,will,collect,your,tenth,[END]
if,the,stormcrows,saw,to,the,collections,at,least,half,the,gold,would,somehow,go,astray,dany,knew,[END]
but,the,second,sons,were,just,as,bad,and,the,unsullied,were,as,unlettered,as,they,were,incorruptible,[END]
records,must,be,kept,she,said,[END]
seek,among,the,freedmen,for,men,who,can,read,write,and,do,sums,[END]
his,business,done,the,captain,of,the,indigo,star,bowed,and,took,his,leave,[END]
dany,shifted,uncomfortably,on,the,ebony,bench,[END]
she,dreaded,what,must,come,next,yet,she,knew,she,had,put,it,off,too,long,already,[END]
yunkai,and,astapor,threats,of,war,marriage,proposals,the,march,west,looming,over,all,[END]
i,need,my,knights,[END]
i,need,their,swords,and,i,need,their,counsel,[END]
yet,the,thought,of,seeing,jorah,mormont,again,made,her,feel,as,if,she'd,swallowed,a,spoonful,of,flies,angry,agitated,sick,[END]
she,could,almost,feel,them,buzzing,round,her,belly,[END]
i,am,the,blood,of,the,dragon,[END]
i,must,be,strong,[END]
i,must,have,fire,in,my,eyes,when,i,face,them,not,tears,[END]

my,good,knights,[END]

ser,barristan,walked,with,his,head,held,high,but,ser,jorah,stared,at,the,marble,floor,as,he,approached,[END]
the,one,is,proud,the,other,guilty,[END]
the,old,man,had,shaved,off,his,white,beard,[END]
he,looked,ten,years,younger,without,it,[END]
but,her,balding,bear,looked,older,than,he,had,[END]
they,halted,before,the,bench,[END]
strong,belwas,stepped,back,and,stood,with,his,arms,crossed,across,his,scarred,chest,[END]
ser,jorah,cleared,his,throat,[END]
khaleesi,[END]
she,had,missed,his,voice,so,much,but,she,had,to,be,stern,[END]
be,quiet,[END]
i,will,tell,you,when,to,speak,[END]
she,stood,[END]
when,i,sent,you,down,into,the,sewers,part,of,me,hoped,i'd,seen,the,last,of,you,[END]
it,seemed,a,fitting,end,for,liars,to,drown,in,slavers',filth,[END]
i,thought,the,gods,would,deal,with,you,but,instead,you,returned,to,me,[END]
my,gallant,knights,of,westeros,an,informer,and,a,turncloak,[END]
my,brother,would,have,hanged,you,both,[END]
viserys,would,have,anyway,[END]
she,did,not,know,what,rhaegar,would,have,done,[END]
i,will,admit,you,helped,win,me,this,city,[END]
ser,jorah's,mouth,tightened,[END]
we,won,you,this,city,[END]
we,sewer,rats,[END]

though,there,was,truth,to,what,he,said,[END]
while,joso's,cock,and,the,other,rams,were,battering,the,city,gates,and,her,archers,were,firing,flights,of,flaming,arrows,over,the,walls,dany,had,sent,two,hundred,men,along,the,river,under,cover,of,darkness,to,fire,the,hulks,in,the,harbor,[END]
but,that,was,only,to,hide,their,true,purpose,[END]
as,the,flaming,ships,drew,the,eyes,of,the,defenders,on,the,walls,a,few,half-mad,swimmers,found,the,sewer,mouths,and,pried,loose,a,rusted,iron,grating,[END]
ser,jorah,ser,barristan,strong,belwas,and,twenty,brave,fools,slipped,beneath,the,brown,water,and,up,the,brick,tunnel,a,mixed,force,of,sellswords,unsullied,and,freedmen,[END]
dany,had,told,them,to,choose,only,men,who,had,no,families,[END]
and,preferably,no,sense,of,smell,[END]
they,had,been,lucky,as,well,as,brave,[END]
it,had,been,a,moon's,turn,since,the,last,good,rain,and,the,sewers,were,only,thigh-high,[END]
the,oilcloth,they'd,wrapped,around,their,torches,kept,them,dry,so,they,had,light,[END]
a,few,of,the,freedmen,were,frightened,of,the,huge,rats,until,strong,belwas,caught,one,and,bit,it,in,two,[END]
one,man,was,killed,by,a,great,pale,lizard,that,reared,up,out,of,the,dark,water,to,drag,him,off,by,the,leg,but,when,next,ripples,were,spied,ser,jorah,butchered,the,beast,with,his,blade,[END]
they,took,some,wrong,turnings,but,once,they,found,the,surface,strong,belwas,led,them,to,the,nearest,fighting,pit,where,they,surprised,a,few,guards,and,struck,the,chains,off,the,slaves,[END]
within,an,hour,half,the,fighting,slaves,in,meereen,had,risen,[END]
you,helped,win,this,city,she,repeated,stubbornly,[END]
and,you,have,served,me,well,in,the,past,[END]
ser,barristan,saved,me,from,the,titan's,bastard,and,from,the,sorrowful,man,in,qarth,[END]
ser,jorah,saved,me,from,the,poisoner,in,vaes,dothrak,and,again,from,drogo's,bloodriders,after,my,sun-and-stars,had,died,[END]
so,many,people,wanted,her,dead,sometimes,she,lost,count,[END]
and,yet,you,lied,deceived,me,betrayed,me,[END]
she,turned,to,ser,barristan,[END]
you,protected,my,father,for,many,years,fought,beside,my,brother,on,the,trident,but,you,abandoned,viserys,in,his,exile,and,bent,your,knee,to,the,usurper,instead,[END]
why,[END]
and,tell,it,true,[END]
some,truths,are,hard,to,hear,[END]
robert,was,a,[END]
a,good,knight,[END]
chivalrous,brave,[END]
he,spared,my,life,and,the,lives,of,many,others,[END]
prince,viserys,was,only,a,boy,it,would,have,been,years,before,he,was,fit,to,rule,and,[END]
forgive,me,my,queen,but,you,asked,for,truth,[END]
even,as,a,child,your,brother,viserys,oft,seemed,to,be,his,father's,son,in,ways,that,rhaegar,never,did,[END]
his,father's,son,[END]
dany,frowned,[END]
what,does,that,mean,[END]
the,old,knight,did,not,blink,[END]
your,father,is,called,the,mad,king',in,westeros,[END]
has,no,one,ever,told,you,[END]
viserys,did,[END]
the,mad,king,[END]
the,usurper,called,him,that,the,usurper,and,his,dogs,[END]
the,mad,king,[END]
it,was,a,lie,[END]
why,ask,for,truth,ser,barristan,said,softly,if,you,close,your,ears,to,it,[END]
he,hesitated,then,continued,[END]
i,told,you,before,that,i,used,a,false,name,so,the,lannisters,would,not,know,that,i'd,joined,you,[END]
that,was,less,than,half,of,it,your,grace,[END]
the,truth,is,i,wanted,to,watch,you,for,a,time,before,pledging,you,my,sword,[END]
to,make,certain,that,you,were,not,[END]
my,father's,daughter,[END]
if,she,was,not,her,father's,daughter,who,was,she,[END]

i,am,no,maester,to,quote,history,at,you,your,grace,[END]
swords,have,been,my,life,not,books,[END]
but,every,child,knows,that,the,targaryens,have,always,danced,too,close,to,madness,[END]
your,father,was,not,the,first,[END]
king,jaehaerys,once,told,me,that,madness,and,greatness,are,two,sides,of,the,same,coin,[END]
every,time,a,new,targaryen,is,born,he,said,the,gods,toss,the,coin,in,the,air,and,the,world,holds,its,breath,to,see,how,it,will,land,[END]
jaehaerys,[END]
this,old,man,knew,my,grandfather,[END]
the,thought,gave,her,pause,[END]
most,of,what,she,knew,of,westeros,had,come,from,her,brother,and,the,rest,from,ser,jorah,[END]
ser,barristan,would,have,forgotten,more,than,the,two,of,them,had,ever,known,[END]
this,man,can,tell,me,what,i,came,from,[END]
so,i,am,a,coin,in,the,hands,of,some,god,is,that,what,you,are,saying,ser,[END]
no,ser,barristan,replied,[END]
you,are,the,trueborn,heir,of,westeros,[END]

only,from,the,hand,of,my,queen,will,i,accept,a,sword,again,[END]
as,you,wish,[END]
dany,took,the,sword,from,brown,ben,and,offered,it,hilt,first,[END]

you,are,kind,to,see,me,off,[END]
jaime,studied,her,closely,[END]
you,know,me,then,[END]
she,bit,her,lip,[END]
you,may,not,recall,my,lord,as,i,was,littler,then,[END]
but,i,had,the,honor,to,meet,you,at,winterfell,when,king,robert,came,to,visit,my,father,lord,eddard,[END]
she,lowered,her,big,brown,eyes,and,mumbled,i'm,arya,stark,[END]

i,understand,you're,to,be,married,[END]
i,am,to,wed,lord,bolton's,son,ramsay,[END]
he,used,to,be,a,snow,but,his,grace,has,made,him,a,bolton,[END]

aye,and,we've,shared,it,out,[END]
you,have,my,thanks,[END]
the,northman,grinned,[END]
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts,[END]
always,said,jaime,with,a,last,glance,at,the,girl,[END]
he,wondered,if,there,was,much,resemblance,[END]
not,that,it,mattered,[END]
the,real,arya,stark,was,buried,in,some,unmarked,grave,in,flea,bottom,in,all,likelihood,[END]
with,her,brothers,dead,and,both,parents,who,would,dare,name,this,one,a,fraud,[END]
good,speed,he,told,steelshanks,[END]
nage,raised,his,peace,banner,and,the,northmen,formed,a,column,as,ragged,as,their,fur,cloaks,and,trotted,out,the,castle,gate,[END]
the,thin,girl,on,the,grey,mare,looked,small,and,forlorn,in,their,midst,[END]
a,few,of,the,horses,still,shied,away,from,the,dark,splotch,on,the,hard-packed,ground,where,the,earth,had,drunk,the,life's,blood,of,the,stableboy,gregor,clegane,had,killed,so,clumsily,[END]
the,sight,of,it,made,jaime,angry,all,over,again,[END]
he,had,told,his,kingsguard,to,keep,the,crowd,out,of,the,way,but,that,oaf,ser,boros,had,let,himself,be,distracted,by,the,duel,[END]
the,fool,boy,himself,shared,some,of,the,blame,to,be,sure,the,dead,dornishman,as,well,[END]
and,clegane,most,of,all,[END]
the,blow,that,took,the,boy's,arm,off,had,been,mischance,but,that,second,cut,[END]
well,gregor,is,paying,for,it,now,[END]
grand,maester,pycelle,was,tending,to,the,man's,wounds,but,the,howls,heard,ringing,from,the,maester's,chambers,suggested,that,the,healing,was,not,going,as,well,as,it,might,[END]
the,flesh,mortifies,and,the,wounds,ooze,pus,pycelle,told,the,council,[END]
even,maggots,will,not,touch,such,foulness,[END]
his,convulsions,are,so,violent,that,i,have,had,to,gag,him,to,prevent,him,from,biting,off,his,tongue,[END]
i,have,cut,away,as,much,tissue,as,i,dare,and,treated,the,rot,with,boiling,wine,and,bread,mold,to,no,avail,[END]
the,veins,in,his,arm,are,turning,black,[END]
when,i,leeched,him,all,the,leeches,died,[END]
my,lords,i,must,know,what,malignant,substance,prince,oberyn,used,on,his,spear,[END]
let,us,detain,these,other,dornishmen,until,they,are,more,forthcoming,[END]
lord,tywin,had,refused,him,[END]
there,will,be,trouble,enough,with,sunspear,over,prince,oberyn's,death,[END]
i,do,not,mean,to,make,matters,worse,by,holding,his,companions,captive,[END]
then,i,fear,ser,gregor,may,die,[END]
undoubtedly,[END]
i,swore,as,much,in,the,letter,i,sent,to,prince,doran,with,his,brother's,body,[END]
but,it,must,be,seen,to,be,the,sword,of,the,king's,justice,that,slays,him,not,a,poisoned,spear,[END]
heal,him,[END]
grand,maester,pycelle,blinked,in,dismay,[END]
my,lord,[END]
heal,him,lord,tywin,said,again,vexed,[END]
you,are,aware,that,lord,varys,has,sent,fishermen,into,the,waters,around,dragonstone,[END]
they,report,that,only,a,token,force,remains,to,defend,the,island,[END]
the,lyseni,are,gone,from,the,bay,and,the,great,part,of,lord,stannis's,strength,with,them,[END]
well,and,good,announced,pycelle,[END]
let,stannis,rot,in,lys,i,say,[END]
we,are,well,rid,of,the,man,and,his,ambitions,[END]
did,you,turn,into,an,utter,fool,when,tyrion,shaved,your,beard,[END]
this,is,stannis,baratheon,[END]
the,man,will,fight,to,the,bitter,end,and,then,some,[END]
if,he,is,gone,it,can,only,mean,he,intends,to,resume,the,war,[END]
most,likely,he,will,land,at,storm's,end,and,try,and,rouse,the,storm,lords,[END]
if,so,he's,finished,[END]
but,a,bolder,man,might,roll,the,dice,for,dorne,[END]
if,he,should,win,sunspear,to,his,cause,he,might,prolong,this,war,for,years,[END]
so,we,will,not,offend,the,martells,any,further,for,any,reason,[END]
the,dornishmen,are,free,to,go,and,you,will,heal,ser,gregor,[END]
and,so,the,mountain,screamed,day,and,night,[END]
lord,tywin,lannister,could,cow,even,the,stranger,it,would,seem,[END]
as,jaime,climbed,the,winding,steps,of,white,sword,tower,he,could,hear,ser,boros,snoring,in,his,cell,[END]
ser,balon's,door,was,shut,as,well,he,had,the,king,tonight,and,would,sleep,all,day,[END]
aside,from,blount's,snores,the,tower,was,very,quiet,[END]
that,suited,jaime,well,enough,[END]
i,ought,to,rest,myself,[END]
last,night,after,his,dance,with,ser,addam,he'd,been,too,sore,to,sleep,[END]
but,when,he,stepped,into,his,bedchamber,he,found,his,sister,waiting,for,him,[END]
she,stood,beside,the,open,window,looking,over,the,curtain,walls,and,out,to,sea,[END]
the,bay,wind,swirled,around,her,flattening,her,gown,against,her,body,in,a,way,that,quickened,jaime's,pulse,[END]
it,was,white,that,gown,like,the,hangings,on,the,wall,and,the,draperies,on,his,bed,[END]
swirls,of,tiny,emeralds,brightened,the,ends,of,her,wide,sleeves,and,spiraled,down,her,bodice,[END]
larger,emeralds,were,set,in,the,golden,spiderweb,that,bound,her,golden,hair,[END]
the,gown,was,cut,low,to,bare,her,shoulders,and,the,tops,of,her,breasts,[END]
she,is,so,beautiful,[END]
he,wanted,nothing,more,than,to,take,her,in,his,arms,[END]
cersei,[END]
he,closed,the,door,softly,[END]
why,are,you,here,[END]
where,else,could,i,go,[END]
when,she,turned,to,him,there,were,tears,in,her,eyes,[END]
father's,made,it,clear,that,i,am,no,longer,wanted,on,the,council,[END]
jaime,won't,you,talk,to,him,[END]
jaime,took,off,his,cloak,and,hung,it,from,a,peg,on,the,wall,[END]
i,talk,to,lord,tywin,every,day,[END]
must,you,be,so,stubborn,[END]
all,he,wants,[END]
is,to,force,me,from,the,kingsguard,and,send,me,back,to,casterly,rock,[END]
that,need,not,be,so,terrible,[END]
he,is,sending,me,back,to,casterly,rock,as,well,[END]
he,wants,me,far,away,so,he'll,have,a,free,hand,with,tommen,[END]
tommen,is,my,son,not,his,[END]
tommen,is,the,king,[END]
he,is,a,boy,[END]
a,frightened,little,boy,who,saw,his,brother,murdered,at,his,own,wedding,[END]
and,now,they,are,telling,him,that,he,must,marry,[END]
the,girl,is,twice,his,age,and,twice,a,widow,[END]
he,eased,himself,into,a,chair,trying,to,ignore,the,ache,of,bruised,muscles,[END]
the,tyrells,are,insisting,[END]
i,see,no,harm,in,it,[END]
tommen's,been,lonely,since,myrcella,went,to,dorne,[END]
he,likes,having,margaery,and,her,ladies,about,[END]
let,them,wed,[END]
he,is,your,son,[END]
he,is,my,seed,[END]
he's,never,called,me,father,[END]
no,more,than,joffrey,ever,did,[END]
you,warned,me,a,thousand,times,never,to,show,any,undue,interest,in,them,[END]
to,keep,them,safe,[END]
you,as,well,[END]
how,would,it,have,looked,if,my,brother,had,played,the,father,to,the,king's,children,[END]
even,robert,might,have,grown,suspicious,[END]
well,he's,beyond,suspicion,now,[END]
robert's,death,still,left,a,bitter,taste,in,jaime's,mouth,[END]
it,should,have,been,me,who,killed,him,not,cersei,[END]
i,only,wished,he'd,died,at,my,hands,[END]
when,i,still,had,two,of,them,[END]
if,i'd,let,kingslaying,become,a,habit,as,he,liked,to,say,i,could,have,taken,you,as,my,wife,for,all,the,world,to,see,[END]
i'm,not,ashamed,of,loving,you,only,of,the,things,i've,done,to,hide,it,[END]
that,boy,at,winterfell,[END]
did,i,tell,you,to,throw,him,out,the,window,[END]
if,you'd,gone,hunting,as,i,begged,you,nothing,would,have,happened,[END]
but,no,you,had,to,have,me,you,could,not,wait,until,we,returned,to,the,city,[END]
i'd,waited,long,enough,[END]
i,hated,watching,robert,stumble,to,your,bed,every,night,always,wondering,if,maybe,this,night,he'd,decide,to,claim,his,rights,as,husband,[END]
jaime,suddenly,remembered,something,else,that,troubled,him,about,winterfell,[END]
at,riverrun,catelyn,stark,seemed,convinced,i'd,sent,some,footpad,to,slit,her,son's,throat,[END]
that,i'd,given,him,a,dagger,[END]
that,she,said,scornfully,[END]
tyrion,asked,me,about,that,[END]
there,was,a,dagger,[END]
the,scars,on,lady,catelyn's,hands,were,real,enough,she,showed,them,to,me,[END]
did,you,[END]
oh,don't,be,absurd,[END]
cersei,closed,the,window,[END]
yes,i,hoped,the,boy,would,die,[END]
so,did,you,[END]
even,robert,thought,that,would,have,been,for,the,best,[END]
we,kill,our,horses,when,they,break,a,leg,and,our,dogs,when,they,go,blind,but,we,are,too,weak,to,give,the,same,mercy,to,crippled,children,',he,told,me,[END]
he,was,blind,himself,at,the,time,from,drink,[END]
robert,[END]
jaime,had,guarded,the,king,long,enough,to,know,that,robert,baratheon,said,things,in,his,cups,that,he,would,have,denied,angrily,the,next,day,[END]
were,you,alone,when,robert,said,this,[END]
you,don't,think,he,said,it,to,ned,stark,i,hope,[END]
of,course,we,were,alone,[END]
us,and,the,children,[END]
cersei,removed,her,hairnet,and,draped,it,over,a,bedpost,then,shook,out,her,golden,curls,[END]
perhaps,myrcella,sent,this,man,with,the,dagger,do,you,think,so,[END]
it,was,meant,as,mockery,but,she'd,cut,right,to,the,heart,of,it,jaime,saw,at,once,[END]
not,myrcella,[END]
joffrey,[END]
cersei,frowned,[END]
joffrey,had,no,love,for,robb,stark,but,the,younger,boy,was,nothing,to,him,[END]
he,was,only,a,child,himself,[END]
a,child,hungry,for,a,pat,on,the,head,from,that,sot,you,let,him,believe,was,his,father,[END]
he,had,an,uncomfortable,thought,[END]
tyrion,almost,died,because,of,this,bloody,dagger,[END]
if,he,knew,the,whole,thing,was,joffrey's,work,that,might,be,why,[END]
i,don't,care,why,cersei,said,[END]
he,can,take,his,reasons,down,to,hell,with,him,[END]
if,you,had,seen,how,joff,died,[END]
he,fought,jaime,he,fought,for,every,breath,but,it,was,as,if,some,malign,spirit,had,its,hands,about,his,throat,[END]
he,had,such,terror,in,his,eyes,[END]
when,he,was,little,he'd,run,to,me,when,he,was,scared,or,hurt,and,i,would,protect,him,[END]
but,that,night,there,was,nothing,i,could,do,[END]
tyrion,murdered,him,in,front,of,me,and,there,was,nothing,i,could,do,[END]
cersei,sank,to,her,knees,before,his,chair,and,took,jaime's,good,hand,between,both,of,hers,[END]
joff,is,dead,and,myrcella's,in,dorne,[END]
tommen's,all,i,have,left,[END]
you,mustn't,let,father,take,him,from,me,[END]
jaime,please,[END]
lord,tywin,has,not,asked,for,my,approval,[END]
i,can,talk,to,him,but,he,will,not,listen,[END]
he,will,if,you,agree,to,leave,the,kingsguard,[END]
i'm,not,leaving,the,kingsguard,[END]
his,sister,fought,back,tears,[END]
jaime,you're,my,shining,knight,[END]
you,cannot,abandon,me,when,i,need,you,most,[END]
he,is,stealing,my,son,sending,me,away,[END]
and,unless,you,stop,him,father,is,going,to,force,me,to,wed,again,[END]
jaime,should,not,have,been,surprised,but,he,was,[END]
the,words,were,a,blow,to,his,gut,harder,than,any,that,ser,addam,marbrand,had,dealt,him,[END]
who,[END]
does,it,matter,[END]
some,lord,or,other,[END]
someone,father,thinks,he,needs,[END]
i,don't,care,[END]
i,will,not,have,another,husband,[END]
you,are,the,only,man,i,want,in,my,bed,ever,again,[END]
then,tell,him,that,[END]
she,pulled,her,hands,away,[END]
you,are,talking,madness,again,[END]
would,you,have,us,ripped,apart,as,mother,did,that,time,she,caught,us,playing,[END]
tommen,would,lose,the,throne,myrcella,her,marriage,[END]
i,want,to,be,your,wife,we,belong,to,each,other,but,it,can,never,be,jaime,[END]
we,are,brother,and,sister,[END]
the,targaryens,[END]
we,are,not,targaryens,[END]
quiet,he,said,scornfully,[END]
so,loud,you'll,wake,my,sworn,brothers,[END]
we,can't,have,that,now,can,we,[END]
people,might,learn,that,you,had,come,to,see,me,[END]
jaime,she,sobbed,don't,you,think,i,want,it,as,much,as,you,do,[END]
it,makes,no,matter,who,they,wed,me,to,i,want,you,at,my,side,i,want,you,in,my,bed,i,want,you,inside,me,[END]
nothing,has,changed,between,us,[END]
let,me,prove,it,to,you,[END]
she,pushed,up,his,tunic,and,began,to,fumble,with,the,laces,of,his,breeches,[END]
jaime,felt,himself,responding,[END]
no,he,said,not,here,[END]
they,had,never,done,it,in,white,sword,tower,much,less,in,the,lord,commander's,chambers,[END]
cersei,this,is,not,the,place,[END]
you,took,me,in,the,sept,this,is,no,different,[END]
she,drew,out,his,cock,and,bent,her,head,over,it,[END]
jaime,pushed,her,away,with,the,stump,of,his,right,hand,[END]
no,[END]
not,here,i,said,[END]
he,forced,himself,to,stand,[END]
for,an,instant,he,could,see,confusion,in,her,bright,green,eyes,and,fear,as,well,[END]
then,rage,replaced,it,[END]
cersei,gathered,herself,together,got,to,her,feet,straightened,her,skirts,[END]
was,it,your,hand,they,hacked,off,in,harrenhal,or,your,manhood,[END]
as,she,shook,her,head,her,hair,tumbled,around,her,bare,white,shoulders,[END]
i,was,a,fool,to,come,[END]
you,lacked,the,courage,to,avenge,joffrey,why,would,i,think,that,you'd,protect,tommen,[END]
tell,me,if,the,imp,had,killed,all,three,of,your,children,would,that,have,made,you,wroth,[END]
tyrion,is,not,going,to,harm,tommen,or,myrcella,[END]
i,am,still,not,certain,he,killed,joffrey,[END]
her,mouth,twisted,in,anger,[END]
how,can,you,say,that,[END]
after,all,his,threats,[END]
threats,mean,nothing,[END]
he,swears,he,did,not,do,it,[END]
oh,he,swears,is,that,it,[END]
and,dwarfs,don't,lie,is,that,what,you,think,[END]
not,to,me,[END]
no,more,than,you,would,[END]
you,great,golden,fool,[END]
he's,lied,to,you,a,thousand,times,and,so,have,i,[END]
she,bound,up,her,hair,again,and,scooped,up,the,hairnet,from,the,bedpost,where,she'd,hung,it,[END]
think,what,you,will,[END]
the,little,monster,is,in,a,black,cell,and,soon,ser,ilyn,will,have,his,head,off,[END]
perhaps,you'd,like,it,for,a,keepsake,[END]
she,glanced,at,the,pillow,[END]
he,can,watch,over,you,as,you,sleep,alone,in,that,cold,white,bed,[END]
until,his,eyes,rot,out,that,is,[END]
you,had,best,go,cersei,[END]
you're,making,me,angry,[END]
oh,an,angry,cripple,[END]
how,terrifying,[END]
she,laughed,[END]
a,pity,lord,tywin,lannister,never,had,a,son,[END]
i,could,have,been,the,heir,he,wanted,but,i,lacked,the,cock,[END]
and,speaking,of,such,best,tuck,yours,away,brother,[END]
it,looks,rather,sad,and,small,hanging,from,your,breeches,like,that,[END]
when,she,was,gone,jaime,took,her,advice,fumbling,one-handed,at,his,laces,[END]
he,felt,a,bone-deep,ache,in,his,phantom,fingers,[END]
i've,lost,a,hand,a,father,a,son,a,sister,and,a,lover,and,soon,enough,i,will,lose,a,brother,[END]

the,tickler,shrugged,straightened,and,reached,a,hand,behind,his,head,to,rub,the,back,of,his,neck,[END]
everything,seemed,to,happen,at,once,then,sandor,lurched,to,his,feet,polliver,drew,his,longsword,and,the,tickler's,hand,whipped,around,in,a,blur,to,send,something,silver,flashing,across,the,common,room,[END]
if,the,hound,had,not,been,moving,the,knife,might,have,cored,the,apple,of,his,throat,instead,it,only,grazed,his,ribs,and,wound,up,quivering,in,the,wall,near,the,door,[END]

his,sword,slid,from,its,scabbard,just,in,time,to,knock,aside,polliver's,first,cut,[END]

the,tickler,came,off,the,bench,with,a,shortsword,in,one,hand,and,a,dagger,in,the,other,[END]
even,the,chunky,brown-haired,squire,was,up,fumbling,for,his,swordhilt,[END]

her,aim,was,better,than,it,had,been,at,the,twins,[END]
the,cup,hit,him,right,on,his,big,white,pimple,and,he,went,down,hard,on,his,tail,[END]
polliver,was,a,grim,methodical,fighter,and,he,pressed,sandor,steadily,backward,his,heavy,longsword,moving,with,brutal,precision,[END]
the,hound's,own,cuts,were,sloppier,his,parries,rushed,his,feet,slow,and,clumsy,[END]
he's,drunk,arya,realized,with,dismay,[END]
he,drank,too,much,too,fast,with,no,food,in,his,belly,[END]

arya,could,taste,the,beginnings,of,panic,in,the,back,of,her,throat,[END]
fear,cuts,deeper,than,swords,[END]

sandor,gave,a,grunt,of,pain,[END]
the,burned,side,of,his,face,ran,red,from,temple,to,cheek,and,the,stub,of,his,ear,was,gone,[END]
that,seemed,to,make,him,angry,[END]
he,drove,back,polliver,with,a,furious,attack,hammering,at,him,with,the,old,nicked,longsword,he,had,swapped,for,in,the,hills,[END]
the,bearded,man,gave,way,but,none,of,the,cuts,so,much,as,touched,him,[END]

they're,killing,him,[END]
arya,had,no,more,cups,but,there,was,something,better,to,throw,[END]

it,wasn't,the,same,as,throwing,a,rock,or,a,crabapple,though,[END]
the,knife,wobbled,and,hit,him,in,the,arm,hilt,first,[END]
he,never,even,felt,it,[END]
he,was,too,intent,on,clegane,[END]

blood,ran,down,his,face,and,from,the,gash,in,his,neck,[END]
both,of,the,mountain's,men,came,after,him,hard,polliver,hacking,at,his,head,and,shoulders,while,the,tickler,darted,in,to,stab,at,back,and,belly,[END]
the,heavy,stone,flagon,was,still,on,the,table,[END]
arya,grabbed,it,with,two,hands,but,as,she,lifted,it,someone,grabbed,her,arm,[END]
the,flagon,slipped,from,her,fingers,and,crashed,to,the,floor,[END]
wrenched,around,she,found,herself,nose,to,nose,with,the,squire,[END]
you,stupid,you,forgot,all,about,him,[END]
his,big,white,pimple,had,burst,she,saw,[END]
are,you,the,puppy's,puppy,[END]
he,had,his,sword,in,his,right,hand,and,her,arm,in,his,left,but,her,own,hands,were,free,so,she,jerked,his,knife,from,its,sheath,and,sheathed,it,again,in,his,belly,twisting,[END]
he,wasn't,wearing,mail,or,even,boiled,leather,so,it,went,right,in,the,same,way,needle,had,when,she,killed,the,stableboy,at,king's,landing,[END]
the,squire's,eyes,got,big,and,he,let,go,of,her,arm,[END]
arya,spun,to,the,door,and,wrenched,the,tickler's,knife,from,the,wall,[END]
polliver,and,the,tickler,had,driven,the,hound,into,a,corner,behind,a,bench,and,one,of,them,had,given,him,an,ugly,red,gash,on,his,upper,thigh,to,go,with,his,other,wounds,[END]
sandor,was,leaning,against,the,wall,bleeding,and,breathing,noisily,[END]
he,looked,as,though,he,could,barely,stand,let,alone,fight,[END]
throw,down,the,sword,and,we'll,take,you,back,to,harrenhal,polliver,told,him,[END]
so,gregor,can,finish,me,himself,[END]
the,tickler,said,maybe,he'll,give,you,to,me,[END]
if,you,want,me,come,get,me,[END]
sandor,pushed,away,from,the,wall,and,stood,in,a,half-crouch,behind,the,bench,his,sword,held,across,his,body,[END]

his,foot,lashed,out,and,caught,the,bench,driving,it,hard,into,polliver's,shins,[END]
somehow,the,bearded,man,kept,his,feet,but,the,hound,ducked,under,his,wild,slash,and,brought,his,own,sword,up,in,a,vicious,backhand,cut,[END]
blood,spattered,on,the,ceiling,and,walls,[END]
the,blade,caught,in,the,middle,of,polliver's,face,and,when,the,hound,wrenched,it,loose,half,his,head,came,with,it,[END]
the,tickler,backed,away,[END]
arya,could,smell,his,fear,[END]
the,shortsword,in,his,hand,suddenly,seemed,almost,a,toy,against,the,long,blade,the,hound,was,holding,and,he,wasn't,armored,either,[END]

her,hands,were,red,and,sticky,when,sandor,dragged,her,off,him,[END]
enough,was,all,he,said,[END]
he,was,bleeding,like,a,butchered,pig,himself,and,dragging,one,leg,when,he,walked,[END]
there's,one,more,arya,reminded,him,[END]
the,squire,had,pulled,the,knife,out,of,his,belly,and,was,trying,to,stop,the,blood,with,his,hands,[END]

this,one,is,yours,she-wolf,[END]

she,knew,what,he,meant,[END]
arya,went,to,polliver,and,knelt,in,his,blood,long,enough,to,undo,his,swordbelt,[END]
hanging,beside,his,dagger,was,a,slimmer,blade,too,long,to,be,a,dirk,too,short,to,be,a,man's,sword,[END]

if,there's,ships,at,saltpans,we,can,reach,the,vale,by,sea,[END]
his,mouth,twitched,at,her,as,more,blood,ran,down,from,where,his,ear,had,been,[END]
maybe,lady,lysa,will,marry,you,to,her,little,robert,[END]
there's,a,match,i'd,like,to,see,[END]
he,started,to,laugh,then,groaned,instead,[END]
when,the,time,came,to,leave,he,needed,arya's,help,to,get,back,up,on,stranger,[END]
he,had,tied,a,strip,of,cloth,about,his,neck,and,another,around,his,thigh,and,taken,the,squire's,cloak,off,its,peg,by,the,door,[END]
the,cloak,was,green,with,a,green,arrow,on,a,white,bend,but,when,the,hound,wadded,it,up,and,pressed,it,to,his,ear,it,soon,turned,red,[END]
arya,was,afraid,he,would,collapse,the,moment,they,set,out,but,somehow,he,stayed,in,the,saddle,[END]
they,could,not,risk,meeting,whoever,held,the,ruby,ford,so,instead,of,following,the,kingsroad,they,angled,south,by,east,through,weedy,fields,woods,and,marshes,[END]
it,was,hours,before,they,reached,the,banks,of,the,trident,[END]
the,river,had,returned,meekly,to,its,accustomed,channel,arya,saw,all,its,wet,brown,rage,vanished,with,the,rains,[END]
it's,tired,too,she,thought,[END]
close,by,the,water's,edge,they,found,some,willows,rising,from,a,jumble,of,weathered,rocks,[END]
together,the,rocks,and,trees,formed,a,sort,of,natural,fort,where,they,could,hide,from,both,river,and,trail,[END]
here,will,do,the,hound,said,[END]
water,the,horses,and,gather,some,deadwood,for,a,fire,[END]
when,he,dismounted,he,had,to,catch,himself,on,a,tree,limb,to,keep,from,falling,[END]

anyone,wants,to,find,us,all,they,need,to,do,is,follow,my,blood,[END]
water,and,wood,[END]
but,bring,me,that,wineskin,first,[END]
when,he,got,the,fire,going,sandor,propped,up,his,helm,in,the,flames,emptied,half,the,wineskin,into,it,and,collapsed,back,against,a,jut,of,moss-covered,stone,as,if,he,never,meant,to,rise,again,[END]
he,made,arya,wash,out,the,squire's,cloak,and,cut,it,into,strips,[END]
those,went,into,his,helm,as,well,[END]
if,i,had,more,wine,i'd,drink,till,i,was,dead,to,the,world,[END]
maybe,i,ought,to,send,you,back,to,that,bloody,inn,for,another,skin,or,three,[END]
no,arya,said,[END]
he,wouldn't,would,he,[END]
if,he,does,i'll,just,leave,him,and,ride,off,[END]
sandor,laughed,at,the,fear,on,her,face,[END]
a,jest,wolf,girl,[END]
a,bloody,jest,[END]
find,me,a,stick,about,so,long,and,not,too,big,around,[END]
and,wash,the,mud,off,it,[END]
i,hate,the,taste,of,mud,[END]
he,didn't,like,the,first,two,sticks,she,brought,him,[END]
by,the,time,she,found,one,that,suited,him,the,flames,had,scorched,his,dog's,snout,black,all,the,way,to,the,eyes,[END]
inside,the,wine,was,boiling,madly,[END]
get,the,cup,from,my,bedroll,and,dip,it,half,full,he,told,her,[END]
be,careful,[END]
you,knock,the,damn,thing,over,i,will,send,you,back,for,more,[END]
take,the,wine,and,pour,it,on,my,wounds,[END]
think,you,can,do,that,[END]
arya,nodded,[END]
then,what,are,you,waiting,for,[END]
he,growled,[END]
her,knuckles,brushed,the,steel,the,first,time,she,filled,the,cup,burning,her,so,badly,she,got,blisters,[END]
arya,had,to,bite,her,lip,to,keep,from,screaming,[END]
the,hound,used,the,stick,for,the,same,purpose,clamping,it,between,his,teeth,as,she,poured,[END]
she,did,the,gash,in,his,thigh,first,then,the,shallower,cut,on,the,back,of,his,neck,[END]
sandor,coiled,his,right,hand,into,a,fist,and,beat,against,the,ground,when,she,did,his,leg,[END]
when,it,came,to,his,neck,he,bit,the,stick,so,hard,it,broke,and,she,had,to,find,him,a,new,one,[END]
she,could,see,the,terror,in,his,eyes,[END]
turn,your,head,[END]
she,trickled,the,wine,down,over,the,raw,red,flesh,where,his,ear,had,been,and,fingers,of,brown,blood,and,red,wine,crept,over,his,jaw,[END]
he,did,scream,then,despite,the,stick,[END]
then,he,passed,out,from,the,pain,[END]
arya,figured,the,rest,out,by,herself,[END]
she,fished,the,strips,they'd,made,of,the,squire's,cloak,out,of,the,bottom,of,the,helm,and,used,them,to,bind,the,cuts,[END]
when,she,came,to,his,ear,she,had,to,wrap,up,half,his,head,to,stop,the,bleeding,[END]
by,then,dusk,was,settling,over,the,trident,[END]
she,let,the,horses,graze,then,hobbled,them,for,the,night,and,made,herself,as,comfortable,as,she,could,in,a,niche,between,two,rocks,[END]
the,fire,burned,a,while,and,died,[END]
arya,watched,the,moon,through,the,branches,overhead,[END]
ser,gregor,the,mountain,she,said,softly,[END]
dunsen,raff,the,sweetling,ser,ilyn,ser,meryn,queen,cersei,[END]
it,made,her,feel,queer,to,leave,out,polliver,and,the,tickler,[END]
and,joffrey,too,[END]
she,was,glad,he,was,dead,but,she,wished,she,could,have,been,there,to,see,him,die,or,maybe,kill,him,herself,[END]
polliver,said,that,sansa,killed,him,and,the,imp,[END]
could,that,be,true,[END]
the,imp,was,a,lannister,and,sansa,[END]
i,wish,i,could,change,into,a,wolf,and,grow,wings,and,fly,away,[END]
if,sansa,was,gone,too,there,were,no,more,starks,but,her,[END]
jon,was,on,the,wall,a,thousand,leagues,away,but,he,was,a,snow,and,these,different,aunts,and,uncles,the,hound,wanted,to,sell,her,to,they,weren't,starks,either,[END]
they,weren't,wolves,[END]
sandor,moaned,and,she,rolled,onto,her,side,to,look,at,him,[END]
she,had,left,his,name,out,too,she,realized,[END]
why,had,she,done,that,[END]
she,tried,to,think,of,mycah,but,it,was,hard,to,remember,what,he'd,looked,like,[END]
she,hadn't,known,him,long,[END]
all,he,ever,did,was,play,at,swords,with,me,[END]
the,hound,she,whispered,and,valar,morghulis,[END]
maybe,he'd,be,dead,by,morning,[END]
but,when,the,pale,dawn,light,came,filtering,through,the,trees,it,was,him,who,woke,her,with,the,toe,of,his,boot,[END]
she,had,dreamed,she,was,a,wolf,again,chasing,a,riderless,horse,up,a,hill,with,a,pack,behind,her,but,his,foot,brought,her,back,just,as,they,were,closing,for,the,kill,[END]
the,hound,was,still,weak,every,movement,slow,and,clumsy,[END]
he,slumped,in,the,saddle,and,sweated,and,his,ear,began,to,bleed,through,the,bandage,[END]
he,needed,all,his,strength,just,to,keep,from,falling,off,stranger,[END]
had,the,mountain's,men,come,hunting,them,she,doubted,if,he,would,even,be,able,to,lift,a,sword,[END]
arya,glanced,over,her,shoulder,but,there,was,nothing,behind,them,but,a,crow,flitting,from,tree,to,tree,[END]
the,only,sound,was,the,river,[END]
long,before,noon,sandor,clegane,was,reeling,[END]
there,were,hours,of,daylight,still,remaining,when,he,called,a,halt,[END]
i,need,to,rest,was,all,he,said,[END]
this,time,when,he,dismounted,he,did,fall,[END]
instead,of,trying,to,get,back,up,he,crawled,weakly,under,a,tree,and,leaned,up,against,the,trunk,[END]
bloody,hell,he,cursed,[END]
bloody,hell,[END]
when,he,saw,arya,staring,at,him,he,said,i'd,skin,you,alive,for,a,cup,of,wine,girl,[END]
she,brought,him,water,instead,[END]
he,drank,a,little,of,it,complained,that,it,tasted,of,mud,and,slid,into,a,noisy,fevered,sleep,[END]
when,she,touched,him,his,skin,was,burning,up,[END]
arya,sniffed,at,his,bandages,the,way,maester,luwin,had,done,sometimes,when,treating,her,cut,or,scrape,[END]
his,face,had,bled,the,worst,but,it,was,the,wound,on,his,thigh,that,smelled,funny,to,her,[END]
she,wondered,how,far,this,saltpans,was,and,whether,she,could,find,it,by,herself,[END]
i,wouldn't,have,to,kill,him,[END]
if,i,just,rode,off,and,left,him,he'd,die,all,by,himself,[END]
he'll,die,of,fever,and,lie,there,beneath,that,tree,until,the,end,of,days,[END]
but,maybe,it,would,be,better,if,she,killed,him,herself,[END]
she,had,killed,the,squire,at,the,inn,and,he,hadn't,done,anything,except,grab,her,arm,[END]
the,hound,had,killed,mycah,[END]
mycah,and,more,[END]
i,bet,he's,killed,a,hundred,mycahs,[END]
he,probably,would,have,killed,her,too,if,not,for,the,ransom,[END]
needle,glinted,as,she,drew,it,[END]
polliver,had,kept,it,nice,and,sharp,at,least,[END]
she,turned,her,body,sideways,in,a,water,dancer's,stance,without,even,thinking,about,it,[END]
dead,leaves,crunched,beneath,her,feet,[END]
quick,as,a,snake,she,thought,[END]
smooth,as,summer,silk,[END]
his,eyes,opened,[END]
you,remember,where,the,heart,is,[END]
he,asked,in,a,hoarse,whisper,[END]
as,still,as,stone,she,stood,[END]
i,[END]
i,was,only,[END]
don't,lie,he,growled,[END]
i,hate,liars,[END]
i,hate,gutless,frauds,even,worse,[END]
go,on,do,it,[END]
when,arya,did,not,move,he,said,i,killed,your,butcher's,boy,[END]
i,cut,him,near,in,half,and,laughed,about,it,after,[END]
he,made,a,queer,sound,and,it,took,her,a,moment,to,realize,he,was,sobbing,[END]
and,the,little,bird,your,pretty,sister,i,stood,there,in,my,white,cloak,and,let,them,beat,her,[END]
i,took,the,bloody,song,she,never,gave,it,[END]
i,meant,to,take,her,too,[END]
i,should,have,[END]
i,should,have,fucked,her,bloody,and,ripped,her,heart,out,before,leaving,her,for,that,dwarf,[END]
a,spasm,of,pain,twisted,his,face,[END]
do,you,mean,to,make,me,beg,bitch,[END]
do,it,[END]
the,gift,of,mercy,[END]
avenge,your,little,michael,[END]
mycah,[END]
arya,stepped,away,from,him,[END]
you,don't,deserve,the,gift,of,mercy,[END]
the,hound,watched,her,saddle,craven,through,eyes,bright,with,fever,[END]
not,once,did,he,attempt,to,rise,and,stop,her,[END]
but,when,she,mounted,he,said,a,real,wolf,would,finish,a,wounded,animal,[END]
maybe,some,real,wolves,will,find,you,arya,thought,[END]
maybe,they'll,smell,you,when,the,sun,goes,down,[END]
then,he,would,learn,what,wolves,did,to,dogs,[END]
you,shouldn't,have,hit,me,with,an,axe,she,said,[END]
you,should,have,saved,my,mother,[END]
she,turned,her,horse,and,rode,away,from,him,and,never,looked,back,once,[END]
on,a,bright,morning,six,days,later,she,came,to,a,place,where,the,trident,began,to,widen,out,and,the,air,smelled,more,of,salt,than,trees,[END]
she,stayed,close,to,the,water,passing,fields,and,farms,and,a,little,after,midday,a,town,appeared,before,her,[END]
saltpans,she,hoped,[END]
a,small,castle,dominated,the,town,no,more,than,a,holdfast,really,a,single,tall,square,keep,with,a,bailey,and,a,curtain,wall,[END]
most,of,the,shops,and,inns,and,alehouses,around,the,harbor,had,been,plundered,or,burned,though,some,looked,still,inhabited,[END]
but,the,port,was,there,and,eastward,spread,the,bay,of,crabs,its,waters,shimmering,blue,and,green,in,the,sun,[END]
and,there,were,ships,[END]
three,thought,arya,there,are,three,[END]
two,were,only,river,galleys,shallow,draft,boats,made,to,ply,the,waters,of,the,trident,[END]
the,third,was,bigger,a,salt,sea,trader,with,two,banks,of,oars,a,gilded,prow,and,three,tall,masts,with,furled,purple,sails,[END]
her,hull,was,painted,purple,too,[END]
arya,rode,craven,down,to,the,docks,to,get,a,better,look,[END]
strangers,are,not,so,strange,in,a,port,as,they,are,in,little,villages,and,no,one,seemed,to,care,who,she,was,or,why,she,was,here,[END]
i,need,silver,[END]
the,realization,made,her,bite,her,lip,[END]
they,had,found,a,stag,and,a,dozen,coppers,on,polliver,eight,silvers,on,the,pimply,squire,she'd,killed,and,only,a,couple,of,pennies,in,the,tickler's,purse,[END]
but,the,hound,had,told,her,to,pull,off,his,boots,and,slice,open,his,blood-drenched,clothes,and,she'd,turned,up,a,stag,in,each,toe,and,three,golden,dragons,sewn,in,the,lining,of,his,jerkin,[END]
sandor,had,kept,it,all,though,[END]
that,wasn't,fair,[END]
it,was,mine,as,much,as,his,[END]
if,she,had,given,him,the,gift,of,mercy,[END]
she,hadn't,though,[END]
she,couldn't,go,back,no,more,than,she,could,beg,for,help,[END]
begging,for,help,never,gets,you,any,[END]
she,would,have,to,sell,craven,and,hope,she,brought,enough,[END]
the,stable,had,been,burnt,she,learned,from,a,boy,by,the,docks,but,the,woman,who'd,owned,it,was,still,trading,behind,the,sept,arya,found,her,easily,a,big,robust,woman,with,a,good,horsey,smell,to,her,[END]
she,liked,craven,at,first,look,asked,arya,how,she'd,come,by,her,and,grinned,at,her,answer,[END]
she's,a,well-bred,horse,that's,plain,enough,and,i,don't,doubt,she,belonged,to,a,knight,sweetling,she,said,[END]
but,the,knight,wasn't,no,dead,brother,o',yours,[END]
i,been,dealing,with,the,castle,there,many,a,year,so,i,know,what,gentleborn,folk,is,like,[END]
this,mare,is,well-bred,but,you're,not,[END]
she,poked,a,finger,at,arya's,chest,[END]
found,her,or,stole,her,never,mind,which,that's,how,it,was,[END]
only,way,a,scruffy,little,thing,like,you,comes,to,ride,a,palfrey,[END]
arya,bit,her,lip,[END]
does,that,mean,you,won't,buy,her,[END]
the,woman,chuckled,[END]
it,means,you'll,take,what,i,give,you,sweetling,[END]
else,we,go,down,to,the,castle,and,maybe,you,get,nothing,[END]
or,even,hanged,for,stealing,some,good,knight's,horse,[END]
a,half-dozen,other,saltpans,folks,were,around,going,about,their,business,so,arya,knew,she,couldn't,kill,the,woman,[END]
instead,she,had,to,bite,her,lip,and,let,herself,be,cheated,[END]
the,purse,she,got,was,pitifully,flat,and,when,she,asked,for,more,for,the,saddle,and,bridle,and,blanket,the,woman,just,laughed,at,her,[END]
she,would,never,have,cheated,the,hound,she,thought,during,the,long,walk,back,to,the,docks,[END]
the,distance,seemed,to,have,grown,by,miles,since,she'd,ridden,it,[END]
the,purple,galley,was,still,there,[END]
if,the,ship,had,sailed,while,she,was,being,robbed,that,would,have,been,too,much,to,bear,[END]
a,cask,of,mead,was,being,rolled,up,the,plank,when,she,arrived,[END]
when,she,tried,to,follow,a,sailor,up,on,deck,shouted,down,at,her,in,a,tongue,she,did,not,know,[END]
i,want,to,see,the,captain,arya,told,him,[END]
he,only,shouted,louder,[END]
but,the,commotion,drew,the,attention,of,a,stout,grey-haired,man,in,a,coat,of,purple,wool,and,he,spoke,the,common,tongue,[END]
i,am,captain,here,he,said,[END]

the,captain,spilled,out,the,silver,onto,his,palm,and,frowned,[END]
is,this,all,you,have,[END]
it,is,not,enough,arya,knew,without,being,told,[END]
she,could,see,it,on,his,face,[END]
i,wouldn't,need,a,cabin,or,anything,she,said,[END]
i,could,sleep,down,in,the,hold,or,[END]
take,her,on,as,cabin,girl,said,a,passing,oarsman,a,bolt,of,wool,over,one,shoulder,[END]

and,now,i,don't,even,have,a,horse,[END]
the,captain,was,turning,away,when,she,said,what,ship,is,this,my,lord,[END]
he,paused,long,enough,to,give,her,a,weary,smile,[END]
this,is,the,galleas,titan's,daughter,of,the,free,city,of,braavos,[END]

she,[END]
she,made,me,braver,jon,[END]

my,f-f-father,[END]
if,gilly,were,to,say,the,babe,was,m-mine,[END]

craster's,his,real,father,[END]

but,suddenly,it,had,a,different,sound,to,it,in,jon's,ears,[END]
it,sounded,[END]
real,[END]
yes,he,said,hesitantly,kings,have,legitimized,bastards,before,but,[END]
i,am,still,a,brother,of,the,night's,watch,[END]
i,knelt,before,a,heart,tree,and,swore,to,hold,no,lands,and,father,no,children,[END]
jon,[END]
melisandre,was,so,close,he,could,feel,the,warmth,of,her,breath,[END]
r'hllor,is,the,only,true,god,[END]
a,vow,sworn,to,a,tree,has,no,more,power,than,one,sworn,to,your,shoes,[END]
open,your,heart,and,let,the,light,of,the,lord,come,in,[END]
burn,these,weirwoods,and,accept,winterfell,as,a,gift,of,the,lord,of,light,[END]
when,jon,had,been,very,young,too,young,to,understand,what,it,meant,to,be,a,bastard,he,used,to,dream,that,one,day,winterfell,might,be,his,[END]
later,when,he,was,older,he,had,been,ashamed,of,those,dreams,[END]
winterfell,would,go,to,robb,and,then,his,sons,or,to,bran,or,rickon,should,robb,die,childless,[END]
and,after,them,came,sansa,and,arya,[END]
even,to,dream,otherwise,seemed,disloyal,as,if,he,were,betraying,them,in,his,heart,wishing,for,their,deaths,[END]
i,never,wanted,this,he,thought,as,he,stood,before,the,blue-eyed,king,and,the,red,woman,[END]
i,loved,robb,loved,all,of,them,[END]
i,never,wanted,any,harm,to,come,to,any,of,them,but,it,did,[END]
and,now,there's,only,me,[END]
all,he,had,to,do,was,say,the,word,and,he,would,be,jon,stark,and,nevermore,a,snow,[END]
all,he,had,to,do,was,pledge,this,king,his,fealty,and,winterfell,was,his,[END]
all,he,had,to,do,[END]
was,forswear,his,vows,again,[END]
and,this,time,it,would,not,be,a,ruse,[END]
to,claim,his,father's,castle,he,must,turn,against,his,father's,gods,[END]
king,stannis,gazed,off,north,again,his,gold,cloak,streaming,from,his,shoulders,[END]
it,may,be,that,i,am,mistaken,in,you,jon,snow,[END]
we,both,know,the,things,that,are,said,of,bastards,[END]
you,may,lack,your,father's,honor,or,your,brother's,skill,in,arms,[END]
but,you,are,the,weapon,the,lord,has,given,me,[END]
i,have,found,you,here,as,you,found,the,cache,of,dragonglass,beneath,the,fist,and,i,mean,to,make,use,of,you,[END]
even,azor,ahai,did,not,win,his,war,alone,[END]
i,killed,a,thousand,wildlings,took,another,thousand,captive,and,scattered,the,rest,but,we,both,know,they,will,return,[END]
melisandre,has,seen,that,in,her,fires,[END]
this,tormund,thunderfist,is,likely,re-forming,them,even,now,and,planning,some,new,assault,[END]
and,the,more,we,bleed,each,other,the,weaker,we,shall,all,be,when,the,real,enemy,falls,upon,us,[END]
jon,had,come,to,that,same,realization,[END]
as,you,say,your,grace,[END]
he,wondered,where,this,king,was,going,[END]
whilst,your,brothers,have,been,struggling,to,decide,who,shall,lead,them,i,have,been,speaking,with,this,mance,rayder,[END]
he,ground,his,teeth,[END]
a,stubborn,man,that,one,and,prideful,[END]
he,will,leave,me,no,choice,but,to,give,him,to,the,flames,[END]
but,we,took,other,captives,as,well,other,leaders,[END]
the,one,who,calls,himself,the,lord,of,bones,some,of,their,clan,chiefs,the,new,magnar,of,thenn,[END]
your,brothers,will,not,like,it,no,more,than,your,father's,lords,but,i,mean,to,allow,the,wildlings,through,the,wall,[END]
those,who,will,swear,me,their,fealty,pledge,to,keep,the,king's,peace,and,the,king's,laws,and,take,the,lord,of,light,as,their,god,[END]
even,the,giants,if,those,great,knees,of,theirs,can,bend,[END]
i,will,settle,them,on,the,gift,once,i,have,wrested,it,away,from,your,new,lord,commander,[END]
when,the,cold,winds,rise,we,shall,live,or,die,together,[END]
it,is,time,we,made,alliance,against,our,common,foe,[END]
he,looked,at,jon,[END]
would,you,agree,[END]
my,father,dreamed,of,resettling,the,gift,jon,admitted,[END]
he,and,my,uncle,benjen,used,to,talk,of,it,[END]
he,never,thought,of,settling,it,with,wildlings,though,[END]
but,he,never,rode,with,wildlings,either,[END]
he,did,not,fool,himself,the,free,folk,would,make,for,unruly,subjects,and,dangerous,neighbors,[END]
yet,when,he,weighed,ygritte's,red,hair,against,the,cold,blue,eyes,of,the,wights,the,choice,was,easy,[END]
i,agree,[END]
good,king,stannis,said,for,the,surest,way,to,seal,a,new,alliance,is,with,a,marriage,[END]
i,mean,to,wed,my,lord,of,winterfell,to,this,wildling,princess,[END]
perhaps,jon,had,ridden,with,the,free,folk,too,long,he,could,not,help,but,laugh,[END]
your,grace,he,said,captive,or,no,if,you,think,you,can,just,give,val,to,me,i,fear,you,have,a,deal,to,learn,about,wildling,women,[END]
whoever,weds,her,had,best,be,prepared,to,climb,in,her,tower,window,and,carry,her,off,at,swordpoint,[END]
whoever,[END]
stannis,gave,him,a,measuring,look,[END]
does,this,mean,you,will,not,wed,the,girl,[END]
i,warn,you,she,is,part,of,the,price,you,must,pay,if,you,want,your,father's,name,and,your,father's,castle,[END]
this,match,is,necessary,to,help,assure,the,loyalty,of,our,new,subjects,[END]
are,you,refusing,me,jon,snow,[END]
no,jon,said,too,quickly,[END]
it,was,winterfell,the,king,was,speaking,of,and,winterfell,was,not,to,be,lightly,refused,[END]
i,mean,[END]
this,has,all,come,very,suddenly,your,grace,[END]
might,i,beg,you,for,some,time,to,consider,[END]
as,you,wish,[END]
but,consider,quickly,[END]
i,am,not,a,patient,man,as,your,black,brothers,are,about,to,discover,[END]
stannis,put,a,thin,fleshless,hand,on,jon's,shoulder,[END]
say,nothing,of,what,we've,discussed,here,today,[END]
to,anyone,[END]
but,when,you,return,you,need,only,bend,your,knee,lay,your,sword,at,my,feet,and,pledge,yourself,to,my,service,and,you,shall,rise,again,as,jon,stark,the,lord,of,winterfell,[END]
tyrion,[END]
when,he,heard,noises,through,the,thick,wooden,door,of,his,cell,tyrion,lannister,prepared,to,die,[END]
past,time,he,thought,[END]
come,on,come,on,make,an,end,to,it,[END]
he,pushed,himself,to,his,feet,[END]
his,legs,were,asleep,from,being,folded,under,him,[END]
he,bent,down,and,rubbed,the,knives,from,them,[END]
i,will,not,go,stumbling,and,waddling,to,the,headsman's,block,[END]
he,wondered,whether,they,would,kill,him,down,here,in,the,dark,or,drag,him,through,the,city,so,ser,ilyn,payne,could,lop,his,head,off,[END]
after,his,mummer's,farce,of,a,trial,his,sweet,sister,and,loving,father,might,prefer,to,dispose,of,him,quietly,rather,than,risk,a,public,execution,[END]
i,could,tell,the,mob,a,few,choice,things,if,they,let,me,speak,[END]
but,would,they,be,that,foolish,[END]
as,the,keys,rattled,and,the,door,to,his,cell,pushed,inward,creaking,tyrion,pressed,back,against,the,dampness,of,the,wall,wishing,for,a,weapon,[END]
i,can,still,bite,and,kick,[END]
i'll,die,with,the,taste,of,blood,in,my,mouth,that's,something,[END]
he,wished,he'd,been,able,to,think,of,some,rousing,last,words,[END]
bugger,you,all,was,not,like,to,earn,him,much,of,a,place,in,the,histories,[END]
torchlight,fell,across,his,face,[END]
he,shielded,his,eyes,with,a,hand,[END]
come,on,are,you,frightened,of,a,dwarf,[END]
do,it,you,son,of,a,poxy,whore,[END]
his,voice,had,grown,hoarse,from,disuse,[END]
is,that,any,way,to,speak,about,our,lady,mother,[END]
the,man,moved,forward,a,torch,in,his,left,hand,[END]
this,is,even,more,ghastly,than,my,cell,at,riverrun,though,not,quite,so,dank,[END]
for,a,moment,tyrion,could,not,breathe,[END]
you,[END]
well,most,of,me,[END]
jaime,was,gaunt,his,hair,hacked,short,[END]
i,left,a,hand,at,harrenhal,[END]
bringing,the,brave,companions,across,the,narrow,sea,was,not,one,of,father's,better,notions,[END]
he,lifted,his,arm,and,tyrion,saw,the,stump,[END]
a,bark,of,hysterical,laughter,burst,from,his,lips,[END]
oh,gods,he,said,[END]
jaime,i,am,so,sorry,but,[END]
gods,be,good,look,at,the,two,of,us,[END]
handless,and,noseless,the,lannister,boys,[END]
there,were,days,when,my,hand,smelled,so,bad,i,wished,i,was,noseless,[END]
jaime,lowered,the,torch,so,the,light,bathed,his,brother's,face,[END]
an,impressive,scar,[END]
tyrion,turned,away,from,the,glare,[END]
they,made,me,fight,a,battle,without,my,big,brother,to,protect,me,[END]
i,heard,tell,you,almost,burned,the,city,down,[END]
a,filthy,lie,[END]
i,only,burned,the,river,[END]
abruptly,tyrion,remembered,where,he,was,and,why,[END]
are,you,here,to,kill,me,[END]
now,that's,ungrateful,[END]
perhaps,i,should,leave,you,here,to,rot,if,you're,going,to,be,so,discourteous,[END]
rotting,is,not,the,fate,cersei,has,in,mind,for,me,[END]
well,no,if,truth,be,told,[END]
you're,to,be,beheaded,on,the,morrow,out,on,the,old,tourney,grounds,[END]
tyrion,laughed,again,[END]
will,there,be,food,[END]
you'll,have,to,help,me,with,my,last,words,my,wits,have,been,running,about,like,a,rat,in,a,root,cellar,[END]
you,won't,need,last,words,[END]
i'm,rescuing,you,[END]
jaime's,voice,was,strangely,solemn,[END]
who,said,i,required,rescue,[END]
you,know,i'd,almost,forgotten,what,an,annoying,little,man,you,are,[END]
now,that,you've,reminded,me,i,do,believe,i'll,let,cersei,cut,your,head,off,after,all,[END]
oh,no,you,won't,[END]
he,waddled,out,of,the,cell,[END]
is,it,day,or,night,up,above,[END]
i've,lost,all,sense,of,time,[END]
three,hours,past,midnight,[END]
the,city,sleeps,[END]
jaime,slid,the,torch,back,into,its,sconce,on,the,wall,between,the,cells,[END]
the,corridor,was,so,poorly,lit,that,tyrion,almost,stumbled,on,the,turnkey,sprawled,across,the,cold,stone,floor,[END]
he,prodded,him,with,a,toe,[END]
is,he,dead,[END]
asleep,[END]
the,other,three,as,well,[END]
the,eunuch,dosed,their,wine,with,sweetsleep,but,not,enough,to,kill,them,[END]
or,so,he,swears,[END]
he,is,waiting,back,at,the,stair,dressed,up,in,a,septon's,robe,[END]
you're,going,down,into,the,sewers,and,from,there,to,the,river,[END]
a,galley,is,waiting,in,the,bay,[END]
varys,has,agents,in,the,free,cities,who,will,see,that,you,do,not,lack,for,funds,[END]
but,try,not,to,be,conspicuous,[END]
cersei,will,send,men,after,you,i,have,no,doubt,[END]
you,might,do,well,to,take,another,name,[END]
another,name,[END]
oh,certainly,[END]
and,when,the,faceless,men,come,to,kill,me,i'll,say,no,you,have,the,wrong,man,i'm,a,different,dwarf,with,a,hideous,facial,scar,',[END]
both,lannisters,laughed,at,the,absurdity,of,it,all,[END]
then,jaime,went,to,one,knee,and,kissed,him,quickly,once,on,each,cheek,his,lips,brushing,against,the,puckered,ribbon,of,scar,tissue,[END]
thank,you,brother,tyrion,said,[END]
for,my,life,[END]
it,was,[END]
a,debt,i,owed,you,[END]
jaime's,voice,was,strange,[END]
a,debt,[END]
he,cocked,his,head,[END]
i,do,not,understand,[END]
good,[END]
some,doors,are,best,left,closed,[END]
oh,dear,said,tyrion,[END]

could,it,be,that,someone,said,something,cruel,about,me,once,[END]
i'll,try,not,to,weep,[END]
tell,me,[END]
tyrion,[END]
jaime,is,afraid,[END]
tell,me,tyrion,said,again,[END]
his,brother,looked,away,[END]
tysha,he,said,softly,[END]
tysha,[END]
his,stomach,tightened,[END]
what,of,her,[END]
she,was,no,whore,[END]
i,never,bought,her,for,you,[END]
that,was,a,lie,that,father,commanded,me,to,tell,[END]
tysha,was,[END]
she,was,what,she,seemed,to,be,[END]
a,crofter's,daughter,chance,met,on,the,road,[END]
tyrion,could,hear,the,faint,sound,of,his,own,breath,whistling,hollowly,through,the,scar,of,his,nose,[END]
jaime,could,not,meet,his,eyes,[END]
tysha,[END]
he,tried,to,remember,what,she,had,looked,like,[END]
a,girl,she,was,only,a,girl,no,older,than,sansa,[END]
my,wife,he,croaked,[END]
she,wed,me,[END]
for,your,gold,father,said,[END]
she,was,lowborn,you,were,a,lannister,of,casterly,rock,[END]
all,she,wanted,was,the,gold,which,made,her,no,different,from,a,whore,so,[END]
so,it,would,not,be,a,lie,not,truly,and,[END]
he,said,that,you,required,a,sharp,lesson,[END]
that,you,would,learn,from,it,and,thank,me,later,[END]
thank,you,[END]
tyrion's,voice,was,choked,[END]
he,gave,her,to,his,guards,[END]
a,barracks,full,of,guards,[END]
he,made,me,[END]
watch,[END]
aye,and,more,than,watch,[END]
i,took,her,too,[END]
my,wife,[END]
i,never,knew,he,would,do,that,[END]
you,must,believe,me,[END]
oh,must,i,[END]
tyrion,snarled,[END]
why,should,i,believe,you,about,anything,ever,[END]
she,was,my,wife,[END]
tyrion,[END]
he,hit,him,[END]
it,was,a,slap,backhanded,but,he,put,all,his,strength,into,it,all,his,fear,all,his,rage,all,his,pain,[END]
jaime,was,squatting,unbalanced,[END]
the,blow,sent,him,tumbling,backward,to,the,floor,[END]
i,[END]
i,suppose,i,earned,that,[END]
oh,you've,earned,more,than,that,jaime,[END]
you,and,my,sweet,sister,and,our,loving,father,yes,i,can't,begin,to,tell,you,what,you've,earned,[END]
but,you'll,have,it,that,i,swear,to,you,[END]
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts,[END]
tyrion,waddled,away,almost,stumbling,over,the,turnkey,again,in,his,haste,[END]
before,he,had,gone,a,dozen,yards,he,bumped,up,against,an,iron,gate,that,closed,the,passage,[END]
oh,gods,[END]
it,was,all,he,could,do,not,to,scream,[END]
jaime,came,up,behind,him,[END]
i,have,the,gaoler's,keys,[END]
then,use,them,[END]
tyrion,stepped,aside,[END]
jaime,unlocked,the,gate,pushed,it,open,and,stepped,through,[END]
he,looked,back,over,his,shoulder,[END]
are,you,coming,[END]
not,with,you,[END]
tyrion,stepped,through,[END]
give,me,the,keys,and,go,[END]
i,will,find,varys,on,my,own,[END]
he,cocked,his,head,and,stared,up,at,his,brother,with,his,mismatched,eyes,[END]
jaime,can,you,fight,left-handed,[END]
rather,less,well,than,you,jaime,said,bitterly,[END]
good,[END]
then,we,will,be,well,matched,if,we,should,ever,meet,again,[END]
the,cripple,and,the,dwarf,[END]
jaime,handed,him,the,ring,of,keys,[END]
i,gave,you,the,truth,[END]
you,owe,me,the,same,[END]
did,you,do,it,[END]
did,you,kill,him,[END]
the,question,was,another,knife,twisting,in,his,guts,[END]
are,you,sure,you,want,to,know,[END]
asked,tyrion,[END]
joffrey,would,have,been,a,worse,king,than,aerys,ever,was,[END]

joff,would,have,killed,me,as,well,once,he,came,into,his,power,[END]
for,the,crime,of,being,short,and,ugly,of,which,i,am,so,conspicuously,guilty,[END]
you,have,not,answered,my,question,[END]
you,poor,stupid,blind,crippled,fool,[END]

very,well,[END]
cersei,is,a,lying,whore,she's,been,fucking,lancel,and,osmund,kettleblack,and,probably,moon,boy,for,all,i,know,[END]
and,i,am,the,monster,they,all,say,i,am,[END]
yes,i,killed,your,vile,son,[END]
he,made,himself,grin,[END]
it,must,have,been,a,hideous,sight,to,see,there,in,the,torchlit,gloom,[END]
jaime,turned,without,a,word,and,walked,away,[END]
tyrion,watched,him,go,striding,on,his,long,strong,legs,and,part,of,him,wanted,to,call,out,to,tell,him,that,it,wasn't,true,to,beg,for,his,forgiveness,[END]
but,then,he,thought,of,tysha,and,he,held,his,silence,[END]
he,listened,to,the,receding,footsteps,until,he,could,hear,them,no,longer,then,waddled,off,to,look,for,varys,[END]
the,eunuch,was,lurking,in,the,dark,of,a,twisting,turnpike,stair,garbed,in,a,moth-eaten,brown,robe,with,a,hood,that,hid,the,paleness,of,his,face,[END]
you,were,so,long,i,feared,that,something,had,gone,amiss,he,said,when,he,saw,tyrion,[END]
oh,no,tyrion,assured,him,in,poisonous,tones,[END]
what,could,possibly,have,gone,amiss,[END]
he,twisted,his,head,back,to,stare,up,[END]
i,sent,for,you,during,my,trial,[END]
i,could,not,come,[END]
the,queen,had,me,watched,night,and,day,[END]

ah,[END]
varys,giggled,[END]
it,seemed,strangely,out,of,place,in,this,place,of,cold,stone,and,echoing,darkness,[END]
your,brother,can,be,most,persuasive,[END]
varys,you,are,as,cold,and,slimy,as,a,slug,has,anyone,ever,told,you,[END]
you,did,your,best,to,kill,me,[END]
perhaps,i,ought,to,return,the,favor,[END]
the,eunuch,sighed,[END]
the,faithful,dog,is,kicked,and,no,matter,how,the,spider,weaves,he,is,never,loved,[END]
but,if,you,slay,me,here,i,fear,for,you,my,lord,[END]
you,may,never,find,your,way,back,to,daylight,[END]
his,eyes,glittered,in,the,shifting,torchlight,dark,and,wet,[END]
these,tunnels,are,full,of,traps,for,the,unwary,[END]
tyrion,snorted,[END]
unwary,[END]
i'm,the,wariest,man,who,ever,lived,you,helped,see,to,that,[END]
he,rubbed,at,his,nose,[END]
so,tell,me,wizard,where,is,my,innocent,maiden,wife,[END]

after,that,nothing,[END]
there,was,much,confusion,that,night,[END]
my,little,birds,are,silent,[END]
varys,gave,a,gentle,tug,at,the,dwarf's,sleeve,and,pulled,him,into,the,stair,[END]
my,lord,we,must,away,[END]
your,path,is,down,[END]
that's,no,lie,at,least,[END]
tyrion,waddled,along,in,the,eunuch's,wake,his,heels,scraping,against,the,rough,stone,as,they,descended,[END]
it,was,very,cold,within,the,stairwell,a,damp,bone-chilling,cold,that,set,him,to,shivering,at,once,[END]
what,part,of,the,dungeons,are,these,[END]
he,asked,[END]
maegor,the,cruel,decreed,four,levels,of,dungeons,for,his,castle,varys,replied,[END]
on,the,upper,level,there,are,large,cells,where,common,criminals,may,be,confined,together,[END]

on,the,third,level,the,cells,are,smaller,and,the,doors,are,wood,[END]
the,black,cells,men,call,them,[END]
that,was,where,you,were,kept,and,eddard,stark,before,you,[END]

maegor,had,the,cells,on,the,fourth,level,built,for,torment,[END]
they,had,reached,the,bottom,of,the,steps,[END]

there,are,things,you,would,not,wish,to,see,[END]
tyrion,hung,back,a,moment,[END]
varys,had,already,betrayed,him,once,[END]
who,knew,what,game,the,eunuch,was,playing,[END]
and,what,better,place,to,murder,a,man,than,down,in,the,darkness,in,a,place,that,no,one,knew,existed,[END]
his,body,might,never,be,found,[END]
on,the,other,hand,what,choice,did,he,have,[END]
to,go,back,up,the,steps,and,walk,out,the,main,gate,[END]
no,that,would,not,serve,[END]
jaime,would,not,be,afraid,he,thought,before,he,remembered,what,jaime,had,done,to,him,[END]
he,took,the,eunuch,by,the,hand,and,let,himself,be,led,through,the,black,following,the,soft,scrape,of,leather,on,stone,[END]
varys,walked,quickly,from,time,to,time,whispering,careful,there,are,three,steps,ahead,or,the,tunnel,slopes,downward,here,my,lord,[END]
i,arrived,here,a,king's,hand,riding,through,the,gates,at,the,head,of,my,own,sworn,men,tyrion,reflected,and,i,leave,like,a,rat,scuttling,through,the,dark,holding,hands,with,a,spider,[END]
a,light,appeared,ahead,of,them,too,dim,to,be,daylight,and,grew,as,they,hurried,toward,it,[END]
after,a,while,he,could,see,it,was,an,arched,doorway,closed,off,by,another,iron,gate,[END]
varys,produced,a,key,[END]
they,stepped,through,into,a,small,round,chamber,[END]
five,other,doors,opened,off,the,room,each,barred,in,iron,[END]
there,was,an,opening,in,the,ceiling,as,well,and,a,series,of,rungs,set,in,the,wall,below,leading,upward,[END]
an,ornate,brazier,stood,to,one,side,fashioned,in,the,shape,of,a,dragon's,head,[END]
the,coals,in,the,beast's,yawning,mouth,had,burnt,down,to,embers,but,they,still,glowed,with,a,sullen,orange,light,[END]
dim,as,it,was,the,light,was,welcome,after,the,blackness,of,the,tunnel,[END]
the,juncture,was,otherwise,empty,but,on,the,floor,was,a,mosaic,of,a,three-headed,dragon,wrought,in,red,and,black,tiles,[END]
something,niggled,at,tyrion,for,a,moment,[END]
then,it,came,to,him,[END]
this,is,the,place,shae,told,me,of,when,varys,first,led,her,to,my,bed,[END]
we,are,below,the,tower,of,the,hand,[END]
yes,[END]
frozen,hinges,screamed,in,protest,as,varys,pulled,open,a,long-closed,door,[END]
flakes,of,rust,drifted,to,the,floor,[END]
this,will,take,us,out,to,the,river,[END]
tyrion,walked,slowly,to,the,ladder,ran,his,hand,across,the,lowest,rung,[END]
this,will,take,me,up,to,my,bedchamber,[END]
your,lord,father's,bedchamber,now,[END]
he,looked,up,the,shaft,[END]
how,far,must,i,climb,[END]
my,lord,you,are,too,weak,for,such,follies,and,there,is,besides,no,time,[END]
we,must,go,[END]
i,have,business,above,[END]

two,hundred,and,thirty,rungs,but,whatever,you,intend,[END]
two,hundred,and,thirty,rungs,and,then,[END]
the,tunnel,to,the,left,but,hear,me,[END]
how,far,along,to,the,bedchamber,[END]
tyrion,lifted,a,foot,to,the,lowest,rung,of,the,ladder,[END]
no,more,than,sixty,feet,[END]
keep,one,hand,on,the,wall,as,you,go,[END]
you,will,feel,the,doors,[END]
the,bedchamber,is,the,third,[END]

this,is,folly,my,lord,[END]
your,brother,has,given,you,your,life,back,[END]

varys,the,only,thing,i,value,less,than,my,life,just,now,is,yours,[END]
wait,for,me,here,[END]
he,turned,his,back,on,the,eunuch,and,began,to,climb,counting,silently,as,he,went,[END]
rung,by,rung,he,ascended,into,darkness,[END]
at,first,he,could,see,the,dim,outline,of,each,rung,as,he,grasped,it,and,the,rough,grey,texture,of,the,stone,behind,but,as,he,climbed,the,black,grew,thicker,[END]
thirteen,fourteen,fifteen,sixteen,[END]
by,thirty,his,arms,trembled,with,the,strain,of,pulling,[END]
he,paused,a,moment,to,catch,his,breath,and,glanced,down,[END]
a,circle,of,faint,light,shone,far,below,half,obscured,by,his,own,feet,[END]
tyrion,resumed,his,ascent,[END]
thirty-nine,forty,forty-one,[END]
by,fifty,his,legs,burned,[END]
the,ladder,was,endless,numbing,[END]
sixty-eight,sixty-nine,seventy,[END]
by,eighty,his,back,was,a,dull,agony,[END]
yet,still,he,climbed,[END]
he,could,not,have,said,why,[END]
one,thirteen,one,fourteen,one,fifteen,[END]
at,two,hundred,and,thirty,the,shaft,was,black,as,pitch,but,he,could,feel,the,warm,air,flowing,from,the,tunnel,to,his,left,like,the,breath,of,some,great,beast,[END]
he,poked,about,awkwardly,with,a,foot,and,edged,off,the,ladder,[END]
the,tunnel,was,even,more,cramped,than,the,shaft,[END]
any,man,of,normal,size,would,have,had,to,crawl,on,hands,and,knees,but,tyrion,was,short,enough,to,walk,upright,[END]
at,last,a,place,made,for,dwarfs,[END]
his,boots,scuffed,softly,against,the,stone,[END]
he,walked,slowly,counting,steps,feeling,for,gaps,in,the,walls,[END]
soon,he,began,to,hear,voices,muffled,and,indistinct,at,first,then,clearer,[END]
he,listened,more,closely,[END]
two,of,his,father's,guardsmen,were,joking,about,the,imp's,whore,saying,how,sweet,it,would,be,to,fuck,her,and,how,bad,she,must,want,a,real,cock,in,place,of,the,dwarf's,stunted,little,thing,[END]
most,like,it's,got,a,crook,in,it,said,lum,[END]
that,led,him,into,a,discussion,of,how,tyrion,would,die,on,the,morrow,[END]
he'll,weep,like,a,woman,and,beg,for,mercy,you'll,see,lum,insisted,[END]
lester,figured,he'd,face,the,axe,brave,as,a,lion,being,a,lannister,and,he,was,willing,to,bet,his,new,boots,on,it,[END]
ah,shit,in,your,boots,said,lum,you,know,they'd,never,fit,these,feet,o'mine,[END]
tell,you,what,if,i,win,you,can,scour,my,bloody,mail,for,a,fortnight,[END]
for,the,space,of,a,few,feet,tyrion,could,hear,every,word,of,their,haggling,but,when,he,moved,on,the,voices,faded,quickly,[END]
small,wonder,varys,did,not,want,me,to,climb,the,bloody,ladder,tyrion,thought,smiling,in,the,dark,[END]
little,birds,indeed,[END]
he,came,to,the,third,door,and,fumbled,about,for,a,long,time,before,his,fingers,brushed,a,small,iron,hook,set,between,two,stones,[END]
when,he,pulled,down,on,it,there,was,a,soft,rumble,that,sounded,loud,as,an,avalanche,in,the,stillness,and,a,square,of,dull,orange,light,opened,a,foot,to,his,left,[END]
the,hearth,[END]
he,almost,laughed,[END]
the,fireplace,was,full,of,hot,ash,and,a,black,log,with,a,hot,orange,heart,burning,within,[END]
he,edged,past,gingerly,taking,quick,steps,so,as,not,to,burn,his,boots,the,warm,cinders,crunching,softly,under,his,heels,[END]
when,he,found,himself,in,what,had,once,been,his,bedchamber,he,stood,a,long,moment,breathing,the,silence,[END]
had,his,father,heard,[END]
would,he,reach,for,his,sword,raise,the,hue,and,cry,[END]
m'lord,[END]
a,woman's,voice,called,[END]
that,might,have,hurt,me,once,when,i,still,felt,pain,[END]
the,first,step,was,the,hardest,[END]
when,he,reached,the,bed,tyrion,pulled,the,draperies,aside,and,there,she,was,turning,toward,him,with,a,sleepy,smile,on,her,lips,[END]
it,died,when,she,saw,him,[END]
she,pulled,the,blankets,up,to,her,chin,as,if,that,would,protect,her,[END]
were,you,expecting,someone,taller,sweetling,[END]
big,wet,tears,filled,her,eyes,[END]
i,never,meant,those,things,i,said,the,queen,made,me,[END]
please,[END]
your,father,frightens,me,so,[END]
she,sat,up,letting,the,blanket,slide,down,to,her,lap,[END]
beneath,it,she,was,naked,but,for,the,chain,about,her,throat,[END]
a,chain,of,linked,golden,hands,each,holding,the,next,[END]
my,lady,shae,tyrion,said,softly,[END]
all,the,time,i,sat,in,the,black,cell,waiting,to,die,i,kept,remembering,how,beautiful,you,were,[END]
in,silk,or,roughspun,or,nothing,at,all,[END]
m'lord,will,be,back,soon,[END]
you,should,go,or,[END]
did,you,come,to,take,me,away,[END]
did,you,ever,like,it,[END]
he,cupped,her,cheek,remembering,all,the,times,he,had,done,this,before,[END]
all,the,times,he'd,slid,his,hands,around,her,waist,squeezed,her,small,firm,breasts,stroked,her,short,dark,hair,touched,her,lips,her,cheeks,her,ears,[END]
all,the,times,he,had,opened,her,with,a,finger,to,probe,her,secret,sweetness,and,make,her,moan,[END]
did,you,ever,like,my,touch,[END]
more,than,anything,she,said,my,giant,of,lannister,[END]
that,was,the,worst,thing,you,could,have,said,sweetling,[END]
tyrion,slid,a,hand,under,his,father's,chain,and,twisted,[END]
the,links,tightened,digging,into,her,neck,[END]
for,hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman's,hands,are,warm,he,said,[END]
he,gave,cold,hands,another,twist,as,the,warm,ones,beat,away,his,tears,[END]
afterward,he,found,lord,tywin's,dagger,on,the,bedside,table,and,shoved,it,through,his,belt,[END]
a,lion-headed,mace,a,poleaxe,and,a,crossbow,had,been,hung,on,the,walls,[END]
the,poleaxe,would,be,clumsy,to,wield,inside,a,castle,and,the,mace,was,too,high,to,reach,but,a,large,wood-and-iron,chest,had,been,placed,against,the,wall,directly,under,the,crossbow,[END]
he,climbed,up,pulled,down,the,bow,and,a,leather,quiver,packed,with,quarrels,jammed,a,foot,into,the,stirrup,and,pushed,down,until,the,bowstring,cocked,[END]
then,he,slipped,a,bolt,into,the,notch,[END]
jaime,had,lectured,him,more,than,once,on,the,drawbacks,of,crossbows,[END]
if,lum,and,lester,emerged,from,wherever,they,were,talking,he'd,never,have,time,to,reload,but,at,least,he'd,take,one,down,to,hell,with,him,[END]
lum,if,he,had,a,choice,[END]
you'll,have,to,clean,your,own,mail,lum,[END]
you,lose,[END]
waddling,to,the,door,he,listened,a,moment,then,eased,it,open,slowly,[END]
a,lamp,burned,in,a,stone,niche,casting,wan,yellow,light,over,the,empty,hallway,[END]
only,the,flame,was,moving,[END]
tyrion,slid,out,holding,the,crossbow,down,against,his,leg,[END]
he,found,his,father,where,he,knew,he'd,find,him,seated,in,the,dimness,of,the,privy,tower,bedrobe,hiked,up,around,his,hips,[END]
at,the,sound,of,steps,lord,tywin,raised,his,eyes,[END]
tyrion,gave,him,a,mocking,half,bow,[END]
my,lord,[END]
tyrion,[END]
if,he,was,afraid,tywin,lannister,gave,no,hint,of,it,[END]
who,released,you,from,your,cell,[END]
i'd,love,to,tell,you,but,i,swore,a,holy,oath,[END]
the,eunuch,his,father,decided,[END]
i'll,have,his,head,for,this,[END]
is,that,my,crossbow,[END]
put,it,down,[END]
will,you,punish,me,if,i,refuse,father,[END]
this,escape,is,folly,[END]
you,are,not,to,be,killed,if,that,is,what,you,fear,[END]
it's,still,my,intent,to,send,you,to,the,wall,but,i,could,not,do,it,without,lord,tyrell's,consent,[END]
put,down,the,crossbow,and,we,will,go,back,to,my,chambers,and,talk,of,it,[END]
we,can,talk,here,just,as,well,[END]
perhaps,i,don't,choose,to,go,to,the,wall,father,[END]
it's,bloody,cold,up,there,and,i,believe,i've,had,enough,coldness,from,you,[END]
so,just,tell,me,something,and,i'll,be,on,my,way,[END]
one,simple,question,you,owe,me,that,much,[END]
i,owe,you,nothing,[END]
you've,given,me,less,than,that,all,my,life,but,you'll,give,me,this,[END]
what,did,you,do,with,tysha,[END]
tysha,[END]
he,does,not,even,remember,her,name,[END]
the,girl,i,married,[END]
oh,yes,[END]
your,first,whore,[END]
tyrion,took,aim,at,his,father's,chest,[END]
the,next,time,you,say,that,word,i'll,kill,you,[END]
you,do,not,have,the,courage,[END]
shall,we,find,out,[END]
it's,a,short,word,and,it,seems,to,come,so,easily,to,your,lips,[END]
tyrion,gestured,impatiently,with,the,bow,[END]
tysha,[END]
what,did,you,do,with,her,after,my,little,lesson,[END]
i,don't,recall,[END]
try,harder,[END]
did,you,have,her,killed,[END]
his,father,pursed,his,lips,[END]
there,was,no,reason,for,that,she'd,learned,her,place,[END]
and,had,been,well,paid,for,her,day's,work,i,seem,to,recall,[END]
i,suppose,the,steward,sent,her,on,her,way,[END]
i,never,thought,to,inquire,[END]
on,her,way,where,[END]
wherever,whores,go,[END]
tyrion's,finger,clenched,[END]
the,crossbow,whanged,just,as,lord,tywin,started,to,rise,[END]
the,bolt,slammed,into,him,above,the,groin,and,he,sat,back,down,with,a,grunt,[END]
the,quarrel,had,sunk,deep,right,to,the,fletching,[END]
blood,seeped,out,around,the,shaft,dripping,down,into,his,pubic,hair,and,over,his,bare,thighs,[END]
you,shot,me,he,said,incredulously,his,eyes,glassy,with,shock,[END]
you,always,were,quick,to,grasp,a,situation,my,lord,tyrion,said,[END]
that,must,be,why,you're,the,hand,of,the,king,[END]
you,[END]
you,are,no,[END]
no,son,of,mine,[END]
now,that's,where,you're,wrong,father,[END]
why,i,believe,i'm,you,writ,small,[END]
do,me,a,kindness,now,and,die,quickly,[END]
i,have,a,ship,to,catch,[END]
for,once,his,father,did,what,tyrion,asked,him,[END]
the,proof,was,the,sudden,stench,as,his,bowels,loosened,in,the,moment,of,death,[END]
well,he,was,in,the,right,place,for,it,tyrion,thought,[END]
but,the,stink,that,filled,the,privy,gave,ample,evidence,that,the,oft-repeated,jape,about,his,father,was,just,another,lie,[END]
lord,tywin,lannister,did,not,in,the,end,shit,gold,[END]
samwell,[END]
the,king,was,angry,[END]
sam,saw,that,at,once,[END]
as,the,black,brothers,entered,one,by,one,and,knelt,before,him,stannis,shoved,away,his,breakfast,of,hardbread,salt,beef,and,boiled,eggs,and,eyed,them,coldly,[END]
beside,him,the,red,woman,melisandre,looked,as,if,she,found,the,scene,amusing,[END]

someone,had,to,help,maester,aemon,up,the,steps,[END]

sam,did,not,understand,why,melisandre,should,seem,so,interested,in,him,[END]
king,stannis,kept,the,black,brothers,on,their,knees,for,an,extraordinarily,long,time,[END]
rise,he,said,at,last,[END]
sam,gave,maester,aemon,his,shoulder,to,help,him,back,up,[END]

you,are,sam,agreed,but,cotter,pyke,might,serve,[END]

jon,[END]
iron,emmett,was,a,long,lanky,young,ranger,whose,endurance,strength,and,swordsmanship,were,the,pride,of,eastwatch,[END]
jon,always,came,away,from,their,sessions,stiff,and,sore,and,woke,the,next,day,covered,with,bruises,which,was,just,the,way,he,wanted,it,[END]
he,would,never,get,any,better,going,up,against,the,likes,of,satin,and,horse,or,even,grenn,[END]
most,days,he,gave,as,good,as,he,got,jon,liked,to,think,but,not,today,[END]
he,had,hardly,slept,last,night,and,after,an,hour,of,restless,tossing,he,had,given,up,even,the,attempt,dressed,and,walked,the,top,of,the,wall,till,the,sun,came,up,wrestling,with,stannis,baratheon's,offer,[END]
the,lack,of,sleep,was,catching,up,with,him,now,and,emmett,was,hammering,him,mercilessly,across,the,yard,driving,him,back,on,his,heels,with,one,long,looping,cut,after,another,and,slamming,him,with,his,shield,from,time,to,time,for,good,measure,[END]
jon's,arm,had,gone,numb,from,the,shock,of,impact,and,the,edgeless,practice,sword,seemed,to,be,growing,heavier,with,every,passing,moment,[END]
he,was,almost,ready,to,lower,his,blade,and,call,a,halt,when,emmett,feinted,low,and,came,in,over,his,shield,with,a,savage,forehand,slash,that,caught,jon,on,the,temple,[END]
he,staggered,his,helm,and,head,both,ringing,from,the,force,of,the,blow,[END]
for,half,a,heartbeat,the,world,beyond,his,eyeslit,was,a,blur,[END]
and,then,the,years,were,gone,and,he,was,back,at,winterfell,once,more,wearing,a,quilted,leather,coat,in,place,of,mail,and,plate,[END]
his,sword,was,made,of,wood,and,it,was,robb,who,stood,facing,him,not,iron,emmett,[END]
every,morning,they,had,trained,together,since,they,were,big,enough,to,walk,snow,and,stark,spinning,and,slashing,about,the,wards,of,winterfell,shouting,and,laughing,sometimes,crying,when,there,was,no,one,else,to,see,[END]

i'm,prince,aemon,the,dragonknight,jon,would,call,out,and,robb,would,shout,back,well,i'm,florian,the,fool,[END]

that,morning,he,called,it,first,[END]
i'm,lord,of,winterfell,[END]
he,cried,as,he,had,a,hundred,times,before,[END]
only,this,time,this,time,robb,had,answered,you,can't,be,lord,of,winterfell,you're,bastard-born,[END]
my,lady,mother,says,you,can't,ever,be,the,lord,of,winterfell,[END]

it,was,said,amiably,though,[END]

warrior,defend,me,he,groaned,now,i,know,how,qhorin,halfhand,must,have,felt,[END]
that,was,too,much,[END]
jon,wrenched,free,of,his,friends,and,retreated,to,the,armory,alone,[END]
his,ears,were,still,ringing,from,the,blow,emmett,had,dealt,him,[END]
he,sat,on,the,bench,and,buried,his,head,in,his,hands,[END]
why,am,i,so,angry,[END]
he,asked,himself,but,it,was,a,stupid,question,[END]
lord,of,winterfell,[END]
i,could,be,the,lord,of,winterfell,[END]
my,father's,heir,[END]
it,was,not,lord,eddard's,face,he,saw,floating,before,him,though,it,was,lady,catelyn's,[END]
with,her,deep,blue,eyes,and,hard,cold,mouth,she,looked,a,bit,like,stannis,[END]
iron,he,thought,but,brittle,[END]
she,was,looking,at,him,the,way,she,used,to,look,at,him,at,winterfell,whenever,he,had,bested,robb,at,swords,or,sums,or,most,anything,[END]
who,are,you,[END]
that,look,had,always,seemed,to,say,[END]
this,is,not,your,place,[END]
why,are,you,here,[END]
his,friends,were,still,out,in,the,practice,yard,but,jon,was,in,no,fit,state,to,face,them,[END]
he,left,the,armory,by,the,back,descending,a,steep,flight,of,stone,steps,to,the,wormways,the,tunnels,that,linked,the,castle's,keeps,and,towers,below,the,earth,[END]
it,was,short,walk,to,the,bathhouse,where,he,took,a,cold,plunge,to,wash,the,sweat,off,and,soaked,in,a,hot,stone,tub,[END]
the,warmth,took,some,of,the,ache,from,his,muscles,and,made,him,think,of,winterfell's,muddy,pools,steaming,and,bubbling,in,the,godswood,[END]
winterfell,he,thought,[END]
theon,left,it,burned,and,broken,but,i,could,restore,it,[END]
surely,his,father,would,have,wanted,that,and,robb,as,well,[END]
they,would,never,have,wanted,the,castle,left,in,ruins,[END]
you,can't,be,the,lord,of,winterfell,you're,bastard-born,he,heard,robb,say,again,[END]
and,the,stone,kings,were,growling,at,him,with,granite,tongues,[END]
you,do,not,belong,here,[END]
this,is,not,your,place,[END]
when,jon,closed,his,eyes,he,saw,the,heart,tree,with,its,pale,limbs,red,leaves,and,solemn,face,[END]
the,weirwood,was,the,heart,of,winterfell,lord,eddard,always,said,[END]
but,to,save,the,castle,jon,would,have,to,tear,that,heart,up,by,its,ancient,roots,and,feed,it,to,the,red,woman's,hungry,fire,god,[END]
i,have,no,right,he,thought,[END]
winterfell,belongs,to,the,old,gods,[END]
the,sound,of,voices,echoing,off,the,vaulted,ceiling,brought,him,back,to,castle,black,[END]
i,don't,know,a,man,was,saying,in,a,voice,thick,with,doubts,[END]
maybe,if,i,knew,the,man,better,[END]
lord,stannis,didn't,have,much,good,to,say,of,him,i'll,tell,you,that,[END]
when,has,stannis,baratheon,ever,had,much,good,to,say,of,anyone,[END]
ser,alliser's,flinty,voice,was,unmistakable,[END]
if,we,let,stannis,choose,our,lord,commander,we,become,his,bannermen,in,all,but,name,[END]
tywin,lannister,is,not,like,to,forget,that,and,you,know,it,will,be,lord,tywin,who,wins,in,the,end,[END]
he's,already,beaten,stannis,once,on,the,blackwater,[END]
lord,tywin,favors,slynt,said,bowen,marsh,in,a,fretful,anxious,voice,[END]
i,can,show,you,his,letter,othell,[END]
our,faithful,friend,and,servant,',he,called,him,[END]
jon,snow,sat,up,suddenly,and,the,three,men,froze,at,the,sound,of,the,slosh,[END]
my,lords,he,said,with,cold,courtesy,[END]
what,are,you,doing,here,bastard,[END]
thorne,asked,[END]
bathing,[END]
but,don't,let,me,spoil,your,plotting,[END]
jon,climbed,from,the,water,dried,dressed,and,left,them,to,conspire,[END]
outside,he,found,he,had,no,idea,where,he,was,going,[END]
he,walked,past,the,shell,of,the,lord,commander's,tower,where,once,he'd,saved,the,old,bear,from,a,dead,man,past,the,spot,where,ygritte,had,died,with,that,sad,smile,on,her,face,past,the,king's,tower,where,he,and,satin,and,deaf,dick,follard,had,waited,for,the,magnar,and,his,thenns,past,the,heaped,and,charred,remains,of,the,great,wooden,stair,[END]
the,inner,gate,was,open,so,jon,went,down,the,tunnel,through,the,wall,[END]
he,could,feel,the,cold,around,him,the,weight,of,all,the,ice,above,his,head,[END]
he,walked,past,the,place,where,donal,noye,and,mag,the,mighty,had,fought,and,died,together,through,the,new,outer,gate,and,back,into,the,pale,cold,sunlight,[END]
only,then,did,he,permit,himself,to,stop,to,take,a,breath,to,think,[END]
othell,yarwyck,was,not,a,man,of,strong,convictions,except,when,it,came,to,wood,and,stone,and,mortar,[END]
the,old,bear,had,known,that,[END]
thorne,and,marsh,will,sway,him,yarwyck,will,support,lord,janos,and,lord,janos,will,be,chosen,lord,commander,[END]
and,what,does,that,leave,me,if,not,winterfell,[END]
a,wind,swirled,against,the,wall,tugging,at,his,cloak,[END]
he,could,feel,the,cold,coming,off,the,ice,the,way,heat,comes,off,a,fire,[END]
jon,pulled,up,his,hood,and,began,to,walk,again,[END]
the,afternoon,was,growing,old,and,the,sun,was,low,in,the,west,[END]
a,hundred,yards,away,was,the,camp,where,king,stannis,had,confined,his,wildling,captives,within,a,ring,of,ditches,sharpened,stakes,and,high,wooden,fences,[END]
to,his,left,were,three,great,firepits,where,the,victors,had,burned,the,bodies,of,all,the,free,folk,to,die,beneath,the,wall,huge,pelted,giants,and,little,hornfoot,men,alike,[END]
the,killing,ground,was,still,a,desolation,of,scorched,weeds,and,hardened,pitch,but,mance's,people,had,left,traces,of,themselves,everywhere,a,torn,hide,that,might,have,been,part,of,a,tent,a,giant's,maul,the,wheel,of,a,chariot,a,broken,spear,a,pile,of,mammoth,dung,[END]
on,the,edge,of,the,haunted,forest,where,the,tents,had,been,jon,found,an,oakwood,stump,and,sat,[END]
ygritte,wanted,me,to,be,a,wildling,[END]
stannis,wants,me,to,be,the,lord,of,winterfell,[END]
but,what,do,i,want,[END]
the,sun,crept,down,the,sky,to,dip,behind,the,wall,where,it,curved,through,the,western,hills,[END]
jon,watched,as,that,towering,expanse,of,ice,took,on,the,reds,and,pinks,of,sunset,[END]
would,i,sooner,be,hanged,for,a,turncloak,by,lord,janos,or,forswear,my,vows,marry,val,and,become,the,lord,of,winterfell,[END]
it,seemed,an,easy,choice,when,he,thought,of,it,in,those,terms,[END]
though,if,ygritte,had,still,been,alive,it,might,have,been,even,easier,[END]
val,was,a,stranger,to,him,[END]
she,was,not,hard,on,the,eyes,certainly,and,she,had,been,sister,to,mance,rayder's,queen,but,still,[END]
i,would,need,to,steal,her,if,i,wanted,her,love,but,she,might,give,me,children,[END]
i,might,someday,hold,a,son,of,my,own,blood,in,my,arms,[END]
a,son,was,something,jon,snow,had,never,dared,dream,of,since,he,decided,to,live,his,life,on,the,wall,[END]
i,could,name,him,robb,[END]
val,would,want,to,keep,her,sister's,son,but,we,could,foster,him,at,winterfell,and,gilly's,boy,as,well,[END]
sam,would,never,need,to,tell,his,lie,[END]
we'd,find,a,place,for,gilly,too,and,sam,could,come,visit,her,once,a,year,or,so,[END]
mance's,son,and,craster's,would,grow,up,brothers,as,i,once,did,with,robb,[END]
he,wanted,it,jon,knew,then,[END]
he,wanted,it,as,much,as,he,had,ever,wanted,anything,[END]
i,have,always,wanted,it,he,thought,guiltily,[END]
may,the,gods,forgive,me,[END]
it,was,a,hunger,inside,him,sharp,as,a,dragonglass,blade,[END]
a,hunger,[END]
he,could,feel,it,[END]
it,was,food,he,needed,prey,a,red,deer,that,stank,of,fear,or,a,great,elk,proud,and,defiant,[END]
he,needed,to,kill,and,fill,his,belly,with,fresh,meat,and,hot,dark,blood,[END]
his,mouth,began,to,water,with,the,thought,[END]
it,was,a,long,moment,before,he,understood,what,was,happening,[END]
when,he,did,he,bolted,to,his,feet,[END]
ghost,[END]
he,turned,toward,the,wood,and,there,he,came,padding,silently,out,of,the,green,dusk,the,breath,coming,warm,and,white,from,his,open,jaws,[END]
ghost,[END]
he,shouted,and,the,direwolf,broke,into,a,run,[END]
he,was,leaner,than,he,had,been,but,bigger,as,well,and,the,only,sound,he,made,was,the,soft,crunch,of,dead,leaves,beneath,his,paws,[END]
when,he,reached,jon,he,leapt,and,they,wrestled,amidst,brown,grass,and,long,shadows,as,the,stars,came,out,above,them,[END]
gods,wolf,where,have,you,been,[END]
jon,said,when,ghost,stopped,worrying,at,his,forearm,[END]
i,thought,you'd,died,on,me,like,robb,and,ygritte,and,all,the,rest,[END]
i've,had,no,sense,of,you,not,since,i,climbed,the,wall,not,even,in,dreams,[END]
the,direwolf,had,no,answer,but,he,licked,jon's,face,with,a,tongue,like,a,wet,rasp,and,his,eyes,caught,the,last,light,and,shone,like,two,great,red,suns,[END]
red,eyes,jon,realized,but,not,like,melisandre's,[END]
he,had,a,weirwood's,eyes,[END]
red,eyes,red,mouth,white,fur,[END]
blood,and,bone,like,a,heart,tree,[END]
he,belongs,to,the,old,gods,this,one,[END]

six,pups,they'd,found,in,the,late,summer,snows,him,and,robb,five,that,were,grey,and,black,and,brown,for,the,five,starks,and,one,white,as,white,as,snow,[END]
he,had,his,answer,then,[END]
beneath,the,wall,the,queen's,men,were,kindling,their,nightfire,[END]
he,saw,melisandre,emerge,from,the,tunnel,with,the,king,beside,her,to,lead,the,prayers,she,believed,would,keep,the,dark,away,[END]
come,ghost,jon,told,the,wolf,[END]
with,me,[END]
you're,hungry,i,know,[END]
i,could,feel,it,[END]
they,ran,together,for,the,gate,circling,wide,around,the,nightfire,where,reaching,flames,clawed,at,the,black,belly,of,the,night,[END]
the,king's,men,were,much,in,evidence,in,the,yards,of,castle,black,[END]
they,stopped,as,jon,went,by,and,gaped,at,him,[END]
none,of,them,had,ever,seen,a,direwolf,before,he,realized,and,ghost,was,twice,as,large,as,the,common,wolves,that,prowled,their,southron,greenwoods,[END]
as,he,walked,toward,the,armory,jon,chanced,to,look,up,and,saw,val,standing,in,her,tower,window,[END]
i'm,sorry,he,thought,[END]
i'm,not,the,man,to,steal,you,out,of,there,[END]
in,the,practice,yard,he,came,upon,a,dozen,king's,men,with,torches,and,long,spears,in,their,hands,[END]
their,sergeant,looked,at,ghost,and,scowled,and,a,couple,of,his,men,lowered,their,spears,until,the,knight,who,led,them,said,move,aside,and,let,them,pass,[END]
to,jon,he,said,you're,late,for,your,supper,[END]

his,brothers,crowded,the,benches,and,the,tables,but,more,were,standing,and,shouting,than,were,sitting,and,no,one,was,eating,[END]
there,was,no,food,[END]
what's,happening,here,[END]

pyp,was,the,first,to,see,jon,[END]

the,shrill,sound,cut,through,the,clamor,like,a,sword,[END]

at,the,center,of,the,garden,beside,the,statue,of,the,weeping,woman,that,lay,broken,and,half-buried,on,the,ground,she,turned,her,face,up,to,the,sky,and,closed,her,eyes,[END]

a,godswood,without,gods,as,empty,as,me,[END]
she,scooped,up,a,handful,of,snow,and,squeezed,it,between,her,fingers,[END]

when,he,had,enough,he,stepped,over,both,walls,with,a,single,long,stride,and,squatted,on,his,heels,in,the,middle,of,the,yard,[END]
sansa,came,closer,to,watch,what,he,was,doing,[END]
his,hands,were,deft,and,sure,and,before,long,he,had,a,crisscrossing,latticework,of,twigs,very,like,the,one,that,roofed,the,glass,gardens,of,winterfell,[END]
we,will,need,to,imagine,the,glass,to,be,sure,he,said,when,he,gave,it,to,her,[END]
this,is,just,right,she,said,[END]
he,touched,her,face,[END]
and,so,is,that,[END]
sansa,did,not,understand,[END]
and,so,is,what,[END]
your,smile,my,lady,[END]
shall,i,make,another,for,you,[END]
if,you,would,[END]
nothing,could,please,me,more,[END]
she,raised,the,walls,of,the,glass,gardens,while,littlefinger,roofed,them,over,and,when,they,were,done,with,that,he,helped,her,extend,the,walls,and,build,the,guardshall,[END]
when,she,used,sticks,for,the,covered,bridges,they,stood,just,as,he,had,said,they,would,[END]
the,first,keep,was,simple,enough,an,old,round,drum,tower,but,sansa,was,stymied,again,when,it,came,to,putting,the,gargoyles,around,the,top,[END]
again,he,had,the,answer,[END]
it's,been,snowing,on,your,castle,my,lady,he,pointed,out,[END]
what,do,the,gargoyles,look,like,when,they're,covered,with,snow,[END]
sansa,closed,her,eyes,to,see,them,in,memory,[END]
they're,just,white,lumps,[END]
well,then,[END]
gargoyles,are,hard,but,white,lumps,should,be,easy,[END]
and,they,were,[END]
the,broken,tower,was,easier,still,[END]
they,made,a,tall,tower,together,kneeling,side,by,side,to,roll,it,smooth,and,when,they'd,raised,it,sansa,stuck,her,fingers,through,the,top,grabbed,a,handful,of,snow,and,flung,it,full,in,his,face,[END]
petyr,yelped,as,the,snow,slid,down,under,his,collar,[END]
that,was,unchivalrously,done,my,lady,[END]
as,was,bringing,me,here,when,you,swore,to,take,me,home,[END]
she,wondered,where,this,courage,had,come,from,to,speak,to,him,so,frankly,[END]
from,winterfell,she,thought,[END]
i,am,stronger,within,the,walls,of,winterfell,[END]
his,face,grew,serious,[END]
yes,i,played,you,false,in,that,[END]
and,in,one,other,thing,as,well,[END]
sansa's,stomach,was,aflutter,[END]
what,other,thing,[END]
i,told,you,that,nothing,could,please,me,more,than,to,help,you,with,your,castle,[END]
i,fear,that,was,a,lie,as,well,[END]
something,else,would,please,me,more,[END]
he,stepped,closer,[END]
this,[END]
sansa,tried,to,step,back,but,he,pulled,her,into,his,arms,and,suddenly,he,was,kissing,her,[END]
feebly,she,tried,to,squirm,but,only,succeeded,in,pressing,herself,more,tightly,against,him,[END]
his,mouth,was,on,hers,swallowing,her,words,[END]
he,tasted,of,mint,[END]
for,half,a,heartbeat,she,yielded,to,his,kiss,[END]
before,she,turned,her,face,away,and,wrenched,free,[END]
what,are,you,doing,[END]
petyr,straightened,his,cloak,[END]
kissing,a,snow,maid,[END]
you're,supposed,to,kiss,her,[END]
sansa,glanced,up,at,lysa's,balcony,but,it,was,empty,now,[END]
your,lady,wife,[END]
i,do,[END]
lysa,has,no,cause,for,complaint,[END]
he,smiled,[END]
i,wish,you,could,see,yourself,my,lady,[END]
you,are,so,beautiful,[END]
you're,crusted,over,with,snow,like,some,little,bear,cub,but,your,face,is,flushed,and,you,can,scarcely,breathe,[END]
how,long,have,you,been,out,here,[END]
you,must,be,very,cold,[END]
let,me,warm,you,sansa,[END]
take,off,those,gloves,give,me,your,hands,[END]
i,won't,[END]
he,sounded,almost,like,marillion,the,night,he'd,gotten,so,drunk,at,the,wedding,[END]
only,this,time,lothor,brune,would,not,appear,to,save,her,ser,lothor,was,petyr's,man,[END]
you,shouldn't,kiss,me,[END]
i,might,have,been,your,own,daughter,[END]
might,have,been,he,admitted,with,a,rueful,smile,[END]
but,you're,not,are,you,[END]
you,are,eddard,stark's,daughter,and,cat's,[END]
but,i,think,you,might,be,even,more,beautiful,than,your,mother,was,when,she,was,your,age,[END]
petyr,please,[END]
her,voice,sounded,so,weak,[END]
please,[END]
a,castle,[END]
the,voice,was,loud,shrill,and,childish,[END]
littlefinger,turned,away,from,her,[END]
lord,robert,[END]
he,sketched,a,bow,[END]
should,you,be,out,in,the,snow,without,your,gloves,[END]
did,you,make,the,snow,castle,lord,littlefinger,[END]
alayne,did,most,of,it,my,lord,[END]
sansa,said,it's,meant,to,be,winterfell,[END]
winterfell,[END]
robert,was,small,for,eight,a,stick,of,a,boy,with,splotchy,skin,and,eyes,that,were,always,runny,[END]
under,one,arm,he,clutched,the,threadbare,cloth,doll,he,carried,everywhere,[END]
winterfell,is,the,seat,of,house,stark,sansa,told,her,husband-to-be,[END]
the,great,castle,of,the,north,[END]
it's,not,so,great,[END]
the,boy,knelt,before,the,gatehouse,[END]
look,here,comes,a,giant,to,knock,it,down,[END]
he,stood,his,doll,in,the,snow,and,moved,it,jerkily,[END]
tromp,tromp,i'm,a,giant,i'm,a,giant,he,chanted,[END]
ho,ho,ho,open,your,gates,or,i'll,mash,them,and,smash,them,[END]
swinging,the,doll,by,the,legs,he,knocked,the,top,off,one,gatehouse,tower,and,then,the,other,[END]
it,was,more,than,sansa,could,stand,[END]
robert,stop,that,[END]
instead,he,swung,the,doll,again,and,a,foot,of,wall,exploded,[END]
she,grabbed,for,his,hand,but,she,caught,the,doll,instead,[END]
there,was,a,loud,ripping,sound,as,the,thin,cloth,tore,[END]
suddenly,she,had,the,doll's,head,robert,had,the,legs,and,body,and,the,rag-and-sawdust,stuffing,was,spilling,in,the,snow,[END]
lord,robert's,mouth,trembled,[END]
you,killlllllllled,him,he,wailed,[END]
then,he,began,to,shake,[END]
it,started,with,no,more,than,a,little,shivering,but,within,a,few,short,heartbeats,he,had,collapsed,across,the,castle,his,limbs,flailing,about,violently,[END]
white,towers,and,snowy,bridges,shattered,and,fell,on,all,sides,[END]
sansa,stood,horrified,but,petyr,baelish,seized,her,cousin's,wrists,and,shouted,for,the,maester,[END]
guards,and,serving,girls,arrived,within,instants,to,help,restrain,the,boy,maester,colemon,a,short,time,later,[END]
robert,arryn's,shaking,sickness,was,nothing,new,to,the,people,of,the,eyrie,and,lady,lysa,had,trained,them,all,to,come,rushing,at,the,boy's,first,cry,[END]
the,maester,held,the,little,lord's,head,and,gave,him,half,a,cup,of,dreamwine,murmuring,soothing,words,[END]
slowly,the,violence,of,the,fit,seemed,to,ebb,away,till,nothing,remained,but,a,small,shaking,of,the,hands,[END]
help,him,to,my,chambers,colemon,told,the,guards,[END]
a,leeching,will,help,calm,him,[END]
it,was,my,fault,[END]
sansa,showed,them,the,doll's,head,[END]
i,ripped,his,doll,in,two,[END]
i,never,meant,to,but,[END]
his,lordship,was,destroying,the,castle,said,petyr,[END]
a,giant,the,boy,whispered,weeping,[END]
it,wasn't,me,it,was,a,giant,hurt,the,castle,[END]
she,killed,him,[END]
i,hate,her,[END]
she's,a,bastard,and,i,hate,her,[END]
i,don't,want,to,be,leeched,[END]
my,lord,your,blood,needs,thinning,said,maester,colemon,[END]
it,is,the,bad,blood,that,makes,you,angry,and,the,rage,that,brings,on,the,shaking,[END]
come,now,[END]
they,led,the,boy,away,[END]
my,lord,husband,sansa,thought,as,she,contemplated,the,ruins,of,winterfell,[END]
the,snow,had,stopped,and,it,was,colder,than,before,[END]
she,wondered,if,lord,robert,would,shake,all,through,their,wedding,[END]
at,least,joffrey,was,sound,of,body,[END]
a,mad,rage,seized,hold,of,her,[END]
she,picked,up,a,broken,branch,and,smashed,the,torn,doll's,head,down,on,top,of,it,then,pushed,it,down,atop,the,shattered,gatehouse,of,her,snow,castle,[END]
the,servants,looked,aghast,but,when,littlefinger,saw,what,she'd,done,he,laughed,[END]
if,the,tales,be,true,that's,not,the,first,giant,to,end,up,with,his,head,on,winterfell's,walls,[END]
those,are,only,stories,she,said,and,left,him,there,[END]
back,in,her,bedchamber,sansa,took,off,her,cloak,and,her,wet,boots,and,sat,beside,the,fire,[END]
she,had,no,doubt,that,she,would,be,made,to,answer,for,lord,robert's,fit,[END]
perhaps,lady,lysa,will,send,me,away,[END]
her,aunt,was,quick,to,banish,anyone,who,displeased,her,and,nothing,displeased,her,quite,so,much,as,people,she,suspected,of,mistreating,her,son,[END]
sansa,would,have,welcomed,banishment,[END]
the,gates,of,the,moon,was,much,larger,than,the,eyrie,and,livelier,as,well,[END]
lord,nestor,royce,seemed,gruff,and,stern,but,his,daughter,myranda,kept,his,castle,for,him,and,everyone,said,how,frolicsome,she,was,[END]
even,sansa's,supposed,bastardy,might,not,count,too,much,against,her,below,[END]
one,of,king,robert's,baseborn,daughters,was,in,service,to,lord,nestor,and,she,and,the,lady,myranda,were,said,to,be,fast,friends,as,close,as,sisters,[END]
i,will,tell,my,aunt,that,i,don't,want,to,marry,robert,[END]
not,even,the,high,septon,himself,could,declare,a,woman,married,if,she,refused,to,say,the,vows,[END]
she,wasn't,a,beggar,no,matter,what,her,aunt,said,[END]
she,was,thirteen,a,woman,flowered,and,wed,the,heir,to,winterfell,[END]
sansa,felt,sorry,for,her,little,cousin,sometimes,but,she,could,not,imagine,ever,wanting,to,be,his,wife,[END]
i,would,sooner,be,married,to,tyrion,again,[END]
if,lady,lysa,knew,that,surely,she'd,send,her,away,[END]
away,from,robert's,pouts,and,shakes,and,runny,eyes,away,from,marillion's,lingering,looks,away,from,petyr's,kisses,[END]
i,will,tell,her,[END]
i,will,[END]
it,was,late,that,afternoon,when,lady,lysa,summoned,her,[END]
sansa,had,been,marshaling,her,courage,all,day,but,no,sooner,did,marillion,appear,at,her,door,than,all,her,doubts,returned,[END]
lady,lysa,requires,your,presence,in,the,high,hall,[END]
the,singer's,eyes,undressed,her,as,he,spoke,but,she,was,used,to,that,[END]
marillion,was,comely,there,was,no,denying,it,boyish,and,slender,with,smooth,skin,sandy,hair,a,charming,smile,[END]
but,he,had,made,himself,well,hated,in,the,vale,by,everyone,but,her,aunt,and,little,lord,robert,[END]
to,hear,the,servants,talk,sansa,was,not,the,first,maid,to,suffer,his,advances,and,the,others,had,not,had,lothor,brune,to,defend,them,[END]
but,lady,lysa,would,hear,no,complaints,against,him,[END]
since,coming,to,the,eyrie,the,singer,had,become,her,favorite,[END]
he,sang,lord,robert,to,sleep,every,night,and,tweaked,the,noses,of,lady,lysa's,suitors,with,verses,that,made,mock,of,their,foibles,[END]
her,aunt,had,showered,him,with,gold,and,gifts,costly,clothes,a,gold,arm,ring,a,belt,studded,with,moonstones,a,fine,horse,[END]
she,had,even,given,him,her,late,husband's,favorite,falcon,[END]
it,all,served,to,make,marillion,unfailingly,courteous,in,lady,lysa's,presence,and,unfailingly,arrogant,outside,it,[END]
thank,you,sansa,told,him,stiffly,[END]
i,know,the,way,[END]
he,would,not,leave,[END]
my,lady,said,to,bring,you,[END]
bring,me,[END]
she,did,not,like,the,sound,of,that,[END]
are,you,a,guardsman,now,[END]
littlefinger,had,dismissed,the,eyrie's,captain,of,guards,and,put,ser,lothor,brune,in,his,place,[END]
do,you,require,guarding,[END]
marillion,said,lightly,[END]
i,am,composing,a,new,song,you,should,know,[END]
a,song,so,sweet,and,sad,it,will,melt,even,your,frozen,heart,[END]
the,roadside,rose,',i,mean,to,call,it,[END]
about,a,baseborn,girl,so,beautiful,she,bewitched,every,man,who,laid,eyes,upon,her,[END]
i,am,a,stark,of,winterfell,she,longed,to,tell,him,[END]
instead,she,nodded,and,let,him,escort,her,down,the,tower,steps,and,along,a,bridge,[END]
the,high,hall,had,been,closed,as,long,as,she'd,been,at,the,eyrie,[END]
sansa,wondered,why,her,aunt,had,opened,it,[END]
normally,she,preferred,the,comfort,of,her,solar,or,the,cozy,warmth,of,lord,arryn's,audience,chamber,with,its,view,of,the,waterfall,[END]
two,guards,in,sky-blue,cloaks,flanked,the,carved,wooden,doors,of,the,high,hall,spears,in,hand,[END]
no,one,is,to,enter,so,long,as,alayne,is,with,lady,lysa,marillion,told,them,[END]
aye,[END]
the,men,let,them,pass,then,crossed,their,spears,[END]
marillion,swung,the,doors,shut,and,barred,them,with,a,third,spear,longer,and,thicker,than,those,the,guards,had,borne,[END]
sansa,felt,a,prickle,of,unease,[END]
why,did,you,do,that,[END]
my,lady,awaits,you,[END]
she,looked,about,uncertainly,[END]
lady,lysa,sat,on,the,dais,in,a,high-backed,chair,of,carved,weirwood,alone,[END]
to,her,right,was,a,second,chair,taller,than,her,own,with,a,stack,of,blue,cushions,piled,on,the,seat,but,lord,robert,was,not,in,it,[END]
sansa,hoped,he'd,recovered,[END]
marillion,was,not,like,to,tell,her,though,[END]
sansa,walked,down,the,blue,silk,carpet,between,rows,of,fluted,pillars,slim,as,lances,[END]
the,floors,and,walls,of,the,high,hall,were,made,of,milk-white,marble,veined,with,blue,[END]
shafts,of,pale,daylight,slanted,down,through,narrow,arched,windows,along,the,eastern,wall,[END]
between,the,windows,were,torches,mounted,in,high,iron,sconces,but,none,of,them,was,lit,[END]
her,footsteps,fell,softly,on,the,carpet,[END]
outside,the,wind,blew,cold,and,lonely,[END]
amidst,so,much,white,marble,even,the,sunlight,looked,chilly,somehow,[END]
though,not,half,so,chilly,as,her,aunt,[END]
lady,lysa,had,dressed,in,a,gown,of,cream-colored,velvet,and,a,necklace,of,sapphires,and,moon-stones,[END]
her,auburn,hair,had,been,done,up,in,a,thick,braid,and,fell,across,one,shoulder,[END]
she,sat,in,the,high,seat,watching,her,niece,approach,her,face,red,and,puffy,beneath,the,paint,and,powder,[END]
on,the,wall,behind,her,hung,a,huge,banner,the,moon-and-falcon,of,house,arryn,in,cream,and,blue,[END]
sansa,stopped,before,the,dais,and,curtsied,[END]
my,lady,[END]
you,sent,for,me,[END]
she,could,still,hear,the,sound,of,the,wind,and,the,soft,chords,marillion,was,playing,at,the,foot,of,the,hall,[END]
i,saw,what,you,did,the,lady,lysa,said,[END]
sansa,smoothed,down,the,folds,of,her,skirt,[END]
i,trust,lord,robert,is,better,[END]
i,never,meant,to,rip,his,doll,[END]
he,was,smashing,my,snow,castle,i,only,[END]
will,you,play,the,coy,deceiver,with,me,[END]
her,aunt,said,[END]
i,was,not,speaking,of,robert's,doll,[END]
i,saw,you,kissing,him,[END]
the,high,hall,seemed,to,grow,a,little,colder,[END]
the,walls,and,floor,and,columns,might,have,turned,to,ice,[END]
he,kissed,me,[END]
lysa's,nostrils,flared,[END]
and,why,would,he,do,that,[END]
he,has,a,wife,who,loves,him,[END]
a,woman,grown,not,a,little,girl,[END]
he,has,no,need,for,the,likes,of,you,[END]
confess,child,[END]
you,threw,yourself,at,him,[END]
that,was,the,way,of,it,[END]
sansa,took,a,step,backward,[END]
that's,not,true,[END]
where,are,you,going,[END]
are,you,afraid,[END]
such,wanton,behavior,must,be,punished,but,i,will,not,be,hard,on,you,[END]
we,keep,a,whipping,boy,for,robert,as,is,the,custom,in,the,free,cities,[END]
his,health,is,too,delicate,for,him,to,bear,the,rod,himself,[END]
i,shall,find,some,common,girl,to,take,your,whipping,but,first,you,must,own,up,to,what,you've,done,[END]
i,cannot,abide,a,liar,alayne,[END]
i,was,building,a,snow,castle,sansa,said,[END]
lord,petyr,was,helping,me,and,then,he,kissed,me,[END]
that's,what,you,saw,[END]

her,aunt,said,sharply,[END]

he,is,mine,[END]
she,rose,to,her,feet,[END]
they,all,tried,to,take,him,from,me,[END]
my,lord,father,my,husband,your,mother,[END]

epilogue,[END]
the,road,up,to,oldstones,went,twice,around,the,hill,before,reaching,the,summit,[END]
overgrown,and,stony,it,would,have,been,slow,going,even,in,the,best,of,times,and,last,night's,snow,had,left,it,muddy,as,well,[END]
snow,in,autumn,in,the,riverlands,it's,unnatural,merrett,thought,gloomily,[END]
it,had,not,been,much,of,a,snow,true,just,enough,to,blanket,the,ground,for,a,night,[END]
most,of,it,had,started,melting,away,as,soon,as,the,sun,came,up,[END]
still,merrett,took,it,for,a,bad,omen,[END]
between,rains,floods,fire,and,war,they,had,lost,two,harvests,and,a,good,part,of,a,third,[END]
an,early,winter,would,mean,famine,all,across,the,riverlands,[END]
a,great,many,people,would,go,hungry,and,some,of,them,would,starve,[END]
merrett,only,hoped,he,wouldn't,be,one,of,them,[END]
i,may,though,[END]
with,my,luck,i,just,may,[END]
i,never,did,have,any,luck,[END]
beneath,the,castle,ruins,the,lower,slopes,of,the,hill,were,so,thickly,forested,that,half,a,hundred,outlaws,could,well,have,been,lurking,there,[END]
they,could,be,watching,me,even,now,[END]
merrett,glanced,about,and,saw,nothing,but,gorse,bracken,thistle,sedge,and,blackberry,bushes,between,the,pines,and,grey-green,sentinels,[END]
elsewhere,skeletal,elm,and,ash,and,scrub,oaks,choked,the,ground,like,weeds,[END]
he,saw,no,outlaws,but,that,meant,little,[END]
outlaws,were,better,at,hiding,than,honest,men,[END]
merrett,hated,the,woods,if,truth,be,told,and,he,hated,outlaws,even,more,[END]
outlaws,stole,my,life,he,had,been,known,to,complain,when,in,his,cups,[END]
he,was,too,often,in,his,cups,his,father,said,often,and,loudly,[END]
too,true,he,thought,ruefully,[END]
you,needed,some,sort,of,distinction,in,the,twins,else,they,were,liable,to,forget,you,were,alive,but,a,reputation,as,the,biggest,drinker,in,the,castle,had,done,little,to,enhance,his,prospects,he'd,found,[END]
i,once,hoped,to,be,the,greatest,knight,who,ever,couched,a,lance,[END]
the,gods,took,that,away,from,me,[END]
why,shouldn't,i,have,a,cup,of,wine,from,time,to,time,[END]
it,helps,my,headaches,[END]
besides,my,wife,is,a,shrew,my,father,despises,me,my,children,are,worthless,[END]
what,do,i,have,to,stay,sober,for,[END]
he,was,sober,now,though,[END]
well,he'd,had,two,horns,of,ale,when,he,broke,his,fast,and,a,small,cup,of,red,when,he,set,out,but,that,was,just,to,keep,his,head,from,pounding,[END]
merrett,could,feel,the,headache,building,behind,his,eyes,and,he,knew,that,if,he,gave,it,half,a,chance,he,would,soon,feel,as,if,he,had,a,thunderstorm,raging,between,his,ears,[END]
sometimes,his,headaches,got,so,bad,that,it,even,hurt,too,much,to,weep,[END]
then,all,he,could,do,was,rest,on,his,bed,in,a,dark,room,with,a,damp,cloth,over,his,eyes,and,curse,his,luck,and,the,nameless,outlaw,who,had,done,this,to,him,[END]
just,thinking,about,it,made,him,anxious,[END]
he,could,no,wise,afford,a,headache,now,[END]
if,i,bring,petyr,back,home,safely,all,my,luck,will,change,[END]
he,had,the,gold,all,he,needed,to,do,was,climb,to,the,top,of,oldstones,meet,the,bloody,outlaws,in,the,ruined,castle,and,make,the,exchange,[END]
a,simple,ransom,[END]
even,he,could,not,muck,it,up,[END]
unless,he,got,a,headache,one,so,bad,that,it,left,him,unable,to,ride,[END]
he,was,supposed,to,be,at,the,ruins,by,sunset,not,weeping,in,a,huddle,at,the,side,of,the,road,[END]
merrett,rubbed,two,fingers,against,his,temple,[END]
once,more,around,the,hill,and,there,i,am,[END]
when,the,message,had,come,in,and,he,had,stepped,forward,to,offer,to,carry,the,ransom,his,father,had,squinted,down,and,said,you,merrett,[END]
and,started,laughing,through,his,nose,that,hideous,heh,heh,heh,laugh,of,his,[END]
merrett,practically,had,to,beg,before,they'd,give,him,the,bloody,bag,of,gold,[END]
something,moved,in,the,underbrush,along,the,side,of,the,road,[END]
merrett,reined,up,hard,and,reached,for,his,sword,but,it,was,only,a,squirrel,[END]
stupid,he,told,himself,shoving,the,sword,back,in,its,scabbard,without,ever,having,gotten,it,out,[END]
outlaws,don't,have,tails,[END]
bloody,hell,merrett,get,hold,of,yourself,[END]
his,heart,was,thumping,in,his,chest,as,if,he,were,some,green,boy,on,his,first,campaign,[END]
as,if,this,were,the,kingswood,and,it,was,the,old,brotherhood,i,was,going,to,face,not,the,lightning,lord's,sorry,lot,of,brigands,[END]
for,a,moment,he,was,tempted,to,trot,right,back,down,the,hill,and,find,the,nearest,alehouse,[END]
that,bag,of,gold,would,buy,a,lot,of,ale,enough,for,him,to,forget,all,about,petyr,pimple,[END]
let,them,hang,him,he,brought,this,on,himself,[END]
it's,no,more,than,he,deserves,wandering,off,with,some,bloody,camp,follower,like,a,stag,in,rut,[END]
his,head,had,begun,to,pound,soft,now,but,he,knew,it,would,get,worse,[END]
merrett,rubbed,the,bridge,of,his,nose,[END]
he,really,had,no,right,to,think,so,ill,of,petyr,[END]
i,did,the,same,myself,when,i,was,his,age,[END]
in,his,case,all,it,got,him,was,a,pox,but,still,he,shouldn't,condemn,[END]
whores,did,have,charms,especially,if,you,had,a,face,like,petyr's,[END]
the,poor,lad,had,a,wife,to,be,sure,but,she,was,half,the,problem,[END]
not,only,was,she,twice,his,age,but,she,was,bedding,his,brother,walder,too,if,the,talk,was,true,[END]
there,was,always,lots,of,talk,around,the,twins,and,only,a,little,was,ever,true,but,in,this,case,merrett,believed,it,[END]
black,walder,was,a,man,who,took,what,he,wanted,even,his,brother's,wife,[END]
he'd,had,edwyn's,wife,too,that,was,common,knowledge,fair,walda,had,been,known,to,slip,into,his,bed,from,time,to,time,and,some,even,said,he'd,known,the,seventh,lady,frey,a,deal,better,than,he,should,have,[END]
small,wonder,he,refused,to,marry,[END]
why,buy,a,cow,when,there,were,udders,all,around,begging,to,be,milked,[END]
cursing,under,his,breath,merrett,jammed,his,heels,into,his,horse's,flanks,and,rode,on,up,the,hill,[END]
as,tempting,as,it,was,to,drink,the,gold,away,he,knew,that,if,he,didn't,come,back,with,petyr,pimple,he,had,as,well,not,come,back,at,all,[END]
lord,walder,would,soon,turn,two-and-ninety,[END]
his,ears,had,started,to,go,his,eyes,were,almost,gone,and,his,gout,was,so,bad,that,he,had,to,be,carried,everywhere,[END]
he,could,not,possibly,last,much,longer,all,his,sons,agreed,[END]
and,when,he,goes,everything,will,change,and,not,for,the,better,[END]
his,father,was,querulous,and,stubborn,with,an,iron,will,and,a,wasp's,tongue,but,he,did,believe,in,taking,care,of,his,own,[END]
all,of,his,own,even,the,ones,who,had,displeased,and,disappointed,him,[END]
even,the,ones,whose,names,he,can't,remember,[END]
once,he,was,gone,though,[END]
when,ser,stevron,had,been,heir,that,was,one,thing,[END]
the,old,man,had,been,grooming,stevron,for,sixty,years,and,had,pounded,it,into,his,head,that,blood,was,blood,[END]
but,stevron,had,died,whilst,campaigning,with,the,young,wolf,in,the,west,of,waiting,no,doubt,lame,lothar,had,quipped,when,the,raven,brought,them,the,news,and,his,sons,and,grandsons,were,a,different,sort,of,frey,[END]

fortunately,lame,lothar,once,said,they,hate,each,other,even,more,than,they,hate,us,[END]
merrett,wasn't,certain,that,was,fortunate,at,all,and,for,that,matter,lothar,himself,might,be,more,dangerous,than,either,of,them,[END]
lord,walder,had,ordered,the,slaughter,of,the,starks,at,roslin's,wedding,but,it,had,been,lame,lothar,who,had,plotted,it,out,with,roose,bolton,all,the,way,down,to,which,songs,would,be,played,[END]
lothar,was,a,very,amusing,fellow,to,get,drunk,with,but,merrett,would,never,be,so,foolish,as,to,turn,his,back,on,him,[END]
in,the,twins,you,learned,early,that,only,full,blood,siblings,could,be,trusted,and,them,not,very,far,[END]

the,rest,of,us,he'll,shove,out,to,fend,for,ourselves,[END]
the,prospect,worried,merrett,more,than,words,could,say,[END]

even,if,he'd,been,a,knight,which,as,it,happened,he,wasn't,[END]

he,was,a,big,man,broad,around,the,chest,and,shoulders,if,only,of,middling,height,[END]
in,the,last,ten,years,he,had,grown,soft,and,fleshy,he,knew,but,when,he'd,been,younger,merrett,had,been,almost,as,robust,as,ser,hosteen,his,eldest,full,brother,who,was,commonly,regarded,as,the,strongest,of,lord,walder,frey's,brood,[END]
as,a,boy,he'd,been,packed,off,to,crakehall,to,serve,his,mother's,family,as,a,page,[END]
when,old,lord,sumner,had,made,him,a,squire,everyone,had,assumed,he,would,be,ser,merrett,in,no,more,than,a,few,years,but,the,outlaws,of,the,kingswood,brotherhood,had,pissed,on,those,plans,[END]
while,his,fellow,squire,jaime,lannister,was,covering,himself,in,glory,merrett,had,first,caught,the,pox,from,a,camp,follower,then,managed,to,get,captured,by,a,woman,the,one,called,the,white,fawn,[END]
lord,sumner,had,ransomed,him,back,from,the,outlaws,but,in,the,very,next,fight,he'd,been,felled,by,a,blow,from,a,mace,that,had,broken,his,helm,and,left,him,insensible,for,a,fortnight,[END]
everyone,gave,him,up,for,dead,they,told,him,later,[END]
merrett,hadn't,died,but,his,fighting,days,were,done,[END]
even,the,lightest,blow,to,his,head,brought,on,blinding,pain,and,reduced,him,to,tears,[END]
under,these,circumstances,knighthood,was,out,of,the,question,lord,sumner,told,him,not,unkindly,[END]

after,that,merrett's,luck,had,only,grown,worse,[END]
his,father,had,managed,to,make,a,good,marriage,for,him,somehow,he,wed,one,of,lord,darry's,daughters,back,when,the,darrys,stood,high,in,king,aerys's,favor,[END]
but,it,seemed,as,if,he,no,sooner,had,deflowered,his,bride,than,aerys,lost,his,throne,[END]
unlike,the,freys,the,darrys,had,been,prominent,targaryen,loyalists,which,cost,them,half,their,lands,most,of,their,wealth,and,almost,all,their,power,[END]

the,bolton,alliance,was,important,for,house,frey,and,his,daughter,had,helped,secure,it,he,thought,that,must,surely,count,for,something,[END]
the,old,man,had,soon,disabused,him,[END]
he,picked,her,because,she's,fat,lord,walder,said,[END]
you,think,bolton,gave,a,mummer's,fart,that,she,was,your,whelp,[END]

your,walda's,a,sow,in,silk,that's,why,he,picked,her,and,i'm,not,like,to,thank,you,for,it,[END]

and,even,that,i,failed,at,[END]
he'd,cozened,the,huge,northman,into,drinking,enough,wine,to,kill,any,three,normal,men,yet,after,roslin,had,been,bedded,the,greatjon,still,managed,to,snatch,the,sword,of,the,first,man,to,accost,him,and,break,his,arm,in,the,snatching,[END]

i,have,to,go,on,he,told,himself,[END]

petyr,might,be,a,whisker,on,the,hapless,side,but,he,wasn't,as,cold,as,edwyn,nor,as,hot,as,black,walder,[END]
the,boy,will,be,grateful,for,my,part,and,his,father,will,see,that,i'm,loyal,a,man,worth,having,about,[END]
but,only,if,he,was,there,by,sunset,with,the,gold,[END]
merrett,glanced,at,the,sky,[END]
right,on,time,[END]
he,needed,something,to,steady,his,hands,[END]
he,pulled,up,the,waterskin,hung,from,his,saddle,uncorked,it,and,took,a,long,swallow,[END]
the,wine,was,thick,and,sweet,so,dark,it,was,almost,black,but,gods,it,tasted,good,[END]
the,curtain,wall,of,oldstones,had,once,encircled,the,brow,of,the,hill,like,the,crown,on,a,king's,head,[END]
only,the,foundation,remained,and,a,few,waist-high,piles,of,crumbling,stone,spotted,with,lichen,[END]
merrett,rode,along,the,line,of,the,wall,until,he,came,to,the,place,where,the,gatehouse,would,have,stood,[END]
the,ruins,were,more,extensive,here,and,he,had,to,dismount,to,lead,his,palfrey,through,them,[END]
in,the,west,the,sun,had,vanished,behind,a,bank,of,low,clouds,[END]
gorse,and,bracken,covered,the,slopes,and,once,inside,the,vanished,walls,the,weeds,were,chest,high,[END]
merrett,loosened,his,sword,in,its,scabbard,and,looked,about,warily,but,saw,no,outlaws,[END]
could,i,have,come,on,the,wrong,day,[END]
he,stopped,and,rubbed,his,temples,with,his,thumbs,but,that,did,nothing,to,ease,the,pressure,behind,his,eyes,[END]
seven,bloody,hells,[END]
from,somewhere,deep,within,the,castle,faint,music,came,drifting,through,the,trees,[END]
merrett,found,himself,shivering,despite,his,cloak,[END]
he,pulled,open,his,waterskin,and,had,another,drink,of,wine,[END]
i,could,just,get,back,on,my,horse,ride,to,oldtown,and,drink,the,gold,away,[END]
no,good,ever,came,from,dealing,with,outlaws,[END]

petyr,pimple,might,be,lord,of,the,crossing,one,day,edwyn,has,no,sons,and,black,walder's,only,got,bastards,[END]
petyr,will,remember,who,came,to,get,him,[END]
he,took,another,swallow,corked,the,skin,up,and,led,his,palfrey,through,broken,stones,gorse,and,thin,wind-whipped,trees,following,the,sounds,to,what,had,been,the,castle,ward,[END]
fallen,leaves,lay,thick,upon,the,ground,like,soldiers,after,some,great,slaughter,[END]
a,man,in,patched,faded,greens,was,sitting,crosslegged,atop,a,weathered,stone,sepulcher,fingering,the,strings,of,a,woodharp,[END]
the,music,was,soft,and,sad,[END]
merrett,knew,the,song,[END]
high,in,the,halls,of,the,kings,who,are,gone,jenny,would,dance,with,her,ghosts,[END]
get,off,there,merrett,said,[END]

the,hammer,of,justice,they,called,him,[END]
been,a,long,while,since,he,heard,any,new,songs,[END]
the,outlaw,hopped,down,[END]
trim,and,slim,he,had,a,narrow,face,and,foxy,features,but,his,mouth,was,so,wide,that,his,smile,seemed,to,touch,his,ears,[END]
a,few,strands,of,thin,brown,hair,were,blowing,across,his,brow,[END]
he,pushed,them,back,with,his,free,hand,and,said,do,you,remember,me,my,lord,[END]
no,[END]
merrett,frowned,[END]
why,would,i,[END]
i,sang,at,your,daughter's,wedding,[END]
and,passing,well,i,thought,[END]

we're,all,cousins,in,sevenstreams,[END]
didn't,stop,him,from,turning,niggard,when,it,was,time,to,pay,me,[END]

why,is,it,your,lord,father,never,has,me,play,at,the,twins,[END]
don't,i,make,enough,noise,for,his,lordship,[END]
he,likes,it,loud,i,have,been,hearing,[END]
you,bring,the,gold,[END]
asked,a,harsher,voice,behind,him,[END]
merrett's,throat,was,dry,[END]
bloody,outlaws,always,hiding,in,the,bushes,[END]
it,had,been,the,same,in,the,kingswood,[END]
you'd,think,you'd,caught,five,of,them,and,ten,more,would,spring,from,nowhere,[END]
when,he,turned,they,were,all,around,him,an,ill-favored,gaggle,of,leathery,old,men,and,smooth-cheeked,lads,younger,than,petyr,pimple,the,lot,of,them,clad,in,roughspun,rags,boiled,leather,and,bits,of,dead,men's,armor,[END]
there,was,one,woman,with,them,bundled,up,in,a,hooded,cloak,three,times,too,big,for,her,[END]
merrett,was,too,flustered,to,count,them,but,there,seemed,to,be,a,dozen,at,the,least,maybe,a,score,[END]
i,asked,a,question,[END]
the,speaker,was,a,big,bearded,man,with,crooked,green,teeth,and,a,broken,nose,taller,than,merrett,though,not,so,heavy,in,the,belly,[END]
a,halfhelm,covered,his,head,a,patched,yellow,cloak,his,broad,shoulders,[END]
where's,our,gold,[END]
in,my,saddlebag,[END]
a,hundred,golden,dragons,[END]
merrett,cleared,his,throat,[END]
you'll,get,it,when,i,see,that,petyr,[END]
a,squat,one-eyed,outlaw,strode,forward,before,he,could,finish,reached,into,the,saddlebag,bold,as,you,please,and,found,the,sack,[END]
merrett,started,to,grab,him,then,thought,better,of,it,[END]
the,outlaw,opened,the,drawstring,removed,a,coin,and,bit,it,[END]
tastes,right,[END]
he,hefted,the,sack,[END]
feels,right,too,[END]
they're,going,to,take,the,gold,and,keep,petyr,too,merrett,thought,in,sudden,panic,[END]
that's,the,whole,ransom,[END]
all,you,asked,for,[END]
his,palms,were,sweating,[END]
he,wiped,them,on,his,breeches,[END]
which,one,of,you,is,beric,dondarrion,[END]
dondarrion,had,been,a,lord,before,he,turned,outlaw,he,might,still,be,a,man,of,honor,[END]
why,that,would,be,me,said,the,one-eyed,man,[END]

it's,my,turn,to,be,lord,beric,[END]
does,that,mean,i,have,to,be,thoros,[END]
the,singer,laughed,[END]
my,lord,sad,to,say,lord,beric,was,needed,elsewhere,[END]
the,times,are,troubled,and,there,are,many,battles,to,fight,[END]
but,we'll,sort,you,out,just,as,he,would,have,no,fear,[END]
merrett,had,plenty,of,fear,[END]
his,head,was,pounding,too,[END]
much,more,of,this,and,he'd,be,sobbing,[END]
you,have,your,gold,he,said,[END]
give,me,my,nephew,and,i'll,be,gone,[END]
petyr,was,actually,more,a,great,half-nephew,but,there,was,no,need,to,go,into,that,[END]
he's,in,the,godswood,said,the,man,in,the,yellow,cloak,[END]
we'll,take,you,to,him,[END]
notch,you,hold,his,horse,[END]
merrett,handed,over,the,bridle,reluctantly,[END]
he,did,not,see,what,other,choice,he,had,[END]
my,water,skin,he,heard,himself,say,[END]
a,swallow,of,wine,to,settle,my,[END]
we,don't,drink,with,your,sort,yellow,cloak,said,curtly,[END]
it's,this,way,[END]
follow,me,[END]
leaves,crunched,beneath,their,heels,and,every,step,sent,a,spike,of,pain,through,merrett's,temple,[END]
they,walked,in,silence,the,wind,gusting,around,them,[END]
the,last,light,of,the,setting,sun,was,in,his,eyes,as,he,clambered,over,the,mossy,hummocks,that,were,all,that,remained,of,the,keep,[END]
behind,was,the,godswood,[END]
petyr,pimple,was,hanging,from,the,limb,of,an,oak,a,noose,tight,around,his,long,thin,neck,[END]
his,eyes,bulged,from,a,black,face,staring,down,at,merrett,accusingly,[END]
you,came,too,late,they,seemed,to,say,[END]
but,he,hadn't,[END]
he,hadn't,[END]

merrett,turned,away,from,petyr,[END]
he,could,taste,the,bile,in,the,back,of,his,throat,[END]
you,[END]
you,had,no,right,[END]
we,had,a,rope,said,yellow,cloak,[END]
that's,right,enough,[END]
two,of,the,outlaws,seized,merrett's,arms,and,bound,them,tight,behind,his,back,[END]
he,was,too,deep,in,shock,to,struggle,[END]
no,was,all,he,could,manage,[END]
i,only,came,to,ransom,petyr,[END]
you,said,if,you,had,the,gold,by,sunset,he,wouldn't,be,harmed,[END]
well,said,the,singer,you've,got,us,there,my,lord,[END]
that,was,a,lie,of,sorts,as,it,happens,[END]
the,one-eyed,outlaw,came,forward,with,a,long,coil,of,hempen,rope,[END]
he,looped,one,end,around,merrett's,neck,pulled,it,tight,and,tied,a,hard,knot,under,his,ear,[END]
the,other,end,he,threw,over,the,limb,of,the,oak,[END]
the,big,man,in,the,yellow,cloak,caught,it,[END]
what,are,you,doing,[END]
merrett,knew,how,stupid,that,sounded,but,he,could,not,believe,what,was,happening,even,then,[END]
you'd,never,dare,hang,a,frey,[END]
yellow,cloak,laughed,[END]

he,cannot,mean,it,[END]
my,father,will,pay,you,[END]
i'm,worth,a,good,ransom,more,than,petyr,twice,as,much,[END]
the,singer,sighed,[END]
lord,walder,might,be,half-blind,and,gouty,but,he's,not,so,stupid,as,to,snap,at,the,same,bait,twice,[END]
next,time,he'll,send,a,hundred,swords,instead,of,a,hundred,dragons,i,fear,[END]
he,will,[END]
merrett,tried,to,sound,stern,but,his,voice,betrayed,him,[END]
he'll,send,a,thousand,swords,and,kill,you,all,[END]
he,has,to,catch,us,first,[END]
the,singer,glanced,up,at,poor,petyr,[END]
and,he,can't,hang,us,twice,now,can,he,[END]
he,drew,a,melancholy,air,from,the,strings,of,his,woodharp,[END]
here,now,don't,soil,yourself,[END]
all,you,need,to,do,is,answer,me,a,question,and,i'll,tell,them,to,let,you,go,[END]

what,do,you,want,to,know,[END]
i'll,tell,you,true,i,swear,it,[END]
the,outlaw,gave,him,an,encouraging,smile,[END]

a,dog,[END]
merrett,was,lost,[END]

the,red,wedding,[END]
merrett's,skull,felt,as,if,it,were,about,to,split,but,he,did,his,best,to,recall,[END]
there,had,been,so,much,confusion,but,surely,someone,would,have,mentioned,joffrey's,dog,sniffing,round,the,twins,[END]
he,wasn't,in,the,castle,[END]
not,at,the,main,feast,[END]
he,might,have,been,at,the,bastard,feast,or,in,the,camps,but,[END]
no,someone,would,have,said,[END]
