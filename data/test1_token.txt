prologue,the,night,was,rank,with,the,smell,of,man
the,warg,stopped,beneath,a,tree,and,sniffed,his,grey-brown,fur,dappled,by,shadow
a,sigh,of,piney,wind,brought,the,man-scent,to,him,over,fainter,smells,that,spoke,of,fox,and,hare,seal,and,stag,even,wolf
those,were,man-smells,too,the,warg,knew,the,stink,of,old,skins,dead,and,sour,near,drowned,beneath,the,stronger,scents,of,smoke,and,blood,and,rot
only,man,stripped,the,skins,from,other,beasts,and,wore,their,hides,and,hair
wargs,have,no,fear,of,man,as,wolves,do
hate,and,hunger,coiled,in,his,belly,and,he,gave,a,low,growl,calling,to,his,one-eyed,brother,to,his,small,sly,sister
as,he,raced,through,the,trees,his,packmates,followed,hard,on,his,heels
they,had,caught,the,scent,as,well
as,he,ran,he,saw,through,their,eyes,too,and,glimpsed,himself,ahead
the,breath,of,the,pack,puffed,warm,and,white,from,long,grey,jaws
ice,had,frozen,between,their,paws,hard,as,stone,but,the,hunt,was,on,now,the,prey,ahead
flesh,the,warg,thought,meat
a,man,alone,was,a,feeble,thing
big,and,strong,with,good,sharp,eyes,but,dull,of,ear,and,deaf,to,smells
deer,and,elk,and,even,hares,were,faster,bears,and,boars,fiercer,in,a,fight
but,men,in,packs,were,dangerous
as,the,wolves,closed,on,the,prey,the,warg,heard,the,wailing,of,a,pup,the,crust,of,last,night’s,snow,breaking,under,clumsy,man-paws,the,rattle,of,hardskins,and,the,long,grey,claws,men,carried
swords,a,voice,inside,him,whispered,spears
the,trees,had,grown,icy,teeth,snarling,down,from,the,bare,brown,branches
one,eye,ripped,through,the,undergrowth,spraying,snow
his,packmates,followed
up,a,hill,and,down,the,slope,beyond,until,the,wood,opened,before,them,and,the,men,were,there
one,was,female
the,fur-wrapped,bundle,she,clutched,was,her,pup
leave,her,for,last,the,voice,whispered,the,males,are,the,danger
they,were,roaring,at,each,other,as,men,did,but,the,warg,could,smell,their,terror
one,had,a,wooden,tooth,as,tall,as,he,was
he,flung,it,but,his,hand,was,shaking,and,the,tooth,sailed,high
then,the,pack,was,on,them
his,one-eyed,brother,knocked,the,tooth-thrower,back,into,a,snowdrift,and,tore,his,throat,out,as,he,struggled
his,sister,slipped,behind,the,other,male,and,took,him,from,the,rear
that,left,the,female,and,her,pup,for,him
she,had,a,tooth,too,a,little,one,made,of,bone,but,she,dropped,it,when,the,warg’s,jaws,closed,around,her,leg
as,she,fell,she,wrapped,both,arms,around,her,noisy,pup
underneath,her,furs,the,female,was,just,skin,and,bones,but,her,dugs,were,full,of,milk
the,sweetest,meat,was,on,the,pup
the,wolf,saved,the,choicest,parts,for,his,brother
all,around,the,carcasses,the,frozen,snow,turned,pink,and,red,as,the,pack,filled,its,bellies
leagues,away,in,a,one-room,hut,of,mud,and,straw,with,a,thatched,roof,and,a,smoke,hole,and,a,floor,of,hard-packed,earth,varamyr,shivered,and,coughed,and,licked,his,lips
his,eyes,were,red,his,lips,cracked,his,throat,dry,and,parched,but,the,taste,of,blood,and,fat,filled,his,mouth,even,as,his,swollen,belly,cried,for,nourishment
a,child’s,flesh,he,thought,remembering,bump
human,meat
had,he,sunk,so,low,as,to,hunger,after,human,meat
he,could,almost,hear,haggon,growling,at,him
men,may,eat,the,flesh,of,beasts,and,beasts,the,flesh,of,men,but,the,man,who,eats,the,flesh,of,man,is,an,abomination
abomination
that,had,always,been,haggon’s,favorite,word
abomination,abomination,abomination
to,eat,of,human,meat,was,abomination,to,mate,as,wolf,with,wolf,was,abomination,and,to,seize,the,body,of,another,man,was,the,worst,abomination,of,all
haggon,was,weak,afraid,of,his,own,power
he,died,weeping,and,alone,when,i,ripped,his,second,life,from,him
varamyr,had,devoured,his,heart,himself
he,taught,me,much,and,more,and,the,last,thing,i,learned,from,him,was,the,taste,of,human,flesh
that,was,as,a,wolf,though
he,had,never,eaten,the,meat,of,men,with,human,teeth
he,would,not,grudge,his,pack,their,feast,however
the,wolves,were,as,famished,as,he,was,gaunt,and,cold,and,hungry,and,the,prey,two,men,and,a,woman,a,babe,in,arms,fleeing,from,defeat,to,death
they,would,have,perished,soon,in,any,case,from,exposure,or,starvation
this,way,was,better,quicker
a,mercy
a,mercy,he,said,aloud
his,throat,was,raw,but,it,felt,good,to,hear,a,human,voice,even,his,own
the,air,smelled,of,mold,and,damp,the,ground,was,cold,and,hard,and,his,fire,was,giving,off,more,smoke,than,heat
he,moved,as,close,to,the,flames,as,he,dared,coughing,and,shivering,by,turns,his,side,throbbing,where,his,wound,had,opened
blood,had,soaked,his,breeches,to,the,knee,and,dried,into,a,hard,brown,crust
thistle,had,warned,him,that,might,happen
i,sewed,it,up,the,best,i,could,she’d,said,but,you,need,to,rest,and,let,it,mend,or,the,flesh,will,tear,open,again
thistle,had,been,the,last,of,his,companions,a,spearwife,tough,as,an,old,root,warty,windburnt,and,wrinkled
the,others,had,deserted,them,along,the,way
one,by,one,they,fell,behind,or,forged,ahead,making,for,their,old,villages,or,the,milkwater,or,hardhome,or,a,lonely,death,in,the,woods
varamyr,did,not,know,and,could,not,care
i,should,have,taken,one,of,them,when,i,had,the,chance
one,of,the,twins,or,the,big,man,with,the,scarred,face,or,the,youth,with,the,red,hair
he,had,been,afraid,though
one,of,the,others,might,have,realized,what,was,happening
then,they,would,have,turned,on,him,and,killed,him
and,haggon’s,words,had,haunted,him,and,so,the,chance,had,passed
after,the,battle,there,had,been,thousands,of,them,struggling,through,the,forest,hungry,frightened,fleeing,the,carnage,that,had,descended,on,them,at,the,wall
some,had,talked,of,returning,to,the,homes,that,they’d,abandoned,others,of,mounting,a,second,assault,upon,the,gate,but,most,were,lost,with,no,notion,of,where,to,go,or,what,to,do
they,had,escaped,the,black-cloaked,crows,and,the,knights,in,their,grey,steel,but,more,relentless,enemies,stalked,them,now
every,day,left,more,corpses,by,the,trails
some,died,of,hunger,some,of,cold,some,of,sickness
others,were,slain,by,those,who,had,been,their,brothersin-arms,when,they,marched,south,with,mance,rayder,the,king-beyond-the-wall
mance,is,fallen,the,survivors,told,each,other,in,despairing,voices,mance,is,taken,mance,is,dead
harma’s,dead,and,mance,is,captured,the,rest,run,off,and,left,us,thistle,had,claimed,as,she,was,sewing,up,his,wound
tormund,the,weeper,sixskins,all,them,brave,raiders
where,are,they,now
she,does,not,know,me,varamyr,realized,then,and,why,should,she
without,his,beasts,he,did,not,look,like,a,great,man
i,was,varamyr,sixskins,who,broke,bread,with,mance,rayder
he,had,named,himself,varamyr,when,he,was,ten
a,name,fit,for,a,lord,a,name,for,songs,a,mighty,name,and,fearsome
yet,he,had,run,from,the,crows,like,a,frightened,rabbit
the,terrible,lord,varamyr,had,gone,craven,but,he,could,not,bear,that,she,should,know,that,so,he,told,the,spearwife,that,his,name,was,haggon
afterward,he,wondered,why,that,name,had,come,to,his,lips,of,all,those,he,might,have,chosen
i,ate,his,heart,and,drank,his,blood,and,still,he,haunts,me
one,day,as,they,fled,a,rider,came,galloping,through,the,woods,on,a,gaunt,white,horse,shouting,that,they,all,should,make,for,the,milkwater,that,the,weeper,was,gathering,warriors,to,cross,the,bridge,of,skulls,and,take,the,shadow,tower
many,followed,him,more,did,not
later,a,dour,warrior,in,fur,and,amber,went,from,cookfire,to,cookfire,urging,all,the,survivors,to,head,north,and,take,refuge,in,the,valley,of,the,thenns
why,he,thought,they,would,be,safe,there,when,the,thenns,themselves,had,fled,the,place,varamyr,never,learned,but,hundreds,followed,him
hundreds,more,went,off,with,the,woods,witch,who’d,had,a,vision,of,a,fleet,of,ships,coming,to,carry,the,free,folk,south
we,must,seek,the,sea,cried,mother,mole,and,her,followers,turned,east
varamyr,might,have,been,amongst,them,if,only,he’d,been,stronger
the,sea,was,grey,and,cold,and,far,away,though,and,he,knew,that,he,would,never,live,to,see,it
he,was,nine,times,dead,and,dying,and,this,would,be,his,true,death
a,squirrel-skin,cloak,he,remembered,he,knifed,me,for,a,squirrel-skin,cloak
its,owner,had,been,dead,the,back,of,her,head,smashed,into,red,pulp,flecked,with,bits,of,bone,but,her,cloak,looked,warm,and,thick
it,was,snowing,and,varamyr,had,lost,his,own,cloaks,at,the,wall
his,sleeping,pelts,and,woolen,smallclothes,his,sheepskin,boots,and,fur-lined,gloves,his,store,of,mead,and,hoarded,food,the,hanks,of,hair,he,took,from,the,women,he,bedded,even,the,golden,arm,rings,mance,had,given,him,all,lost,and,left,behind
i,burned,and,i,died,and,then,i,ran,half-mad,with,pain,and,terror
the,memory,still,shamed,him,but,he,had,not,been,alone
others,had,run,as,well,hundreds,of,them,thousands
the,battle,was,lost
the,knights,had,come,invincible,in,their,steel,killing,everyone,who,stayed,to,fight
it,was,run,or,die
death,was,not,so,easily,outrun,however
so,when,varamyr,came,upon,the,dead,woman,in,the,wood,he,knelt,to,strip,the,cloak,from,her,and,never,saw,the,boy,until,he,burst,from,hiding,to,drive,the,long,bone,knife,into,his,side,and,rip,the,cloak,out,of,his,clutching,fingers
his,mother,thistle,told,him,later,after,the,boy,had,run,off
it,were,his,mother’s,cloak,and,when,he,saw,you,robbing,her,she,was,dead,varamyr,said,wincing,as,her,bone,needle,pierced,his,flesh
someone,smashed,her,head
some,crow
no,crow
hornfoot,men
i,saw,it
her,needle,pulled,the,gash,in,his,side,closed
savages,and,who’s,left,to,tame,them
no,one
if,mance,is,dead,the,free,folk,are,doomed
the,thenns,giants,and,the,hornfoot,men,the,cave-dwellers,with,their,filed,teeth,and,the,men,of,the,western,shore,with,their,chariots,of,bone,all,of,them,were,doomed,as,well
even,the,crows
they,might,not,know,it,yet,but,those,black-cloaked,bastards,would,perish,with,the,rest
the,enemy,was,coming
haggon’s,rough,voice,echoed,in,his,head
you,will,die,a,dozen,deaths,boy,and,every,one,will,hurt,but,when,your,true,death,comes,you,will,live,again
the,second,life,is,simpler,and,sweeter,they,say
varamyr,sixskins,would,know,the,truth,of,that,soon,enough
he,could,taste,his,true,death,in,the,smoke,that,hung,acrid,in,the,air,feel,it,in,the,heat,beneath,his,fingers,when,he,slipped,a,hand,under,his,clothes,to,touch,his,wound
the,chill,was,in,him,too,though,deep,down,in,his,bones
this,time,it,would,be,cold,that,killed,him
his,last,death,had,been,by,fire
i,burned
at,first,in,his,confusion,he,thought,some,archer,on,the,wall,had,pierced,him,with,a,flaming,arrow,but,the,fire,had,been,inside,him,consuming,him
and,the,pain,varamyr,had,died,nine,times,before
he,had,died,once,from,a,spear,thrust,once,with,a,bear’s,teeth,in,his,throat,and,once,in,a,wash,of,blood,as,he,brought,forth,a,stillborn,cub
he,died,his,first,death,when,he,was,only,six,as,his,father’s,axe,crashed,through,his,skull
even,that,had,not,been,so,agonizing,as,the,fire,in,his,guts,crackling,along,his,wings,devouring,him
when,he,tried,to,fly,from,it,his,terror,fanned,the,flames,and,made,them,burn,hotter
one,moment,he,had,been,soaring,above,the,wall,his,eagle’s,eyes,marking,the,movements,of,the,men,below
then,the,flames,had,turned,his,heart,into,a,blackened,cinder,and,sent,his,spirit,screaming,back,into,his,own,skin,and,for,a,little,while,he’d,gone,mad
even,the,memory,was,enough,to,make,him,shudder
that,was,when,he,noticed,that,his,fire,had,gone,out
only,a,grey-and-black,tangle,of,charred,wood,remained,with,a,few,embers,glowing,in,the,ashes
there’s,still,smoke,it,just,needs,wood
gritting,his,teeth,against,the,pain,varamyr,crept,to,the,pile,of,broken,branches,thistle,had,gathered,before,she,went,off,hunting,and,tossed,a,few,sticks,onto,the,ashes
catch,he,croaked
burn
he,blew,upon,the,embers,and,said,a,wordless,prayer,to,the,nameless,gods,of,wood,and,hill,and,field
the,gods,gave,no,answer
after,a,while,the,smoke,ceased,to,rise,as,well
already,the,little,hut,was,growing,colder
varamyr,had,no,flint,no,tinder,no,dry,kindling
he,would,never,get,the,fire,burning,again,not,by,himself
thistle,he,called,out,his,voice,hoarse,and,edged,with,pain
thistle
her,chin,was,pointed,and,her,nose,flat,and,she,had,a,mole,on,one,cheek,with,four,dark,hairs,growing,from,it
an,ugly,face,and,hard,yet,he,would,have,given,much,to,glimpse,it,in,the,door,of,the,hut
i,should,have,taken,her,before,she,left
how,long,had,she,been,gone
two,days
three
varamyr,was,uncertain
it,was,dark,inside,the,hut,and,he,had,been,drifting,in,and,out,of,sleep,never,quite,sure,if,it,was,day,or,night,outside
wait,she’d,said
i,will,be,back,with,food
so,like,a,fool,he’d,waited,dreaming,of,haggon,and,bump,and,all,the,wrongs,he,had,done,in,his,long,life,but,days,and,nights,had,passed,and,thistle,had,not,returned
she,won’t,be,coming,back
varamyr,wondered,if,he,had,given,himself,away
could,she,tell,what,he,was,thinking,just,from,looking,at,him,or,had,he,muttered,in,his,fever,dream
abomination,he,heard,haggon,saying
it,was,almost,as,if,he,were,here,in,this,very,room
she,is,just,some,ugly,spearwife,varamyr,told,him
i,am,a,great,man
i,am,varamyr,the,warg,the,skinchanger,it,is,not,right,that,she,should,live,and,i,should,die
no,one,answered
there,was,no,one,there
thistle,was,gone
she,had,abandoned,him,the,same,as,all,the,rest
his,own,mother,had,abandoned,him,as,well
she,cried,for,bump,but,she,never,cried,for,me
the,morning,his,father,pulled,him,out,of,bed,to,deliver,him,to,haggon,she,would,not,even,look,at,him
he,had,shrieked,and,kicked,as,he,was,dragged,into,the,woods,until,his,father,slapped,him,and,told,him,to,be,quiet
you,belong,with,your,own,kind,was,all,he,said,when,he,flung,him,down,at,haggon’s,feet
he,was,not,wrong,varamyr,thought,shivering
haggon,taught,me,much,and,more
he,taught,me,how,to,hunt,and,fish,how,to,butcher,a,carcass,and,bone,a,fish,how,to,find,my,way,through,the,woods
and,he,taught,me,the,way,of,the,warg,and,the,secrets,of,the,skinchanger,though,my,gift,was,stronger,than,his,own
years,later,he,had,tried,to,find,his,parents,to,tell,them,that,their,lump,had,become,the,great,varamyr,sixskins,but,both,of,them,were,dead,and,burned
gone,into,the,trees,and,streams,gone,into,the,rocks,and,earth
gone,to,dirt,and,ashes
that,was,what,the,woods,witch,told,his,mother,the,day,bump,died
lump,did,not,want,to,be,a,clod,of,earth
the,boy,had,dreamed,of,a,day,when,bards,would,sing,of,his,deeds,and,pretty,girls,would,kiss,him
when,i,am,grown,i,will,be,the,king-beyond-the-wall,lump,had,promised,himself
he,never,had,but,he,had,come,close
varamyr,sixskins,was,a,name,men,feared
he,rode,to,battle,on,the,back,of,a,snow,bear,thirteen,feet,tall,kept,three,wolves,and,a,shadowcat,in,thrall,and,sat,at,the,right,hand,of,mance,rayder
it,was,mance,who,brought,me,to,this,place
i,should,not,have,listened
i,should,have,slipped,inside,my,bear,and,torn,him,to,pieces
before,mance,varamyr,sixskins,had,been,a,lord,of,sorts
he,lived,alone,in,a,hall,of,moss,and,mud,and,hewn,logs,that,had,once,been,haggon’s,attended,by,his,beasts
a,dozen,villages,did,him,homage,in,bread,and,salt,and,cider,offering,him,fruit,from,their,orchards,and,vegetables,from,their,gardens
his,meat,he,got,himself
whenever,he,desired,a,woman,he,sent,his,shadowcat,to,stalk,her,and,whatever,girl,he’d,cast,his,eye,upon,would,follow,meekly,to,his,bed
some,came,weeping,aye,but,still,they,came
varamyr,gave,them,his,seed,took,a,hank,of,their,hair,to,remember,them,by,and,sent,them,back
from,time,to,time,some,village,hero,would,come,with,spear,in,hand,to,slay,the,beastling,and,save,a,sister,or,a,lover,or,a,daughter
those,he,killed,but,he,never,harmed,the,women
some,he,even,blessed,with,children
runts
small,puny,things,like,lump,and,not,one,with,the,gift
fear,drove,him,to,his,feet,reeling
holding,his,side,to,staunch,the,seep,of,blood,from,his,wound,varamyr,lurched,to,the,door,and,swept,aside,the,ragged,skin,that,covered,it,to,face,a,wall,of,white
snow
no,wonder,it,had,grown,so,dark,and,smoky,inside
the,falling,snow,had,buried,the,hut
when,varamyr,pushed,at,it,the,snow,crumbled,and,gave,way,still,soft,and,wet
outside,the,night,was,white,as,death,pale,thin,clouds,danced,attendance,on,a,silver,moon,while,a,thousand,stars,watched,coldly
he,could,see,the,humped,shapes,of,other,huts,buried,beneath,drifts,of,snow,and,beyond,them,the,pale,shadow,of,a,weirwood,armored,in,ice
to,the,south,and,west,the,hills,were,a,vast,white,wilderness,where,nothing,moved,except,the,blowing,snow
thistle,varamyr,called,feebly,wondering,how,far,she,could,have,gone
thistle
woman
where,are,you
far,away,a,wolf,gave,howl
a,shiver,went,through,varamyr
he,knew,that,howl,as,well,as,lump,had,once,known,his,mother’s,voice
one,eye
he,was,the,oldest,of,his,three,the,biggest,the,fiercest
stalker,was,leaner,quicker,younger,sly,more,cunning,but,both,went,in,fear,of,one,eye
the,old,wolf,was,fearless,relentless,savage
varamyr,had,lost,control,of,his,other,beasts,in,the,agony,of,the,eagle’s,death
his,shadowcat,had,raced,into,the,woods,whilst,his,snow,bear,turned,her,claws,on,those,around,her,ripping,apart,four,men,before,falling,to,a,spear
she,would,have,slain,varamyr,had,he,come,within,her,reach
the,bear,hated,him,had,raged,each,time,he,wore,her,skin,or,climbed,upon,her,back
his,wolves,though,my,brothers
my,pack
many,a,cold,night,he,had,slept,with,his,wolves,their,shaggy,bodies,piled,up,around,him,to,help,keep,him,warm
when,i,die,they,will,feast,upon,my,flesh,and,leave,only,bones,to,greet,the,thaw,come,spring
the,thought,was,queerly,comforting
his,wolves,had,often,foraged,for,him,as,they,roamed,it,seemed,only,fitting,that,he,should,feed,them,in,the,end
he,might,well,begin,his,second,life,tearing,at,the,warm,dead,flesh,of,his,own,corpse
dogs,were,the,easiest,beasts,to,bond,with,they,lived,so,close,to,men,that,they,were,almost,human
slipping,into,a,dog’s,skin,was,like,putting,on,an,old,boot,its,leather,softened,by,wear
as,a,boot,was,shaped,to,accept,a,foot,a,dog,was,shaped,to,accept,a,collar,even,a,collar,no,human,eye,could,see
wolves,were,harder
a,man,might,befriend,a,wolf,even,break,a,wolf,but,no,man,could,truly,tame,a,wolf
wolves,and,women,wed,for,life,haggon,often,said
you,take,one,that’s,a,marriage
the,wolf,is,part,of,you,from,that,day,on,and,you’re,part,of,him
both,of,you,will,change

not,all,skinchangers,felt,the,same,however
once,when,lump,was,ten,haggon,had,taken,him,to,a,gathering,of,such
the,wargs,were,the,most,numerous,in,that,company,the,wolf-brothers,but,the,boy,had,found,the,others,stranger,and,more,fascinating

greyskin,made,four,though,the,old,wolf,was,frail,and,almost,toothless,and,soon,followed,haggon,into,death
varamyr,could,take,any,beast,he,wanted,bend,them,to,his,will,make,their,flesh,his,own
dog,or,wolf,bear,or,badger,thistle,he,thought
haggon,would,call,it,an,abomination,the,blackest,sin,of,all,but,haggon,was,dead,devoured,and,burned
mance,would,have,cursed,him,as,well,but,mance,was,slain,or,captured
no,one,will,ever,know
i,will,be,thistle,the,spearwife,and,varamyr,sixskins,will,be,dead
his,gift,would,perish,with,his,body,he,expected
he,would,lose,his,wolves,and,live,out,the,rest,of,his,days,as,some,scrawny,warty,woman,but,he,would,live
if,she,comes,back
if,i,am,still,strong,enough,to,take,her
a,wave,of,dizziness,washed,over,varamyr
he,found,himself,upon,his,knees,his,hands,buried,in,a,snowdrift
he,scooped,up,a,fistful,of,snow,and,filled,his,mouth,with,it,rubbing,it,through,his,beard,and,against,his,cracked,lips,sucking,down,the,moisture
the,water,was,so,cold,that,he,could,barely,bring,himself,to,swallow,and,he,realized,once,again,how,hot,he,was
the,snowmelt,only,made,him,hungrier
it,was,food,his,belly,craved,not,water
the,snow,had,stopped,falling,but,the,wind,was,rising,filling,the,air,with,crystal,slashing,at,his,face,as,he,struggled,through,the,drifts,the,wound,in,his,side,opening,and,closing,again
his,breath,made,a,ragged,white,cloud
when,he,reached,the,weirwood,tree,he,found,a,fallen,branch,just,long,enough,to,use,as,a,crutch
leaning,heavily,upon,it,he,staggered,toward,the,nearest,hut
perhaps,the,villagers,had,forgotten,something,when,they,fled,a,sack,of,apples,some,dried,meat,anything,to,keep,him,alive,until,thistle,returned
he,was,almost,there,when,his,crutch,snapped,beneath,his,weight,and,his,legs,went,out,from,under,him
how,long,he,sprawled,there,with,his,blood,reddening,the,snow,varamyr,could,not,have,said
the,snow,will,bury,me
it,would,be,a,peaceful,death
they,say,you,feel,warm,near,the,end,warm,and,sleepy
it,would,be,good,to,feel,warm,again,though,it,made,him,sad,to,think,that,he,would,never,see,the,green,lands,the,warm,lands,beyond,the,wall,that,mance,used,to,sing,about
the,world,beyond,the,wall,is,not,for,our,kind,haggon,used,to,say
the,free,folk,fear,skinchangers,but,they,honor,us,as,well
south,of,the,wall,the,kneelers,hunt,us,down,and,butcher,us,like,pigs
you,warned,me,varamyr,thought,but,it,was,you,who,showed,me,eastwatch,too
he,could,not,have,been,more,than,ten
haggon,traded,a,dozen,strings,of,amber,and,a,sled,piled,high,with,pelts,for,six,skins,of,wine,a,block,of,salt,and,a,copper,kettle
eastwatch,was,a,better,place,to,trade,than,castle,black,that,was,where,the,ships,came,laden,with,goods,from,the,fabled,lands,beyond,the,sea
the,crows,knew,haggon,as,a,hunter,and,a,friend,to,the,night’s,watch,and,welcomed,the,news,he,brought,of,life,beyond,their,wall
some,knew,him,for,a,skinchanger,too,but,no,one,spoke,of,that
it,was,there,at,eastwatchby-the-sea,that,the,boy,he’d,been,first,began,to,dream,of,the,warm,south
varamyr,could,feel,the,snowflakes,melting,on,his,brow
this,is,not,so,bad,as,burning
let,me,sleep,and,never,wake,let,me,begin,my,second,life
his,wolves,were,close,now
he,could,feel,them
he,would,leave,this,feeble,flesh,behind,become,one,with,them,hunting,the,night,and,howling,at,the,moon
the,warg,would,become,a,true,wolf
which,though
not,sly
haggon,would,have,called,it,abomination,but,varamyr,had,often,slipped,inside,her,skin,as,she,was,being,mounted,by,one,eye
he,did,not,want,to,spend,his,new,life,as,a,bitch,though,not,unless,he,had,no,other,choice
stalker,might,suit,him,better,the,younger,male,though,one,eye,was,larger,and,fiercer,and,it,was,one,eye,who,took,sly,whenever,she,went,into,heat
they,say,you,forget,haggon,had,told,him,a,few,weeks,before,his,own,death
when,the,man’s,flesh,dies,his,spirit,lives,on,inside,the,beast,but,every,day,his,memory,fades,and,the,beast,becomes,a,little,less,a,warg,a,little,more,a,wolf,until,nothing,of,the,man,is,left,and,only,the,beast,remains
varamyr,knew,the,truth,of,that
when,he,claimed,the,eagle,that,had,been,orell’s,he,could,feel,the,other,skinchanger,raging,at,his,presence
orell,had,been,slain,by,the,turncloak,crow,jon,snow,and,his,hate,for,his,killer,had,been,so,strong,that,varamyr,found,himself,hating,the,beastling,boy,as,well
he,had,known,what,snow,was,the,moment,he,saw,that,great,white,direwolf,stalking,silent,at,his,side
one,skinchanger,can,always,sense,another
mance,should,have,let,me,take,the,direwolf
there,would,be,a,second,life,worthy,of,a,king
he,could,have,done,it,he,did,not,doubt
the,gift,was,strong,in,snow,but,the,youth,was,untaught,still,fighting,his,nature,when,he,should,have,gloried,in,it
varamyr,could,see,the,weirwood’s,red,eyes,staring,down,at,him,from,the,white,trunk
the,gods,are,weighing,me
a,shiver,went,through,him
he,had,done,bad,things,terrible,things
he,had,stolen,killed,raped
he,had,gorged,on,human,flesh,and,lapped,the,blood,of,dying,men,as,it,gushed,red,and,hot,from,their,torn,throats
he,had,stalked,foes,through,the,woods,fallen,on,them,as,they,slept,clawed,their,entrails,from,their,bellies,and,scattered,them,across,the,muddy,earth
how,sweet,their,meat,had,tasted
that,was,the,beast,not,me,he,said,in,a,hoarse,whisper
that,was,the,gift,you,gave,me
the,gods,made,no,reply
his,breath,hung,pale,and,misty,in,the,air
he,could,feel,ice,forming,in,his,beard
varamyr,sixskins,closed,his,eyes
he,dreamt,an,old,dream,of,a,hovel,by,the,sea,three,dogs,whimpering,a,woman’s,tears
bump
she,weeps,for,bump,but,she,never,wept,for,me
lump,had,been,born,a,month,before,his,proper,time,and,he,was,sick,so,often,that,no,one,expected,him,to,live
his,mother,waited,until,he,was,almost,four,to,give,him,a,proper,name,and,by,then,it,was,too,late
the,whole,village,had,taken,to,calling,him,lump,the,name,his,sister,meha,had,given,him,when,he,was,still,in,their,mother’s,belly
meha,had,given,bump,his,name,as,well,but,lump’s,little,brother,had,been,born,in,his,proper,time,big,and,red,and,robust,sucking,greedily,at,mother’s,teats
she,was,going,to,name,him,after,father
bump,died,though
he,died,when,he,was,two,and,i,was,six,three,days,before,his,nameday
your,little,one,is,with,the,gods,now,the,woods,witch,told,his,mother,as,she,wept
he’ll,never,hurt,again,never,hunger,never,cry
the,gods,have,taken,him,down,into,the,earth,into,the,trees
the,gods,are,all,around,us,in,the,rocks,and,streams,in,the,birds,and,beasts
your,bump,has,gone,to,join,them
he’ll,be,the,world,and,all,that’s,in,it
the,old,woman’s,words,had,gone,through,lump,like,a,knife
bump,sees
he,is,watching,me
he,knows
lump,could,not,hide,from,him,could,not,slip,behind,his,mother’s,skirts,or,run,off,with,the,dogs,to,escape,his,father’s,fury
the,dogs
loptail,sniff,the,growler
they,were,good,dogs
they,were,my,friends
when,his,father,found,the,dogs,sniffing,round,bump’s,body,he,had,no,way,of,knowing,which,had,done,it,so,he,took,his,axe,to,all,three
his,hands,shook,so,badly,that,it,took,two,blows,to,silence,sniff,and,four,to,put,the,growler,down
the,smell,of,blood,hung,heavy,in,the,air,and,the,sounds,the,dying,dogs,had,made,were,terrible,to,hear,yet,loptail,still,came,when,father,called,him
he,was,the,oldest,dog,and,his,training,overcame,his,terror
by,the,time,lump,slipped,inside,his,skin,it,was,too,late
no,father,please,he,tried,to,say,but,dogs,cannot,speak,the,tongues,of,men,so,all,that,emerged,was,a,piteous,whine
the,axe,crashed,into,the,middle,of,the,old,dog’s,skull,and,inside,the,hovel,the,boy,let,out,a,scream
that,was,how,they,knew
two,days,later,his,father,dragged,him,into,the,woods
he,brought,his,axe,so,lump,thought,he,meant,to,put,him,down,the,same,way,he,had,done,the,dogs
instead,he’d,given,him,to,haggon
varamyr,woke,suddenly,violently,his,whole,body,shaking
get,up,a,voice,was,screaming,get,up,we,have,to,go
there,are,hundreds,of,them
the,snow,had,covered,him,with,a,stiff,white,blanket
so,cold
when,he,tried,to,move,he,found,that,his,hand,was,frozen,to,the,ground
he,left,some,skin,behind,when,he,tore,it,loose
get,up,she,screamed,again,they’re,coming
thistle,had,returned,to,him
she,had,him,by,the,shoulders,and,was,shaking,him,shouting,in,his,face
varamyr,could,smell,her,breath,and,feel,the,warmth,of,it,upon,cheeks,gone,numb,with,cold
now,he,thought,do,it,now,or,die
he,summoned,all,the,strength,still,in,him,leapt,out,of,his,own,skin,and,forced,himself,inside,her
thistle,arched,her,back,and,screamed
abomination
was,that,her,or,him,or,haggon
he,never,knew
his,old,flesh,fell,back,into,the,snowdrift,as,her,fingers,loosened
the,spearwife,twisted,violently,shrieking
his,shadowcat,used,to,fight,him,wildly,and,the,snow,bear,had,gone,half-mad,for,a,time,snapping,at,trees,and,rocks,and,empty,air,but,this,was,worse
get,out,get,out
he,heard,her,own,mouth,shouting
her,body,staggered,fell,and,rose,again,her,hands,flailed,her,legs,jerked,this,way,and,that,in,some,grotesque,dance,as,his,spirit,and,her,own,fought,for,the,flesh
she,sucked,down,a,mouthful,of,the,frigid,air,and,varamyr,had,half,a,heartbeat,to,glory,in,the,taste,of,it,and,the,strength,of,this,young,body,before,her,teeth,snapped,together,and,filled,his,mouth,with,blood
she,raised,her,hands,to,his,face
he,tried,to,push,them,down,again,but,the,hands,would,not,obey,and,she,was,clawing,at,his,eyes
abomination,he,remembered,drowning,in,blood,and,pain,and,madness
when,he,tried,to,scream,she,spat,their,tongue,out
the,white,world,turned,and,fell,away
for,a,moment,it,was,as,if,he,were,inside,the,weirwood,gazing,out,through,carved,red,eyes,as,a,dying,man,twitched,feebly,on,the,ground,and,a,madwoman,danced,blind,and,bloody,underneath,the,moon,weeping,red,tears,and,ripping,at,her,clothes
then,both,were,gone,and,he,was,rising,melting,his,spirit,borne,on,some,cold,wind
he,was,in,the,snow,and,in,the,clouds,he,was,a,sparrow,a,squirrel,an,oak
a,horned,owl,flew,silently,between,his,trees,hunting,a,hare,varamyr,was,inside,the,owl,inside,the,hare,inside,the,trees

his,wolves,would,save,him,he,told,himself
that,was,his,last,thought,as,a,man
true,death,came,suddenly,he,felt,a,shock,of,cold,as,if,he,had,been,plunged,into,the,icy,waters,of,a,frozen,lake
then,he,found,himself,rushing,over,moonlit,snows,with,his,packmates,close,behind,him
half,the,world,was,dark
one,eye,he,knew
he,bayed,and,sly,and,stalker,gave,echo

if,i,had,not,loosed,he,would,have,seen,my,threats,were,empty
he,would,have,taken,the,crossbow,from,my,hands,as,once,he,took,tysha,from,my,arms
he,was,rising,when,i,killed,him
i,killed,shae,too,he,confessed,to,varys
you,knew,what,she,was
i,did
but,i,never,knew,what,he,was
varys,tittered
and,now,you,do
i,should,have,killed,the,eunuch,as,well
a,little,more,blood,on,his,hands,what,would,it,matter
he,could,not,say,what,had,stayed,his,dagger
not,gratitude
varys,had,saved,him,from,a,headsman’s,sword,but,only,because,jaime,had,compelled,him
jaime,no,better,not,to,think,of,jaime
he,found,a,fresh,skin,of,wine,instead,and,sucked,at,it,as,if,it,were,a,woman’s,breast
the,sour,red,ran,down,his,chin,and,soaked,through,his,soiled,tunic,the,same,one,he,had,been,wearing,in,his,cell
the,deck,was,swaying,beneath,his,feet,and,when,he,tried,to,rise,it,lifted,sideways,and,smashed,him,hard,against,a,bulkhead
a,storm,he,realized,or,else,i,am,even,drunker,than,i,knew
he,retched,the,wine,up,and,lay,in,it,a,while,wondering,if,the,ship,would,sink
is,this,your,vengeance,father
has,the,father,above,made,you,his,hand
such,are,the,wages,of,the,kinslayer,he,said,as,the,wind,howled,outside
it,did,not,seem,fair,to,drown,the,cabin,boy,and,the,captain,and,all,the,rest,for,something,he,had,done,but,when,had,the,gods,ever,been,fair
and,around,about,then,the,darkness,gulped,him,down
when,he,stirred,again,his,head,felt,like,to,burst,and,the,ship,was,spinning,round,in,dizzy,circles,though,the,captain,was,insisting,that,they’d,come,to,port
tyrion,told,him,to,be,quiet,and,kicked,feebly,as,a,huge,bald,sailor,tucked,him,under,one,arm,and,carried,him,squirming,to,the,hold,where,an,empty,wine,cask,awaited,him
it,was,a,squat,little,cask,and,a,tight,fit,even,for,a,dwarf
tyrion,pissed,himself,in,his,struggles,for,all,the,good,it,did
he,was,crammed,face-first,into,the,cask,with,his,knees,pushed,up,against,his,ears
the,stub,of,his,nose,itched,horribly,but,his,arms,were,pinned,so,tightly,that,he,could,not,reach,to,scratch,it
a,palanquin,fit,for,a,man,of,my,stature,he,thought,as,they,hammered,shut,the,lid
he,could,hear,voices,shouting,as,he,was,hoisted,up
every,bounce,cracked,his,head,against,the,bottom,of,the,cask
the,world,went,round,and,round,as,the,cask,rolled,downward,then,stopped,with,a,crash,that,made,him,want,to,scream
another,cask,slammed,into,his,and,tyrion,bit,his,tongue
that,was,the,longest,journey,he,had,ever,taken,though,it,could,not,have,lasted,more,than,half,an,hour
he,was,lifted,and,lowered,rolled,and,stacked,upended,and,righted,and,rolled,again
through,the,wooden,staves,he,heard,men,shouting,and,once,a,horse,whickered,nearby
his,stunted,legs,began,to,cramp,and,soon,hurt,so,badly,that,he,forgot,the,hammering,in,his,head
it,ended,as,it,had,begun,with,another,roll,that,left,him,dizzy,and,more,jouncing
outside,strange,voices,were,speaking,in,a,tongue,he,did,not,know
someone,started,pounding,on,the,top,of,the,cask,and,the,lid,cracked,open,suddenly
light,came,flooding,in,and,cool,air,as,well
tyrion,gasped,greedily,and,tried,to,stand,but,only,managed,to,knock,the,cask,over,sideways,and,spill,himself,out,onto,a,hard-packed,earthen,floor
above,him,loomed,a,grotesque,fat,man,with,a,forked,yellow,beard,holding,a,wooden,mallet,and,an,iron,chisel
his,bedrobe,was,large,enough,to,serve,as,a,tourney,pavilion,but,its,loosely,knotted,belt,had,come,undone,exposing,a,huge,white,belly,and,a,pair,of,heavy,breasts,that,sagged,like,sacks,of,suet,covered,with,coarse,yellow,hair
he,reminded,tyrion,of,a,dead,sea,cow,that,had,once,washed,up,in,the,caverns,under,casterly,rock
the,fat,man,looked,down,and,smiled
a,drunken,dwarf,he,said,in,the,common,tongue,of,westeros
a,rotting,sea,cow
tyrion’s,mouth,was,full,of,blood
he,spat,it,at,the,fat,man’s,feet
they,were,in,a,long,dim,cellar,with,barrel-vaulted,ceilings,its,stone,walls,spotted,with,nitre
casks,of,wine,and,ale,surrounded,them,more,than,enough,drink,to,see,a,thirsty,dwarf,safely,through,the,night
or,through,a,life
you,are,insolent
i,like,that,in,a,dwarf
when,the,fat,man,laughed,his,flesh,bounced,so,vigorously,that,tyrion,was,afraid,he,might,fall,and,crush,him
are,you,hungry,my,little,friend
weary
thirsty
tyrion,struggled,to,his,knees
and,filthy
the,fat,man,sniffed
a,bath,first,just,so
then,food,and,a,soft,bed,yes
my,servants,shall,see,to,it
his,host,put,the,mallet,and,chisel,aside
my,house,is,yours
any,friend,of,my,friend,across,the,water,is,a,friend,to,illyrio,mopatis,yes
and,any,friend,of,varys,the,spider,is,someone,i,will,trust,just,as,far,as,i,can,throw,him
the,fat,man,made,good,on,the,promised,bath,though
no,sooner,did,tyrion,lower,himself,into,the,hot,water,and,close,his,eyes,than,he,was,fast,asleep
he,woke,naked,on,a,goose-down,feather,bed,so,soft,it,felt,as,if,he,had,been,swallowed,by,a,cloud
his,tongue,was,growing,hair,and,his,throat,was,raw,but,his,cock,was,as,hard,as,an,iron,bar
he,rolled,from,the,bed,found,a,chamber,pot,and,commenced,to,filling,it,with,a,groan,of,pleasure
the,room,was,dim,but,there,were,bars,of,yellow,sunlight,showing,between,the,slats,of,the,shutters
tyrion,shook,the,last,drops,off,and,waddled,over,patterned,myrish,carpets,as,soft,as,new,spring,grass
awkwardly,he,climbed,the,window,seat,and,flung,the,shutters,open,to,see,where,varys,and,the,gods,had,sent,him
beneath,his,window,six,cherry,trees,stood,sentinel,around,a,marble,pool,their,slender,branches,bare,and,brown
a,naked,boy,stood,on,the,water,poised,to,duel,with,a,bravo’s,blade,in,hand
he,was,lithe,and,handsome,no,older,than,sixteen,with,straight,blond,hair,that,brushed,his,shoulders
so,lifelike,did,he,seem,that,it,took,the,dwarf,a,long,moment,to,realize,he,was,made,of,painted,marble,though,his,sword,shimmered,like,true,steel
across,the,pool,stood,a,brick,wall,twelve,feet,high,with,iron,spikes,along,its,top
beyond,that,was,the,city
a,sea,of,tiled,rooftops,crowded,close,around,a,bay
he,saw,square,brick,towers,a,great,red,temple,a,distant,manse,upon,a,hill
in,the,far,distance,sunlight,shimmered,off,deep,water
fishing,boats,were,moving,across,the,bay,their,sails,rippling,in,the,wind,and,he,could,see,the,masts,of,larger,ships,poking,up,along,the,shore
surely,one,is,bound,for,dorne,or,for,eastwatch-by-the-sea
he,had,no,means,to,pay,for,passage,though,nor,was,he,made,to,pull,an,oar
i,suppose,i,could,sign,on,as,a,cabin,boy,and,earn,my,way,by,letting,the,crew,bugger,me,up,and,down,the,narrow,sea
he,wondered,where,he,was
even,the,air,smells,different,here
strange,spices,scented,the,chilly,autumn,wind,and,he,could,hear,faint,cries,drifting,over,the,wall,from,the,streets,beyond
it,sounded,something,like,valyrian,but,he,did,not,recognize,more,than,one,word,in,five
not,braavos,he,concluded,nor,tyrosh
those,bare,branches,and,the,chill,in,the,air,argued,against,lys,and,myr,and,volantis,as,well
when,he,heard,the,door,opening,behind,him,tyrion,turned,to,confront,his,fat,host
this,is,pentos,yes
just,so
where,else
pentos
well,it,was,not,king’s,landing,that,much,could,be,said,for,it
where,do,whores,go
he,heard,himself,ask
whores,are,found,in,brothels,here,as,in,westeros
you,will,have,no,need,of,such,my,little,friend
choose,from,amongst,my,servingwomen
none,will,dare,refuse,you
slaves
the,dwarf,asked,pointedly
the,fat,man,stroked,one,of,the,prongs,of,his,oiled,yellow,beard,a,gesture,tyrion,found,remarkably,obscene
slavery,is,forbidden,in,pentos,by,the,terms,of,the,treaty,the,braavosi,imposed,on,us,a,hundred,years,ago
still,they,will,not,refuse,you
illyrio,gave,a,ponderous,half,bow
but,now,my,little,friend,must,excuse,me
i,have,the,honor,to,be,a,magister,of,this,great,city,and,the,prince,has,summoned,us,to,session
he,smiled,showing,a,mouth,full,of,crooked,yellow,teeth
explore,the,manse,and,grounds,as,you,like,but,on,no,account,stray,beyond,the,walls
it,is,best,that,no,man,knows,that,you,were,here
were
have,i,gone,somewhere
time,enough,to,speak,of,that,this,evening
my,little,friend,and,i,shall,eat,and,drink,and,make,great,plans,yes
yes,my,fat,friend,tyrion,replied
he,thinks,to,use,me,for,his,profit
it,was,all,profit,with,the,merchant,princes,of,the,free,cities
spice,soldiers,and,cheese,lords,his,lord,father,called,them,with,contempt
should,a,day,ever,dawn,when,illyrio,mopatis,saw,more,profit,in,a,dead,dwarf,than,a,live,one,tyrion,would,find,himself,packed,into,another,wine,cask,by,dusk
it,would,be,well,if,i,was,gone,before,that,day,arrives
that,it,would,arrive,he,did,not,doubt,cersei,was,not,like,to,forget,him,and,even,jaime,might,be,vexed,to,find,a,quarrel,in,father’s,belly
a,light,wind,was,riffling,the,waters,of,the,pool,below,all,around,the,naked,swordsman
it,reminded,him,of,how,tysha,would,riffle,his,hair,during,the,false,spring,of,their,marriage,before,he,helped,his,father’s,guardsmen,rape,her
he,had,been,thinking,of,those,guardsmen,during,his,flight,trying,to,recall,how,many,there,had,been
you,would,think,he,might,remember,that,but,no
a,dozen
a,score
a,hundred
he,could,not,say
they,had,all,been,grown,men,tall,and,strong,though,all,men,were,tall,to,a,dwarf,of,thirteen,years
tysha,knew,their,number
each,of,them,had,given,her,a,silver,stag,so,she,would,only,need,to,count,the,coins
a,silver,for,each,and,a,gold,for,me
his,father,had,insisted,that,he,pay,her,too
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts
wherever,whores,go,he,heard,lord,tywin,say,once,more,and,once,more,the,bowstring,thrummed
the,magister,had,invited,him,to,explore,the,manse
he,found,clean,clothes,in,a,cedar,chest,inlaid,with,lapis,and,mother-of-pearl
the,clothes,had,been,made,for,a,small,boy,he,realized,as,he,struggled,into,them
the,fabrics,were,rich,enough,if,a,little,musty,but,the,cut,was,too,long,in,the,legs,and,too,short,in,the,arms,with,a,collar,that,would,have,turned,his,face,as,black,as,joffrey’s,had,he,somehow,contrived,to,get,it,fastened
moths,had,been,at,them,too
at,least,they,do,not,stink,of,vomit
tyrion,began,his,explorations,with,the,kitchen,where,two,fat,women,and,a,potboy,watched,him,warily,as,he,helped,himself,to,cheese,bread,and,figs
good,morrow,to,you,fair,ladies,he,said,with,a,bow
do,you,know,where,whores,go
when,they,did,not,respond,he,repeated,the,question,in,high,valyrian,though,he,had,to,say,courtesan,in,place,of,whore
the,younger,fatter,cook,gave,him,a,shrug,that,time
he,wondered,what,they,would,do,if,he,took,them,by,the,hand,and,dragged,them,to,his,bedchamber
none,will,dare,refuse,you,illyrio,claimed,but,somehow,tyrion,did,not,think,he,meant,these,two
the,younger,woman,was,old,enough,to,be,his,mother,and,the,older,was,likely,her,mother
both,were,near,as,fat,as,illyrio,with,teats,that,were,larger,than,his,head
i,could,smother,myself,in,flesh
there,were,worse,ways,to,die
the,way,his,lord,father,had,died,for,one
i,should,have,made,him,shit,a,little,gold,before,expiring
lord,tywin,might,have,been,niggardly,with,his,approval,and,affection,but,he,had,always,been,open-handed,when,it,came,to,coin
the,only,thing,more,pitiful,than,a,dwarf,without,a,nose,is,a,dwarf,without,a,nose,who,has,no,gold
tyrion,left,the,fat,women,to,their,loaves,and,kettles,and,went,in,search,of,the,cellar,where,illyrio,had,decanted,him,the,night,before
it,was,not,hard,to,find
there,was,enough,wine,there,to,keep,him,drunk,for,a,hundred,years,sweet,reds,from,the,reach,and,sour,reds,from,dorne,pale,pentoshi,ambers,the,green,nectar,of,myr,three,score,casks,of,arbor,gold,even,wines,from,the,fabled,east,from,qarth,and,yi,ti,and,asshai,by,the,shadow
in,the,end,tyrion,chose,a,cask,of,strongwine,marked,as,the,private,stock,of,lord,runceford,redwyne,the,grandfather,of,the,present,lord,of,the,arbor
the,taste,of,it,was,languorous,and,heady,on,the,tongue,the,color,a,purple,so,dark,that,it,looked,almost,black,in,the,dim-lit,cellar
tyrion,filled,a,cup,and,a,flagon,for,good,measure,and,carried,them,up,to,the,gardens,to,drink,beneath,those,cherry,trees,he’d,seen
as,it,happened,he,left,by,the,wrong,door,and,never,found,the,pool,he,had,spied,from,his,window,but,it,made,no,matter
the,gardens,behind,the,manse,were,just,as,pleasant,and,far,more,extensive
he,wandered,through,them,for,a,time,drinking
the,walls,would,have,shamed,any,proper,castle,and,the,ornamental,iron,spikes,along,the,top,looked,strangely,naked,without,heads,to,adorn,them
tyrion,pictured,how,his,sister’s,head,might,look,up,there,with,tar,in,her,golden,hair,and,flies,buzzing,in,and,out,of,her,mouth
yes,and,jaime,must,have,the,spike,beside,her,he,decided
no,one,must,ever,come,between,my,brother,and,my,sister
with,a,rope,and,a,grapnel,he,might,be,able,to,get,over,that,wall
he,had,strong,arms,and,he,did,not,weigh,much
he,should,be,able,to,clamber,over,if,he,did,not,impale,himself,on,a,spike
i,will,search,for,a,rope,on,the,morrow,he,resolved
he,saw,three,gates,during,his,wanderings,the,main,entrance,with,its,gatehouse,a,postern,by,the,kennels,and,a,garden,gate,hidden,behind,a,tangle,of,pale,ivy
the,last,was,chained,the,others,guarded
the,guards,were,plump,their,faces,as,smooth,as,babies’,bottoms,and,every,man,of,them,wore,a,spiked,bronze,cap
tyrion,knew,eunuchs,when,he,saw,them
he,knew,their,sort,by,reputation
they,feared,nothing,and,felt,no,pain,it,was,said,and,were,loyal,to,their,masters,unto,death
i,could,make,good,use,of,a,few,hundred,of,mine,own,he,reflected
a,pity,i,did,not,think,of,that,before,i,became,a,beggar
he,walked,along,a,pillared,gallery,and,through,a,pointed,arch,and,found,himself,in,a,tiled,courtyard,where,a,woman,was,washing,clothes,at,a,well
she,looked,to,be,his,own,age,with,dull,red,hair,and,a,broad,face,dotted,by,freckles
would,you,like,some,wine
he,asked,her
she,looked,at,him,uncertainly
i,have,no,cup,for,you,we’ll,have,to,share
the,washerwoman,went,back,to,wringing,out,tunics,and,hanging,them,to,dry
tyrion,settled,on,a,stone,bench,with,his,flagon
tell,me,how,far,should,i,trust,magister,illyrio
the,name,made,her,look,up
that,far
chuckling,he,crossed,his,stunted,legs,and,took,a,drink
i,am,loath,to,play,whatever,part,the,cheesemonger,has,in,mind,for,me,yet,how,can,i,refuse,him
the,gates,are,guarded
perhaps,you,might,smuggle,me,out,under,your,skirts
i’d,be,so,grateful,why,i’ll,even,wed,you
i,have,two,wives,already,why,not,three
ah,but,where,would,we,live
he,gave,her,as,pleasant,a,smile,as,a,man,with,half,a,nose,could,manage
i,have,a,niece,in,sunspear,did,i,tell,you
i,could,make,rather,a,lot,of,mischief,in,dorne,with,myrcella
i,could,set,my,niece,and,nephew,at,war,wouldn’t,that,be,droll
the,washerwoman,pinned,up,one,of,illyrio’s,tunics,large,enough,to,double,as,a,sail
i,should,be,ashamed,to,think,such,evil,thoughts,you’re,quite,right
better,if,i,sought,the,wall,instead
all,crimes,are,wiped,clean,when,a,man,joins,the,night’s,watch,they,say
though,i,fear,they,would,not,let,me,keep,you,sweetling
no,women,in,the,watch,no,sweet,freckly,wives,to,warm,your,bed,at,night,only,cold,winds,salted,cod,and,small,beer
do,you,think,i,might,stand,taller,in,black,my,lady
he,filled,his,cup,again
what,do,you,say
north,or,south
shall,i,atone,for,old,sins,or,make,some,new,ones
the,washerwoman,gave,him,one,last,glance,picked,up,her,basket,and,walked,away
i,cannot,seem,to,hold,a,wife,for,very,long,tyrion,reflected
somehow,his,flagon,had,gone,dry
perhaps,i,should,stumble,back,down,to,the,cellars
the,strongwine,was,making,his,head,spin,though,and,the,cellar,steps,were,very,steep
where,do,whores,go
he,asked,the,wash,flapping,on,the,line
perhaps,he,should,have,asked,the,washerwoman
not,to,imply,that,you’re,a,whore,my,dear,but,perhaps,you,know,where,they,go
or,better,yet,he,should,have,asked,his,father
wherever,whores,go,lord,tywin,said
she,loved,me
she,was,a,crofter’s,daughter,she,loved,me,and,she,wed,me,she,put,her,trust,in,me
the,empty,flagon,slipped,from,his,hand,and,rolled,across,the,yard
tyrion,pushed,himself,off,the,bench,and,went,to,fetch,it
as,he,did,he,saw,some,mushrooms,growing,up,from,a,cracked,paving,tile
pale,white,they,were,with,speckles,and,red-ribbed,undersides,dark,as,blood
the,dwarf,snapped,one,off,and,sniffed,it
delicious,he,thought,and,deadly
there,were,seven,of,the,mushrooms
perhaps,the,seven,were,trying,to,tell,him,something
he,picked,them,all,snatched,a,glove,down,from,the,line,wrapped,them,carefully,and,stuffed,them,down,his,pocket
the,effort,made,him,dizzy,so,afterward,he,crawled,back,onto,the,bench,curled,up,and,shut,his,eyes
when,he,woke,again,he,was,back,in,his,bedchamber,drowning,in,the,goose-down,feather,bed,once,more,while,a,blond,girl,shook,his,shoulder
my,lord,she,said,your,bath,awaits
magister,illyrio,expects,you,at,table,within,the,hour
tyrion,propped,himself,against,the,pillows,his,head,in,his,hands
do,i,dream,or,do,you,speak,the,common,tongue
yes,my,lord
i,was,bought,to,please,the,king
she,was,blue-eyed,and,fair,young,and,willowy
i,am,sure,you,did
i,need,a,cup,of,wine
she,poured,for,him
magister,illyrio,said,that,i,am,to,scrub,your,back,and,warm,your,bed
my,name,is,of,no,interest,to,me
do,you,know,where,whores,go
she,flushed
whores,sell,themselves,for,coin
or,jewels,or,gowns,or,castles
but,where,do,they,go
the,girl,could,not,grasp,the,question
is,it,a,riddle,m’lord
i’m,no,good,at,riddles
will,you,tell,me,the,answer
no,he,thought
i,despise,riddles,myself
i,will,tell,you,nothing
do,me,the,same,favor
the,only,part,of,you,that,interests,me,is,the,part,between,your,legs,he,almost,said
the,words,were,on,his,tongue,but,somehow,never,passed,his,lips
she,is,not,shae,the,dwarf,told,himself,only,some,little,fool,who,thinks,i,play,at,riddles
if,truth,be,told,even,her,cunt,did,not,interest,him,much
i,must,be,sick,or,dead
you,mentioned,a,bath
we,must,not,keep,the,great,cheesemonger,waiting
as,he,bathed,the,girl,washed,his,feet,scrubbed,his,back,and,brushed,his,hair
afterward,she,rubbed,sweet-smelling,ointment,into,his,calves,to,ease,the,aches,and,dressed,him,once,again,in,boy’s,clothing,a,musty,pair,of,burgundy,breeches,and,a,blue,velvet,doublet,lined,with,cloth-of-gold
will,my,lord,want,me,after,he,has,eaten
she,asked,as,she,was,lacing,up,his,boots
no

only,if,he,knows,where,whores,go
the,girl’s,mouth,tightened
she,despises,me,he,realized,but,no,more,than,i,despise,myself
that,he,had,fucked,many,a,woman,who,loathed,the,very,sight,of,him,tyrion,lannister,had,no,doubt,but,the,others,had,at,least,the,grace,to,feign,affection
a,little,honest,loathing,might,be,refreshing,like,a,tart,wine,after,too,much,sweet
i,believe,i,have,changed,my,mind,he,told,her

he,gave,her,a,leer,hoping,for,a,taste,of,fear,but,all,she,gave,him,was,revulsion
no,one,fears,a,dwarf
even,lord,tywin,had,not,been,afraid,though,tyrion,had,held,a,crossbow,in,his,hands
do,you,moan,when,you,are,being,fucked
he,asked,the,bedwarmer

illyrio,waved,him,closer
the,dwarf,clambered,up,onto,a,chair
it,was,much,too,big,for,him,a,cushioned,throne,intended,to,accommodate,the,magister’s,massive,buttocks,with,thick,sturdy,legs,to,bear,his,weight
tyrion,lannister,had,lived,all,his,life,in,a,world,that,was,too,big,for,him,but,in,the,manse,of,illyrio,mopatis,the,sense,of,disproportion,assumed,grotesque,dimensions
i,am,a,mouse,in,a,mammoth’s,lair,he,mused,though,at,least,the,mammoth,keeps,a,good,cellar

illyrio,clapped,his,hands,together,and,serving,men,came,running
they,began,with,a,broth,of,crab,and,monkfish,and,cold,egg,lime,soup,as,well
then,came,quails,in,honey,a,saddle,of,lamb,goose,livers,drowned,in,wine,buttered,parsnips,and,suckling,pig
the,sight,of,it,all,made,tyrion,feel,queasy,but,he,forced,himself,to,try,a,spoon,of,soup,for,the,sake,of,politeness,and,once,he,had,tasted,it,he,was,lost
the,cooks,might,be,old,and,fat,but,they,knew,their,business
he,had,never,eaten,so,well,even,at,court
as,he,was,sucking,the,meat,off,the,bones,of,his,quail,he,asked,illyrio,about,the,morning’s,summons

slaver’s,bay,is,a,long,way,from,pentos
tyrion,speared,a,goose,liver,on,the,point,of,his,knife
no,man,is,as,cursed,as,the,kinslayer,he,mused,but,i,could,learn,to,like,this,hell
this,is,so,illyrio,agreed,but,the,world,is,one,great,web,and,a,man,dare,not,touch,a,single,strand,lest,all,the,others,tremble
more,wine
illyrio,popped,a,pepper,into,his,mouth
no,something,better
he,clapped,his,hands,together
at,the,sound,a,serving,man,entered,with,a,covered,dish
he,placed,it,in,front,of,tyrion,and,illyrio,leaned,across,the,table,to,remove,the,lid
mushrooms,the,magister,announced,as,the,smell,wafted,up
kissed,with,garlic,and,bathed,in,butter
i,am,told,the,taste,is,exquisite
have,one,my,friend
have,two
tyrion,had,a,fat,black,mushroom,halfway,to,his,mouth,but,something,in,illyrio’s,voice,made,him,stop,abruptly
after,you,my,lord
he,pushed,the,dish,toward,his,host
no,no
magister,illyrio,pushed,the,mushrooms,back
for,a,heartbeat,it,seemed,as,if,a,mischievous,boy,was,peering,out,from,inside,the,cheesemonger’s,bloated,flesh
after,you
i,insist
cook,made,them,specially,for,you
did,she,indeed
he,remembered,the,cook,the,flour,on,her,hands,heavy,breasts,shot,through,with,dark,blue,veins
that,was,kind,of,her,but,no
tyrion,eased,the,mushroom,back,into,the,lake,of,butter,from,which,it,had,emerged
you,are,too,suspicious
illyrio,smiled,through,his,forked,yellow,beard
oiled,every,morning,to,make,it,gleam,like,gold,tyrion,suspected
are,you,craven
i,had,not,heard,that,of,you
in,the,seven,kingdoms,it,is,considered,a,grave,breach,of,hospitality,to,poison,your,guest,at,supper
here,as,well
illyrio,mopatis,reached,for,his,wine,cup
yet,when,a,guest,plainly,wishes,to,end,his,own,life,why,his,host,must,oblige,him,no
he,took,a,gulp
magister,ordello,was,poisoned,by,a,mushroom,not,half,a,year,ago
the,pain,is,not,so,much,i,am,told
some,cramping,in,the,gut,a,sudden,ache,behind,the,eyes,and,it,is,done
better,a,mushroom,than,a,sword,through,your,neck,is,it,not,so
why,die,with,the,taste,of,blood,in,your,mouth,when,it,could,be,butter,and,garlic
the,dwarf,studied,the,dish,before,him
the,smell,of,garlic,and,butter,had,his,mouth,watering
some,part,of,him,wanted,those,mushrooms,even,knowing,what,they,were
he,was,not,brave,enough,to,take,cold,steel,to,his,own,belly,but,a,bite,of,mushroom,would,not,be,so,hard
that,frightened,him,more,than,he,could,say
you,mistake,me,he,heard,himself,say
is,it,so
i,wonder
if,you,would,sooner,drown,in,wine,say,the,word,and,it,shall,be,done,and,quickly
drowning,cup,by,cup,wastes,time,and,wine,both
you,mistake,me,tyrion,said,again,more,loudly

children,to,raise,lands,to,rule,a,woman,to,love
you,have,nothing,finished,magister,illyrio,but,we,can,change,that
he,plucked,a,mushroom,from,the,butter,and,chewed,it,lustily
delicious
the,mushrooms,are,not,poisoned
tyrion,was,irritated
no
why,should,i,wish,you,ill
magister,illyrio,ate,another
we,must,show,a,little,trust,you,and,i,come,eat
he,clapped,his,hands,again
we,have,work,to,do
my,little,friend,must,keep,his,strength,up

tyrion,refused,the,swan,which,reminded,him,of,a,supper,with,his,sister
he,helped,himself,to,heron,and,herring,though,and,a,few,of,the,sweet,onions
and,the,serving,men,filled,his,wine,cup,anew,each,time,he,emptied,it
you,drink,a,deal,of,wine,for,such,a,little,man
kinslaying,is,dry,work
it,gives,a,man,a,thirst
the,fat,man’s,eyes,glittered,like,the,gemstones,on,his,fingers
there,are,those,in,westeros,who,would,say,that,killing,lord,lannister,was,merely,a,good,beginning
they,had,best,not,say,it,in,my,sister’s,hearing,or,they,will,find,themselves,short,a,tongue
the,dwarf,tore,a,loaf,of,bread,in,half
and,you,had,best,be,careful,what,you,say,of,my,family,magister
kinslayer,or,no,i,am,a,lion,still
that,seemed,to,amuse,the,lord,of,cheese,no,end
he,slapped,a,meaty,thigh,and,said,you,westerosi,are,all,the,same
you,sew,some,beast,upon,a,scrap,of,silk,and,suddenly,you,are,all,lions,or,dragons,or,eagles
i,can,take,you,to,a,real,lion,my,little,friend
the,prince,keeps,a,pride,in,his,menagerie
would,you,like,to,share,a,cage,with,them
the,lords,of,the,seven,kingdoms,did,make,rather,much,of,their,sigils,tyrion,had,to,admit
very,well,he,conceded
a,lannister,is,not,a,lion
yet,i,am,still,my,father’s,son,and,jaime,and,cersei,are,mine,to,kill
how,odd,that,you,should,mention,your,fair,sister,said,illyrio,between,snails
the,queen,has,offered,a,lordship,to,the,man,who,brings,her,your,head,no,matter,how,humble,his,birth
it,was,no,more,than,tyrion,had,expected
if,you,mean,to,take,her,up,on,it,make,her,spread,her,legs,for,you,as,well
the,best,part,of,me,for,the,best,part,of,her,that’s,a,fair,trade
i,would,sooner,have,mine,own,weight,in,gold
the,cheesemonger,laughed,so,hard,that,tyrion,feared,he,was,about,to,rupture
all,the,gold,in,casterly,rock,why,not
the,gold,i,grant,you,the,dwarf,said,relieved,that,he,was,not,about,to,drown,in,a,gout,of,half-digested,eels,and,sweetmeats,but,the,rock,is,mine
just,so
the,magister,covered,his,mouth,and,belched,a,mighty,belch
do,you,think,king,stannis,will,give,it,to,you
i,am,told,he,is,a,great,one,for,the,law
your,brother,wears,the,white,cloak,so,you,are,heir,by,all,the,laws,of,westeros
stannis,might,well,grant,me,casterly,rock,said,tyrion,but,for,the,small,matter,of,regicide,and,kinslaying
for,those,he,would,shorten,me,by,a,head,and,i,am,short,enough,as,i,stand
but,why,would,you,think,i,mean,to,join,lord,stannis
why,else,would,you,go,the,wall
stannis,is,at,the,wall
tyrion,rubbed,at,his,nose
what,in,seven,bloody,hells,is,stannis,doing,at,the,wall
shivering,i,would,think
it,is,warmer,down,in,dorne
perhaps,he,should,have,sailed,that,way
tyrion,was,beginning,to,suspect,that,a,certain,freckled,washerwoman,knew,more,of,the,common,speech,than,she,pretended
my,niece,myrcella,is,in,dorne,as,it,happens
and,i,have,half,a,mind,to,make,her,a,queen
illyrio,smiled,as,his,serving,men,spooned,out,bowls,of,black,cherries,in,sweet,cream,for,them,both
what,has,this,poor,child,done,to,you,that,you,would,wish,her,dead
even,a,kinslayer,is,not,required,to,slay,all,his,kin,said,tyrion,wounded
queen,her,i,said
not,kill,her
the,cheesemonger,spooned,up,cherries
in,volantis,they,use,a,coin,with,a,crown,on,one,face,and,a,death’s-head,on,the,other
yet,it,is,the,same,coin
to,queen,her,is,to,kill,her
dorne,might,rise,for,myrcella,but,dorne,alone,is,not,enough
if,you,are,as,clever,as,our,friend,insists,you,know,this
tyrion,looked,at,the,fat,man,with,new,interest
he,is,right,on,both,counts
to,queen,her,is,to,kill,her
and,i,knew,that
futile,gestures,are,all,that,remain,to,me
this,one,would,make,my,sister,weep,bitter,tears,at,least
magister,illyrio,wiped,sweet,cream,from,his,mouth,with,the,back,of,a,fat,hand
the,road,to,casterly,rock,does,not,go,through,dorne,my,little,friend

the,lord,commander’s,tower,was,a,shell,the,common,hall,a,pile,of,blackened,timbers,and,hardin’s,tower,looked,as,if,the,next,gust,of,wind,would,knock,it,over,though,it,had,looked,that,way,for,years

it’s,so,cold
where,is,the,threeeyed,crow

hodor,walked,with,one,eye,frozen,shut,his,thick,brown,beard,a,tangle,of,hoarfrost,icicles,drooping,from,the,ends,of,his,bushy,mustache
one,gloved,hand,still,clutched,the,rusty,iron,longsword,he,had,taken,from,the,crypts,below,winterfell,and,from,time,to,time,he,would,lash,out,at,a,branch,knocking,loose,a,spray,of,snow
hod-d-ddor,he,would,mutter,his,teeth,chattering
the,sound,was,strangely,reassuring
on,their,journey,from,winterfell,to,the,wall,bran,and,his,companions,had,made,the,miles,shorter,by,talking,and,telling,tales,but,it,was,different,here
even,hodor,felt,it
his,hodors,came,less,often,than,they,had,south,of,the,wall
there,was,a,stillness,to,this,wood,like,nothing,bran,had,ever,known,before
before,the,snows,began,the,north,wind,would,swirl,around,them,and,clouds,of,dead,brown,leaves,would,kick,up,from,the,ground,with,a,faint,small,rustling,sound,that,reminded,him,of,roaches,scurrying,in,a,cupboard,but,now,all,the,leaves,were,buried,under,a,blanket,of,white
from,time,to,time,a,raven,would,fly,overhead,big,black,wings,slapping,against,the,cold,air
elsewise,the,world,was,silent
just,ahead,the,elk,wove,between,the,snowdrifts,with,his,head,down,his,huge,rack,of,antlers,crusted,with,ice
the,ranger,sat,astride,his,broad,back,grim,and,silent
coldhands,was,the,name,that,the,fat,boy,sam,had,given,him,for,though,the,ranger’s,face,was,pale,his,hands,were,black,and,hard,as,iron,and,cold,as,iron,too
the,rest,of,him,was,wrapped,in,layers,of,wool,and,boiled,leather,and,ringmail,his,features,shadowed,by,his,hooded,cloak,and,a,black,woolen,scarf,about,the,lower,half,of,his,face
behind,the,ranger,meera,reed,wrapped,her,arms,around,her,brother,to,shelter,him,from,the,wind,and,cold,with,the,warmth,of,her,own,body
a,crust,of,frozen,snot,had,formed,below,jojen’s,nose,and,from,time,to,time,he,shivered,violently
he,looks,so,small,bran,thought,as,he,watched,him,sway
he,looks,smaller,than,me,now,and,weaker,too,and,i’m,the,cripple

of,late,bran,wore,summer’s,body,more,often,than,his,own,the,wolf,felt,the,bite,of,the,cold,despite,the,thickness,of,his,fur,but,he,could,see,farther,and,hear,better,and,smell,more,than,the,boy,in,the,basket,bundled,up,like,a,babe,in,swaddling,clothes
other,times,when,he,was,tired,of,being,a,wolf,bran,slipped,into,hodor’s,skin,instead
the,gentle,giant,would,whimper,when,he,felt,him,and,thrash,his,shaggy,head,from,side,to,side,but,not,as,violently,as,he,had,the,first,time,back,at,queenscrown
he,knows,it’s,me,the,boy,liked,to,tell,himself
he’s,used,to,me,by,now
even,so,he,never,felt,comfortable,inside,hodor’s,skin
the,big,stableboy,never,understood,what,was,happening,and,bran,could,taste,the,fear,at,the,back,of,his,mouth
it,was,better,inside,summer
i,am,him,and,he,is,me
he,feels,what,i,feel
sometimes,bran,could,sense,the,direwolf,sniffing,after,the,elk,wondering,if,he,could,bring,the,great,beast,down
summer,had,grown,accustomed,to,horses,at,winterfell,but,this,was,an,elk,and,elk,were,prey
the,direwolf,could,sense,the,warm,blood,coursing,beneath,the,elk’s,shaggy,hide
just,the,smell,was,enough,to,make,the,slaver,run,from,between,his,jaws,and,when,it,did,bran’s,mouth,would,water,at,the,thought,of,rich,dark,meat
from,a,nearby,oak,a,raven,quorked,and,bran,heard,the,sound,of,wings,as,another,of,the,big,black,birds,flapped,down,to,land,beside,it
by,day,only,half,a,dozen,ravens,stayed,with,them,flitting,from,tree,to,tree,or,riding,on,the,antlers,of,the,elk
the,rest,of,the,murder,flew,ahead,or,lingered,behind
but,when,the,sun,sank,low,they,would,return,descending,from,the,sky,on,night-black,wings,until,every,branch,of,every,tree,was,thick,with,them,for,yards,around
some,would,fly,to,the,ranger,and,mutter,at,him,and,it,seemed,to,bran,that,he,understood,their,quorks,and,squawks
they,are,his,eyes,and,ears
they,scout,for,him,and,whisper,to,him,of,dangers,ahead,and,behind
as,now
the,elk,stopped,suddenly,and,the,ranger,vaulted,lightly,from,his,back,to,land,in,knee-deep,snow
summer,growled,at,him,his,fur,bristling
the,direwolf,did,not,like,the,way,that,coldhands,smelled

hunters,and,hungry
they,can,smell,how,weak,we,are
often,bran,woke,shivering,hours,before,the,dawn,listening,to,the,sound,of,them,calling,to,one,another,in,the,distance,as,he,waited,for,the,sun,to,rise

he,knows,this,land
jojen’s,eyes,were,a,dark,green,the,color,of,moss,but,heavy,with,a,weariness,that,bran,had,never,seen,in,them,before
the,little,grandfather
south,of,the,wall,the,boy,from,the,crannogs,had,seemed,to,be,wise,beyond,his,years,but,up,here,he,was,as,lost,and,frightened,as,the,rest,of,them
even,so,meera,always,listened,to,him
that,was,still,true
coldhands,slipped,between,the,trees,back,the,way,they’d,come,with,four,ravens,flapping,after,him
meera,watched,him,go,her,cheeks,red,with,cold,breath,puffing,from,her,nostrils
she,pulled,her,hood,back,up,and,gave,the,elk,a,nudge,and,their,trek,resumed
before,they,had,gone,twenty,yards,though,she,turned,to,glance,behind,them,and,said,men,he,says
what,men
does,he,mean,wildlings
why,won’t,he,say
he,said,he’d,go,and,deal,with,them,said,bran
he,said,aye
he,said,he,would,take,us,to,this,three-eyed,crow,too
that,river,we,crossed,this,morning,is,the,same,one,we,crossed,four,days,ago,i,swear
we’re,going,in,circles

there’s,been,too,much,going,around,meera,insisted,and,too,many,secrets
i,don’t,like,it
i,don’t,like,him
and,i,don’t,trust,him
those,hands,of,his,are,bad,enough
he,hides,his,face,and,will,not,speak,a,name

what,is,he
anyone,can,put,on,a,black,cloak
anyone,or,any,thing
he,does,not,eat,he,never,drinks,he,does,not,seem,to,feel,the,cold
it’s,true
bran,had,been,afraid,to,speak,of,it,but,he,had,noticed
whenever,they,took,shelter,for,the,night,while,he,and,hodor,and,the,reeds,huddled,together,for,warmth,the,ranger,kept,apart
sometimes,coldhands,closed,his,eyes,but,bran,did,not,think,he,slept
and,there,was,something,else,the,scarf
bran,glanced,about,uneasily,but,there,was,not,a,raven,to,be,seen
all,the,big,black,birds,had,left,them,when,the,ranger,did
no,one,was,listening
even,so,he,kept,his,voice,low
the,scarf,over,his,mouth,it,never,gets,all,hard,with,ice,like,hodor’s,beard
not,even,when,he,talks
meera,gave,him,a,sharp,look
you’re,right
we’ve,never,seen,his,breath,have,we
no
a,puff,of,white,heralded,each,of,hodor’s,hodors
when,jojen,or,his,sister,spoke,their,words,could,be,seen,too
even,the,elk,left,a,warm,fog,upon,the,air,when,he,exhaled
if,he,does,not,breathe,bran,found,himself,remembering,the,tales,old,nan,had,told,him,when,he,was,a,babe
beyond,the,wall,the,monsters,live,the,giants,and,the,ghouls,the,stalking,shadows,and,the,dead,that,walk,she,would,say,tucking,him,in,beneath,his,scratchy,woolen,blanket,but,they,cannot,pass,so,long,as,the,wall,stands,strong,and,the,men,of,the,night’s,watch,are,true
so,go,to,sleep,my,little,brandon,my,baby,boy,and,dream,sweet,dreams
there,are,no,monsters,here
the,ranger,wore,the,black,of,the,night’s,watch,but,what,if,he,was,not,a,man,at,all
what,if,he,was,some,monster,taking,them,to,the,other,monsters,to,be,devoured
the,ranger,saved,sam,and,the,girl,from,the,wights,bran,said,hesitantly,and,he’s,taking,me,to,the,three-eyed,crow
why,won’t,this,three-eyed,crow,come,to,us
why,couldn’t,he,meet,us,at,the,wall

how,long,can,we,go,on
jojen,coughed
until,we,get,there
they,came,upon,the,promised,lake,not,long,after,and,turned,north,as,the,ranger,had,bid,them
that,was,the,easy,part
the,water,was,frozen,and,the,snow,had,been,falling,for,so,long,that,bran,had,lost,count,of,the,days,turning,the,lake,into,a,vast,white,wilderness
where,the,ice,was,flat,and,the,ground,was,bumpy,the,going,was,easy,but,where,the,wind,had,pushed,the,snow,up,into,ridges,sometimes,it,was,hard,to,tell,where,the,lake,ended,and,the,shore,began
even,the,trees,were,not,as,infallible,a,guide,as,they,might,have,hoped,for,there,were,wooded,islands,in,the,lake,and,wide,areas,ashore,where,no,trees,grew
the,elk,went,where,he,would,regardless,of,the,wishes,of,meera,and,jojen,on,his,back
mostly,he,stayed,beneath,the,trees,but,where,the,shore,curved,away,westward,he,would,take,the,more,direct,path,across,the,frozen,lake,shouldering,through,snowdrifts,taller,than,bran,as,the,ice,crackled,underneath,his,hooves
out,there,the,wind,was,stronger,a,cold,north,wind,that,howled,across,the,lake,knifed,through,their,layers,of,wool,and,leather,and,set,them,all,to,shivering
when,it,blew,into,their,faces,it,would,drive,the,snow,into,their,eyes,and,leave,them,as,good,as,blind
hours,passed,in,silence

bran,had,come,to,dread,that
each,day,seemed,shorter,than,the,last,and,where,the,days,were,cold,the,nights,were,bitter,cruel
meera,halted,them,again
we,should,have,come,on,the,village,by,now
her,voice,sounded,hushed,and,strange
could,we,have,passed,it
bran,asked
i,hope,not
we,need,to,find,shelter,before,nightfall
she,was,not,wrong
jojen’s,lips,were,blue,meera’s,cheeks,dark,red
bran’s,own,face,had,gone,numb
hodor’s,beard,was,solid,ice
snow,caked,his,legs,almost,to,the,knee,and,bran,had,felt,him,stagger,more,than,once
no,one,was,as,strong,as,hodor,no,one
if,even,his,great,strength,was,failing,summer,can,find,the,village,bran,said,suddenly,his,words,misting,in,the,air
he,did,not,wait,to,hear,what,meera,might,say,but,closed,his,eyes,and,let,himself,flow,from,his,broken,body
as,he,slipped,inside,summer’s,skin,the,dead,woods,came,to,sudden,life
where,before,there,had,been,silence,now,he,heard,wind,in,the,trees,hodor’s,breathing,the,elk,pawing,at,the,ground,in,search,of,fodder

over,roots,and,rocks,the,direwolf,sped,through,a,drift,of,old,snow,the,crust,crackling,beneath,his,weight
his,paws,grew,wet,and,cold
the,next,hill,was,covered,with,pines,and,the,sharp,scent,of,their,needles,filled,the,air
when,he,reached,the,top,he,turned,in,a,circle,sniffing,at,the,air,then,raised,his,head,and,howled
the,smells,were,there
mansmells
ashes,bran,thought,old,and,faint,but,ashes
it,was,the,smell,of,burnt,wood,soot,and,charcoal
a,dead,fire
he,shook,the,snow,off,his,muzzle
the,wind,was,gusting,so,the,smells,were,hard,to,follow
the,wolf,turned,this,way,and,that,sniffing
all,around,were,heaps,of,snow,and,tall,trees,garbed,in,white
the,wolf,let,his,tongue,loll,out,between,his,teeth,tasting,the,frigid,air,his,breath,misting,as,snowflakes,melted,on,his,tongue
when,he,trotted,toward,the,scent,hodor,lumbered,after,him,at,once

as,the,first,sliver,of,a,crescent,moon,came,peeking,through,the,clouds,they,finally,stumbled,into,the,village,by,the,lake
they,had,almost,walked,straight,through,it
from,the,ice,the,village,looked,no,different,than,a,dozen,other,spots,along,the,lakeshore
buried,under,drifts,of,snow,the,round,stone,houses,could,just,as,easily,have,been,boulders,or,hillocks,or,fallen,logs,like,the,deadfall,that,jojen,had,mistaken,for,a,building,the,day,before,until,they,dug,down,into,it,and,found,only,broken,branches,and,rotting,logs
the,village,was,empty,abandoned,by,the,wildlings,who,had,once,lived,there,like,all,the,other,villages,they,had,passed
some,had,been,burned,as,if,the,inhabitants,had,wanted,to,make,certain,they,could,not,come,creeping,back,but,this,one,had,been,spared,the,torch
beneath,the,snow,they,found,a,dozen,huts,and,a,longhall,with,its,sod,roof,and,thick,walls,of,rough-hewn,logs

that,proved,a,forlorn,hope
inside,the,longhall,they,found,the,ashes,of,a,fire,floors,of,hard-packed,dirt,a,chill,that,went,bone,deep
but,at,least,they,had,a,roof,above,their,heads,and,log,walls,to,keep,the,wind,off
a,stream,ran,nearby,covered,with,a,film,of,ice
the,elk,had,to,crack,it,with,his,hoof,to,drink

the,female,was,chewing,on,a,leather,boot,that,still,had,half,a,leg,in,it,but,she,let,it,fall,at,his,approach
the,leader,of,the,pack,an,old,male,with,a,grizzled,white,muzzle,and,a,blind,eye,moved,out,to,meet,him,snarling,his,teeth,bared
behind,him,a,younger,male,showed,his,fangs,as,well
the,direwolf’s,pale,yellow,eyes,drank,in,the,sights,around,them
a,nest,of,entrails,coiled,through,a,bush,entangled,with,the,branches
steam,rising,from,an,open,belly,rich,with,the,smells,of,blood,and,meat
a,head,staring,sightlessly,up,at,a,horned,moon,cheeks,ripped,and,torn,down,to,bloody,bone,pits,for,eyes,neck,ending,in,a,ragged,stump

he,was,hungry
the,eyes,of,the,three,wolves,glowed,yellow
the,direwolf,swung,his,head,from,side,to,side,nostrils,flaring,then,bared,his,fangs,in,a,snarl
the,younger,male,backed,away
the,direwolf,could,smell,the,fear,in,him

the,wolf,lapped,at,it,with,his,tongue,licked,the,ragged,eyeless,ruin,of,his,nose,and,cheeks,then,buried,his,muzzle,in,his,neck,and,tore,it,open,gulping,down,a,gobbet,of,sweet,meat

the,litter,was,as,slow,as,it,was,comfortable,however,and,the,dwarf,soon,found,himself,itching,with,impatience
how,many,days,until,we,reach,the,river
he,asked,illyrio,that,evening
at,this,pace,your,queen’s,dragons,will,be,larger,than,aegon’s,three,before,i,can,lay,eyes,upon,them

a,large,dragon,is,more,fearsome,than,a,small,one
the,magister,shrugged
much,as,it,would,please,me,to,welcome,queen,daenerys,to,volantis,i,must,rely,on,you,and,griff,for,that
i,can,serve,her,best,in,pentos,smoothing,the,way,for,her,return
so,long,as,i,am,with,you,though,well,an,old,fat,man,must,have,his,comforts,yes
come,drink,a,cup,of,wine

the,fat,man,dabbed,grease,from,his,lips

next,you,will,be,offering,me,a,suit,of,magic,armor,and,a,palace,in,valyria

the,fat,man,grew,pensive
daenerys,was,half,a,child,when,she,came,to,me,yet,fairer,even,than,my,second,wife,so,lovely,i,was,tempted,to,claim,her,for,myself
such,a,fearful,furtive,thing,however,i,knew,i,should,get,no,joy,from,coupling,with,her
instead,i,summoned,a,bedwarmer,and,fucked,her,vigorously,until,the,madness,passed
if,truth,be,told,i,did,not,think,daenerys,would,survive,for,long,amongst,the,horselords
that,did,not,stop,you,selling,her,to,khal,drogo,dothraki,neither,buy,nor,sell
say,rather,that,her,brother,viserys,gave,her,to,drogo,to,win,the,khal’s,friendship
a,vain,young,man,and,greedy
viserys,lusted,for,his,father’s,throne,but,he,lusted,for,daenerys,too,and,was,loath,to,give,her,up
the,night,before,the,princess,wed,he,tried,to,steal,into,her,bed,insisting,that,if,he,could,not,have,her,hand,he,would,claim,her,maidenhead
had,i,not,taken,the,precaution,of,posting,guards,upon,her,door,viserys,might,have,undone,years,of,planning
he,sounds,an,utter,fool
viserys,was,mad,aerys’s,son,just,so
daenerys,daenerys,is,quite,different
he,popped,a,roasted,lark,into,his,mouth,and,crunched,it,noisily,bones,and,all
the,frightened,child,who,sheltered,in,my,manse,died,on,the,dothraki,sea,and,was,reborn,in,blood,and,fire
this,dragon,queen,who,wears,her,name,is,a,true,targaryen
when,i,sent,ships,to,bring,her,home,she,turned,toward,slaver’s,bay
in,a,short,span,of,days,she,conquered,astapor,made,yunkai,bend,the,knee,and,sacked,meereen
mantarys,will,be,next,if,she,marches,west,along,the,old,valyrian,roads
if,she,comes,by,sea,well,her,fleet,must,take,on,food,and,water,at,volantis
by,land,or,by,sea,there,are,long,leagues,between,meereen,and,volantis,tyrion,observed
five,hundred,fifty,as,the,dragon,flies,through,deserts,mountains,swamps,and,demon-haunted,ruins
many,and,more,will,perish,but,those,who,survive,will,be,stronger,by,the,time,they,reach,volantis,where,they,shall,find,you,and,griff,awaiting,them,with,fresh,forces,and,sufficient,ships,to,carry,them,all,across,the,sea,to,westeros
tyrion,pondered,all,he,knew,of,volantis,oldest,and,proudest,of,the,nine,free,cities
something,was,awry,here
even,with,half,a,nose,he,could,smell,it
it’s,said,there,are,five,slaves,for,every,free,man,in,volantis
why,would,the,triarchs,assist,a,queen,who,smashed,the,slave,trade
he,pointed,at,illyrio
for,that,matter,why,would,you
slavery,may,be,forbidden,by,the,laws,of,pentos,yet,you,have,a,finger,in,that,trade,as,well,and,maybe,a,whole,hand
and,yet,you,conspire,for,the,dragon,queen,and,not,against,her
why
what,do,you,hope,to,gain,from,queen,daenerys
are,we,back,to,that,again
you,are,a,persistent,little,man
illyrio,gave,a,laugh,and,slapped,his,belly
as,you,will
the,beggar,king,swore,that,i,should,be,his,master,of,coin,and,a,lordly,lord,as,well
once,he,wore,his,golden,crown,i,should,have,my,choice,of,castles,even,casterly,rock,if,i,desired
tyrion,snorted,wine,back,up,the,scarred,stump,that,had,been,his,nose
my,father,would,have,loved,to,hear,that
your,lord,father,had,no,cause,for,concern
why,would,i,want,a,rock
my,manse,is,large,enough,for,any,man,and,more,comfortable,than,your,drafty,westerosi,castles
master,of,coin,though,the,fat,man,peeled,another,egg
i,am,fond,of,coins
is,there,any,sound,as,sweet,as,the,clink,of,gold,on,gold
a,sister’s,screams
are,you,quite,certain,that,daenerys,will,make,good,her,brother’s,promises
she,will,or,she,will,not
illyrio,bit,the,egg,in,half
i,told,you,my,little,friend,not,all,that,a,man,does,is,done,for,gain
believe,as,you,wish,but,even,fat,old,fools,like,me,have,friends,and,debts,of,affection,to,repay
liar,thought,tyrion
there,is,something,in,this,venture,worth,more,to,you,than,coin,or,castles
you,meet,so,few,men,who,value,friendship,over,gold,these,days
too,true,the,fat,man,said,deaf,to,the,irony
how,is,it,that,the,spider,became,so,dear,to,you
we,were,young,together,two,green,boys,in,pentos
varys,came,from,myr
so,he,did
i,met,him,not,long,after,he,arrived,one,step,ahead,of,the,slavers
by,day,he,slept,in,the,sewers,by,night,he,prowled,the,rooftops,like,a,cat
i,was,near,as,poor,a,bravo,in,soiled,silks,living,by,my,blade
perhaps,you,chanced,to,glimpse,the,statue,by,my,pool
pytho,malanon,carved,that,when,i,was,six-and-ten
a,lovely,thing,though,now,i,weep,to,see,it
age,makes,ruins,of,us,all
i,am,still,in,mourning,for,my,nose
but,varys,in,myr,he,was,a,prince,of,thieves,until,a,rival,thief,informed,on,him
in,pentos,his,accent,marked,him,and,once,he,was,known,for,a,eunuch,he,was,despised,and,beaten
why,he,chose,me,to,protect,him,i,may,never,know,but,we,came,to,an,arrangement
varys,spied,on,lesser,thieves,and,took,their,takings
i,offered,my,help,to,their,victims,promising,to,recover,their,valuables,for,a,fee
soon,every,man,who,had,suffered,a,loss,knew,to,come,to,me,whilst,city’s,footpads,and,cutpurses,sought,out,varys,half,to,slit,his,throat,the,other,half,to,sell,him,what,they’d,stolen
we,both,grew,rich,and,richer,still,when,varys,trained,his,mice
in,king’s,landing,he,kept,little,birds
mice,we,called,them,then
the,older,thieves,were,fools,who,thought,no,further,than,turning,a,night’s,plunder,into,wine
varys,preferred,orphan,boys,and,young,girls
he,chose,the,smallest,the,ones,who,were,quick,and,quiet,and,taught,them,to,climb,walls,and,slip,down,chimneys
he,taught,them,to,read,as,well
we,left,the,gold,and,gems,for,common,thieves
instead,our,mice,stole,letters,ledgers,charts,later,they,would,read,them,and,leave,them,where,they,lay
secrets,are,worth,more,than,silver,or,sapphires,varys,claimed
just,so
i,grew,so,respectable,that,a,cousin,of,the,prince,of,pentos,let,me,wed,his,maiden,daughter,whilst,whispers,of,a,certain,eunuch’s,talents,crossed,the,narrow,sea,and,reached,the,ears,of,a,certain,king
a,very,anxious,king,who,did,not,wholly,trust,his,son,nor,his,wife,nor,his,hand,a,friend,of,his,youth,who,had,grown,arrogant,and,overproud
i,do,believe,that,you,know,the,rest,of,this,tale,is,that,not,so
much,of,it,tyrion,admitted
i,see,that,you,are,somewhat,more,than,a,cheesemonger,after,all
illyrio,inclined,his,head
you,are,kind,to,say,so,my,little,friend
and,for,my,part,i,see,that,you,are,just,as,quick,as,lord,varys,claimed
he,smiled,showing,all,his,crooked,yellow,teeth,and,shouted,for,another,jar,of,myrish,fire,wine
when,the,magister,drifted,off,to,sleep,with,the,wine,jar,at,his,elbow,tyrion,crept,across,the,pillows,to,work,it,loose,from,its,fleshy,prison,and,pour,himself,a,cup
he,drained,it,down,and,yawned,and,filled,it,once,again
if,i,drink,enough,fire,wine,he,told,himself,perhaps,i’ll,dream,of,dragons
when,he,was,still,a,lonely,child,in,the,depths,of,casterly,rock,he,oft,rode,dragons,through,the,nights,pretending,he,was,some,lost,targaryen,princeling,or,a,valyrian,dragonlord,soaring,high,o’er,fields,and,mountains
once,when,his,uncles,asked,him,what,gift,he,wanted,for,his,nameday,he,begged,them,for,a,dragon
it,wouldn’t,need,to,be,a,big,one
it,could,be,little,like,i,am
his,uncle,gerion,thought,that,was,the,funniest,thing,he,had,ever,heard,but,his,uncle,tygett,said,the,last,dragon,died,a,century,ago,lad
that,had,seemed,so,monstrously,unfair,that,the,boy,had,cried,himself,to,sleep,that,night
yet,if,the,lord,of,cheese,could,be,believed,the,mad,king’s,daughter,had,hatched,three,living,dragons
two,more,than,even,a,targaryen,should,require
tyrion,was,almost,sorry,that,he,had,killed,his,father
he,would,have,enjoyed,seeing,lord,tywin’s,face,when,he,learned,that,there,was,a,targaryen,queen,on,her,way,to,westeros,with,three,dragons,backed,by,a,scheming,eunuch,and,a,cheesemonger,half,the,size,of,casterly,rock
the,dwarf,was,so,stuffed,that,he,had,to,undo,his,belt,and,the,topmost,laces,on,his,breeches
the,boy’s,clothes,his,host,had,dressed,him,in,made,him,feel,like,ten,pounds,of,sausage,in,a,five-pound,skin
if,we,eat,this,way,every,day,i,will,be,the,size,of,illyrio,before,i,meet,this,dragon,queen
outside,the,litter,night,had,fallen
inside,all,was,dark
tyrion,listened,to,illyrio’s,snores,the,creak,of,the,leather,straps,the,slow,clop,clop,of,the,team’s,ironshod,hooves,on,the,hard,valyrian,road,but,his,heart,was,listening,for,the,beat,of,leathern,wings
when,he,woke,dawn,had,come
the,horses,plodded,on,the,litter,creaking,and,swaying,between,them
tyrion,pulled,the,curtain,back,an,inch,to,peer,outside,but,there,was,little,to,see,but,ochre,fields,bare,brown,elms,and,the,road,itself,a,broad,stone,highway,that,ran,straight,as,a,spear,to,the,horizon
he,had,read,about,valyrian,roads,but,this,was,the,first,he,had,seen
the,freehold’s,grasp,had,reached,as,far,as,dragonstone,but,never,to,the,mainland,of,westeros,itself
odd,that
dragonstone,is,no,more,than,a,rock
the,wealth,was,farther,west,but,they,had,dragons
surely,they,knew,that,it,was,there
he,had,drunk,too,much,last,night
his,head,was,pounding,and,even,the,gentle,swaying,of,the,litter,was,enough,to,make,his,gorge,rise,in,his,throat
though,he,said,no,word,of,complaint,his,distress,must,have,been,plain,to,illyrio,mopatis
come,drink,with,me,the,fat,man,said
a,scale,from,the,dragon,that,burned,you,as,they,say
he,poured,for,them,from,a,flagon,of,blackberry,wine,so,sweet,that,it,drew,more,flies,than,honey
tyrion,shooed,them,off,with,the,back,of,his,hand,and,drank,deep
the,taste,was,so,cloying,that,it,was,all,he,could,do,to,keep,it,down
the,second,cup,went,down,easier,however
even,so,he,had,no,appetite,and,when,illyrio,offered,him,a,bowl,of,blackberries,in,cream,he,waved,it,off
i,dreamed,about,the,queen,he,said
i,was,on,my,knees,before,her,swearing,my,allegiance,but,she,mistook,me,for,my,brother,jaime,and,fed,me,to,her,dragons
let,us,hope,this,dream,was,not,prophetic
you,are,a,clever,imp,just,as,varys,said,and,daenerys,will,have,need,of,clever,men,about,her
ser,barristan,is,a,valiant,knight,and,true,but,none,i,think,has,ever,called,him,cunning
knights,know,only,one,way,to,solve,a,problem
they,couch,their,lances,and,charge
a,dwarf,has,a,different,way,of,looking,at,the,world
what,of,you,though
you,are,a,clever,man,yourself
you,flatter,me
illyrio,waggled,his,hand
alas,i,am,not,made,for,travel,so,i,will,send,you,to,daenerys,in,my,stead
you,did,her,grace,a,great,service,when,you,slew,your,father,and,it,is,my,hope,that,you,will,do,her,many,more
daenerys,is,not,the,fool,her,brother,was
she,will,make,good,use,of,you
as,kindling
tyrion,thought,smiling,pleasantly
they,changed,out,teams,only,thrice,that,day,but,seemed,to,halt,twice,an,hour,at,the,least,so,illyrio,could,climb,down,from,the,litter,and,have,himself,a,piss
our,lord,of,cheese,is,the,size,of,an,elephant,but,he,has,a,bladder,like,a,peanut,the,dwarf,mused
during,one,stop,he,used,the,time,to,have,a,closer,look,at,the,road
tyrion,knew,what,he,would,find,not,packed,earth,nor,bricks,nor,cobbles,but,a,ribbon,of,fused,stone,raised,a,half,foot,above,the,ground,to,allow,rainfall,and,snowmelt,to,run,off,its,shoulders
unlike,the,muddy,tracks,that,passed,for,roads,in,the,seven,kingdoms,the,valyrian,roads,were,wide,enough,for,three,wagons,to,pass,abreast,and,neither,time,nor,traffic,marred,them
they,still,endured,unchanging,four,centuries,after,valyria,itself,had,met,its,doom
he,looked,for,ruts,and,cracks,but,found,only,a,pile,of,warm,dung,deposited,by,one,of,the,horses
the,dung,made,him,think,of,his,lord,father
are,you,down,in,some,hell,father
a,nice,cold,hell,where,you,can,look,up,and,see,me,help,restore,mad,aerys’s,daughter,to,the,iron,throne
as,they,resumed,their,journey,illyrio,produced,a,bag,of,roasted,chestnuts,and,began,to,speak,once,more,of,the,dragon,queen
our,last,news,of,queen,daenerys,is,old,and,stale,i,fear
by,now,she,will,have,left,meereen,we,must,assume
she,has,her,host,at,last,a,ragged,host,of,sellswords,dothraki,horselords,and,unsullied,infantry,and,she,will,no,doubt,lead,them,west,to,take,back,her,father’s,throne
magister,illyrio,twisted,open,a,pot,of,garlic,snails,sniffed,at,them,and,smiled
at,volantis,you,will,have,fresh,tidings,of,daenerys,we,must,hope,he,said,as,he,sucked,one,from,its,shell
dragons,and,young,girls,are,both,capricious,and,it,may,be,that,you,will,need,to,adjust,your,plans
griff,will,know,what,to,do
will,you,have,a,snail
the,garlic,is,from,my,own,gardens
i,could,ride,a,snail,and,make,a,better,pace,than,this,litter,of,yours
tyrion,waved,the,dish,away
you,place,a,deal,of,trust,in,this,man,griff
another,friend,of,your,childhood
no
a,sellsword,you,would,call,him,but,westerosi,born
daenerys,needs,men,worthy,of,her,cause
illyrio,raised,a,hand
i,know
sellswords,put,gold,before,honor,’,you,are,thinking
this,man,griff,will,sell,me,to,my,sister,’,not,so
i,trust,griff,as,i,would,trust,a,brother
another,mortal,error
then,i,shall,do,likewise
the,golden,company,marches,toward,volantis,as,we,speak,there,to,await,the,coming,of,our,queen,out,of,the,east
beneath,the,gold,the,bitter,steel
i,had,heard,the,golden,company,was,under,contract,with,one,of,the,free,cities
myr
illyrio,smirked
contracts,can,be,broken
there,is,more,coin,in,cheese,than,i,knew,said,tyrion
how,did,you,accomplish,that
the,magister,waggled,his,fat,fingers
some,contracts,are,writ,in,ink,and,some,in,blood
i,say,no,more
the,dwarf,pondered,that
the,golden,company,was,reputedly,the,finest,of,the,free,companies,founded,a,century,ago,by,bittersteel,a,bastard,son,of,aegon,the,unworthy
when,another,of,aegon’s,great,bastards,tried,to,seize,the,iron,throne,from,his,trueborn,half-brother,bittersteel,joined,the,revolt
daemon,blackfyre,had,perished,on,the,redgrass,field,however,and,his,rebellion,with,him
those,followers,of,the,black,dragon,who,survived,the,battle,yet,refused,to,bend,the,knee,fled,across,the,narrow,sea,among,them,daemon’s,younger,sons,bittersteel,and,hundreds,of,landless,lords,and,knights,who,soon,found,themselves,forced,to,sell,their,swords,to,eat
some,joined,the,ragged,standard,some,the,second,sons,or,maiden’s,men
bittersteel,saw,the,strength,of,house,blackfyre,scattering,to,the,four,winds,so,he,formed,the,golden,company,to,bind,the,exiles,together
from,that,day,to,this,the,men,of,the,golden,company,had,lived,and,died,in,the,disputed,lands,fighting,for,myr,or,lys,or,tyrosh,in,their,pointless,little,wars,and,dreaming,of,the,land,their,fathers,had,lost
they,were,exiles,and,sons,of,exiles,dispossessed,and,unforgiven,yet,formidable,fighters,still
i,admire,your,powers,of,persuasion,tyrion,told,illyrio
how,did,you,convince,the,golden,company,to,take,up,the,cause,of,our,sweet,queen,when,they,have,spent,so,much,of,their,history,fighting,against,the,targaryens
illyrio,brushed,away,the,objection,as,if,it,were,a,fly
black,or,red,a,dragon,is,still,a,dragon
when,maelys,the,monstrous,died,upon,the,stepstones,it,was,the,end,of,the,male,line,of,house,blackfyre
the,cheesemonger,smiled,through,his,forked,beard
and,daenerys,will,give,the,exiles,what,bittersteel,and,the,blackfyres,never,could
she,will,take,them,home
with,fire,and,sword
it,was,the,kind,of,homecoming,that,tyrion,wished,for,as,well
ten,thousand,swords,makes,for,a,princely,gift,i,grant,you
her,grace,should,be,most,pleased
the,magister,gave,a,modest,bob,of,his,head,chins,jiggling
i,would,never,presume,to,say,what,might,please,her,grace
prudent,of,you
tyrion,knew,much,and,more,about,the,gratitude,of,kings
why,should,queens,be,any,different
soon,enough,the,magister,was,fast,asleep,leaving,tyrion,to,brood,alone
he,wondered,what,barristan,selmy,would,think,of,riding,into,battle,with,the,golden,company
during,the,war,of,the,ninepenny,kings,selmy,had,cut,a,bloody,path,through,their,ranks,to,slay,the,last,of,the,blackfyre,pretenders
rebellion,makes,for,queer,bedfellows
and,none,more,queer,than,this,fat,man,and,me
the,cheesemonger,woke,when,they,stopped,to,change,the,horses,and,sent,for,a,fresh,hamper
how,far,have,we,come
the,dwarf,asked,him,as,they,stuffed,themselves,with,cold,capon,and,a,relish,made,of,carrots,raisins,and,bits,of,lime,and,orange
this,is,andalos,my,friend
the,land,your,andals,came,from
they,took,it,from,the,hairy,men,who,were,here,before,them,cousins,to,the,hairy,men,of,ib
the,heart,of,hugor’s,ancient,realm,lies,north,of,us,but,we,are,passing,through,its,southern,marches
in,pentos,these,are,called,the,flatlands
farther,east,stand,the,velvet,hills,whence,we,are,bound
andalos
the,faith,taught,that,the,seven,themselves,had,once,walked,the,hills,of,andalos,in,human,form
the,father,reached,his,hand,into,the,heavens,and,pulled,down,seven,stars,tyrion,recited,from,memory,and,one,by,one,he,set,them,on,the,brow,of,hugor,of,the,hill,to,make,a,glowing,crown
magister,illyrio,gave,him,a,curious,look
i,did,not,dream,my,little,friend,was,so,devout
the,dwarf,shrugged
a,relic,of,my,boyhood
i,knew,i,would,not,make,a,knight,so,i,decided,to,be,high,septon
that,crystal,crown,adds,a,foot,to,a,man’s,height
i,studied,the,holy,books,and,prayed,until,i,had,scabs,on,both,my,knees,but,my,quest,came,to,a,tragic,end
i,reached,that,certain,age,and,fell,in,love
a,maiden
i,know,the,way,of,that
illyrio,thrust,his,right,hand,up,his,left,sleeve,and,drew,out,a,silver,locket
inside,was,a,painted,likeness,of,a,woman,with,big,blue,eyes,and,pale,golden,hair,streaked,by,silver
serra
i,found,her,in,a,lysene,pillow,house,and,brought,her,home,to,warm,my,bed,but,in,the,end,i,wed,her
me,whose,first,wife,had,been,a,cousin,of,the,prince,of,pentos
the,palace,gates,were,closed,to,me,thereafter,but,i,did,not,care
the,price,was,small,enough,for,serra
how,did,she,die
tyrion,knew,that,she,was,dead,no,man,spoke,so,fondly,of,a,woman,who,had,abandoned,him
a,braavosi,trading,galley,called,at,pentos,on,her,way,back,from,the,jade,sea
the,treasure,carried,cloves,and,saffron,jet,and,jade,scarlet,samite,green,silk,and,the,grey,death
we,slew,her,oarsmen,as,they,came,ashore,and,burned,the,ship,at,anchor,but,the,rats,crept,down,the,oars,and,paddled,to,the,quay,on,cold,stone,feet
the,plague,took,two,thousand,before,it,ran,its,course
magister,illyrio,closed,the,locket
i,keep,her,hands,in,my,bedchamber
her,hands,that,were,so,soft,tyrion,thought,of,tysha
he,glanced,out,at,the,fields,where,once,the,gods,had,walked
what,sort,of,gods,make,rats,and,plagues,and,dwarfs
another,passage,from,the,sevenpointed,star,came,back,to,him
the,maid,brought,him,forth,a,girl,as,supple,as,a,willow,with,eyes,like,deep,blue,pools,and,hugor,declared,that,he,would,have,her,for,his,bride
so,the,mother,made,her,fertile,and,the,crone,foretold,that,she,would,bear,the,king,fourand-forty,mighty,sons

and,as,the,sky,turned,a,dusky,purple,the,fat,man,began,to,snore
that,night,tyrion,lannister,dreamed,of,a,battle,that,turned,the,hills,of,westeros,as,red,as,blood
he,was,in,the,midst,of,it,dealing,death,with,an,axe,as,big,as,he,was,fighting,side,by,side,with,barristan,the,bold,and,bittersteel,as,dragons,wheeled,across,the,sky,above,them

tyrion,slept,and,woke,and,slept,again,and,day,and,night,seemed,not,to,matter

that,night,drunker,than,usual,he,broke,into,sudden,song
he,rode,through,the,streets,of,the,city,down,from,his,hill,on,high,o’er,the,wynds,and,the,steps,and,the,cobbles,he,rode,to,a,woman’s,sigh

we,kept,bumping,our,noses,but,when,i,touched,her,tongue,with,mine,she,trembled
tyrion,closed,his,eyes,to,bring,her,face,to,mind,but,instead,he,saw,his,father,squatting,on,a,privy,with,his,bedrobe,hiked,up,about,his,waist

a,hundred
close,enough,thought,quentyn
the,volantenes,were,fond,of,boasting,that,the,hundred,isles,of,braavos,could,be,dropped,into,their,deep,harbor,and,drowned
quentyn,had,never,seen,braavos,but,he,could,believe,it
rich,and,ripe,and,rotted,volantis,covered,the,mouth,of,the,rhoyne,like,a,warm,wet,kiss,stretching,across,hill,and,marsh,on,both,sides,of,the,river

so,many,that,quentyn,seeing,the,port,for,the,first,time,from,the,deck,of,the,meadowlark,had,told,his,friends,that,they,would,only,linger,here,three,days
yet,twenty,days,had,passed,and,here,they,remained,still,shipless
the,captains,of,the,melantine,the,triarch’s,daughter,and,the,mermaid’s,kiss,had,all,refused,them
a,mate,on,the,bold,voyager,had,laughed,in,their,faces
the,master,of,the,dolphin,berated,them,for,wasting,his,time,and,the,owner,of,the,seventh,son,accused,them,of,being,pirates
all,on,the,first,day
only,the,captain,of,the,fawn,had,given,them,reasons,for,his,refusal
it,is,true,that,i,am,sailing,east,he,told,them,over,watered,wine
south,around,valyria,and,thence,into,the,sunrise
we,will,take,on,water,and,provisions,at,new,ghis,then,bend,all,oars,toward,qarth,and,the,jade,gates
every,voyage,has,perils,long,ones,more,than,most
why,should,i,seek,out,more,danger,by,turning,into,slaver’s,bay
the,fawn,is,my,livelihood
i,will,not,risk,her,to,take,three,mad,dornishmen,into,the,middle,of,a,war
quentyn,had,begun,to,think,that,they,might,have,done,better,to,buy,their,own,ship,in,the,planky,town
that,would,have,drawn,unwanted,attention,however
the,spider,had,informers,everywhere,even,in,the,halls,of,sunspear

what,we,do,is,treason,make,no,mistake
trust,only,your,companions,and,do,your,best,to,avoid,attracting,notice
so,gerris,drinkwater,gave,the,captain,of,adventure,his,most,disarming,smile
truth,be,told,i,have,not,kept,count,of,all,the,cowards,who,refused,us,but,at,the,merchant’s,house,i,heard,it,said,that,you,were,a,bolder,sort,of,man,the,sort,who,might,risk,anything,for,sufficient,gold
a,smuggler,quentyn,thought
that,was,how,the,other,traders,styled,adventure’s,master,back,at,the,merchant’s,house
he,is,a,smuggler,and,a,slaver,half,pirate,and,half,pander,but,it,may,be,that,he,is,your,best,hope,the,innkeep,had,told,them
the,captain,rubbed,thumb,and,forefinger,together
and,how,much,gold,would,you,deem,sufficient,for,such,a,voyage
thrice,your,usual,fee,for,passage,to,slaver’s,bay
for,each,of,you
the,captain,showed,his,teeth,in,something,that,might,have,been,intended,as,a,smile,though,it,gave,his,narrow,face,a,feral,look
perhaps
it,is,true,i,am,a,bolder,man,than,most
how,soon,will,you,wish,to,leave
the,morrow,would,not,be,too,soon
done
return,an,hour,before,first,light,with,your,friends,and,your,wines
best,to,be,under,way,whilst,volantis,sleeps,so,no,one,will,ask,us,inconvenient,questions,about,our,destination
as,you,say
an,hour,before,first,light
the,captain’s,smile,widened
i,am,pleased,that,i,can,help,you
we,will,have,a,happy,voyage,yes
i,am,certain,of,it,said,gerris
the,captain,called,for,ale,then,and,the,two,of,them,drank,a,toast,to,their,venture
a,sweet,man,gerris,said,afterward,as,he,and,quentyn,made,their,way,down,to,the,foot,of,the,pier,where,their,hired,hathay,waited
the,air,hung,hot,and,heavy,and,the,sun,was,so,bright,that,both,of,them,were,squinting
this,is,a,sweet,city,quentyn,agreed
sweet,enough,to,rot,your,teeth
sweet,beets,were,grown,in,profusion,hereabouts,and,were,served,with,almost,every,meal
the,volantenes,made,a,cold,soup,of,them,as,thick,and,rich,as,purple,honey
their,wines,were,sweet,as,well
i,fear,our,happy,voyage,will,be,short,however
that,sweet,man,does,not,mean,to,take,us,to,meereen
he,was,too,quick,to,accept,your,offer
he’ll,take,thrice,the,usual,fee,no,doubt,and,once,he,has,us,aboard,and,out,of,sight,of,land,he’ll,slit,our,throats,and,take,the,rest,of,our,gold,as,well
or,chain,us,to,an,oar,beside,those,wretches,we,were,smelling
we,need,to,find,a,better,class,of,smuggler,i,think
their,driver,awaited,them,beside,his,hathay
in,westeros,it,might,have,been,called,an,oxcart,though,it,was,a,deal,more,ornate,than,any,cart,that,quentyn,had,ever,seen,in,dorne,and,lacked,an,ox
the,hathay,was,pulled,by,a,dwarf,elephant,her,hide,the,color,of,dirty,snow
the,streets,of,old,volantis,were,full,of,such
quentyn,would,have,preferred,to,walk,but,they,were,miles,from,their,inn
besides,the,innkeep,at,the,merchant’s,house,had,warned,him,that,traveling,afoot,would,taint,them,in,the,eyes,of,foreign,captains,and,the,native-born,volantenes,alike
persons,of,quality,traveled,by,palanquin,or,in,the,back,of,a,hathay,and,as,it,happened,the,innkeep,had,a,cousin,who,owned,several,such,contrivances,and,would,be,pleased,to,serve,them,in,this,matter
their,driver,was,one,of,the,cousin’s,slaves,a,small,man,with,a,wheel,tattooed,upon,one,cheek,naked,but,for,a,breechclout,and,a,pair,of,sandals
his,skin,was,the,color,of,teak,his,eyes,chips,of,flint
after,he,had,helped,them,up,onto,the,cushioned,bench,between,the,cart’s,two,huge,wooden,wheels,he,clambered,onto,the,elephant’s,back
the,merchant’s,house,quentyn,told,him,but,go,along,the,wharves
beyond,the,waterfront,and,its,breezes,the,streets,and,alleys,of,volantis,were,hot,enough,to,drown,a,man,in,his,own,sweat,at,least,on,this,side,of,the,river
the,driver,shouted,something,at,his,elephant,in,the,local,tongue
the,beast,began,to,move,trunk,swaying,from,side,to,side
the,cart,lurched,along,behind,her,the,driver,hooting,at,sailors,and,slaves,alike,to,clear,the,way
it,was,easy,enough,to,tell,one,from,the,other
the,slaves,were,all,tattooed,a,mask,of,blue,feathers,a,lightning,bolt,that,ran,from,jaw,to,brow,a,coin,upon,the,cheek,a,leopard’s,spots,a,skull,a,jug
maester,kedry,said,there,were,five,slaves,for,every,free,man,in,volantis,though,he,had,not,lived,long,enough,to,verify,his,estimate
he,had,perished,on,the,morning,the,corsairs,swarmed,aboard,the,meadowlark
quentyn,lost,two,other,friends,that,same,day,willam,wells,with,his,freckles,and,his,crooked,teeth,fearless,with,a,lance,and,cletus,yronwood,handsome,despite,his,lazy,eye,always,randy,always,laughing
cletus,had,been,quentyn’s,dearest,friend,for,half,his,life,a,brother,in,all,but,blood
give,your,bride,a,kiss,for,me,cletus,had,whispered,to,him,just,before,he,died
the,corsairs,had,come,aboard,in,the,darkness,before,the,dawn,as,the,meadowlark,was,anchored,off,the,coast,of,the,disputed,lands
the,crew,had,beaten,them,off,at,the,cost,of,twelve,lives
afterward,the,sailors,stripped,the,dead,corsairs,of,boots,and,belts,and,weapons,divvied,up,their,purses,and,yanked,gemstones,from,their,ears,and,rings,from,their,fingers
one,of,the,corpses,was,so,fat,that,the,ship’s,cook,had,to,cut,his,fingers,off,with,a,meat,cleaver,to,claim,his,rings
it,took,three,meadowlarks,to,roll,the,body,into,the,sea
the,other,pirates,were,chucked,in,after,him,without,a,word,of,prayer,or,ceremony
their,own,dead,received,more,tender,treatment
the,sailors,sewed,their,bodies,up,in,canvas,weighed,down,with,ballast,stones,so,they,might,sink,more,quickly
the,captain,of,the,meadowlark,led,his,crew,in,a,prayer,for,the,souls,of,their,slain,shipmates
then,he,turned,to,his,dornish,passengers,the,three,who,still,remained,of,the,six,who,had,come,aboard,at,the,planky,town
even,the,big,man,had,emerged,pale,and,greensick,and,unsteady,on,his,feet,struggling,up,from,the,depths,of,the,ship’s,hold,to,pay,his,last,respects
one,of,you,should,say,some,words,for,your,dead,before,we,give,them,to,the,sea,the,captain,said
gerris,had,obliged,lying,with,every,other,word,since,he,dare,not,tell,the,truth,of,who,they’d,been,or,why,they’d,come
it,was,not,supposed,to,end,like,that,for,them
this,will,be,a,tale,to,tell,our,grandchildren,cletus,had,declared,the,day,they,set,out,from,his,father’s,castle
will,made,a,face,at,that,and,said,a,tale,to,tell,tavern,wenches,you,mean,in,hopes,they’ll,lift,their,skirts
cletus,had,slapped,him,on,the,back
for,grandchildren,you,need,children
for,children,you,need,to,lift,some,skirts
later,in,the,planky,town,the,dornishmen,had,toasted,quentyn’s,future,bride,made,ribald,japes,about,his,wedding,night,to,come,and,talked,about,the,things,they’d,see,the,deeds,they’d,do,the,glory,they,would,win
all,they,won,was,a,sailcloth,sack,filled,with,ballast,stones
as,much,as,he,mourned,will,and,cletus,it,was,the,maester’s,loss,that,quentyn,felt,most,keenly
kedry,had,been,fluent,in,the,tongues,of,all,of,the,free,cities,and,even,the,mongrel,ghiscari,that,men,spoke,along,the,shores,of,slaver’s,bay
maester,kedry,will,accompany,you,his,father,said,the,night,they,parted

he,has,devoted,half,his,life,to,the,study,of,the,nine,free,cities
quentyn,wondered,if,things,might,not,have,gone,a,deal,easier,if,only,he,were,here,to,guide,them
i,would,sell,my,mother,for,a,bit,of,breeze,said,gerris,as,they,rolled,through,the,dockside,throngs

quentyn,shared,the,feeling
the,sullen,wet,heat,of,volantis,sapped,his,strength,and,left,him,feeling,dirty
the,worst,part,was,knowing,that,nightfall,would,bring,no,relief
up,in,the,high,meadows,north,of,lord,yronwood’s,estates,the,air,was,always,crisp,and,cool,after,dark,no,matter,how,hot,the,day,had,been
not,here
in,volantis,the,nights,were,almost,as,hot,as,the,days
the,goddess,sails,for,new,ghis,on,the,morrow,gerris,reminded,him
that,at,least,would,bring,us,closer
new,ghis,is,an,island,and,a,much,smaller,port,than,this
we,would,be,closer,yes,but,we,could,find,ourselves,stranded
and,new,ghis,has,allied,with,the,yunkai’i
that,news,had,not,come,as,a,surprise,to,quentyn
new,ghis,and,yunkai,were,both,ghiscari,cities
if,volantis,should,ally,with,them,as,well,we,need,to,find,a,ship,from,westeros,suggested,gerris,some,trader,out,of,lannisport,or,oldtown
few,come,this,far,and,those,who,do,fill,their,holds,with,silk,and,spice,from,the,jade,sea,then,bend,their,oars,for,home
perhaps,a,braavosi,ship
one,hears,of,purple,sails,as,far,away,as,asshai,and,the,islands,of,the,jade,sea
the,braavosi,are,descended,from,escaped,slaves

the,seas,around,valyria,are,perilous,and,thick,with,corsairs
i,have,had,enough,of,corsairs
let’s,not,buy,a,ship
this,is,still,just,a,game,to,him,quentyn,realized,no,different,than,the,time,he,led,six,of,us,up,into,the,mountains,to,find,the,old,lair,of,the,vulture,king
it,was,not,in,gerris,drinkwater’s,nature,to,imagine,they,might,fail,let,alone,that,they,might,die
even,the,deaths,of,three,friends,had,not,served,to,chasten,him,it,would,seem
he,leaves,that,to,me
he,knows,my,nature,is,as,cautious,as,his,is,bold
perhaps,the,big,man,is,right,ser,gerris,said
piss,on,the,sea,we,can,finish,the,journey,overland
you,know,why,he,says,that,quentyn,said
he’d,rather,die,than,set,foot,on,another,ship
the,big,man,had,been,greensick,every,day,of,their,voyage
in,lys,it,had,taken,him,four,days,to,recover,his,strength
they’d,had,to,take,rooms,in,an,inn,so,maester,kedry,could,tuck,him,into,a,feather,bed,and,feed,him,broths,and,potions,until,some,pink,returned,to,his,cheeks
it,was,possible,to,go,overland,to,meereen,that,much,was,true
the,old,valyrian,roads,would,take,them,there
dragon,roads,men,called,the,great,stone,roadways,of,the,freehold,but,the,one,that,ran,eastward,from,volantis,to,meereen,had,earned,a,more,sinister,name,the,demon,road
the,demon,road,is,dangerous,and,too,slow,quentyn,said
tywin,lannister,will,send,his,own,men,after,the,queen,once,word,of,her,reaches,king’s,landing
his,father,had,been,certain,of,that
his,will,come,with,knives
if,they,reach,her,first,let’s,hope,her,dragons,will,sniff,them,out,and,eat,them,said,gerris
well,if,we,cannot,find,a,ship,and,you,will,not,let,us,ride,we,had,as,well,book,passage,back,to,dorne
crawl,back,to,sunspear,defeated,with,my,tail,between,my,legs
his,father’s,disappointment,would,be,more,than,quentyn,could,bear,and,the,scorn,of,the,sand,snakes,would,be,withering
doran,martell,had,put,the,fate,of,dorne,into,his,hands,he,could,not,fail,him,not,whilst,life,remained
heat,shimmers,rose,off,the,street,as,the,hathay,rattled,and,jounced,along,on,its,ironrimmed,wheels,giving,a,dreamlike,quality,to,their,surroundings

here,were,temples,too,where,sailors,came,to,sacrifice,to,foreign,gods,cheek,by,jowl,with,pillow,houses,where,women,called,down,from,balconies,to,men,below
have,a,look,at,that,one,gerris,urged,as,they,passed,one,pillow,house
i,think,she’s,in,love,with,you
and,how,much,does,a,whore’s,love,cost
truth,be,told,girls,made,quentyn,anxious,especially,the,pretty,ones
when,first,he’d,come,to,yronwood,he,had,been,smitten,with,ynys,the,eldest,of,lord,yronwood’s,daughters
though,he,never,said,a,word,about,his,feelings,he,nursed,his,dreams,for,years,until,the,day,she,was,dispatched,to,wed,ser,ryon,allyrion,the,heir,to,godsgrace
the,last,time,he,had,seen,her,she’d,had,one,boy,at,her,breast,and,another,clinging,to,her,skirts
after,ynys,had,come,the,drinkwater,twins,a,pair,of,tawny,young,maidens,who,loved,hawking,hunting,climbing,rocks,and,making,quentyn,blush
one,of,them,had,given,him,his,first,kiss,though,he,never,knew,which,one
as,daughters,of,a,landed,knight,the,twins,were,too,lowborn,to,marry,but,cletus,did,not,think,that,was,any,reason,to,stop,kissing,them
after,you’re,wed,you,can,take,one,of,them,for,a,paramour
or,both,why,not
but,quentyn,thought,of,several,reasons,why,not,so,he,had,done,his,best,to,avoid,the,twins,thereafter,and,there,had,been,no,second,kiss
more,recently,the,youngest,of,lord,yronwood’s,daughters,had,taken,to,following,him,about,the,castle
gwyneth,was,but,twelve,a,small,scrawny,girl,whose,dark,eyes,and,brown,hair,set,her,apart,in,that,house,of,blue-eyed,blondes
she,was,clever,though,as,quick,with,words,as,with,her,hands,and,fond,of,telling,quentyn,that,he,had,to,wait,for,her,to,flower,so,she,could,marry,him
that,was,before,prince,doran,had,summoned,him,to,the,water,gardens
and,now,the,most,beautiful,woman,in,the,world,was,waiting,in,meereen,and,he,meant,to,do,his,duty,and,claim,her,for,his,bride
she,will,not,refuse,me
she,will,honor,the,agreement
daenerys,targaryen,would,need,dorne,to,win,the,seven,kingdoms,and,that,meant,that,she,would,need,him
it,does,not,mean,that,she,will,love,me,though
she,may,not,even,like,me
the,street,curved,where,the,river,met,the,sea,and,there,along,the,bend,a,number,of,animal,sellers,were,clustered,together,offering,jeweled,lizards,giant,banded,snakes,and,agile,little,monkeys,with,striped,tails,and,clever,pink,hands
perhaps,your,silver,queen,would,like,a,monkey,said,gerris
quentyn,had,no,idea,what,daenerys,targaryen,might,like
he,had,promised,his,father,that,he,would,bring,her,back,to,dorne,but,more,and,more,he,wondered,if,he,was,equal,to,the,task
i,never,asked,for,this,he,thought
across,the,wide,blue,expanse,of,the,rhoyne,he,could,see,the,black,wall,that,had,been,raised,by,the,valyrians,when,volantis,was,no,more,than,an,outpost,of,their,empire,a,great,oval,of,fused,stone,two,hundred,feet,high,and,so,thick,that,six,four-horse,chariots,could,race,around,its,top,abreast,as,they,did,each,year,to,celebrate,the,founding,of,the,city
outlanders,foreigners,and,freedmen,were,not,allowed,inside,the,black,wall,save,at,the,invitation,of,those,who,dwelt,within,scions,of,the,old,blood,who,could,trace,their,ancestry,back,to,valyria,itself
the,traffic,was,thicker,here
they,were,near,the,western,end,of,the,long,bridge,which,linked,the,two,halves,of,the,city
wayns,and,carts,and,hathays,crowded,the,streets,all,of,them,coming,from,the,bridge,or,making,for,it
slaves,were,everywhere,as,numerous,as,roaches,scurrying,about,their,masters’,business
not,far,from,fishermonger’s,square,and,the,merchant’s,house,shouts,erupted,from,a,cross,street,and,a,dozen,unsullied,spearmen,in,ornate,armor,and,tiger-skin,cloaks,appeared,as,if,from,nowhere,waving,everyone,aside,so,the,triarch,could,pass,through,atop,his,elephant
the,triarch’s,elephant,was,a,grey-skinned,behemoth,clad,in,elaborate,enameled,armor,that,clattered,softly,as,he,moved,the,castle,on,its,back,so,tall,that,it,scraped,the,top,of,the,ornamental,stone,arch,he,was,passing,underneath
the,triarchs,are,considered,so,elevated,that,their,feet,are,not,allowed,to,touch,the,ground,during,their,year,of,service,quentyn,informed,his,companion
they,ride,everywhere,on,elephants
blocking,up,the,streets,and,leaving,heaps,of,dung,for,the,likes,of,us,to,contend,with,said,gerris
why,volantis,needs,three,princes,when,dorne,makes,do,with,one,i,will,never,know
the,triarchs,are,neither,kings,nor,princes
volantis,is,a,freehold,like,valyria,of,old
all,freeborn,landholders,share,the,rule
even,women,are,allowed,to,vote,provided,they,own,land
the,three,triarchs,are,chosen,from,amongst,those,noble,families,who,can,prove,unbroken,descent,from,old,valyria,to,serve,until,the,first,day,of,the,new,year
and,you,would,know,all,this,if,you,had,troubled,to,read,the,book,that,maester,kedry,gave,you
it,had,no,pictures
there,were,maps
maps,do,not,count
if,he,had,told,me,it,was,about,tigers,and,elephants,i,might,have,given,it,a,try
it,looked,suspiciously,like,a,history
when,their,hathay,reached,the,edge,of,the,fishermonger’s,square,their,elephant,lifted,her,trunk,and,made,a,honking,noise,like,some,huge,white,goose,reluctant,to,plunge,into,the,tangle,of,wayns,palanquins,and,foot,traffic,ahead
their,driver,prodded,her,with,his,heel,and,kept,her,moving
the,fishmongers,were,out,in,strength,crying,the,morning,catch
quentyn,understood,one,word,in,two,at,best,but,he,did,not,need,to,know,the,words,to,know,the,fish
he,saw,cod,and,sailfish,and,sardines,barrels,of,mussels,and,clams
eels,hung,along,the,front,of,one,stall
another,displayed,a,gigantic,turtle,strung,up,by,its,legs,on,iron,chains,heavy,as,a,horse
crabs,scrabbled,inside,casks,of,brine,and,seaweed
several,of,the,vendors,were,frying,chunks,of,fish,with,onions,and,beets,or,selling,peppery,fish,stew,out,of,small,iron,kettles
in,the,center,of,the,square,under,the,cracked,and,headless,statue,of,a,dead,triarch,a,crowd,had,begun,to,gather,about,some,dwarfs,putting,on,a,show
the,little,men,were,done,up,in,wooden,armor,miniature,knights,preparing,for,a,joust
quentyn,saw,one,mount,a,dog,as,the,other,hopped,onto,a,pig,only,to,slide,right,off,again,to,a,smattering,of,laughter
they,look,amusing,gerris,said
shall,we,stop,and,watch,them,fight
a,laugh,might,serve,you,well,quent
you,look,like,an,old,man,who,has,not,moved,his,bowels,in,half,a,year
i,am,eight-and-ten,six,years,younger,than,you,quentyn,thought
i,am,no,old,man
instead,he,said,i,have,no,need,for,comic,dwarfs
unless,they,have,a,ship
a,small,one,i,would,think
four,stories,tall,the,merchant’s,house,dominated,the,docks,and,wharves,and,storehouses,that,surrounded,it

the,paving,stones,felt,warm,beneath,his,feet,when,quentyn,climbed,down,from,the,hathay,even,through,the,leather,of,his,boots
outside,the,merchant’s,house,a,trestle,table,had,been,set,up,in,the,shade,and,decorated,with,striped,blue-and-white,pennons,that,fluttered,at,every,breath,of,air
four,hard-eyed,sellswords,lounged,around,the,table,calling,out,to,every,passing,man,and,boy
windblown,quentyn,knew
the,serjeants,were,looking,for,fresh,meat,to,fill,their,ranks,before,they,sailed,for,slaver’s,bay
and,every,man,who,signs,with,them,is,another,sword,for,yunkai,another,blade,meant,to,drink,the,blood,of,my,bride-to-be
one,of,the,windblown,shouted,at,them
i,do,not,speak,your,tongue,quentyn,answered
though,he,could,read,and,write,high,valyrian,he,had,little,practice,speaking,it
and,the,volantene,apple,had,rolled,a,fair,distance,from,the,valyrian,tree

the,sellswords,threw,taunts,at,their,backs,as,they,pushed,through,the,doors,of,the,merchant’s,house,mocking,them,as,bloodless,cravens,and,frightened,girls
the,big,man,was,waiting,in,their,rooms,on,the,second,floor
though,the,inn,had,come,well,recommended,by,the,master,of,the,meadowlark,that,did,not,mean,quentyn,was,willing,to,leave,their,goods,and,gold,unguarded

some,childhood,malady,had,made,all,his,hair,fall,out
his,bald,head,reminded,quentyn,of,a,smooth,pink,boulder
so,he,demanded,what,did,the,smuggler,say

a,ship,corrected,quentyn
aye,he’ll,take,us,but,only,as,far,as,the,nearest,hell

the,annals,i’ve,found,and,looked,at,that,is
there’s,more,i,haven’t,found,i,know
some,of,the,older,books,are,falling,to,pieces
the,pages,crumble,when,i,try,and,turn,them
and,the,really,old,books,either,they,have,crumbled,all,away,or,they,are,buried,somewhere,that,i,haven’t,looked,yet,or,well,it,could,be,that,there,are,no,such,books,and,never,were
the,oldest,histories,we,have,were,written,after,the,andals,came,to,westeros
the,first,men,only,left,us,runes,on,rocks,so,everything,we,think,we,know,about,the,age,of,heroes,and,the,dawn,age,and,the,long,night,comes,from,accounts,set,down,by,septons,thousands,of,years,later
there,are,archmaesters,at,the,citadel,who,question,all,of,it
those,old,histories,are,full,of,kings,who,reigned,for,hundreds,of,years,and,knights,riding,around,a,thousand,years,before,there,were,knights
you,know,the,tales,brandon,the,builder,symeon,star-eyes,night’s,king,we,say,that,you’re,the,nine-hundred-and-ninety-eighth,lord,commander,of,the,night’s,watch,but,the,oldest,list,i’ve,found,shows,six,hundred,seventy-four,commanders,which,suggests,that,it,was,written,during,long,ago,jon,broke,in
what,about,the,others
i,found,mention,of,dragonglass
the,children,of,the,forest,used,to,give,the,night’s,watch,a,hundred,obsidian,daggers,every,year,during,the,age,of,heroes
the,others,come,when,it,is,cold,most,of,the,tales,agree
or,else,it,gets,cold,when,they,come
sometimes,they,appear,during,snowstorms,and,melt,away,when,the,skies,clear
they,hide,from,the,light,of,the,sun,and,emerge,by,night,or,else,night,falls,when,they,emerge
some,stories,speak,of,them,riding,the,corpses,of,dead,animals
bears,direwolves,mammoths,horses,it,makes,no,matter,so,long,as,the,beast,is,dead
the,one,that,killed,small,paul,was,riding,a,dead,horse,so,that,part’s,plainly,true
some,accounts,speak,of,giant,ice,spiders,too
i,don’t,know,what,those,are
men,who,fall,in,battle,against,the,others,must,be,burned,or,else,the,dead,will,rise,again,as,their,thralls
we,knew,all,this
the,question,is,how,do,we,fight,them
the,armor,of,the,others,is,proof,against,most,ordinary,blades,if,the,tales,can,be,believed,and,their,own,swords,are,so,cold,they,shatter,steel
fire,will,dismay,them,though,and,they,are,vulnerable,to,obsidian
i,found,one,account,of,the,long,night,that,spoke,of,the,last,hero,slaying,others,with,a,blade,of,dragonsteel
supposedly,they,could,not,stand,against,it
dragonsteel
the,term,was,new,to,jon
valyrian,steel

so,if,i,can,just,convince,the,lords,of,the,seven,kingdoms,to,give,us,their,valyrian,blades,all,is,saved
that,won’t,be,hard
no,harder,than,asking,them,to,give,up,their,coin,and,castles

stones,and,spears,and,pots,of,burning,pitch,could,be,rained,down,on,them,from,above,and,all,they,could,do,was,cling,desperately,to,the,ice
sometimes,the,wall,itself,seemed,to,shake,them,off,as,a,dog,might,shake,off,fleas
jon,had,seen,that,for,himself,when,a,sheet,of,ice,cracked,beneath,val’s,lover,jarl,sending,him,to,his,death

it’s,not,good,to,jape,of,that,one,not,when,we’re,so,near,the,rhoyne

his,grey,kiss
the,thought,made,his,flesh,crawl
death,had,lost,its,terror,for,tyrion,lannister,but,greyscale,was,another,matter
the,shrouded,lord,is,just,a,legend,he,told,himself,no,more,real,than,the,ghost,of,lann,the,clever,that,some,claim,haunts,casterly,rock
even,so,he,held,his,tongue
the,dwarf’s,sudden,silence,went,unnoticed,as,duck,had,begun,to,regale,him,with,his,own,life,story
his,father,had,been,an,armorer,at,bitterbridge,he,said,so,he,had,been,born,with,the,sound,of,steel,ringing,in,his,ears,and,had,taken,to,swordplay,at,an,early,age
such,a,large,and,likely,lad,drew,the,eye,of,old,lord,caswell,who,offered,him,a,place,in,his,garrison,but,the,boy,had,wanted,more
he,watched,caswell’s,weakling,son,named,a,page,a,squire,and,finally,a,knight
a,weedy,pinch-faced,sneak,he,was,but,the,old,lord,had,four,daughters,and,only,the,one,son,so,no,one,was,allowed,to,say,a,word,against,him
t’other,squires,hardly,dared,to,lay,a,finger,on,him,in,the,yard
you,were,not,so,timid,though
tyrion,could,see,where,this,tale,was,going,easily,enough
my,father,made,a,longsword,for,me,to,mark,my,sixteenth,nameday,said,duck,but,lorent,liked,the,look,of,it,so,much,he,took,it,for,himself,and,my,bloody,father,never,dared,to,tell,him,no
when,i,complained,lorent,told,me,to,my,face,that,my,hand,was,made,to,hold,a,hammer,not,a,sword
so,i,went,and,got,a,hammer,and,beat,him,with,it,till,both,his,arms,and,half,his,ribs,were,broken
after,that,i,had,to,leave,the,reach,quick,as,it,were
i,made,it,across,the,water,to,the,golden,company
i,did,some,smithing,for,a,few,years,as,a,’prentice,then,ser,harry,strickland,took,me,on,as,squire
when,griff,sent,word,downriver,that,he,needed,someone,to,help,train,his,son,to,arms,harry,sent,him,me
and,griff,knighted,you
a,year,later
haldon,halfmaester,smiled,a,thin,smile

a,knight,needs,more,than,just,the,one,name,the,big,man,insisted,and,well,we,were,in,a,field,when,he,dubbed,me,and,i,looked,up,and,saw,these,ducks,so,don’t,laugh,now
just,after,sunset,they,left,the,road,to,rest,in,an,overgrown,yard,beside,an,old,stone,well
tyrion,hopped,down,to,work,the,cramps,out,of,his,calves,whilst,duck,and,haldon,were,watering,the,horses
tough,brown,grass,and,weed,trees,sprouted,from,the,gaps,between,the,cobbles,and,the,mossy,walls,of,what,once,might,have,been,a,huge,stone,manse
after,the,animals,had,been,tended,to,the,riders,shared,a,simple,supper,of,salt,pork,and,cold,white,beans,washed,down,with,ale
tyrion,found,the,plain,fare,a,pleasant,change,from,all,the,rich,food,he,had,eaten,with,illyrio
those,chests,we,brought,you,he,said,as,they,were,chewing
gold,for,the,golden,company,i,thought,at,first,until,i,saw,ser,rolly,hoist,a,chest,onto,one,shoulder
if,it,were,full,of,coin,he,could,never,have,lifted,it,so,easily
it’s,just,armor,said,duck,with,a,shrug

come,moonrise,they,were,back,in,their,saddles,trotting,eastward,under,a,mantle,of,stars
the,old,valyrian,road,glimmered,ahead,of,them,like,a,long,silver,ribbon,winding,through,wood,and,dale
for,a,little,while,tyrion,lannister,felt,almost,at,peace
lomas,longstrider,told,it,true
the,road’s,a,wonder
lomas,longstrider
asked,duck
a,scribe,long,dead,said,haldon
he,spent,his,life,traveling,the,world,and,writing,about,the,lands,he,visited,in,two,books,he,called,wonders,and,wonders,made,by,man
an,uncle,of,mine,gave,them,to,me,when,i,was,just,a,boy,said,tyrion
i,read,them,until,they,fell,to,pieces
the,gods,made,seven,wonders,and,mortal,man,made,nine,quoted,the,halfmaester
rather,impious,of,mortal,man,to,do,the,gods,two,better,but,there,you,are
the,stone,roads,of,valyria,were,one,of,longstrider’s,nine
the,fifth,i,believe
the,fourth,said,tyrion,who,had,committed,all,sixteen,of,the,wonders,to,memory,as,a,boy
his,uncle,gerion,liked,to,set,him,on,the,table,during,feasts,and,make,him,recite,them
i,liked,that,well,enough,didn’t,i
standing,there,amongst,the,trenchers,with,every,eye,upon,me,proving,what,a,clever,little,imp,i,was
for,years,afterward,he,had,cherished,a,dream,that,one,day,he,would,travel,the,world,and,see,longstrider’s,wonders,for,himself
lord,tywin,had,put,an,end,to,that,hope,ten,days,before,his,dwarf,son’s,sixteenth,nameday,when,tyrion,asked,to,tour,the,nine,free,cities,as,his,uncles,had,done,at,that,same,age
my,brothers,could,be,relied,upon,to,bring,no,shame,upon,house,lannister,his,father,had,replied
neither,ever,wed,a,whore
and,when,tyrion,had,reminded,him,that,in,ten,days,he,would,be,a,man,grown,free,to,travel,where,he,wished,lord,tywin,had,said,no,man,is,free
only,children,and,fools,think,elsewise
go,by,all,means
wear,motley,and,stand,upon,your,head,to,amuse,the,spice,lords,and,the,cheese,kings
just,see,that,you,pay,your,own,way,and,put,aside,any,thoughts,of,returning
at,that,the,boy’s,defiance,had,crumbled
if,it,is,useful,occupation,you,require,useful,occupation,you,shall,have,his,father,then,said
so,to,mark,his,manhood,tyrion,was,given,charge,of,all,the,drains,and,cisterns,within,casterly,rock
perhaps,he,hoped,i’d,fall,into,one
but,tywin,had,been,disappointed,in,that
the,drains,never,drained,half,so,well,as,when,he,had,charge,of,them
i,need,a,cup,of,wine,to,wash,the,taste,of,tywin,from,my,mouth
a,skin,of,wine,would,serve,me,even,better
they,rode,all,night,with,tyrion,sleeping,fitfully,dozing,against,the,pommel,and,waking,suddenly
from,time,to,time,he,would,begin,to,slip,sideways,from,the,saddle,but,ser,rolly,would,get,a,hand,on,him,and,yank,him,upright,once,again
by,dawn,the,dwarf’s,legs,were,aching,and,his,cheeks,were,chafed,and,raw
it,was,the,next,day,before,they,reached,the,site,of,ghoyan,drohe,hard,beside,the,river
the,fabled,rhoyne,said,tyrion,when,he,glimpsed,the,slow,green,waterway,from,atop,a,rise
the,little,rhoyne,said,duck
it,is,that
a,pleasant,enough,river,i,suppose,but,the,smallest,fork,of,the,trident,is,twice,as,wide,and,all,three,of,them,run,swifter
the,city,was,no,more,impressive
ghoyan,drohe,had,never,been,large,tyrion,recalled,from,his,histories,but,it,had,been,a,fair,place,green,and,flowering,a,city,of,canals,and,fountains
until,the,war
until,the,dragons,came
a,thousand,years,later,the,canals,were,choked,with,reeds,and,mud,and,pools,of,stagnant,water,gave,birth,to,swarms,of,flies
the,broken,stones,of,temples,and,palaces,were,sinking,back,into,the,earth,and,gnarled,old,willows,grew,thick,along,the,riverbanks
a,few,people,still,remained,amidst,the,squalor,tending,little,gardens,in,amongst,the,weeds
the,sound,of,iron,hooves,ringing,on,the,old,valyrian,road,sent,most,of,them,darting,back,into,the,holes,they’d,crawled,from,but,the,bolder,ones,lingered,in,the,sun,long,enough,to,stare,at,the,passing,riders,with,dull,incurious,eyes
one,naked,girl,with,mud,up,to,her,knees,could,not,seem,to,take,her,eyes,off,tyrion
she,has,never,seen,a,dwarf,before,he,realized,much,less,a,dwarf,without,a,nose
he,made,a,face,and,stuck,his,tongue,out,and,the,girl,began,to,cry
what,did,you,do,to,her
duck,asked
i,blew,her,a,kiss
all,the,girls,cry,when,i,kiss,them
beyond,the,tangled,willows,the,road,ended,abruptly,and,they,turned,north,for,a,short,ways,and,rode,beside,the,water,until,the,brush,gave,way,and,they,found,themselves,beside,an,old,stone,quay,half-submerged,and,surrounded,by,tall,brown,weeds
duck
came,a,shout
haldon
tyrion,craned,his,head,to,one,side,and,saw,a,boy,standing,on,the,roof,of,a,low,wooden,building,waving,a,wide-brimmed,straw,hat
he,was,a,lithe,and,well-made,youth,with,a,lanky,build,and,a,shock,of,dark,blue,hair
the,dwarf,put,his,age,at,fifteen,sixteen,or,near,enough,to,make,no,matter
the,roof,the,boy,was,standing,on,turned,out,to,be,the,cabin,of,the,shy,maid,an,old,ramshackle,single-masted,poleboat
she,had,a,broad,beam,and,a,shallow,draft,ideal,for,making,her,way,up,the,smallest,of,streams,and,crabwalking,over,sandbars
a,homely,maid,thought,tyrion,but,sometimes,the,ugliest,ones,are,the,hungriest,once,abed
the,poleboats,that,plied,the,rivers,of,dorne,were,often,brightly,painted,and,exquisitely,carved,but,not,this,maid
her,paintwork,was,a,muddy,greyish,brown,mottled,and,flaking,her,big,curved,tiller,plain,and,unadorned
she,looks,like,dirt,he,thought,but,no,doubt,that’s,the,point
duck,was,hallooing,back,by,then
the,mare,splashed,through,the,shallows,trampling,down,the,reeds
the,boy,leapt,down,off,the,cabin,roof,to,the,poleboat’s,deck,and,the,rest,of,the,shy,maid’s,crew,made,their,appearance
an,older,couple,with,a,rhoynish,cast,to,their,features,stood,close,beside,the,tiller,whilst,a,handsome,septa,in,a,soft,white,robe,stepped,through,the,cabin,door,and,pushed,a,lock,of,dark,brown,hair,from,her,eyes
but,there,was,no,mistaking,griff
that,will,be,enough,shouting,he,said
a,sudden,silence,fell,upon,the,river
this,one,will,be,trouble,tyrion,knew,at,once
griff’s,cloak,was,made,from,the,hide,and,head,of,a,red,wolf,of,the,rhoyne
under,the,pelt,he,wore,brown,leather,stiffened,with,iron,rings
his,clean-shaved,face,was,leathery,too,with,wrinkles,at,the,corners,of,his,eyes
though,his,hair,was,as,blue,as,his,son’s,he,had,red,roots,and,redder,eyebrows
at,his,hip,hung,a,sword,and,dagger
if,he,was,happy,to,have,duck,and,haldon,back,again,he,hid,it,well,but,he,did,not,trouble,to,conceal,his,displeasure,at,the,sight,of,tyrion
a,dwarf
what’s,this
i,know,you,were,hoping,for,a,wheel,of,cheese
tyrion,turned,to,young,griff,and,gave,the,lad,his,most,disarming,smile

they,were,ice,blue,pale,cold
the,dwarf,misliked,pale,eyes

he,hardly,moves,his,lips,at,all,tyrion,reflected
finally,griff,looked,up,from,the,parchment,and,those,pale,eyes,narrowed
tywin,lannister,dead
at,your,hand
at,my,finger
this,one
tyrion,held,it,up,for,griff,to,admire
lord,tywin,was,sitting,on,a,privy,so,i,put,a,crossbow,bolt,through,his,bowels,to,see,if,he,really,did,shit,gold
he,didn’t
a,pity,i,could,have,used,some,gold
i,also,slew,my,mother,somewhat,earlier
oh,and,my,nephew,joffrey,i,poisoned,him,at,his,wedding,feast,and,watched,him,choke,to,death

has,illyrio,taken,leave,of,his,senses
why,does,he,imagine,that,her,grace,would,welcome,the,service,of,a,self-confessed,kingslayer,and,betrayer
a,fair,question,thought,tyrion,but,what,he,said,was,the,king,i,slew,was,sitting,on,her,throne,and,all,those,i,betrayed,were,lions,so,it,seems,to,me,that,i,have,already,done,the,queen,good,service

instead,he,touched,the,letter,to,the,candle,flame,and,watched,the,parchment,blacken,curl,and,flare,up
there,is,blood,between,targaryen,and,lannister
why,would,you,support,the,cause,of,queen,daenerys
for,gold,and,glory,the,dwarf,said,cheerfully
oh,and,hate
if,you,had,ever,met,my,sister,you,would,understand
i,understand,hate,well,enough
from,the,way,griff,said,the,word,tyrion,knew,that,much,was,true
he,has,supped,on,hate,himself,this,one
it,has,warmed,him,in,the,night,for,years
then,we,have,that,in,common,ser
i,am,no,knight
not,only,a,liar,but,a,bad,one
that,was,clumsy,and,stupid,my,lord
and,yet,ser,duck,says,you,knighted,him
duck,talks,too,much
some,might,wonder,that,a,duck,can,talk,at,all
no,matter,griff
you,are,no,knight,and,i,am,hugor,hill,a,little,monster
your,little,monster,if,you,like

i,can,tell,her,grace,how,my,sweet,sister,thinks,if,you,call,it,thinking
i,can,tell,her,captains,the,best,way,to,defeat,my,brother,jaime,in,battle

ysilla,will,find,bedding,for,you
how,kind,of,her
tyrion,made,a,waddling,bow,but,at,the,cabin,door,he,turned,back
what,if,we,should,find,the,queen,and,discover,that,this,talk,of,dragons,was,just,some,sailor’s,drunken,fancy
this,wide,world,is,full,of,such,mad,tales
grumkins,and,snarks,ghosts,and,ghouls,mermaids,rock,goblins,winged,horses,winged,pigs,winged,lions
griff,stared,at,him,frowning
i,have,given,you,fair,warning,lannister
guard,your,tongue,or,lose,it
kingdoms,are,at,hazard,here
our,lives,our,names,our,honor
this,is,no,game,we’re,playing,for,your,amusement
of,course,it,is,thought,tyrion
the,game,of,thrones
as,you,say,captain,he,murmured,bowing,once,again
davos,lightning,split,the,northern,sky,etching,the,black,tower,of,the,night,lamp,against,the,blue-white,sky
six,heartbeats,later,came,the,thunder,like,a,distant,drum
the,guards,marched,davos,seaworth,across,a,bridge,of,black,basalt,and,under,an,iron,portcullis,showing,signs,of,rust
beyond,lay,a,deep,salt,moat,and,a,drawbridge,supported,by,a,pair,of,massive,chains
green,waters,surged,below,sending,up,plumes,of,spray,to,smash,against,the,foundations,of,the,castle
then,came,a,second,gatehouse,larger,than,the,first,its,stones,bearded,with,green,algae
davos,stumbled,across,a,muddy,yard,with,his,hands,bound,at,the,wrists
a,cold,rain,stung,his,eyes
the,guards,prodded,him,up,the,steps,into,breakwater’s,cavernous,stone,keep
once,inside,the,captain,removed,his,cloak,and,hung,it,from,a,peg,so,as,not,to,leave,puddles,on,the,threadbare,myrish,carpet
davos,did,the,same,fumbling,at,the,clasp,with,his,bound,hands
he,had,not,forgotten,the,courtesies,he,had,learned,on,dragonstone,during,his,years,of,service
they,found,the,lord,alone,in,the,gloom,of,his,hall,making,a,supper,of,beer,and,bread,and,sister’s,stew
twenty,iron,sconces,were,mounted,along,his,thick,stone,walls,but,only,four,held,torches,and,none,of,them,was,lit
two,fat,tallow,candles,gave,a,meagre,flickering,light
davos,could,hear,the,rain,lashing,at,the,walls,and,a,steady,dripping,where,the,roof,had,sprung,a,leak
m’lord,said,the,captain,we,found,this,man,in,the,belly,o’,the,whale,trying,to,buy,his,way,off,island
he,had,twelve,dragons,on,him,and,this,thing,too
the,captain,put,it,on,the,table,by,the,lord,a,wide,ribbon,of,black,velvet,trimmed,with,cloth-of-gold,and,bearing,three,seals,a,crowned,stag,stamped,in,golden,beeswax,a,flaming,heart,in,red,a,hand,in,white
davos,waited,wet,and,dripping,his,wrists,chafing,where,the,wet,rope,dug,into,his,skin
one,word,from,this,lord,and,he,would,soon,be,hanging,from,the,gallows,gate,of,sisterton,but,at,least,he,was,out,of,the,rain,with,solid,stone,beneath,his,feet,in,place,of,a,heaving,deck
he,was,soaked,and,sore,and,haggard,worn,thin,by,grief,and,betrayal,and,sick,to,death,of,storms
the,lord,wiped,his,mouth,with,the,back,of,his,hand,and,picked,up,the,ribbon,for,a,closer,squint
lightning,flashed,outside,making,the,arrow,loops,blaze,blue,and,white,for,half,a,heartbeat
one,two,three,four,davos,counted,before,the,thunder,came
when,it,quieted,he,listened,to,the,dripping,and,the,duller,roar,beneath,his,feet,where,the,waves,were,smashing,against,breakwater’s,huge,stone,arches,and,swirling,through,its,dungeons
he,might,well,end,up,down,there,fettered,to,a,wet,stone,floor,and,left,to,drown,when,the,tide,came,rushing,in
no,he,tried,to,tell,himself,a,smuggler,might,die,that,way,but,not,a,king’s,hand
i’m,worth,more,if,he,sells,me,to,his,queen
the,lord,fingered,the,ribbon,frowning,at,the,seals
he,was,an,ugly,man,big,and,fleshy,with,an,oarsman’s,thick,shoulders,and,no,neck
coarse,grey,stubble,going,white,in,patches,covered,his,cheeks,and,chin
above,a,massive,shelf,of,brow,he,was,bald
his,nose,was,lumpy,and,red,with,broken,veins,his,lips,thick,and,he,had,a,sort,of,webbing,between,the,three,middle,fingers,of,his,right,hand
davos,had,heard,that,some,of,the,lords,of,the,three,sisters,had,webbed,hands,and,feet,but,he,had,always,put,that,down,as,just,another,sailor’s,story
the,lord,leaned,back
cut,him,free,he,said,and,peel,those,gloves,off,him
i,want,to,see,his,hands
the,captain,did,as,he,was,told
as,he,jerked,up,his,captive’s,maimed,left,hand,the,lightning,flashed,again,throwing,the,shadow,of,davos,seaworth’s,shortened,fingers,across,the,blunt,and,brutal,face,of,godric,borrell,lord,of,sweetsister
any,man,can,steal,a,ribbon,the,lord,said,but,those,fingers,do,not,lie
you,are,the,onion,knight
i,have,been,called,that,my,lord
davos,was,a,lord,himself,and,had,been,a,knight,for,long,years,now,but,deep,down,he,was,still,what,he,had,always,been,a,smuggler,of,common,birth,who,had,bought,his,knighthood,with,a,hold,of,onions,and,salt,fish
i,have,been,called,worse,things,too
aye
traitor

he,bristled,at,the,last
i,have,never,turned,my,cloak,my,lord
i,am,a,king’s,man
only,if,stannis,is,a,king
the,lord,weighed,him,with,hard,black,eyes

a,vile,smuggler’s,den,that,place
are,you,returning,to,your,old,trade,onion,knight
no,my,lord
i,was,looking,for,passage,to,white,harbor
the,king,sent,me,with,a,message,for,its,lord
then,you,are,in,the,wrong,place,with,the,wrong,lord
lord,godric,seemed,amused
this,is,sisterton,on,sweetsister
i,know,it,is
there,was,nothing,sweet,about,sisterton,though
it,was,a,vile,town,a,sty,small,and,mean,and,rank,with,the,odors,of,pig,shit,and,rotting,fish
davos,remembered,it,well,from,his,smuggling,days
the,three,sisters,had,been,a,favorite,haunt,of,smugglers,for,hundreds,of,years,and,a,pirate’s,nest,before,that
sisterton’s,streets,were,mud,and,planks,its,houses,daub-and-wattle,hovels,roofed,with,straw,and,by,the,gallows,gate,there,were,always,hanged,men,with,their,entrails,dangling,out
you,have,friends,here,i,do,not,doubt,said,the,lord
every,smuggler,has,friends,on,the,sisters
some,of,them,are,my,friends,as,well
the,ones,who,aren’t,them,i,hang
i,let,them,strangle,slowly,with,their,guts,slapping,up,against,their,knees
the,hall,grew,bright,again,as,lightning,lit,the,windows
two,heartbeats,later,came,the,thunder
if,it,is,white,harbor,that,you,want,why,are,you,in,sisterton
what,brought,you,here
a,king’s,command,and,a,friend’s,betrayal,davos,might,have,said
instead,he,answered,storms
nine-and-twenty,ships,had,set,sail,from,the,wall
if,half,of,them,were,still,afloat,davos,would,be,shocked
black,skies,bitter,winds,and,lashing,rains,had,hounded,them,all,the,way,down,the,coast
the,galleys,oledo,and,old,mother’s,son,had,been,driven,onto,the,rocks,of,skagos,the,isle,of,unicorns,and,cannibals,where,even,the,blind,bastard,had,feared,to,land,the,great,cog,saathos,saan,had,foundered,off,the,grey,cliffs
stannis,will,be,paying,for,them,salladhor,saan,had,fumed
he,will,be,paying,for,them,with,good,gold,every,one
it,was,as,if,some,angry,god,was,exacting,payment,for,their,easy,voyage,north,when,they,had,ridden,a,steady,southerly,from,dragonstone,to,the,wall
another,gale,had,ripped,away,the,rigging,of,the,bountiful,harvest,forcing,salla,to,have,her,taken,under,tow
ten,leagues,north,of,widow’s,watch,the,seas,rose,again,slamming,the,harvest,into,one,of,the,galleys,towing,her,and,sinking,both
the,rest,of,the,lysene,fleet,had,been,scattered,across,the,narrow,sea
some,would,straggle,into,one,port,or,another
others,would,never,be,seen,again
salladhor,the,beggar,that’s,what,your,king,has,made,me,salladhor,saan,complained,to,davos,as,the,remnants,of,his,fleet,limped,across,the,bite
salladhor,the,smashed
where,are,my,ships
and,my,gold,where,is,all,the,gold,that,i,was,promised
when,davos,had,tried,to,assure,him,that,he,would,have,his,payment,salla,had,erupted
when,when
on,the,morrow,on,the,new,moon,when,the,red,comet,comes,again
he,is,promising,me,gold,and,gems,always,promising,but,this,gold,i,have,not,seen
i,have,his,word,he,is,saying,oh,yes,his,royal,word,he,writes,it,down
can,salladhor,saan,eat,the,king’s,word
can,he,quench,his,thirst,with,parchments,and,waxy,seals
can,he,tumble,promises,into,a,feather,bed,and,fuck,them,till,they,squeal
davos,had,tried,to,persuade,him,to,stay,true
if,salla,abandoned,stannis,and,his,cause,he,pointed,out,he,abandoned,all,hope,of,collecting,the,gold,that,was,due,him
a,victorious,king,tommen,was,not,like,to,pay,his,defeated,uncle’s,debts,after,all
salla’s,only,hope,was,to,remain,loyal,to,stannis,baratheon,until,he,won,the,iron,throne
elsewise,he,would,never,see,a,groat,of,his,money
he,had,to,be,patient
perhaps,some,lord,with,honey,on,his,tongue,might,have,swayed,the,lysene,pirate,prince,but,davos,was,an,onion,knight,and,his,words,had,only,provoked,salla,to,fresh,outrage
on,dragonstone,i,was,patient,he,said,when,the,red,woman,burned,wooden,gods,and,screaming,men
all,the,long,way,to,the,wall,i,was,patient
at,eastwatch,i,was,patient,and,cold,so,very,cold
bah,i,say
bah,to,your,patience,and,bah,to,your,king
my,men,are,hungry
they,are,wishing,to,fuck,their,wives,again,to,count,their,sons,to,see,the,stepstones,and,the,pleasure,gardens,of,lys
ice,and,storms,and,empty,promises,these,they,are,not,wanting
this,north,is,much,too,cold,and,getting,colder
i,knew,the,day,would,come,davos,told,himself
i,was,fond,of,the,old,rogue,but,never,so,great,a,fool,as,to,trust,him
storms
lord,godric,said,the,word,as,fondly,as,another,man,might,say,his,lover’s,name
storms,were,sacred,on,the,sisters,before,the,andals,came
our,gods,of,old,were,the,lady,of,the,waves,and,the,lord,of,the,skies
they,made,storms,every,time,they,mated
he,leaned,forward
these,kings,never,bother,with,the,sisters
why,should,they
we,are,small,and,poor
and,yet,you’re,here
delivered,to,me,by,the,storms
delivered,to,you,by,a,friend,davos,thought
lord,godric,turned,to,his,captain
leave,this,man,with,me
he,was,never,here
no,m’lord
never
the,captain,took,his,leave,his,wet,boots,leaving,damp,footprints,across,the,carpet
beneath,the,floor,the,sea,was,rumbling,and,restless,pounding,at,the,castle’s,feet
the,outer,door,closed,with,a,sound,like,distant,thunder,and,again,the,lightning,came,as,if,in,answer
my,lord,said,davos,if,you,would,send,me,on,to,white,harbor,his,grace,would,count,it,as,an,act,of,friendship
i,could,send,you,to,white,harbor,the,lord,allowed
or,i,could,send,you,to,some,cold,wet,hell
sisterton,is,hell,enough
davos,feared,the,worst
the,three,sisters,were,fickle,bitches,loyal,only,to,themselves
supposedly,they,were,sworn,to,the,arryns,of,the,vale,but,the,eyrie’s,grasp,upon,the,islands,was,tenuous,at,best
sunderland,would,require,me,to,hand,you,over,if,he,knew,of,you
borrell,did,fealty,for,sweetsister,as,longthorpe,did,for,longsister,and,torrent,for,littlesister,all,were,sworn,to,triston,sunderland,the,lord,of,the,three,sisters
he’d,sell,you,to,the,queen,for,a,pot,of,that,lannister,gold
poor,man,needs,every,dragon,with,seven,sons,all,determined,to,be,knights
the,lord,picked,up,a,wooden,spoon,and,attacked,his,stew,again
i,used,to,curse,the,gods,who,gave,me,only,daughters,until,i,heard,triston,bemoaning,the,cost,of,destriers
you,would,be,surprised,to,know,how,many,fish,it,takes,to,buy,a,decent,suit,of,plate,and,mail
i,had,seven,sons,as,well,but,four,are,burned,and,dead
lord,sunderland,is,sworn,to,the,eyrie,davos,said
by,rights,he,should,deliver,me,to,lady,arryn
he,would,stand,a,better,chance,with,her,than,with,the,lannisters,he,judged
though,she,had,taken,no,part,in,the,war,of,the,five,kings,lysa,arryn,was,a,daughter,of,riverrun,and,aunt,to,the,young,wolf
lysa,arryn’s,dead,lord,godric,said,murdered,by,some,singer
lord,littlefinger,rules,the,vale,now
where,are,the,pirates
when,davos,did,not,answer,he,rapped,his,spoon,against,the,table
the,lyseni

orange,sails,and,green,and,pink
salladhor,saan
where,is,he
at,sea
salla,would,be,sailing,around,the,fingers,and,down,the,narrow,sea
he,was,returning,to,the,stepstones,with,what,few,ships,remained,him
perhaps,he,would,acquire,a,few,more,along,the,way,if,he,came,upon,some,likely,merchantmen
a,little,piracy,to,help,the,leagues,go,by
his,grace,has,sent,him,south,to,trouble,the,lannisters,and,their,friends
the,lie,was,one,he,had,rehearsed,as,he,rowed,toward,sisterton,through,the,rain
soon,or,late,the,world,would,learn,that,salladhor,saan,had,abandoned,stannis,baratheon,leaving,him,without,a,fleet,but,they,would,not,hear,it,from,the,lips,of,davos,seaworth
lord,godric,stirred,his,stew
did,that,old,pirate,saan,make,you,swim,to,shore
i,came,ashore,in,an,open,boat,my,lord
salla,had,waited,until,the,beacon,of,the,night,lamp,shone,off,the,valyrian’s,port,bow,before,he,put,him,off
their,friendship,had,been,worth,that,much,at,least
the,lyseni,would,gladly,have,taken,him,south,with,him,he,avowed,but,davos,had,refused
stannis,needed,wyman,manderly,and,had,trusted,davos,to,win,him
he,would,not,betray,that,trust,he,told,salla
bah,the,pirate,prince,replied,he,will,kill,you,with,these,honors,old,friend
he,will,kill,you
i,have,never,had,a,king’s,hand,beneath,my,roof,before,lord,godric,said
would,stannis,ransom,you,i,wonder
would,he
stannis,had,given,davos,lands,and,titles,and,offices,but,would,he,pay,good,gold,to,buy,back,his,life
he,has,no,gold
else,he’d,still,have,salla
you,will,find,his,grace,at,castle,black,if,my,lord,would,like,to,ask,that,of,him
borrell,grunted
is,the,imp,at,castle,black,as,well
the,imp
davos,did,not,understand,the,question
he,is,at,king’s,landing,condemned,to,die,for,the,murder,of,his,nephew
the,wall,is,the,last,to,learn,my,father,used,to,say

he,twisted,through,the,bars,of,his,cell,and,tore,his,own,father,apart,with,his,bare,hands
a,guardsman,saw,him,flee,red,from,head,to,heel,as,if,he’d,bathed,in,blood
the,queen,will,make,a,lord,of,any,man,who,kills,him
davos,struggled,to,believe,what,he,was,hearing
you,are,telling,me,that,tywin,lannister,is,dead
at,his,son’s,hand,aye
the,lord,took,a,drink,of,beer
when,there,were,kings,on,the,sisters,we,did,not,suffer,dwarfs,to,live
we,cast,them,all,into,the,sea,as,an,offering,to,the,gods
the,septons,made,us,stop,that
a,pack,of,pious,fools
why,would,the,gods,give,a,man,such,a,shape,but,to,mark,him,as,a,monster
lord,tywin,dead
this,changes,all
my,lord,will,you,grant,me,leave,to,send,a,raven,to,the,wall
his,grace,will,want,to,know,of,lord,tywin’s,death
he’ll,know
but,not,from,me
nor,you,so,long,as,you,are,here,beneath,my,leaky,roof
i’ll,not,have,it,said,that,i,gave,stannis,aid,and,counsel
the,sunderlands,dragged,the,sisters,into,two,of,the,blackfyre,rebellions,and,we,all,suffered,grievously,for,that
lord,godric,waved,his,spoon,toward,a,chair

it,was,the,young,usurper,who,dismissed,you,from,the,kingsguard,joffrey,aye
they,gave,my,age,for,a,reason,though,the,truth,was,elsewise
the,boy,wanted,a,white,cloak,for,his,dog,sandor,clegane,and,his,mother,wanted,the,kingslayer,to,be,her,lord,commander
when,they,told,me,i,i,took,off,my,cloak,as,they,commanded,threw,my,sword,at,joffrey’s,feet,and,spoke,unwisely
what,did,you,say
the,truth,but,truth,was,never,welcome,at,that,court
i,walked,from,the,throne,room,with,my,head,high,though,i,did,not,know,where,i,was,going
i,had,no,home,but,white,sword,tower
my,cousins,would,find,a,place,for,me,at,harvest,hall,i,knew,but,i,had,no,wish,to,bring,joffrey’s,displeasure,down,upon,them
i,was,gathering,my,things,when,it,came,to,me,that,i,had,brought,this,on,myself,by,taking,robert’s,pardon
he,was,a,good,knight,but,a,bad,king,for,he,had,no,right,to,the,throne,he,sat
that,was,when,i,knew,that,to,redeem,myself,i,must,find,the,true,king,and,serve,him,loyally,with,all,the,strength,that,still,remained,me
my,brother,viserys
such,was,my,intent
when,i,reached,the,stables,the,gold,cloaks,tried,to,seize,me
joffrey,had,offered,me,a,tower,to,die,in,but,i,had,spurned,his,gift,so,now,he,meant,to,offer,me,a,dungeon
the,commander,of,the,city,watch,himself,confronted,me,emboldened,by,my,empty,scabbard,but,he,had,only,three,men,with,him,and,i,still,had,my,knife
i,slashed,one,man’s,face,open,when,he,laid,his,hands,upon,me,and,rode,through,the,others
as,i,spurred,for,the,gates,i,heard,janos,slynt,shouting,for,them,to,go,after,me
once,outside,the,red,keep,the,streets,were,congested,else,i,might,have,gotten,away,clean
instead,they,caught,me,at,the,river,gate
the,gold,cloaks,who,had,pursued,me,from,the,castle,shouted,for,those,at,the,gate,to,stop,me,so,they,crossed,their,spears,to,bar,my,way
and,you,without,your,sword
how,did,you,get,past,them
a,true,knight,is,worth,ten,guardsmen
the,men,at,the,gate,were,taken,by,surprise
i,rode,one,down,wrenched,away,his,spear,and,drove,it,through,the,throat,of,my,closest,pursuer
the,other,broke,off,once,i,was,through,the,gate,so,i,spurred,my,horse,to,a,gallop,and,rode,hellbent,along,the,river,until,the,city,was,lost,to,sight,behind,me
that,night,i,traded,my,horse,for,a,handful,of,pennies,and,some,rags,and,the,next,morning,i,joined,the,stream,of,smallfolk,making,their,way,to,king’s,landing
i’d,gone,out,the,mud,gate,so,i,returned,through,the,gate,of,the,gods,with,dirt,on,my,face,stubble,on,my,cheeks,and,no,weapon,but,a,wooden,staff
in,roughspun,clothes,and,mud-caked,boots,i,was,just,one,more,old,man,fleeing,the,war
the,gold,cloaks,took,a,stag,from,me,and,waved,me,through
king’s,landing,was,crowded,with,smallfolk,who’d,come,seeking,refuge,from,the,fighting
i,lost,myself,amongst,them
i,had,a,little,silver,but,i,needed,that,to,pay,my,passage,across,the,narrow,sea,so,i,slept,in,septs,and,alleys,and,took,my,meals,in,pot,shops
i,let,my,beard,grow,out,and,cloaked,myself,in,age
the,day,lord,stark,lost,his,head,i,was,there,watching
afterward,i,went,into,the,great,sept,and,thanked,the,seven,gods,that,joffrey,had,stripped,me,of,my,cloak
stark,was,a,traitor,who,met,a,traitor’s,end
your,grace,said,selmy,eddard,stark,played,a,part,in,your,father’s,fall,but,he,bore,you,no,ill,will
when,the,eunuch,varys,told,us,that,you,were,with,child,robert,wanted,you,killed,but,lord,stark,spoke,against,it
rather,than,countenance,the,murder,of,children,he,told,robert,to,find,himself,another,hand

all,the,dogs,are,just,as,guilty
the,guilt,the,word,caught,in,her,throat
hazzea,she,thought,and,suddenly,she,heard,herself,say,i,have,to,see,the,pit,in,a,voice,as,small,as,a,child’s,whisper
take,me,down,ser,if,you,would
a,flicker,of,disapproval,crossed,the,old,man’s,face,but,it,was,not,his,way,to,question,his,queen
as,you,command
the,servants’,steps,were,the,quickest,way,down,not,grand,but,steep,and,straight,and,narrow,hidden,in,the,walls
ser,barristan,brought,a,lantern,lest,she,fall
bricks,of,twenty,different,colors,pressed,close,around,them,fading,to,grey,and,black,beyond,the,lantern,light
thrice,they,passed,unsullied,guards,standing,as,if,they,had,been,carved,from,stone
the,only,sound,was,the,soft,scruff,of,their,feet,upon,the,steps
at,ground,level,the,great,pyramid,of,meereen,was,a,hushed,place,full,of,dust,and,shadows
its,outer,walls,were,thirty,feet,thick
within,them,sounds,echoed,off,arches,of,many-colored,bricks,and,amongst,the,stables,stalls,and,storerooms
they,passed,beneath,three,massive,arches,down,a,torchlit,ramp,into,the,vaults,beneath,the,pyramid,past,cisterns,dungeons,and,torture,chambers,where,slaves,had,been,scourged,and,skinned,and,burned,with,red-hot,irons
finally,they,came,to,a,pair,of,huge,iron,doors,with,rusted,hinges,guarded,by,unsullied
at,her,command,one,produced,an,iron,key
the,door,opened,hinges,shrieking
daenerys,targaryen,stepped,into,the,hot,heart,of,darkness,and,stopped,at,the,lip,of,a,deep,pit
forty,feet,below,her,dragons,raised,their,heads
four,eyes,burned,through,the,shadows,two,of,molten,gold,and,two,of,bronze
ser,barristan,took,her,by,the,arm
no,closer
you,think,they,would,harm,me
i,do,not,know,your,grace,but,i,would,sooner,not,risk,your,person,to,learn,the,answer
when,rhaegal,roared,a,gout,of,yellow,flame,turned,darkness,into,day,for,half,a,heartbeat
the,fire,licked,along,the,walls,and,dany,felt,the,heat,upon,her,face,like,the,blast,from,an,oven
across,the,pit,viserion’s,wings,unfolded,stirring,the,stale,air
he,tried,to,fly,to,her,but,the,chains,snapped,taut,as,he,rose,and,slammed,him,down,onto,his,belly
links,as,big,as,a,man’s,fist,bound,his,feet,to,the,floor
the,iron,collar,about,his,neck,was,fastened,to,the,wall,behind,him
rhaegal,wore,matching,chains
in,the,light,of,selmy’s,lantern,his,scales,gleamed,like,jade
smoke,rose,from,between,his,teeth
bones,were,scattered,on,the,floor,at,his,feet,cracked,and,scorched,and,splintered
the,air,was,uncomfortably,hot,and,smelled,of,sulfur,and,charred,meat
they,are,larger
dany’s,voice,echoed,off,the,scorched,stone,walls
a,drop,of,sweat,trickled,down,her,brow,and,fell,onto,her,breast
is,it,true,that,dragons,never,stop,growing
if,they,have,food,enough,and,space,to,grow
chained,up,in,here,though,the,great,masters,had,used,the,pit,as,a,prison
it,was,large,enough,to,hold,five,hundred,men,and,more,than,ample,for,two,dragons
for,how,long,though
what,will,happen,when,they,grow,too,large,for,the,pit
will,they,turn,on,one,another,with,flame,and,claw
will,they,grow,wan,and,weak,with,withered,flanks,and,shrunken,wings
will,their,fires,go,out,before,the,end
what,sort,of,mother,lets,her,children,rot,in,darkness
if,i,look,back,i,am,doomed,dany,told,herself,but,how,could,she,not,look,back
i,should,have,seen,it,coming
was,i,so,blind,or,did,i,close,my,eyes,willfully,so,i,would,not,have,to,see,the,price,of,power
viserys,had,told,her,all,the,tales,when,she,was,little
he,loved,to,talk,of,dragons
she,knew,how,harrenhal,had,fallen
she,knew,about,the,field,of,fire,and,the,dance,of,the,dragons
one,of,her,forebears,the,third,aegon,had,seen,his,own,mother,devoured,by,his,uncle’s,dragon
and,there,were,songs,beyond,count,of,villages,and,kingdoms,that,lived,in,dread,of,dragons,till,some,brave,dragonslayer,rescued,them
at,astapor,the,slaver’s,eyes,had,melted
on,the,road,to,yunkai,when,daario,tossed,the,heads,of,sallor,the,bald,and,prendahl,na,ghezn,at,her,feet,her,children,made,a,feast,of,them
dragons,had,no,fear,of,men
and,a,dragon,large,enough,to,gorge,on,sheep,could,take,a,child,just,as,easily
her,name,had,been,hazzea
she,was,four,years,old
unless,her,father,lied
he,might,have,lied
no,one,had,seen,the,dragon,but,him
his,proof,was,burned,bones,but,burned,bones,proved,nothing
he,might,have,killed,the,little,girl,himself,and,burned,her,afterward
he,would,not,have,been,the,first,father,to,dispose,of,an,unwanted,girl,child,the,shavepate,claimed
the,sons,of,the,harpy,might,have,done,it,and,made,it,look,like,dragon’s,work,to,make,the,city,hate,me
dany,wanted,to,believe,that,but,if,that,was,so,why,had,hazzea’s,father,waited,until,the,audience,hall,was,almost,empty,to,come,forward
if,his,purpose,had,been,to,inflame,the,meereenese,against,her,he,would,have,told,his,tale,when,the,hall,was,full,of,ears,to,hear
the,shavepate,had,urged,her,to,put,the,man,to,death
at,least,rip,out,his,tongue
this,man’s,lie,could,destroy,us,all,magnificence
instead,dany,chose,to,pay,the,blood,price
no,one,could,tell,her,the,worth,of,a,daughter,so,she,set,it,at,one,hundred,times,the,worth,of,a,lamb
i,would,give,hazzea,back,to,you,if,i,could,she,told,the,father,but,some,things,are,beyond,the,power,of,even,a,queen
her,bones,shall,be,laid,to,rest,in,the,temple,of,the,graces,and,a,hundred,candles,shall,burn,day,and,night,in,her,memory

when,he,could,not,he,gave,a,roar,twisted,his,head,back,as,far,as,he,was,able,and,spat,golden,flame,at,the,wall,behind,him
how,soon,till,his,fire,burns,hot,enough,to,crack,stone,and,melt,iron

they,had,chained,him,whilst,he,slept
rhaegal,had,been,harder
perhaps,he,could,hear,his,brother,raging,in,the,pit,despite,the,walls,of,brick,and,stone,between,them
in,the,end,they,had,to,cover,him,with,a,net,of,heavy,iron,chain,as,he,basked,on,her,terrace,and,he,fought,so,fiercely,that,it,had,taken,three,days,to,carry,him,down,the,servants’,steps,twisting,and,snapping
six,men,had,been,burned,in,the,struggle
and,drogon,the,winged,shadow,the,grieving,father,called,him
he,was,the,largest,of,her,three,the,fiercest,the,wildest,with,scales,as,black,as,night,and,eyes,like,pits,of,fire
drogon,hunted,far,afield,but,when,he,was,sated,he,liked,to,bask,in,the,sun,at,the,apex,of,the,great,pyramid,where,once,the,harpy,of,meereen,had,stood
thrice,they,had,tried,to,take,him,there,and,thrice,they,had,failed
two,score,of,her,bravest,had,risked,themselves,trying,to,capture,him

it,was,so,good,that,it,brought,tears,to,his,eyes
his,belly,rumbled,and,he,swallowed
by,the,third,bite,the,rat,had,ceased,to,struggle,and,he,was,feeling,almost,content
then,he,heard,the,sounds,of,voices,outside,the,dungeon,door
at,once,he,stilled,fearing,even,to,chew
his,mouth,was,full,of,blood,and,flesh,and,hair,but,he,dare,not,spit,or,swallow
he,listened,in,terror,stiff,as,stone,to,the,scuff,of,boots,and,the,clanking,of,iron,keys
no,he,thought,no,please,gods,not,now,not,now

whenever,he,closed,his,eyes,he,found,himself,remembering,lady,hornwood
after,their,wedding,lord,ramsay,had,locked,her,away,in,a,tower,and,starved,her,to,death
in,the,end,she,had,eaten,her,own,fingers
he,crouched,down,in,a,corner,of,his,cell,clutching,his,prize,under,his,chin
blood,ran,from,the,corners,of,his,mouth,as,he,nibbled,at,the,rat,with,what,remained,of,his,teeth,trying,to,bolt,down,as,much,of,the,warm,flesh,as,he,could,before,the,cell,was,opened
the,meat,was,stringy,but,so,rich,he,thought,he,might,be,sick
he,chewed,and,swallowed,picking,small,bones,from,the,holes,in,his,gums,where,teeth,had,been,yanked,out
it,hurt,to,chew,but,he,was,so,hungry,he,could,not,stop

guests,reek,thought,his,lordship’s,friends,and,i,am,brought,up,to,amuse,them
a,shiver,of,fear,went,through,him
at,the,high,table,the,bastard,of,bolton,sat,in,his,lord,father’s,seat,drinking,from,his,father’s,cup
two,old,men,shared,the,high,table,with,him,and,reek,knew,at,a,glance,that,both,were,lords

underneath,he,wore,a,ringmail,byrnie,even,at,table
the,second,lord,was,thin,as,well,but,twisted,where,the,first,was,straight
one,of,his,shoulders,was,much,higher,than,the,other,and,he,stooped,over,his,trencher,like,a,vulture,over,carrion

only,a,few,wisps,of,white,hair,still,clung,to,his,spotted,skull,but,the,cloak,he,wore,was,soft,and,fine,grey,wool,trimmed,with,black,sable,and,fastened,at,the,shoulder,with,a,starburst,wrought,in,beaten,silver

yet,for,all,the,splendor,of,his,garb,he,remained,an,ugly,man,big-boned,and,slope-shouldered,with,a,fleshiness,to,him,that,suggested,that,in,later,life,he,would,run,to,fat
his,skin,was,pink,and,blotchy,his,nose,broad,his,mouth,small,his,hair,long,and,dark,and,dry

the,three-eyed,crow
asked,meera
the,greenseer
and,with,that,she,was,off,and,they,had,no,choice,but,to,follow
meera,helped,bran,back,up,onto,hodor’s,back,though,his,basket,was,half-crushed,and,wet,from,melting,snow
then,she,slipped,an,arm,around,her,brother,and,shouldered,him,back,onto,his,feet,once,more
his,eyes,opened
what
he,said
meera
where,are,we
when,he,saw,the,fire,he,smiled
i,had,the,strangest,dream
the,way,was,cramped,and,twisty,and,so,low,that,hodor,soon,was,crouching
bran,hunched,down,as,best,he,could,but,even,so,the,top,of,his,head,was,soon,scraping,and,bumping,against,the,ceiling
loose,dirt,crumbled,at,each,touch,and,dribbled,down,into,his,eyes,and,hair,and,once,he,smacked,his,brow,on,a,thick,white,root,growing,from,the,tunnel,wall,with,tendrils,hanging,from,it,and,spiderwebs,between,its,fingers
the,child,went,in,front,with,the,torch,in,hand,her,cloak,of,leaves,whispering,behind,her,but,the,passage,turned,so,much,that,bran,soon,lost,sight,of,her
then,the,only,light,was,what,was,reflected,off,the,passage,walls
after,they,had,gone,down,a,little,the,cave,divided,but,the,left,branch,was,dark,as,pitch,so,even,hodor,knew,to,follow,the,moving,torch,to,the,right
the,way,the,shadows,shifted,made,it,seem,as,if,the,walls,were,moving,too
bran,saw,great,white,snakes,slithering,in,and,out,of,the,earth,around,him,and,his,heart,thumped,in,fear
he,wondered,if,they,had,blundered,into,a,nest,of,milk,snakes,or,giant,grave,worms,soft,and,pale,and,squishy
grave,worms,have,teeth
hodor,saw,them,too
hodor,he,whimpered,reluctant,to,go,on
but,when,the,girl,child,stopped,to,let,them,catch,her,the,torchlight,steadied,and,bran,realized,that,the,snakes,were,only,white,roots,like,the,one,he’d,hit,his,head,on
it’s,weirwood,roots,he,said
remember,the,heart,tree,in,the,godswood,hodor
the,white,tree,with,the,red,leaves
a,tree,can’t,hurt,you
hodor
hodor,plunged,ahead,hurrying,after,the,child,and,her,torch,deeper,into,the,earth
they,passed,another,branching,and,another,then,came,into,an,echoing,cavern,as,large,as,the,great,hall,of,winterfell,with,stone,teeth,hanging,from,its,ceiling,and,more,poking,up,through,its,floor
the,child,in,the,leafy,cloak,wove,a,path,through,them
from,time,to,time,she,stopped,and,waved,her,torch,at,them,impatiently
this,way,it,seemed,to,say,this,way,this,way,faster
there,were,more,side,passages,after,that,more,chambers,and,bran,heard,dripping,water,somewhere,to,his,right
when,he,looked,off,that,way,he,saw,eyes,looking,back,at,them,slitted,eyes,that,glowed,bright,reflecting,back,the,torchlight
more,children,he,told,himself,the,girl,is,not,the,only,one,but,old,nan’s,tale,of,gendel’s,children,came,back,to,him,as,well
the,roots,were,everywhere,twisting,through,earth,and,stone,closing,off,some,passages,and,holding,up,the,roofs,of,others
all,the,color,is,gone,bran,realized,suddenly
the,world,was,black,soil,and,white,wood
the,heart,tree,at,winterfell,had,roots,as,thick,around,as,a,giant’s,legs,but,these,were,even,thicker
and,bran,had,never,seen,so,many,of,them
there,must,be,a,whole,grove,of,weirwoods,growing,up,above,us
the,light,dwindled,again
small,as,she,was,the,child-who-was-not-a-child,moved,quickly,when,she,wanted
as,hodor,thumped,after,her,something,crunched,beneath,his,feet
his,halt,was,so,sudden,that,meera,and,jojen,almost,slammed,into,his,back
bones,said,bran
it’s,bones
the,floor,of,the,passage,was,littered,with,the,bones,of,birds,and,beasts
but,there,were,other,bones,as,well,big,ones,that,must,have,come,from,giants,and,small,ones,that,could,have,been,from,children
on,either,side,of,them,in,niches,carved,from,the,stone,skulls,looked,down,on,them
bran,saw,a,bear,skull,and,a,wolf,skull,half,a,dozen,human,skulls,and,near,as,many,giants
all,the,rest,were,small,queerly,formed
children,of,the,forest
the,roots,had,grown,in,and,around,and,through,them,every,one
a,few,had,ravens,perched,atop,them,watching,them,pass,with,bright,black,eyes
the,last,part,of,their,dark,journey,was,the,steepest
hodor,made,the,final,descent,on,his,arse,bumping,and,sliding,downward,in,a,clatter,of,broken,bones,loose,dirt,and,pebbles
the,girl,child,was,waiting,for,them,standing,on,one,end,of,a,natural,bridge,above,a,yawning,chasm
down,below,in,the,darkness,bran,heard,the,sound,of,rushing,water
an,underground,river
do,we,have,to,cross
bran,asked,as,the,reeds,came,sliding,down,behind,him
the,prospect,frightened,him
if,hodor,slipped,on,that,narrow,bridge,they,would,fall,and,fall
no,boy,the,child,said
behind,you
she,lifted,her,torch,higher,and,the,light,seemed,to,shift,and,change
one,moment,the,flames,burned,orange,and,yellow,filling,the,cavern,with,a,ruddy,glow,then,all,the,colors,faded,leaving,only,black,and,white
behind,them,meera,gasped
hodor,turned
before,them,a,pale,lord,in,ebon,finery,sat,dreaming,in,a,tangled,nest,of,roots,a,woven,weirwood,throne,that,embraced,his,withered,limbs,as,a,mother,does,a,child
his,body,was,so,skeletal,and,his,clothes,so,rotted,that,at,first,bran,took,him,for,another,corpse,a,dead,man,propped,up,so,long,that,the,roots,had,grown,over,him,under,him,and,through,him
what,skin,the,corpse,lord,showed,was,white,save,for,a,bloody,blotch,that,crept,up,his,neck,onto,his,cheek
his,white,hair,was,fine,and,thin,as,root,hair,and,long,enough,to,brush,against,the,earthen,floor
roots,coiled,around,his,legs,like,wooden,serpents
one,burrowed,through,his,breeches,into,the,desiccated,flesh,of,his,thigh,to,emerge,again,from,his,shoulder
a,spray,of,dark,red,leaves,sprouted,from,his,skull,and,grey,mushrooms,spotted,his,brow
a,little,skin,remained,stretched,across,his,face,tight,and,hard,as,white,leather,but,even,that,was,fraying,and,here,and,there,the,brown,and,yellow,bone,beneath,was,poking,through
are,you,the,three-eyed,crow
bran,heard,himself,say
a,three-eyed,crow,should,have,three,eyes
he,has,only,one,and,that,one,red
bran,could,feel,the,eye,staring,at,him,shining,like,a,pool,of,blood,in,the,torchlight
where,his,other,eye,should,have,been,a,thin,white,root,grew,from,an,empty,socket,down,his,cheek,and,into,his,neck
a,crow
the,pale,lord’s,voice,was,dry
his,lips,moved,slowly,as,if,they,had,forgotten,how,to,form,words
once,aye
black,of,garb,and,black,of,blood
the,clothes,he,wore,were,rotten,and,faded,spotted,with,moss,and,eaten,through,with,worms,but,once,they,had,been,black

no,said,the,pale,lord
that,is,beyond,my,powers
bran’s,eyes,filled,with,tears
we,came,such,a,long,way
the,chamber,echoed,to,the,sound,of,the,black,river
you,will,never,walk,again,bran,the,pale,lips,promised,but,you,will,fly
tyrion,for,a,long,while,he,did,not,stir,but,lay,unmoving,upon,the,heap,of,old,sacks,that,served,him,for,a,bed,listening,to,the,wind,in,the,lines,to,the,lapping,of,the,river,at,the,hull
a,full,moon,floated,above,the,mast
it,is,following,me,downriver,watching,me,like,some,great,eye
despite,the,warmth,of,the,musty,skins,that,covered,him,a,shiver,went,through,the,little,man
i,need,a,cup,of,wine
a,dozen,cups,of,wine
but,the,moon,would,blink,before,that,whoreson,griff,let,him,quench,his,thirst
instead,he,drank,water,and,was,condemned,to,sleepless,nights,and,days,of,sweats,and,shakes
the,dwarf,sat,up,cradling,his,head,in,his,hands
did,i,dream
all,memory,of,it,had,fled
the,nights,had,never,been,kind,to,tyrion,lannister
he,slept,badly,even,on,soft,feather,beds
on,the,shy,maid,he,made,his,bed,atop,the,roof,of,the,cabin,with,a,coil,of,hempen,rope,for,a,pillow
he,liked,it,better,up,here,than,in,the,boat’s,cramped,hold
the,air,was,fresher,and,the,river,sounds,were,sweeter,than,duck’s,snoring
there,was,a,price,to,be,paid,for,such,joys,though,the,deck,was,hard,and,he,woke,stiff,and,sore,his,legs,cramped,and,aching
they,were,throbbing,now,his,calves,gone,hard,as,wood
he,kneaded,them,with,his,fingers,trying,to,rub,the,ache,away,but,when,he,stood,the,pain,was,still,enough,to,make,him,grimace
i,need,to,bathe
his,boy’s,clothes,stank,and,so,did,he
the,others,bathed,in,the,river,but,thus,far,he,had,not,joined,them
some,of,the,turtles,he’d,seen,in,the,shallows,looked,big,enough,to,bite,him,in,half
bonesnappers,duck,called,them
besides,he,did,not,want,lemore,to,see,him,naked
a,wooden,ladder,led,down,from,the,cabin,roof
tyrion,pulled,on,his,boots,and,descended,to,the,afterdeck,where,griff,sat,wrapped,in,a,wolfskin,cloak,beside,an,iron,brazier
the,sellsword,kept,the,night,watch,by,himself,rising,as,the,rest,of,his,band,sought,their,beds,and,retiring,when,the,sun,came,up
tyrion,squatted,across,from,him,and,warmed,his,hands,over,the,coals
across,the,water,nightingales,were,singing
day,soon,he,said,to,griff
not,soon,enough
we,need,to,be,under,way
if,it,had,been,up,to,griff,the,shy,maid,would,continue,downstream,by,night,as,well,as,day,but,yandry,and,ysilla,refused,to,risk,their,poleboat,in,the,dark
the,upper,rhoyne,was,full,of,snags,and,sawyers,any,one,of,which,could,rip,out,the,shy,maid’s,hull
griff,did,not,want,to,hear,it
what,he,wanted,was,volantis
the,sellsword’s,eyes,were,always,moving,searching,the,night,for,what
pirates
stone,men
slave-catchers
the,river,had,perils,the,dwarf,knew,but,griff,himself,struck,tyrion,as,more,dangerous,than,any,of,them
he,reminded,tyrion,of,bronn,though,bronn,had,a,sellsword’s,black,humor,and,griff,had,no,humor,at,all
i,would,kill,for,a,cup,of,wine,muttered,tyrion
griff,made,no,reply
you,will,die,before,you,drink,his,pale,eyes,seemed,to,say
tyrion,had,drunk,himself,blind,his,first,night,on,the,shy,maid
the,next,day,he,awoke,with,dragons,fighting,in,his,skull
griff,took,one,look,at,him,retching,over,the,side,of,the,poleboat,and,said,you,are,done,with,drink
wine,helps,me,sleep,tyrion,had,protested
wine,drowns,my,dreams,he,might,have,said
then,stay,awake,griff,had,replied,implacable
to,the,east,the,first,pale,light,of,day,suffused,the,sky,above,the,river
the,waters,of,the,rhoyne,slowly,went,from,black,to,blue,to,match,the,sellsword’s,hair,and,beard
griff,got,to,his,feet
the,others,should,wake,soon
the,deck,is,yours
as,the,nightingales,fell,silent,the,river,larks,took,up,their,song
egrets,splashed,amongst,the,reeds,and,left,their,tracks,across,the,sandbars
the,clouds,in,the,sky,were,aglow,pink,and,purple,maroon,and,gold,pearl,and,saffron

good,morrow,hugor
septa,lemore,had,emerged,in,her,white,robes,cinched,at,the,waist,with,a,woven,belt,of,seven,colors
her,hair,flowed,loose,about,her,shoulders
how,did,you,sleep
fitfully,good,lady
i,dreamed,of,you,again
a,waking,dream
he,could,not,sleep,so,he,had,eased,a,hand,between,his,legs,and,imagined,the,septa,atop,him,breasts,bouncing
a,wicked,dream,no,doubt
you,are,a,wicked,man
will,you,pray,with,me,and,ask,forgiveness,for,your,sins
only,if,we,pray,in,the,fashion,of,the,summer,isles
no,but,do,give,the,maiden,a,long,sweet,kiss,for,me
laughing,the,septa,walked,to,the,prow,of,the,boat
it,was,her,custom,to,bathe,in,the,river,every,morning
plainly,this,boat,was,not,named,for,you,tyrion,called,as,she,disrobed
the,mother,and,the,father,made,us,in,their,image,hugor
we,should,glory,in,our,bodies,for,they,are,the,work,of,gods
the,gods,must,have,been,drunk,when,they,got,to,me
the,dwarf,watched,lemore,slip,into,the,water
the,sight,always,made,him,hard
there,was,something,wonderfully,wicked,about,the,thought,of,peeling,the,septa,out,of,those,chaste,white,robes,and,spreading,her,legs
innocence,despoiled,he,thought,though,lemore,was,not,near,as,innocent,as,she,appeared
she,had,stretch,marks,on,her,belly,that,could,only,have,come,from,childbirth
yandry,and,ysilla,had,risen,with,the,sun,and,were,going,about,their,business
yandry,stole,a,glance,at,septa,lemore,from,time,to,time,as,he,was,checking,the,lines
his,small,dark,wife,ysilla,took,no,notice
she,fed,some,wood,chips,to,the,brazier,on,the,afterdeck,stirred,the,coals,with,a,blackened,blade,and,began,to,knead,the,dough,for,the,morning,biscuits
when,lemore,climbed,back,onto,the,deck,tyrion,savored,the,sight,of,water,trickling,between,her,breasts,her,smooth,skin,glowing,golden,in,the,morning,light
she,was,past,forty,more,handsome,than,pretty,but,still,easy,on,the,eye
being,randy,is,the,next,best,thing,to,being,drunk,he,decided
it,made,him,feel,as,if,he,was,still,alive
did,you,see,the,turtle,hugor
the,septa,asked,him,wringing,water,from,her,hair
the,big,ridgeback
the,early,morning,was,the,best,time,for,seeing,turtles
during,the,day,they,would,swim,down,deep,or,hide,in,cuts,along,the,banks,but,when,the,sun,was,newly,risen,they,came,to,the,surface
some,liked,to,swim,beside,the,boat
tyrion,had,glimpsed,a,dozen,different,sorts,large,turtles,and,small,ones,flatbacks,and,red-ears,softshells,and,bonesnappers,brown,turtles,green,turtles,black,turtles,clawed,turtles,and,horned,turtles,turtles,whose,ridged,and,patterned,shells,were,covered,with,whorls,of,gold,and,jade,and,cream
some,were,so,large,they,could,have,borne,a,man,upon,their,backs
yandry,swore,the,rhoynar,princes,used,to,ride,them,across,the,river
he,and,his,wife,were,greenblood,born,a,pair,of,dornish,orphans,come,home,to,mother,rhoyne

i,was,watching,the,naked,woman
i,am,sad,for,you

i,know,you,only,rise,so,early,in,hopes,of,seeing,turtles
i,like,to,watch,the,sun,come,up,as,well
it,was,like,watching,a,maiden,rising,naked,from,her,bath
some,might,be,prettier,than,others,but,every,one,was,full,of,promise
the,turtles,have,their,charms,i,will,allow
nothing,delights,me,so,much,as,the,sight,of,a,nice,pair,of,shapely,shells
septa,lemore,laughed
like,everyone,else,aboard,the,shy,maid,she,had,her,secrets
she,was,welcome,to,them
i,do,not,want,to,know,her,i,only,want,to,fuck,her
she,knew,it,too
as,she,hung,her,septa’s,crystal,about,her,neck,to,nestle,in,the,cleft,between,her,breasts,she,teased,him,with,a,smile
yandry,pulled,up,the,anchor,slid,one,of,the,long,poles,off,the,cabin,roof,and,pushed,them,off
two,of,the,herons,raised,their,heads,to,watch,as,the,shy,maid,drifted,away,from,the,bank,out,into,the,current
slowly,the,boat,began,to,move,downstream
yandry,went,to,the,tiller
ysilla,was,turning,the,biscuits
she,laid,an,iron,pan,atop,the,brazier,and,put,the,bacon,in
some,days,she,cooked,biscuits,and,bacon,some,days,bacon,and,biscuits
once,every,fortnight,there,might,be,a,fish,but,not,today
when,ysilla,turned,her,back,tyrion,snatched,a,biscuit,off,the,brazier,darting,away,just,in,time,to,avoid,a,smack,from,her,fearsome,wooden,spoon
they,were,best,when,eaten,hot,dripping,with,honey,and,butter
the,smell,of,the,bacon,cooking,soon,fetched,duck,up,from,the,hold
he,sniffed,over,the,brazier,received,a,swack,from,ysilla’s,spoon,and,went,back,to,have,his,morning,piss,off,the,stern
tyrion,waddled,over,to,join,him
now,here’s,a,sight,to,see,he,quipped,as,they,were,emptying,their,bladders,a,dwarf,and,a,duck,making,the,mighty,rhoyne,that,much,mightier
yandry,snorted,in,derision
mother,rhoyne,has,no,need,of,your,water,yollo
she,is,the,greatest,river,in,the,world
tyrion,shook,off,the,last,few,drops
big,enough,to,drown,a,dwarf,i,grant,you
the,mander,is,as,broad,though
so,is,the,trident,near,its,mouth
the,blackwater,runs,deeper
you,do,not,know,the,river
wait,and,you,will,see
the,bacon,turned,crisp,the,biscuits,golden,brown
young,griff,stumbled,up,onto,deck,yawning
good,morrow,all
the,lad,was,shorter,than,duck,but,his,lanky,build,suggested,that,he,had,not,yet,come,into,his,full,growth
this,beardless,boy,could,have,any,maiden,in,the,seven,kingdoms,blue,hair,or,no
those,eyes,of,his,would,melt,them
like,his,sire,young,griff,had,blue,eyes,but,where,the,father’s,eyes,were,pale,the,son’s,were,dark
by,lamplight,they,turned,black,and,in,the,light,of,dusk,they,seemed,purple
his,eyelashes,were,as,long,as,any,woman’s
i,smell,bacon,the,lad,said,pulling,on,his,boots
good,bacon,said,ysilla
sit
she,fed,them,on,the,afterdeck,pressing,honeyed,biscuits,on,young,griff,and,hitting,duck’s,hand,with,her,spoon,whenever,he,made,a,grab,for,more,bacon
tyrion,pulled,apart,two,biscuits,filled,them,with,bacon,and,carried,one,to,yandry,at,the,tiller
afterward,he,helped,duck,to,raise,the,shy,maid’s,big,lateen,sail
yandry,took,them,out,into,the,center,of,the,river,where,the,current,was,strongest
the,shy,maid,was,a,sweet,boat
her,draft,was,so,shallow,she,could,work,her,way,up,even,the,smallest,of,the,river’s,vassal,streams,negotiating,sandbars,that,would,have,stranded,larger,vessels,yet,with,her,sail,raised,and,a,current,under,her,she,could,make,good,speed
that,could,mean,life,and,death,on,the,upper,reaches,of,the,rhoyne,yandry,claimed
there,is,no,law,above,the,sorrows,not,for,a,thousand,years
and,no,people,so,far,as,i,can,see
he’d,glimpsed,some,ruins,along,the,banks,piles,of,masonry,overgrown,by,vines,and,moss,and,flowers,but,no,other,signs,of,human,habitation
you,do,not,know,the,river,yollo

the,slave-catchers,seldom,come,so,far,north
slave-catchers,would,be,a,welcome,change,from,turtles
not,being,an,escaped,slave,tyrion,need,not,fear,being,caught
and,no,pirate,was,like,to,bother,a,poleboat,moving,downstream
the,valuable,goods,came,up,the,river,from,volantis
when,the,bacon,was,gone,duck,punched,young,griff,in,the,shoulder
time,to,raise,some,bruises
swords,today,i,think
swords
young,griff,grinned
swords,will,be,sweet
tyrion,helped,him,dress,for,the,bout,in,heavy,breeches,padded,doublet,and,a,dinted,suit,of,old,steel,plate
ser,rolly,shrugged,into,his,mail,and,boiled,leather
both,set,helms,upon,their,heads,and,chose,blunted,longswords,from,the,bundle,in,the,weapons,chest
they,set,to,on,the,afterdeck,having,at,each,other,lustily,whilst,the,rest,of,the,morning,company,looked,on
when,they,fought,with,mace,or,blunted,longaxe,ser,rolly’s,greater,size,and,strength,would,quickly,overwhelm,his,charge,with,swords,the,contests,were,more,even
neither,man,had,taken,up,a,shield,this,morning,so,it,was,a,game,of,slash,and,parry,back,and,forth,across,the,deck
the,river,rang,to,the,sounds,of,their,combat
young,griff,landed,more,blows,though,duck’s,were,harder
after,a,while,the,bigger,man,began,to,tire
his,cuts,came,a,little,slower,a,little,lower
young,griff,turned,them,all,and,launched,a,furious,attack,that,forced,ser,rolly,back
when,they,reached,the,stern,the,lad,tied,up,their,blades,and,slammed,a,shoulder,into,duck,and,the,big,man,went,into,the,river
he,came,up,sputtering,and,cursing,bellowing,for,someone,to,fish,him,out,before,a,’snapper,ate,his,privates
tyrion,tossed,a,line,to,him
ducks,should,swim,better,than,that,he,said,as,he,and,yandry,were,hauling,the,knight,back,aboard,the,shy,maid
ser,rolly,grabbed,tyrion,by,the,collar
let,us,see,how,dwarfs,swim,he,said,chucking,him,headlong,into,the,rhoyne
the,dwarf,laughed,last,he,could,paddle,passably,well,and,did,until,his,legs,began,to,cramp
young,griff,extended,him,a,pole
you,are,not,the,first,to,try,and,drown,me,he,told,duck,as,he,was,pouring,river,water,from,his,boot
my,father,threw,me,down,a,well,the,day,i,was,born,but,i,was,so,ugly,that,the,water,witch,who,lived,down,there,spat,me,back
he,pulled,off,the,other,boot,then,did,a,cartwheel,along,the,deck,spraying,all,of,them
young,griff,laughed
where,did,you,learn,that
the,mummers,taught,me,he,lied
my,mother,loved,me,best,of,all,her,children,because,i,was,so,small
she,nursed,me,at,her,breast,till,i,was,seven
that,made,my,brothers,jealous,so,they,stuffed,me,in,a,sack,and,sold,me,to,a,mummer’s,troupe
when,i,tried,to,run,off,the,master,mummer,cut,off,half,my,nose,so,i,had,no,choice,but,to,go,with,them,and,learn,to,be,amusing
the,truth,was,rather,different
his,uncle,had,taught,him,a,bit,of,tumbling,when,he,was,six,or,seven
tyrion,had,taken,to,it,eagerly
for,half,a,year,he,cartwheeled,his,merry,way,about,casterly,rock,bringing,smiles,to,the,faces,of,septons,squires,and,servants,alike
even,cersei,laughed,to,see,him,once,or,twice
all,that,ended,abruptly,the,day,his,father,returned,from,a,sojourn,in,king’s,landing
that,night,at,supper,tyrion,surprised,his,sire,by,walking,the,length,of,the,high,table,on,his,hands
lord,tywin,was,not,pleased
the,gods,made,you,a,dwarf
must,you,be,a,fool,as,well
you,were,born,a,lion,not,a,monkey
and,you’re,a,corpse,father,so,i’ll,caper,as,i,please
you,have,a,gift,for,making,men,smile,septa,lemore,told,tyrion,as,he,was,drying,off,his,toes
you,should,thank,the,father,above
he,gives,gifts,to,all,his,children
he,does,he,agreed,pleasantly
and,when,i,die,please,let,them,bury,with,me,a,crossbow,so,i,can,thank,the,father,above,for,his,gifts,the,same,way,i,thanked,the,father,below
his,clothing,was,still,soaked,from,his,involuntary,swim,clinging,to,his,arms,and,legs,uncomfortably
whilst,young,griff,went,off,with,septa,lemore,to,be,instructed,in,the,mysteries,of,the,faith,tyrion,stripped,off,the,wet,clothes,and,donned,dry,ones
duck,had,a,good,guffaw,when,he,emerged,on,deck,again
he,could,not,blame,him
dressed,as,he,was,he,made,a,comic,sight
his,doublet,was,divided,down,the,middle,the,left,side,was,purple,velvet,with,bronze,studs,the,right,yellow,wool,embroidered,in,green,floral,patterns
his,breeches,were,similarly,split,the,right,leg,was,solid,green,the,left,leg,striped,in,red,and,white
one,of,illyrio’s,chests,had,been,packed,with,a,child’s,clothing,musty,but,well,made
septa,lemore,had,slit,each,garment,apart,then,sewn,them,back,together,joining,half,of,this,to,half,of,that,to,fashion,a,crude,motley
griff,had,even,insisted,that,tyrion,help,with,the,cutting,and,sewing
no,doubt,he,meant,for,it,to,be,humbling,but,tyrion,enjoyed,the,needlework
lemore,was,always,pleasant,company,despite,her,penchant,for,scolding,him,whenever,he,said,something,rude,about,the,gods
if,griff,wants,to,cast,me,as,the,fool,i’ll,play,the,game
somewhere,he,knew,lord,tywin,lannister,was,horrified,and,that,took,the,sting,from,it
his,other,duty,was,anything,but,foolish
duck,has,his,sword,i,my,quill,and,parchment
griff,had,commanded,him,to,set,down,all,he,knew,of,dragonlore
the,task,was,a,formidable,one,but,the,dwarf,labored,at,it,every,day,scratching,away,as,best,he,could,as,he,sat,cross-legged,on,the,cabin,roof
tyrion,had,read,much,and,more,of,dragons,through,the,years
the,greater,part,of,those,accounts,were,idle,tales,and,could,not,be,relied,on,and,the,books,that,illyrio,had,provided,them,were,not,the,ones,he,might,have,wished,for
what,he,really,wanted,was,the,complete,text,of,the,fires,of,the,freehold,galendro’s,history,of,valyria
no,complete,copy,was,known,to,westeros,however,even,the,citadel’s,lacked,twenty-seven,scrolls
they,must,have,a,library,in,old,volantis,surely
i,may,find,a,better,copy,there,if,i,can,find,a,way,inside,the,black,walls,to,the,city’s,heart
he,was,less,hopeful,concerning,septon,barth’s,dragons,wyrms,and,wyverns,their,unnatural,history
barth,had,been,a,blacksmith’s,son,who,rose,to,be,king’s,hand,during,the,reign,of,jaehaerys,the,conciliator
his,enemies,always,claimed,he,was,more,sorcerer,than,septon
baelor,the,blessed,had,ordered,all,barth’s,writings,destroyed,when,he,came,to,the,iron,throne
ten,years,ago,tyrion,had,read,a,fragment,of,unnatural,history,that,had,eluded,the,blessed,baelor,but,he,doubted,that,any,of,barth’s,work,had,found,its,way,across,the,narrow,sea
and,of,course,there,was,even,less,chance,of,his,coming,on,the,fragmentary,anonymous,blood-soaked,tome,sometimes,called,blood,and,fire,and,sometimes,the,death,of,dragons,the,only,surviving,copy,of,which,was,supposedly,hidden,away,in,a,locked,vault,beneath,the,citadel
when,the,halfmaester,appeared,on,deck,yawning,the,dwarf,was,writing,down,what,he,recalled,concerning,the,mating,habits,of,dragons,on,which,subject,barth,munkun,and,thomax,held,markedly,divergent,views
haldon,stalked,to,the,stern,to,piss,down,at,the,sun,where,it,shimmered,on,the,water,breaking,apart,with,every,puff,of,wind
we,should,reach,the,junction,with,the,noyne,by,evening,yollo,the,halfmaester,called,out
tyrion,glanced,up,from,his,writing
my,name,is,hugor
yollo,is,hiding,in,my,breeches
shall,i,let,him,out,to,play
best,not
you,might,frighten,the,turtles
haldon’s,smile,was,as,sharp,as,the,blade,of,a,dagger
what,did,you,tell,me,was,the,name,of,that,street,in,lannisport,where,you,were,born,yollo
it,was,an,alley
it,had,no,name
tyrion,took,a,mordant,pleasure,in,inventing,the,details,of,the,colorful,life,of,hugor,hill,also,known,as,yollo,a,bastard,out,of,lannisport
the,best,lies,are,seasoned,with,a,bit,of,truth
the,dwarf,knew,he,sounded,like,a,westerman,and,a,highborn,westerman,at,that,so,hugor,must,needs,be,some,lordling’s,byblow
born,in,lannisport,because,he,knew,that,city,better,than,oldtown,or,king’s,landing,and,cities,were,where,most,dwarfs,ended,up,even,those,whelped,by,goodwife,bumpkin,in,the,turnip,patch
the,countryside,had,no,grotesqueries,or,mummer,shows,though,it,did,have,wells,aplenty,to,swallow,up,unwanted,kittens,three-headed,calves,and,babes,like,him
i,see,you,have,been,defacing,more,good,parchment,yollo
haldon,laced,up,his,breeches
not,all,of,us,can,be,half,a,maester
tyrion’s,hand,was,cramping
he,put,his,quill,aside,and,flexed,his,stubby,fingers
fancy,another,game,of,cyvasse
the,halfmaester,always,defeated,him,but,it,was,a,way,to,pass,the,time
this,evening
will,you,join,us,for,young,griff’s,lesson
why,not
someone,needs,to,correct,your,errors
there,were,four,cabins,on,the,shy,maid
yandry,and,ysilla,shared,one,griff,and,young,griff,another
septa,lemore,had,a,cabin,to,herself,as,did,haldon
the,halfmaester’s,cabin,was,the,largest,of,the,four
one,wall,was,lined,with,bookshelves,and,bins,stacked,with,old,scrolls,and,parchments,another,held,racks,of,ointments,herbs,and,potions
golden,light,slanted,through,the,wavy,yellow,glass,of,the,round,window
the,furnishings,included,a,bunk,a,writing,desk,a,chair,a,stool,and,the,halfmaester’s,cyvasse,table,strewn,with,carved,wooden,pieces
the,lesson,began,with,languages
young,griff,spoke,the,common,tongue,as,if,he,had,been,born,to,it,and,was,fluent,in,high,valyrian,the,low,dialects,of,pentos,tyrosh,myr,and,lys,and,the,trade,talk,of,sailors
the,volantene,dialect,was,as,new,to,him,as,it,was,to,tyrion,so,every,day,they,learned,a,few,more,words,whilst,haldon,corrected,their,mistakes
meereenese,was,harder,its,roots,were,valyrian,as,well,but,the,tree,had,been,grafted,onto,the,harsh,ugly,tongue,of,old,ghis
you,need,a,bee,up,your,nose,to,speak,ghiscari,properly,tyrion,complained
young,griff,laughed,but,the,halfmaester,only,said,again
the,boy,obeyed,though,he,rolled,his,eyes,along,with,his,zzzs,this,time
he,has,a,better,ear,than,me,tyrion,was,forced,to,admit,though,i’ll,wager,my,tongue,is,still,more,nimble
geometry,followed,languages
there,the,boy,was,less,adroit,but,haldon,was,a,patient,teacher,and,tyrion,was,able,to,make,himself,of,use,as,well
he,had,learned,the,mysteries,of,squares,and,circles,and,triangles,from,his,father’s,maesters,at,casterly,rock,and,they,came,back,more,quickly,than,he,would,have,thought
by,the,time,they,turned,to,history,young,griff,was,growing,restive
we,were,discussing,the,history,of,volantis,haldon,said,to,him
can,you,tell,yollo,the,difference,between,a,tiger,and,an,elephant
volantis,is,the,oldest,of,the,nine,free,cities,first,daughter,of,valyria,the,lad,replied,in,a,bored,tone
after,the,doom,it,pleased,the,volantenes,to,consider,themselves,the,heirs,of,the,freehold,and,rightful,rulers,of,the,world,but,they,were,divided,as,to,how,dominion,might,best,be,achieved
the,old,blood,favored,the,sword,while,the,merchants,and,moneylenders,advocated,trade
as,they,contended,for,rule,of,the,city,the,factions,became,known,as,the,tigers,and,elephants,respectively
the,tigers,held,sway,for,almost,a,century,after,the,doom,of,valyria
for,a,time,they,were,successful
a,volantene,fleet,took,lys,and,a,volantene,army,captured,myr,and,for,two,generations,all,three,cities,were,ruled,from,within,the,black,walls
that,ended,when,the,tigers,tried,to,swallow,tyrosh
pentos,came,into,the,war,on,the,tyroshi,side,along,with,the,westerosi,storm,king
braavos,provided,a,lyseni,exile,with,a,hundred,warships,aegon,targaryen,flew,forth,from,dragonstone,on,the,black,dread,and,myr,and,lys,rose,up,in,rebellion
the,war,left,the,disputed,lands,a,waste,and,freed,lys,and,myr,from,the,yoke
the,tigers,suffered,other,defeats,as,well
the,fleet,they,sent,to,reclaim,valyria,vanished,in,the,smoking,sea
qohor,and,norvos,broke,their,power,on,the,rhoyne,when,the,fire,galleys,fought,on,dagger,lake
out,of,the,east,came,the,dothraki,driving,smallfolk,from,their,hovels,and,nobles,from,their,estates,until,only,grass,and,ruins,remained,from,the,forest,of,qohor,to,the,headwaters,of,the,selhoru
after,a,century,of,war,volantis,found,herself,broken,bankrupt,and,depopulated
it,was,then,that,the,elephants,rose,up
they,have,held,sway,ever,since
some,years,the,tigers,elect,a,triarch,and,some,years,they,do,not,but,never,more,than,one,so,the,elephants,have,ruled,the,city,for,three,hundred,years
just,so,said,haldon
and,the,present,triarchs
malaquo,is,a,tiger,nyessos,and,doniphos,are,elephants
and,what,lesson,can,we,draw,from,volantene,history
if,you,want,to,conquer,the,world,you,best,have,dragons
tyrion,could,not,help,but,laugh
later,when,young,griff,went,up,on,deck,to,help,yandry,with,the,sails,and,poles,haldon,set,up,his,cyvasse,table,for,their,game
tyrion,watched,with,mismatched,eyes,and,said,the,boy,is,bright
you,have,done,well,by,him
half,the,lords,in,westeros,are,not,so,learned,sad,to,say
languages,history,songs,sums,a,heady,stew,for,some,sellsword’s,son
a,book,can,be,as,dangerous,as,a,sword,in,the,right,hands,said,haldon
try,to,give,me,a,better,battle,this,time,yollo
you,play,cyvasse,as,badly,as,you,tumble
i,am,trying,to,lull,you,into,a,false,sense,of,confidence,said,tyrion,as,they,arranged,their,tiles,on,either,side,of,a,carved,wooden,screen
you,think,you,taught,me,how,to,play,but,things,are,not,always,as,they,seem
perhaps,i,learned,the,game,from,the,cheesemonger,have,you,considered,that
illyrio,does,not,play,cyvasse
no,thought,the,dwarf,he,plays,the,game,of,thrones,and,you,and,griff,and,duck,are,only,pieces,to,be,moved,where,he,will,and,sacrificed,at,need,just,as,he,sacrificed,viserys
the,blame,must,fall,on,you,then
if,i,play,badly,it,is,your,doing
the,halfmaester,chuckled
yollo,i,shall,miss,you,when,the,pirates,cut,your,throat
where,are,these,famous,pirates
i,am,beginning,to,think,that,you,and,illyrio,made,them,all,up
they,are,thickest,on,the,stretch,of,river,between,ar,noy,and,the,sorrows
above,the,ruins,of,ar,noy,the,qohorik,rule,the,river,and,below,the,sorrows,the,galleys,of,volantis,hold,sway,but,neither,city,claims,the,waters,in,between,so,the,pirates,have,made,it,their,own
dagger,lake,is,full,of,islands,where,they,lurk,in,hidden,caves,and,secret,strongholds
are,you,ready
for,you
beyond,a,doubt
for,the,pirates
less,so
haldon,removed,the,screen
each,of,them,contemplated,the,other’s,opening,array
you,are,learning,the,halfmaester,said
tyrion,almost,grabbed,his,dragon,but,thought,better,of,it
last,game,he,had,brought,her,out,too,soon,and,lost,her,to,a,trebuchet
if,we,do,meet,these,fabled,pirates,i,may,join,up,with,them
i’ll,tell,them,that,my,name,is,hugor,halfmaester
he,moved,his,light,horse,toward,haldon’s,mountains
haldon,answered,with,an,elephant
hugor,halfwit,would,suit,you,better
i,only,need,half,my,wits,to,be,a,match,for,you
tyrion,moved,up,his,heavy,horse,to,support,the,light
perhaps,you,would,care,to,wager,on,the,outcome
the,halfmaester,arched,an,eyebrow
how,much
i,have,no,coin
we’ll,play,for,secrets
griff,would,cut,my,tongue,out
afraid,are,you
i,would,be,if,i,were,you
the,day,you,defeat,me,at,cyvasse,will,be,the,day,turtles,crawl,out,my,arse
the,halfmaester,moved,his,spears
you,have,your,wager,little,man
tyrion,stretched,a,hand,out,for,his,dragon
it,was,three,hours,later,when,the,little,man,finally,crept,back,up,on,deck,to,empty,his,bladder
duck,was,helping,yandry,wrestle,down,the,sail,while,ysilla,took,the,tiller
the,sun,hung,low,above,the,reed-beds,along,the,western,bank,as,the,wind,began,to,gust,and,rip
i,need,that,skin,of,wine,the,dwarf,thought
his,legs,were,cramped,from,squatting,on,that,stool,and,he,felt,so,light-headed,that,he,was,lucky,not,to,fall,into,the,river
yollo,duck,called
where’s,haldon
he’s,taken,to,his,bed,in,some,discomfort
there,are,turtles,crawling,out,his,arse
he,left,the,knight,to,sort,that,out,and,crawled,up,the,ladder,to,the,cabin,roof
off,to,the,east,there,was,darkness,gathering,behind,a,rocky,island
septa,lemore,found,him,there
can,you,feel,the,storms,in,the,air,hugor,hill
dagger,lake,is,ahead,of,us,where,pirates,prowl
and,beyond,that,lie,the,sorrows
not,mine
i,carry,mine,own,sorrows,with,me,everywhere,i,go
he,thought,of,tysha,and,wondered,where,whores,go
why,not,volantis
perhaps,i’ll,find,her,there
a,man,should,cling,to,hope
he,wondered,what,he,would,say,to,her
i,am,sorry,that,i,let,them,rape,you,love
i,thought,you,were,a,whore
can,you,find,it,in,your,heart,to,forgive,me
i,want,to,go,back,to,our,cottage,to,the,way,it,was,when,we,were,man,and,wife
the,island,fell,away,behind,them
tyrion,saw,ruins,rising,along,the,eastern,bank,crooked,walls,and,fallen,towers,broken,domes,and,rows,of,rotted,wooden,pillars,streets,choked,by,mud,and,overgrown,with,purple,moss
another,dead,city,ten,times,as,large,as,ghoyan,drohe
turtles,lived,there,now,big,bonesnappers
the,dwarf,could,see,them,basking,in,the,sun,brown,and,black,hummocks,with,jagged,ridges,down,the,center,of,their,shells
a,few,saw,the,shy,maid,and,slid,down,into,the,water,leaving,ripples,in,their,wake
this,would,not,be,a,good,place,for,a,swim
then,through,the,twisted,half-drowned,trees,and,wide,wet,streets,he,glimpsed,the,silvery,sheen,of,sunlight,upon,water
another,river,he,knew,at,once,rushing,toward,the,rhoyne
the,ruins,grew,taller,as,the,land,grew,narrower,until,the,city,ended,on,a,point,of,land,where,stood,the,remains,of,a,colossal,palace,of,pink,and,green,marble,its,collapsed,domes,and,broken,spires,looming,large,above,a,row,of,covered,archways
tyrion,saw,more,’snappers,sleeping,in,the,slips,where,half,a,hundred,ships,might,once,have,docked
he,knew,where,he,was,then
that,was,nymeria’s,palace,and,this,is,all,that,remains,of,ny,sar,her,city
yollo,shouted,yandry,as,the,shy,maid,passed,the,point,tell,me,again,of,those,westerosi,rivers,as,big,as,mother,rhoyne

no,river,in,the,seven,kingdoms,is,half,so,wide,as,this
the,new,river,that,had,joined,them,was,a,close,twin,to,the,one,they,had,been,sailing,down,and,that,one,alone,had,almost,matched,the,mander,or,the,trident
this,is,ny,sar,where,the,mother,gathers,in,her,wild,daughter,noyne,said,yandry,but,she,will,not,reach,her,widest,point,until,she,meets,her,other,daughters
at,dagger,lake,the,qhoyne,comes,rushing,in,the,darkling,daughter,full,of,gold,and,amber,from,the,axe,and,pine-cones,from,the,forest,of,qohor

where,they,join,once,stood,chroyane,the,festival,city,where,the,streets,were,made,of,water,and,the,houses,made,of,gold
then,south,and,east,again,for,long,leagues,until,at,last,comes,creeping,in,selhoru,the,shy,daughter,who,hides,her,course,in,reeds,and,writhes

he,was,about,to,point,it,out,to,lemore,when,it,came,to,the,surface,with,a,wash,of,water,that,rocked,the,shy,maid,sideways
it,was,another,turtle,a,horned,turtle,of,enormous,size,its,dark,green,shell,mottled,with,brown,and,overgrown,with,water,moss,and,crusty,black,river,molluscs

davos,the,merry,midwife,stole,into,white,harbor,on,the,evening,tide,her,patched,sail,rippling,with,every,gust,of,wind
she,was,an,old,cog,and,even,in,her,youth,no,one,had,ever,called,her,pretty
her,figurehead,showed,a,laughing,woman,holding,an,infant,by,one,foot,but,the,woman’s,cheeks,and,the,babe’s,bottom,were,both,pocked,by,wormholes
uncounted,layers,of,drab,brown,paint,covered,her,hull,her,sails,were,grey,and,tattered
she,was,not,a,ship,to,draw,a,second,glance,unless,it,was,to,wonder,how,she,stayed,afloat
the,merry,midwife,was,known,in,white,harbor,too
for,years,she,had,plied,a,humble,trade,between,there,and,sisterton
it,was,not,the,sort,of,arrival,that,davos,seaworth,had,anticipated,when,he’d,set,sail,with,salla,and,his,fleet
all,this,had,seemed,simpler,then
the,ravens,had,not,brought,king,stannis,the,allegiance,of,white,harbor,so,his,grace,would,send,an,envoy,to,treat,with,lord,manderly,in,person
as,a,show,of,strength,davos,would,arrive,aboard,salla’s,galleas,valyrian,with,the,rest,of,the,lysene,fleet,behind,her
every,hull,was,striped,black,and,yellow,pink,and,blue,green,and,white,purple,and,gold
the,lyseni,loved,bright,hues,and,salladhor,saan,was,the,most,colorful,of,all
salladhor,the,splendid,davos,thought,but,the,storms,wrote,an,end,to,all,of,that
instead,he,would,smuggle,himself,into,the,city,as,he,might,have,done,twenty,years,before
until,he,knew,how,matters,stood,here,it,was,more,prudent,to,play,the,common,sailor,not,the,lord
white,harbor’s,walls,of,whitewashed,stone,rose,before,them,on,the,eastern,shore,where,the,white,knife,plunged,into,the,firth
some,of,the,city’s,defenses,had,been,strengthened,since,the,last,time,davos,had,been,here,half,a,dozen,years,before
the,jetty,that,divided,the,inner,and,outer,harbors,had,been,fortified,with,a,long,stone,wall,thirty,feet,tall,and,almost,a,mile,long,with,towers,every,hundred,yards
there,was,smoke,rising,from,seal,rock,as,well,where,once,there,had,been,only,ruins
that,could,be,good,or,bad,depending,on,what,side,lord,wyman,chooses
davos,had,always,been,fond,of,this,city,since,first,he’d,come,here,as,a,cabin,boy,on,cobblecat
though,small,compared,to,oldtown,and,king’s,landing,it,was,clean,and,well-ordered,with,wide,straight,cobbled,streets,that,made,it,easy,for,a,man,to,find,his,way
the,houses,were,built,of,whitewashed,stone,with,steeply,pitched,roofs,of,dark,grey,slate
roro,uhoris,the,cobblecat’s,cranky,old,master,used,to,claim,that,he,could,tell,one,port,from,another,just,by,the,way,they,smelled
cities,were,like,women,he,insisted,each,one,had,its,own,unique,scent
oldtown,was,as,flowery,as,a,perfumed,dowager
lannisport,was,a,milkmaid,fresh,and,earthy,with,woodsmoke,in,her,hair
king’s,landing,reeked,like,some,unwashed,whore
but,white,harbor’s,scent,was,sharp,and,salty,and,a,little,fishy,too
she,smells,the,way,a,mermaid,ought,to,smell,roro,said
she,smells,of,the,sea
she,still,does,thought,davos,but,he,could,smell,the,peat,smoke,drifting,off,seal,rock,too
the,sea,stone,dominated,the,approaches,to,the,outer,harbor,a,massive,grey-green,upthrust,looming,fifty,feet,above,the,waters
its,top,was,crowned,with,a,circle,of,weathered,stones,a,ringfort,of,the,first,men,that,had,stood,desolate,and,abandoned,for,hundreds,of,years
it,was,not,abandoned,now
davos,could,see,scorpions,and,spitfires,behind,the,standing,stones,and,crossbowmen,peering,between,them
it,must,be,cold,up,there,and,wet
on,all,his,previous,visits,seals,could,be,seen,basking,on,the,broken,rocks,below
the,blind,bastard,always,made,him,count,them,whenever,the,cobblecat,set,sail,from,white,harbor,the,more,seals,there,were,roro,said,the,more,luck,they,would,have,on,their,voyage
there,were,no,seals,now
the,smoke,and,the,soldiers,had,frightened,them,away
a,wiser,man,would,see,a,caution,in,that
if,i,had,a,thimble,full,of,sense,i,would,have,gone,with,salla
he,could,have,made,his,way,back,south,to,marya,and,their,sons
i,have,lost,four,sons,in,the,king’s,service,and,my,fifth,serves,as,his,squire
i,should,have,the,right,to,cherish,the,two,boys,who,still,remain
it,has,been,too,long,since,i,saw,them
at,eastwatch,the,black,brothers,told,him,there,was,no,love,between,the,manderlys,of,white,harbor,and,the,boltons,of,the,dreadfort
the,iron,throne,had,raised,roose,bolton,up,to,warden,of,the,north,so,it,stood,to,reason,that,wyman,manderly,should,declare,for,stannis
white,harbor,cannot,stand,alone
the,city,needs,an,ally,a,protector
lord,wyman,needs,king,stannis,as,much,as,stannis,needs,him
or,so,it,seemed,at,eastwatch
sisterton,had,undermined,those,hopes
if,lord,borrell,told,it,true,if,the,manderlys,meant,to,join,their,strength,to,the,boltons,and,the,freys,no,he,would,not,dwell,on,that
he,would,know,the,truth,soon,enough
he,prayed,he,had,not,come,too,late
that,jetty,wall,conceals,the,inner,harbor,he,realized,as,the,merry,midwife,was,pulling,down,her,sail
the,outer,harbor,was,larger,but,the,inner,harbor,offered,better,anchorage,sheltered,by,the,city,wall,on,one,side,and,the,looming,mass,of,the,wolf’s,den,on,another,and,now,by,the,jetty,wall,as,well
at,eastwatch-by-the-sea,cotter,pyke,told,davos,that,lord,wyman,was,building,war,galleys
there,could,have,been,a,score,of,ships,concealed,behind,those,walls,waiting,only,a,command,to,put,to,sea
behind,the,city’s,thick,white,walls,the,new,castle,rose,proud,and,pale,upon,its,hill
davos,could,see,the,domed,roof,of,the,sept,of,the,snows,as,well,surmounted,by,tall,statues,of,the,seven
the,manderlys,had,brought,the,faith,north,with,them,when,they,were,driven,from,the,reach
white,harbor,had,its,godswood,too,a,brooding,tangle,of,root,and,branch,and,stone,locked,away,behind,the,crumbling,black,walls,of,the,wolf’s,den,an,ancient,fortress,that,served,only,as,a,prison,now
but,for,the,most,part,the,septons,ruled,here
the,merman,of,house,manderly,was,everywhere,in,evidence,flying,from,the,towers,of,the,new,castle,above,the,seal,gate,and,along,the,city,walls
at,eastwatch,the,northmen,insisted,that,white,harbor,would,never,abandon,its,allegiance,to,winterfell,but,davos,saw,no,sign,of,the,direwolf,of,stark
there,are,no,lions,either
lord,wyman,cannot,have,declared,for,tommen,yet,or,he,would,have,raised,his,standard
the,dockside,wharves,were,swarming
a,clutter,of,small,boats,were,tied,up,along,the,fish,market,off-loading,their,catches
he,saw,three,river,runners,too,long,lean,boats,built,tough,to,brave,the,swift,currents,and,rocky,shoots,of,the,white,knife
it,was,the,seagoing,vessels,that,interested,him,most,however,a,pair,of,carracks,as,drab,and,tattered,as,the,merry,midwife,the,trading,galley,storm,dancer,the,cogs,brave,magister,and,horn,of,plenty,a,galleas,from,braavos,marked,by,her,purple,hull,and,sails,and,there,beyond,the,warship
the,sight,of,her,sent,a,knife,through,his,hopes
her,hull,was,black,and,gold,her,figurehead,a,lion,with,an,upraised,paw
lionstar,read,the,letters,on,her,stern,beneath,a,fluttering,banner,that,bore,the,arms,of,the,boy,king,on,the,iron,throne
a,year,ago,he,would,not,have,been,able,to,read,them,but,maester,pylos,had,taught,him,some,of,the,letters,back,on,dragonstone
for,once,the,reading,gave,him,little,pleasure
davos,had,been,praying,that,the,galley,had,been,lost,in,the,same,storms,that,had,ravaged,salla’s,fleet,but,the,gods,had,not,been,so,kind
the,freys,were,here,and,he,would,need,to,face,them
the,merry,midwife,tied,up,to,the,end,of,a,weathered,wooden,pier,in,the,outer,harbor,well,away,from,lionstar
as,her,crew,made,her,fast,to,the,pilings,and,lowered,a,gangplank,her,captain,sauntered,up,to,davos

it,made,him,look,like,a,tree,stump,in,yellow,boots
despite,his,appearance,he,seemed,a,good,sailor,though,a,hard,master,to,his,crew
how,long,will,you,be,gone
a,day,at,least
it,may,be,longer

a,pair,of,customs,men,were,clambering,aboard,as,he,went,down,the,gangplank,but,neither,gave,him,so,much,as,a,glance
they,were,there,to,see,the,captain,and,inspect,the,hold,common,seamen,did,not,concern,them,and,few,men,looked,as,common,as,davos
he,was,of,middling,height,his,shrewd,peasant’s,face,weathered,by,wind,and,sun,his,grizzled,beard,and,brown,hair,well,salted,with,grey

davos,hardly,looked,a,lord,much,less,a,king’s,hand
that,was,all,to,the,good,until,he,knew,how,matters,stood,here
he,made,his,way,along,the,wharf,and,through,the,fish,market

when,davos,shook,his,head,the,woman,said,something,that,made,her,companions,laugh
after,that,none,of,them,paid,him,any,mind

they,have,been,dancing,since,they,were,old,enough,to,walk
how,else,to,achieve,such,perfection
he,took,a,swallow,of,his,wine
they,are,expert,in,all,the,erotic,arts,as,well
i,had,thought,to,make,your,grace,a,gift,of,them
by,all,means
dany,was,unsurprised
i,shall,free,them
that,made,him,wince
and,what,would,they,do,with,freedom
as,well,give,a,fish,a,suit,of,mail
they,were,made,to,dance
made,by,who
their,masters
perhaps,your,dancers,would,sooner,build,or,bake,or,farm
have,you,asked,them
perhaps,your,elephants,would,sooner,be,nightingales
instead,of,sweet,song,meereen’s,nights,would,be,filled,with,thunderous,trumpetings,and,your,trees,would,shatter,beneath,the,weight,of,great,grey,birds
xaro,sighed
daenerys,my,delight,beneath,that,sweet,young,breast,beats,a,tender,heart,but,take,counsel,from,an,older,wiser,head
things,are,not,always,as,they,seem
much,that,may,seem,evil,can,be,good
consider,rain
rain
does,he,take,me,for,a,fool,or,just,a,child
we,curse,the,rain,when,it,falls,upon,our,heads,yet,without,it,we,should,starve
the,world,needs,rain,and,slaves
you,make,a,face,but,it,is,true
consider,qarth
in,art,music,magic,trade,all,that,makes,us,more,than,beasts,qarth,sits,above,the,rest,of,mankind,as,you,sit,at,the,summit,of,this,pyramid,but,below,in,place,of,bricks,the,magnificence,that,is,the,queen,of,cities,rests,upon,the,backs,of,slaves
ask,yourself,if,all,men,must,grub,in,the,dirt,for,food,how,shall,any,man,lift,his,eyes,to,contemplate,the,stars
if,each,of,us,must,break,his,back,to,build,a,hovel,who,shall,raise,the,temples,to,glorify,the,gods
for,some,men,to,be,great,others,must,be,enslaved
he,was,too,eloquent,for,her
dany,had,no,answer,for,him,only,the,raw,feeling,in,her,belly
slavery,is,not,the,same,as,rain,she,insisted
i,have,been,rained,on,and,i,have,been,sold
it,is,not,the,same
no,man,wants,to,be,owned
xaro,gave,a,languid,shrug
as,it,happens,when,i,came,ashore,in,your,sweet,city,i,chanced,to,see,upon,the,riverbank,a,man,who,had,once,been,a,guest,in,my,manse,a,merchant,who,dealt,in,rare,spices,and,choice,wines
he,was,naked,from,the,waist,up,red,and,peeling,and,seemed,to,be,digging,a,hole
not,a,hole
a,ditch,to,bring,water,from,the,river,to,the,fields
we,mean,to,plant,beans
the,beanfields,must,have,water
how,kind,of,my,old,friend,to,help,with,the,digging
and,how,very,unlike,him
is,it,possible,he,was,given,no,choice,in,the,matter
no,surely,not
you,have,no,slaves,in,meereen
dany,flushed
your,friend,is,being,paid,with,food,and,shelter
i,cannot,give,him,back,his,wealth
meereen,needs,beans,more,than,it,needs,rare,spices,and,beans,require,water
would,you,set,my,dancers,to,digging,ditches,as,well
sweet,queen,when,he,saw,me,my,old,friend,fell,to,his,knees,and,begged,me,to,buy,him,as,a,slave,and,take,him,back,to,qarth
she,felt,as,if,he’d,slapped,her
buy,him,then
if,it,please,you
i,know,it,will,please,him
he,put,his,hand,upon,her,arm
there,are,truths,only,a,friend,may,tell,you
i,helped,you,when,you,came,to,qarth,a,beggar,and,i,have,crossed,long,leagues,and,stormy,seas,to,help,you,once,again
is,there,some,place,where,we,might,speak,frankly
dany,could,feel,the,warmth,of,his,fingers
he,was,warm,in,qarth,as,well,she,recalled,until,the,day,he,had,no,more,use,for,me
she,rose,to,her,feet
come,she,said,and,xaro,followed,her,through,the,pillars,to,the,wide,marble,steps,that,led,up,to,her,private,chambers,at,the,apex,of,the,pyramid
oh,most,beautiful,of,women,xaro,said,as,they,began,to,climb,there,are,footsteps,behind,us
we,are,followed
my,old,knight,does,not,frighten,you,surely
ser,barristan,is,sworn,to,keep,my,secrets
she,took,him,out,onto,the,terrace,that,overlooked,the,city
a,full,moon,swam,in,the,black,sky,above,meereen
shall,we,walk
dany,slipped,her,arm,through,his
the,air,was,heavy,with,the,scent,of,night-blooming,flowers
you,spoke,of,help
trade,with,me,then
meereen,has,salt,to,sell,and,wine,ghiscari,wine
xaro,made,a,sour,face
the,sea,provides,all,the,salt,that,qarth,requires,but,i,would,gladly,take,as,many,olives,as,you,cared,to,sell,me
olive,oil,as,well
i,have,none,to,offer
the,slavers,burned,the,trees
olives,had,been,grown,along,the,shores,of,slaver’s,bay,for,centuries,but,the,meereenese,had,put,their,ancient,groves,to,the,torch,as,dany’s,host,advanced,on,them,leaving,her,to,cross,a,blackened,wasteland
we,are,replanting,but,it,takes,seven,years,before,an,olive,tree,begins,to,bear,and,thirty,years,before,it,can,truly,be,called,productive
what,of,copper
a,pretty,metal,but,fickle,as,a,woman
gold,now,gold,is,sincere
qarth,will,gladly,give,you,gold,for,slaves
meereen,is,a,free,city,of,free,men
a,poor,city,that,once,was,rich
a,hungry,city,that,once,was,fat
a,bloody,city,that,once,was,peaceful
his,accusations,stung
there,was,too,much,truth,in,them
meereen,will,be,rich,and,fat,and,peaceful,once,again,and,free,as,well
go,to,the,dothraki,if,you,must,have,slaves
dothraki,make,slaves,ghiscari,train,them
and,to,reach,qarth,the,horselords,must,needs,drive,their,captives,across,the,red,waste
hundreds,would,die,if,not,thousands,and,many,horses,too,which,is,why,no,khal,will,risk,it
and,there,is,this,qarth,wants,no,khalasars,seething,round,our,walls
the,stench,of,all,those,horses,meaning,no,offense,khaleesi
a,horse,has,an,honest,smell
that,is,more,than,can,be,said,of,some,great,lords,and,merchant,princes
xaro,took,no,notice,of,the,sally
daenerys,let,me,be,honest,with,you,as,befits,a,friend
you,will,not,make,meereen,rich,and,fat,and,peaceful
you,will,only,bring,it,to,destruction,as,you,did,astapor
you,are,aware,that,there,was,battle,joined,at,the,horns,of,hazzat
the,butcher,king,has,fled,back,to,his,palace,his,new,unsullied,running,at,his,heels
this,is,known
brown,ben,plumm,had,sent,back,word,of,the,battle,from,the,field
the,yunkai’i,have,bought,themselves,new,sellswords,and,two,legions,from,new,ghis,fought,beside,them
two,will,soon,become,four,then,ten
and,yunkish,envoys,have,been,sent,to,myr,and,volantis,to,hire,more,blades
the,company,of,the,cat,the,long,lances,the,windblown
some,say,that,the,wise,masters,have,bought,the,golden,company,as,well
her,brother,viserys,had,once,feasted,the,captains,of,the,golden,company,in,hopes,they,might,take,up,his,cause
they,ate,his,food,and,heard,his,pleas,and,laughed,at,him
dany,had,only,been,a,little,girl,but,she,remembered
i,have,sellswords,too
two,companies
the,yunkai’i,will,send,twenty,against,you,if,they,must
and,when,they,march,they,will,not,march,alone
tolos,and,mantarys,have,agreed,to,an,alliance
that,was,ill,news,if,true
daenerys,had,sent,missions,to,tolos,and,mantarys,hoping,to,find,new,friends,to,the,west,to,balance,the,enmity,of,yunkai,to,the,south
her,envoys,had,not,returned
meereen,has,made,alliance,with,lhazar
that,only,made,him,chuckle
the,dothraki,horselords,call,the,lhazarene,the,lamb,men
when,you,shear,them,all,they,do,is,bleat
they,are,not,a,martial,people
even,a,sheepish,friend,is,better,than,none
the,wise,masters,should,follow,their,example
i,spared,yunkai,before,but,i,will,not,make,that,mistake,again
if,they,should,dare,attack,me,this,time,i,shall,raze,their,yellow,city,to,the,ground
and,whilst,you,are,razing,yunkai,my,sweet,meereen,shall,rise,behind,you
do,not,close,your,eyes,to,your,peril,daenerys
your,eunuchs,are,fine,soldiers,but,they,are,too,few,to,match,the,hosts,that,yunkai,will,send,against,you,once,astapor,has,fallen
my,freedman,dany,started
bedslaves,barbers,and,brickmakers,win,no,battles
he,was,wrong,in,that,she,hoped
the,freedmen,had,been,a,rabble,once,but,she,had,organized,the,men,of,fighting,age,into,companies,and,commanded,grey,worm,to,make,them,into,soldiers
let,him,think,what,he,will
have,you,forgotten
i,have,dragons
do,you
in,qarth,you,were,seldom,seen,without,a,dragon,on,your,shoulder,yet,now,that,shapely,shoulder,is,as,fair,and,bare,as,your,sweet,breast,i,observe
my,dragons,have,grown,my,shoulders,have,not
they,range,far,afield,hunting
hazzea,forgive,me
she,wondered,how,much,xaro,knew,what,whispers,he,had,heard
ask,the,good,masters,of,astapor,about,my,dragons,if,you,doubt,them
i,saw,a,slaver’s,eyes,melt,and,go,running,down,his,cheeks
tell,me,true,old,friend,why,did,you,seek,me,out,if,not,to,trade
to,bring,a,gift,for,the,queen,of,my,heart
say,on
what,trap,is,this,now
the,gift,you,begged,of,me,in,qarth
ships
there,are,thirteen,galleys,in,the,bay
yours,if,you,will,have,them
i,have,brought,you,a,fleet,to,carry,you,home,to,westeros
a,fleet
it,was,more,than,she,could,hope,for,so,of,course,it,made,her,wary
in,qarth,xaro,had,offered,her,thirty,ships,for,a,dragon
and,what,price,do,you,ask,for,these,ships
none
i,no,longer,lust,for,dragons
i,saw,their,work,at,astapor,on,my,way,here,when,my,silken,cloud,put,in,for,water
the,ships,are,yours,sweet,queen
thirteen,galleys,and,men,to,pull,the,oars
thirteen
to,be,sure
xaro,was,one,of,the,thirteen
no,doubt,he,had,convinced,each,of,his,fellow,members,to,give,up,one,ship
she,knew,the,merchant,prince,too,well,to,think,that,he,would,sacrifice,thirteen,of,his,own,ships
i,must,consider,this
may,i,inspect,these,ships
you,have,grown,suspicious,daenerys
always
i,have,grown,wise,xaro
inspect,all,you,wish
when,you,are,satisfied,swear,to,me,that,you,shall,return,to,westeros,forthwith,and,the,ships,are,yours
swear,by,your,dragons,and,your,seven-faced,god,and,the,ashes,of,your,fathers,and,go
and,if,i,should,decide,to,wait,a,year,or,three
a,mournful,look,crossed,xaro’s,face
that,would,make,me,very,sad,my,sweet,delight,for,young,and,strong,as,you,now,seem,you,shall,not,live,so,long
not,here
he,offers,the,honeycomb,with,one,hand,and,shows,the,whip,with,the,other
the,yunkai’i,are,not,so,fearsome,as,all,that
not,all,your,enemies,are,in,the,yellow,city
beware,men,with,cold,hearts,and,blue,lips
you,had,not,been,gone,from,qarth,a,fortnight,when,pyat,pree,set,out,with,three,of,his,fellow,warlocks,to,seek,for,you,in,pentos
dany,was,more,amused,than,afraid
it,is,good,i,turned,aside,then
pentos,is,half,a,world,from,meereen
this,is,so,he,allowed,yet,soon,or,late,word,must,reach,them,of,the,dragon,queen,of,slaver’s,bay
is,that,meant,to,frighten,me
i,lived,in,fear,for,fourteen,years,my,lord
i,woke,afraid,each,morning,and,went,to,sleep,afraid,each,night,but,my,fears,were,burned,away,the,day,i,came,forth,from,the,fire
only,one,thing,frightens,me,now
and,what,is,it,that,you,fear,sweet,queen
i,am,only,a,foolish,young,girl
dany,rose,on,her,toes,and,kissed,his,cheek
but,not,so,foolish,as,to,tell,you,that
my,men,shall,look,at,these,ships
then,you,shall,have,my,answer
as,you,say
he,touched,her,bare,breast,lightly,and,whispered,let,me,stay,and,help,persuade,you
for,a,moment,she,was,tempted
perhaps,the,dancers,had,stirred,her,after,all
i,could,close,my,eyes,and,pretend,that,he,was,daario
a,dream,daario,would,be,safer,than,the,real,one
but,she,pushed,the,thought,aside
no,my,lord
i,thank,you,but,no
dany,slipped,from,his,arms
some,other,night,perhaps
some,other,night
his,mouth,was,sad,but,his,eyes,seemed,more,relieved,than,disappointed
if,i,were,a,dragon,i,could,fly,to,westeros,she,thought,when,he,was,gone
i,would,have,no,need,of,xaro,or,his,ships
dany,wondered,how,many,men,thirteen,galleys,could,hold
it,had,taken,three,to,carry,her,and,her,khalasar,from,qarth,to,astapor,but,that,was,before,she,had,acquired,eight,thousand,unsullied,a,thousand,sellswords,and,a,vast,horde,of,freedmen
and,the,dragons,what,am,i,to,do,with,them
drogon,she,whispered,softly,where,are,you
for,a,moment,she,could,almost,see,him,sweeping,across,the,sky,his,black,wings,swallowing,the,stars
she,turned,her,back,upon,the,night,to,where,barristan,selmy,stood,silent,in,the,shadows
my,brother,once,told,me,a,westerosi,riddle
who,listens,to,everything,yet,hears,nothing
a,knight,of,the,kingsguard
selmy’s,voice,was,solemn
you,heard,xaro,make,his,offer
i,did,your,grace
the,old,knight,took,pains,not,to,look,at,her,bare,breast,as,he,spoke,to,her
ser,jorah,would,not,turn,his,eyes,away
he,loved,me,as,a,woman,where,ser,barristan,loves,me,only,as,his,queen
mormont,had,been,an,informer,reporting,to,her,enemies,in,westeros,yet,he,had,given,her,good,counsel,too
what,do,you,think,of,it
of,him
of,him,little,and,less
these,ships,though,your,grace,with,these,ships,we,might,be,home,before,year’s,end
dany,had,never,known,a,home
in,braavos,there,had,been,a,house,with,a,red,door,but,that,was,all
beware,of,qartheen,bearing,gifts,especially,merchants,of,the,thirteen
there,is,some,trap,here
perhaps,these,ships,are,rotten,or,if,they,were,so,unseaworthy,they,could,not,have,crossed,the,sea,from,qarth,ser,barristan,pointed,out,but,your,grace,was,wise,to,insist,upon,inspection
i,will,take,admiral,groleo,to,the,galleys,at,first,light,with,his,captains,and,two,score,of,his,sailors
we,can,crawl,over,every,inch,of,those,ships
it,was,good,counsel
yes,make,it,so
westeros
home
but,if,she,left,what,would,happen,to,her,city
meereen,was,never,your,city,her,brother’s,voice,seemed,to,whisper
your,cities,are,across,the,sea
your,seven,kingdoms,where,your,enemies,await,you
you,were,born,to,serve,them,blood,and,fire
ser,barristan,cleared,his,throat,and,said,this,warlock,that,the,merchant,spoke,of,pyat,pree
she,tried,to,recall,his,face,but,all,she,could,see,were,his,lips
the,wine,of,the,warlocks,had,turned,them,blue
shade-of-the-evening,it,was,called
if,a,warlock’s,spell,could,kill,me,i,would,be,dead,by,now
i,left,their,palace,all,in,ashes
drogon,saved,me,when,they,would,have,drained,my,life,from,me
drogon,burned,them,all
as,you,say,your,grace
still
i,will,be,watchful
she,kissed,him,on,the,cheek
i,know,you,will
come,walk,me,back,down,to,the,feast
the,next,morning,dany,woke,as,full,of,hope,as,she,had,been,since,first,she,came,to,slaver’s,bay
daario,would,soon,be,at,her,side,once,more,and,together,they,would,sail,for,westeros
for,home
one,of,her,young,hostages,brought,her,morning,meal,a,plump,shy,girl,named,mezzara,whose,father,ruled,the,pyramid,of,merreq,and,dany,gave,her,a,happy,hug,and,thanked,her,with,a,kiss
xaro,xhoan,daxos,has,offered,me,thirteen,galleys,she,told,irri,and,jhiqui,as,they,were,dressing,her,for,court
thirteen,is,a,bad,number,khaleesi,murmured,jhiqui,in,the,dothraki,tongue
it,is,known
it,is,known,irri,agreed
thirty,would,be,better,daenerys,agreed
three,hundred,better,still
but,thirteen,may,suffice,to,carry,us,to,westeros
the,two,dothraki,girls,exchanged,a,look
the,poison,water,is,accursed,khaleesi,said,irri
horses,cannot,drink,it
i,do,not,intend,to,drink,it,dany,promised,them
only,four,petitioners,awaited,her,that,morning
as,ever,lord,ghael,was,the,first,to,present,himself,looking,even,more,wretched,than,usual
your,radiance,he,moaned,as,he,fell,to,the,marble,at,her,feet,the,armies,of,the,yunkai’i,descend,on,astapor
i,beg,you,come,south,with,all,your,strength
i,warned,your,king,that,this,war,of,his,was,folly,dany,reminded,him
he,would,not,listen
great,cleon,sought,only,to,strike,down,the,vile,slavers,of,yunkai
great,cleon,is,a,slaver,himself
i,know,that,the,mother,of,dragons,will,not,abandon,us,in,our,hour,of,peril
lend,us,your,unsullied,to,defend,our,walls
and,if,i,do,who,will,defend,my,walls
many,of,my,freedmen,were,slaves,in,astapor
perhaps,some,will,wish,to,help,defend,your,king
that,is,their,choice,as,free,men
i,gave,astapor,its,freedom
it,is,up,to,you,to,defend,it
we,are,all,dead,then
you,gave,us,death,not,freedom
ghael,leapt,to,his,feet,and,spat,into,her,face
strong,belwas,seized,him,by,the,shoulder,and,slammed,him,down,onto,the,marble,so,hard,that,dany,heard,ghael’s,teeth,crack
the,shavepate,would,have,done,worse,but,she,stopped,him
enough,she,said,dabbing,at,her,cheek,with,the,end,of,her,tokar
no,one,has,ever,died,from,spittle
take,him,away
they,dragged,him,out,feet,first,leaving,several,broken,teeth,and,a,trail,of,blood,behind
dany,would,gladly,have,sent,the,rest,of,the,petitioners,away,but,she,was,still,their,queen,so,she,heard,them,out,and,did,her,best,to,give,them,justice
late,that,afternoon,admiral,groleo,and,ser,barristan,returned,from,their,inspection,of,the,galleys
dany,assembled,her,council,to,hear,them
grey,worm,was,there,for,the,unsullied,skahaz,mo,kandaq,for,the,brazen,beasts
in,the,absence,of,her,bloodriders,a,wizened,jaqqa,rhan,called,rommo,squint-eyed,and,bowlegged,came,to,speak,for,her,dothraki

reznak,mo,reznak,hovered,at,the,queen’s,elbow,and,strong,belwas,stood,behind,her,with,his,huge,arms,crossed
dany,would,not,lack,for,counsel
groleo,had,been,a,most,unhappy,man,since,they,had,broken,up,his,ship,to,build,the,siege,engines,that,won,meereen,for,her
dany,had,tried,to,console,him,by,naming,him,her,lord,admiral,but,it,was,a,hollow,honor,the,meereenese,fleet,had,sailed,for,yunkai,when,dany’s,host,approached,the,city,so,the,old,pentoshi,was,an,admiral,without,ships
yet,now,he,was,smiling,through,his,ragged,salt-streaked,beard,in,a,way,that,the,queen,could,scarce,remember
the,ships,are,sound,then
she,said,hoping
sound,enough,your,grace
they,are,old,ships,aye,but,most,are,well,maintained
the,hull,of,the,pureborn,princess,is,worm-eaten
i’d,not,want,to,take,her,beyond,the,sight,of,land
the,narraqqa,could,stand,a,new,rudder,and,lines,and,the,banded,lizard,has,some,cracked,oars,but,they,will,serve

those,who,leave,can,be,replaced,from,my,own,crews
it,is,a,long,hard,voyage,to,westeros,but,these,ships,are,sound,enough,to,get,us,there,i’d,judge
reznak,mo,reznak,gave,a,piteous,moan
then,it,is,true

it,is,almost,as,if,someone,wanted,to,keep,you,hidden,whilst,still,preparing,you,for,what

tyrion,felt,tendrils,brush,against,his,face,soft,as,a,whore’s,fingers
then,there,was,a,crash,behind,him,and,the,deck,tilted,so,suddenly,that,he,almost,lost,his,feet,and,went,pitching,over,the,side
a,stone,man,crashed,down,into,the,boat
he,landed,on,the,cabin,roof,so,heavily,that,the,shy,maid,seemed,to,rock,and,roared,a,word,down,at,them,in,a,tongue,that,tyrion,did,not,know

griff,was,on,the,second,man,the,instant,he,shambled,down,off,the,cabin,roof
with,a,sword,in,his,right,hand,and,a,torch,in,his,left,he,drove,the,creature,backwards
as,the,current,swept,the,shy,maid,beneath,the,bridge,their,shifting,shadows,danced,upon,the,mossy,walls
when,the,stone,man,moved,aft,duck,blocked,his,way,pole,in,hand

the,boy,stood,staring,as,still,as,if,he,too,were,made,of,stone
his,hand,was,on,his,sword,hilt,but,he,seemed,to,have,forgotten,why
tyrion,kicked,the,lad’s,leg,out,from,under,him,and,leapt,over,him,when,he,fell,thrusting,his,torch,into,the,stone,man’s,face,to,send,him,stumbling,backwards,on,his,shattered,leg,flailing,at,the,flames,with,stiff,grey,hands

where,he,had,grasped,the,torch,his,skin,had,cracked,and,split
blood,was,seeping,from,his,knuckles,though,he,did,not,seem,to,feel,it

the,stone,man,staggered,forward,his,hands,outstretched,and,grasping
tyrion,drove,a,shoulder,into,him
it,felt,like,slamming,into,a,castle,wall,but,this,castle,stood,upon,a,shattered,leg
the,stone,man,went,over,backwards,grabbing,hold,of,tyrion,as,he,fell
they,hit,the,river,with,a,towering,splash,and,mother,rhoyne,swallowed,up,the,two,of,them
the,sudden,cold,hit,tyrion,like,a,hammer

he,could,feel,the,eyes
when,he,looked,up,he,caught,a,glimpse,of,pale,faces,peering,from,behind,the,battlements,of,the,gatehouse,tower,and,through,the,broken,masonry,that,crowned,the,children’s,tower,where,legend,said,the,children,of,the,forest,had,once,called,down,the,hammer,of,the,waters,to,break,the,lands,of,westeros,in,two
the,only,dry,road,through,the,neck,was,the,causeway,and,the,towers,of,moat,cailin,plugged,its,northern,end,like,a,cork,in,a,bottle
the,road,was,narrow,the,ruins,so,positioned,that,any,enemy,coming,up,from,the,south,must,pass,beneath,and,between,them
to,assault,any,of,the,three,towers,an,attacker,must,expose,his,back,to,arrows,from,the,other,two,whilst,climbing,damp,stone,walls,festooned,with,streamers,of,slimy,white,ghostskin
the,swampy,ground,beyond,the,causeway,was,impassable,an,endless,morass,of,suckholes,quicksands,and,glistening,green,swards,that,looked,solid,to,the,unwary,eye,but,turned,to,water,the,instant,you,trod,upon,them,the,whole,of,it,infested,with,venomous,serpents,and,poisonous,flowers,and,monstrous,lizard,lions,with,teeth,like,daggers

a,mile,farther,on,they,came,upon,a,second,face,carved,into,a,chestnut,tree,that,grew,beside,an,icy,stream,where,its,eyes,could,watch,the,old,plank,bridge,that,spanned,its,flow
twice,as,much,trouble,announced,dolorous,edd

once,they,were,so,close,we,could,hear,the,bells,tinkling,in,their,braids,and,sometimes,at,night,their,fires,could,be,seen,beyond,the,eastern,hills
we,passed,warships,as,well,volantene,river,galleys,crammed,with,slave,soldiers
the,triarchs,fear,an,attack,upon,selhorys,plainly
tyrion,understood,that,quick,enough
alone,amongst,the,major,river,towns,selhorys,stood,upon,the,eastern,bank,of,the,rhoyne,making,it,much,more,vulnerable,to,the,horselords,than,its,sister,towns,across,the,river
even,so,it,is,a,small,prize
if,i,were,khal,i,would,feint,at,selhorys,let,the,volantenes,rush,to,defend,it,then,swing,south,and,ride,hard,for,volantis,itself
i,know,how,to,use,a,sword,young,griff,was,insisting
even,the,bravest,of,your,forebears,kept,his,kingsguard,close,about,him,in,times,of,peril
lemore,had,changed,out,of,her,septa’s,robes,into,garb,more,befitting,the,wife,or,daughter,of,a,prosperous,merchant
tyrion,watched,her,closely
he,had,sniffed,out,the,truth,beneath,the,dyed,blue,hair,of,griff,and,young,griff,easily,enough,and,yandry,and,ysilla,seemed,to,be,no,more,than,they,claimed,to,be,whilst,duck,was,somewhat,less
lemore,though,who,is,she,really
why,is,she,here
not,for,gold,i’d,judge
what,is,this,prince,to,her
was,she,ever,a,true,septa
haldon,took,note,of,her,change,of,garb,as,well
what,are,we,to,make,of,this,sudden,loss,of,faith
i,preferred,you,in,your,septa’s,robes,lemore
i,preferred,her,naked,said,tyrion
lemore,gave,him,a,reproachful,look
that,is,because,you,have,a,wicked,soul
septa’s,robes,scream,of,westeros,and,might,draw,unwelcome,eyes,onto,us
she,turned,back,to,prince,aegon
you,are,not,the,only,one,who,must,needs,hide
the,lad,did,not,seem,appeased
the,perfect,prince,but,still,half,a,boy,for,all,that,with,little,and,less,experience,of,the,world,and,all,its,woes
prince,aegon,said,tyrion,since,we’re,both,stuck,aboard,this,boat,perhaps,you,will,honor,me,with,a,game,of,cyvasse,to,while,away,the,hours
the,prince,gave,him,a,wary,look
i,am,sick,of,cyvasse
sick,of,losing,to,a,dwarf,you,mean
that,pricked,the,lad’s,pride,just,as,tyrion,had,known,it,would
go,fetch,the,board,and,pieces
this,time,i,mean,to,smash,you
they,played,on,deck,sitting,cross-legged,behind,the,cabin
young,griff,arrayed,his,army,for,attack,with,dragon,elephants,and,heavy,horse,up,front
a,young,man’s,formation,as,bold,as,it,is,foolish
he,risks,all,for,the,quick,kill
he,let,the,prince,have,first,move
haldon,stood,behind,them,watching,the,play
when,the,prince,reached,for,his,dragon,tyrion,cleared,his,throat
i,would,not,do,that,if,i,were,you
it,is,a,mistake,to,bring,your,dragon,out,too,soon
he,smiled,innocently
your,father,knew,the,dangers,of,being,overbold
did,you,know,my,true,father
well,i,saw,him,twice,or,thrice,but,i,was,only,ten,when,robert,killed,him,and,mine,own,sire,had,me,hidden,underneath,a,rock
no,i,cannot,claim,i,knew,prince,rhaegar
not,as,your,false,father,did
lord,connington,was,the,prince’s,dearest,friend,was,he,not
young,griff,pushed,a,lock,of,blue,hair,out,of,his,eyes
they,were,squires,together,at,king’s,landing
a,true,friend,our,lord,connington
he,must,be,to,remain,so,fiercely,loyal,to,the,grandson,of,the,king,who,took,his,lands,and,titles,and,sent,him,into,exile
a,pity,about,that
elsewise,prince,rhaegar’s,friend,might,have,been,on,hand,when,my,father,sacked,king’s,landing,to,save,prince,rhaegar’s,precious,little,son,from,getting,his,royal,brains,dashed,out,against,a,wall
the,lad,flushed
that,was,not,me
i,told,you
that,was,some,tanner’s,son,from,pisswater,bend,whose,mother,died,birthing,him
his,father,sold,him,to,lord,varys,for,a,jug,of,arbor,gold
he,had,other,sons,but,had,never,tasted,arbor,gold
varys,gave,the,pisswater,boy,to,my,lady,mother,and,carried,me,away
aye
tyrion,moved,his,elephants
and,when,the,pisswater,prince,was,safely,dead,the,eunuch,smuggled,you,across,the,narrow,sea,to,his,fat,friend,the,cheesemonger,who,hid,you,on,a,poleboat,and,found,an,exile,lord,willing,to,call,himself,your,father
it,does,make,for,a,splendid,story,and,the,singers,will,make,much,of,your,escape,once,you,take,the,iron,throne,assuming,that,our,fair,daenerys,takes,you,for,her,consort
she,will
she,must
must
tyrion,made,a,tsking,sound
that,is,not,a,word,queens,like,to,hear
you,are,her,perfect,prince,agreed,bright,and,bold,and,comely,as,any,maid,could,wish
daenerys,targaryen,is,no,maid,however
she,is,the,widow,of,a,dothraki,khal,a,mother,of,dragons,and,sacker,of,cities,aegon,the,conqueror,with,teats
she,may,not,prove,as,willing,as,you,wish
she’ll,be,willing
prince,aegon,sounded,shocked
it,was,plain,that,he,had,never,before,considered,the,possibility,that,his,bride-to-be,might,refuse,him
you,don’t,know,her
he,picked,up,his,heavy,horse,and,put,it,down,with,a,thump
the,dwarf,shrugged
i,know,that,she,spent,her,childhood,in,exile,impoverished,living,on,dreams,and,schemes,running,from,one,city,to,the,next,always,fearful,never,safe,friendless,but,for,a,brother,who,was,by,all,accounts,half-mad,a,brother,who,sold,her,maidenhood,to,the,dothraki,for,the,promise,of,an,army
i,know,that,somewhere,out,upon,the,grass,her,dragons,hatched,and,so,did,she
i,know,she,is,proud
how,not
what,else,was,left,her,but,pride
i,know,she,is,strong
how,not
the,dothraki,despise,weakness
if,daenerys,had,been,weak,she,would,have,perished,with,viserys
i,know,she,is,fierce
astapor,yunkai,and,meereen,are,proof,enough,of,that
she,has,crossed,the,grasslands,and,the,red,waste,survived,assassins,and,conspiracies,and,fell,sorceries,grieved,for,a,brother,and,a,husband,and,a,son,trod,the,cities,of,the,slavers,to,dust,beneath,her,dainty,sandaled,feet
now,how,do,you,suppose,this,queen,will,react,when,you,turn,up,with,your,begging,bowl,in,hand,and,say,good,morrow,to,you,auntie
i,am,your,nephew,aegon,returned,from,the,dead
i’ve,been,hiding,on,a,poleboat,all,my,life,but,now,i’ve,washed,the,blue,dye,from,my,hair,and,i’d,like,a,dragon,please,and,oh,did,i,mention,my,claim,to,the,iron,throne,is,stronger,than,your,own,’,aegon’s,mouth,twisted,in,fury
i,will,not,come,to,my,aunt,a,beggar
i,will,come,to,her,a,kinsman,with,an,army
a,small,army
there,that’s,made,him,good,and,angry
the,dwarf,could,not,help,but,think,of,joffrey
i,have,a,gift,for,angering,princes
queen,daenerys,has,a,large,one,and,no,thanks,to,you
tyrion,moved,his,crossbows

trust,no,one,my,prince
not,your,chainless,maester,not,your,false,father,not,the,gallant,duck,nor,the,lovely,lemore,nor,these,other,fine,friends,who,grew,you,from,a,bean

all,that,mistrust,will,sour,your,stomach,and,keep,you,awake,by,night,’tis,true,but,better,that,than,the,long,sleep,that,does,not,end
the,dwarf,pushed,his,black,dragon,across,a,range,of,mountains
but,what,do,i,know
your,false,father,is,a,great,lord,and,i,am,just,some,twisted,little,monkey,man
still,i’d,do,things,differently
that,got,the,boy’s,attention
how,differently
if,i,were,you
i,would,go,west,instead,of,east
land,in,dorne,and,raise,my,banners
the,seven,kingdoms,will,never,be,more,ripe,for,conquest,than,they,are,right,now
a,boy,king,sits,the,iron,throne
the,north,is,in,chaos,the,riverlands,a,devastation,a,rebel,holds,storm’s,end,and,dragonstone
when,winter,comes,the,realm,will,starve
and,who,remains,to,deal,with,all,of,this,who,rules,the,little,king,who,rules,the,seven,kingdoms
why,my,own,sweet,sister
there,is,no,one,else
my,brother,jaime,thirsts,for,battle,not,for,power
he’s,run,from,every,chance,he’s,had,to,rule
my,uncle,kevan,would,make,a,passably,good,regent,if,someone,pressed,the,duty,on,him,but,he,will,never,reach,for,it
the,gods,shaped,him,to,be,a,follower,not,a,leader
well,the,gods,and,my,lord,father
mace,tyrell,would,grasp,the,sceptre,gladly,but,mine,own,kin,are,not,like,to,step,aside,and,give,it,to,him
and,everyone,hates,stannis
who,does,that,leave
why,only,cersei
westeros,is,torn,and,bleeding,and,i,do,not,doubt,that,even,now,my,sweet,sister,is,binding,up,the,wounds,with,salt
cersei,is,as,gentle,as,king,maegor,as,selfless,as,aegon,the,unworthy,as,wise,as,mad,aerys
she,never,forgets,a,slight,real,or,imagined
she,takes,caution,for,cowardice,and,dissent,for,defiance
and,she,is,greedy
greedy,for,power,for,honor,for,love
tommen’s,rule,is,bolstered,by,all,of,the,alliances,that,my,lord,father,built,so,carefully,but,soon,enough,she,will,destroy,them,every,one
land,and,raise,your,banners,and,men,will,flock,to,your,cause
lords,great,and,small,and,smallfolk,too
but,do,not,wait,too,long,my,prince
the,moment,will,not,last
the,tide,that,lifts,you,now,will,soon,recede
be,certain,you,reach,westeros,before,my,sister,falls,and,someone,more,competent,takes,her,place
but,prince,aegon,said,without,daenerys,and,her,dragons,how,could,we,hope,to,win
you,do,not,need,to,win,tyrion,told,him
all,you,need,to,do,is,raise,your,banners,rally,your,supporters,and,hold,until,daenerys,arrives,to,join,her,strength,to,yours
you,said,she,might,not,have,me
perhaps,i,overstated
she,may,take,pity,on,you,when,you,come,begging,for,her,hand
the,dwarf,shrugged
do,you,want,to,wager,your,throne,upon,a,woman’s,whim
go,to,westeros,though,ah,then,you,are,a,rebel,not,a,beggar
bold,reckless,a,true,scion,of,house,targaryen,walking,in,the,footsteps,of,aegon,the,conqueror
a,dragon
i,told,you,i,know,our,little,queen
let,her,hear,that,her,brother,rhaegar’s,murdered,son,is,still,alive,that,this,brave,boy,has,raised,the,dragon,standard,of,her,forebears,in,westeros,once,more,that,he,is,fighting,a,desperate,war,to,avenge,his,father,and,reclaim,the,iron,throne,for,house,targaryen,hard-pressed,on,every,side,and,she,will,fly,to,your,side,as,fast,as,wind,and,water,can,carry,her
you,are,the,last,of,her,line,and,this,mother,of,dragons,this,breaker,of,chains,is,above,all,a,rescuer
the,girl,who,drowned,the,slaver,cities,in,blood,rather,than,leave,strangers,to,their,chains,can,scarcely,abandon,her,own,brother’s,son,in,his,hour,of,peril
and,when,she,reaches,westeros,and,meets,you,for,the,first,time,you,will,meet,as,equals,man,and,woman,not,queen,and,supplicant
how,can,she,help,but,love,you,then,i,ask,you
smiling,he,seized,his,dragon,flew,it,across,the,board
i,hope,your,grace,will,pardon,me
your,king,is,trapped
death,in,four
the,prince,stared,at,the,playing,board
my,dragon,is,too,far,away,to,save,you
you,should,have,moved,her,to,the,center,of,the,battle
but,you,said,i,lied
trust,no,one
and,keep,your,dragon,close
young,griff,jerked,to,his,feet,and,kicked,over,the,board
cyvasse,pieces,flew,in,all,directions,bouncing,and,rolling,across,the,deck,of,the,shy,maid
pick,those,up,the,boy,commanded
he,may,well,be,a,targaryen,after,all
if,it,please,your,grace
tyrion,got,down,on,his,hands,and,knees,and,began,to,crawl,about,the,deck,gathering,up,pieces
it,was,close,to,dusk,when,yandry,and,ysilla,returned,to,the,shy,maid
a,porter,trotted,at,their,heels,pushing,a,wheelbarrow,heaped,high,with,provisions,salt,and,flour,freshchurned,butter,slabs,of,bacon,wrapped,in,linen,sacks,of,oranges,apples,and,pears
yandry,had,a,wine,cask,on,one,shoulder,while,ysilla,had,slung,a,pike,over,hers
the,fish,was,as,large,as,tyrion
when,she,saw,the,dwarf,standing,at,the,end,of,the,gangplank,ysilla,stopped,so,suddenly,that,yandry,blundered,into,her,and,the,pike,almost,slid,off,her,back,into,the,river
duck,helped,her,rescue,it
ysilla,glared,at,tyrion,and,made,a,peculiar,stabbing,gesture,with,three,of,her,fingers
a,sign,to,ward,off,evil
let,me,help,you,with,that,fish,he,said,to,duck
no,ysilla,snapped
stay,away
touch,no,food,besides,the,food,you,eat,yourself
the,dwarf,raised,both,hands
as,you,command
yandry,thumped,the,wine,cask,down,onto,the,desk
where’s,griff
he,demanded,of,haldon
asleep
then,rouse,him
we,have,tidings,he’d,best,hear
the,queen’s,name,is,on,every,tongue,in,selhorys
they,say,she,still,sits,in,meereen,sore,beset
if,the,talk,in,the,markets,can,be,believed,old,volantis,will,soon,join,the,war,against,her
haldon,pursed,his,lips
the,gossip,of,fishmongers,is,not,to,be,relied,on
still,i,suppose,griff,will,want,to,hear
you,know,how,he,is
the,halfmaester,went,below
the,girl,never,started,for,the,west
no,doubt,she,had,good,reasons
between,meereen,and,volantis,lay,five,hundred,leagues,of,deserts,mountains,swamps,and,ruins,plus,mantarys,with,its,sinister,repute
a,city,of,monsters,they,say,but,if,she,marches,overland,where,else,is,she,to,turn,for,food,and,water
the,sea,would,be,swifter,but,if,she,does,not,have,the,ships,by,the,time,griff,appeared,on,deck,the,pike,was,spitting,and,sizzling,over,the,brazier,whilst,ysilla,hovered,over,it,with,a,lemon,squeezing
the,sellsword,wore,his,mail,and,wolfskin,cloak,soft,leather,gloves,dark,woolen,breeches
if,he,was,surprised,to,see,tyrion,awake,he,gave,no,sign,beyond,his,customary,scowl
he,took,yandry,back,to,the,tiller,where,they,spoke,in,low,voices,too,quietly,for,the,dwarf,to,hear
finally,griff,beckoned,to,haldon
we,need,to,know,the,truth,of,these,rumors
go,ashore,and,learn,what,you,can
qavo,will,know,if,you,can,find,him
try,the,riverman,and,the,painted,turtle
you,know,his,other,places
aye
i’ll,take,the,dwarf,as,well
four,ears,hear,more,than,two
and,you,know,how,qavo,is,about,his,cyvasse
as,you,wish
be,back,before,the,sun,comes,up
if,for,any,reason,you’re,delayed,make,your,way,to,the,golden,company
spoken,like,a,lord
tyrion,kept,the,thought,to,himself
haldon,donned,a,hooded,cloak,and,tyrion,shed,his,homemade,motley,for,something,drab,and,grey
griff,allowed,them,each,a,purse,of,silver,from,illyrio’s,chests
to,loosen,tongues
dusk,was,giving,way,to,darkness,as,they,made,their,way,along,the,riverfront
some,of,the,ships,they,passed,appeared,deserted,their,gangplanks,drawn,up
others,crawled,with,armed,men,who,eyed,them,with,suspicion
under,the,town,walls,parchment,lanterns,had,been,lit,above,the,stalls,throwing,pools,of,colored,light,upon,the,cobbled,path
tyrion,watched,as,haldon’s,face,turned,green,then,red,then,purple
under,the,cacophony,of,foreign,tongues,he,heard,queer,music,playing,from,somewhere,up,ahead,a,thin,high,fluting,accompanied,by,drums
a,dog,was,barking,too,behind,them
and,the,whores,were,out
river,or,sea,a,port,was,a,port,and,wherever,you,found,sailors,you’d,find,whores
is,that,what,my,father,meant
is,that,where,whores,go,to,the,sea
the,whores,of,lannisport,and,king’s,landing,were,free,women
their,sisters,of,selhorys,were,slaves,their,bondage,indicated,by,the,tears,tattooed,beneath,their,right,eyes
old,as,sin,and,twice,as,ugly,the,lot,of,them
it,was,almost,enough,to,put,a,man,off,whoring
tyrion,felt,their,eyes,upon,them,as,he,waddled,by,and,heard,them,whispering,to,one,another,and,giggling,behind,their,hands
you,would,think,they,had,never,seen,a,dwarf,before
a,squad,of,volantene,spearmen,stood,guard,at,the,river,gate
torchlight,gleamed,off,the,steel,claws,that,jutted,from,their,gauntlets
their,helms,were,tiger’s,masks,the,faces,beneath,marked,by,green,stripes,tattooed,across,both,cheeks
the,slave,soldiers,of,volantis,were,fiercely,proud,of,their,tiger,stripes,tyrion,knew
do,they,yearn,for,freedom
he,wondered
what,would,they,do,if,this,child,queen,bestowed,it,on,them
what,are,they,if,not,tigers
what,am,i,if,not,a,lion
one,of,the,tigers,spied,the,dwarf,and,said,something,that,made,the,others,laugh
as,they,reached,the,gate,he,pulled,off,his,clawed,gauntlet,and,the,sweaty,glove,beneath,locked,one,arm,around,the,dwarf’s,neck,and,roughly,rubbed,his,head
tyrion,was,too,startled,to,resist
it,was,all,over,in,a,heartbeat
was,there,some,reason,for,that
he,demanded,of,the,halfmaester
he,says,that,it,is,good,luck,to,rub,the,head,of,a,dwarf,haldon,said,after,an,exchange,with,the,guard,in,his,own,tongue
tyrion,forced,himself,to,smile,at,the,man
tell,him,that,it,is,even,better,luck,to,suck,on,a,dwarf’s,cock
best,not
tigers,have,been,known,to,have,sharp,teeth
a,different,guard,motioned,them,through,the,gate,waving,a,torch,at,them,impatiently
haldon,halfmaester,led,the,way,into,selhorys,proper,with,tyrion,waddling,warily,at,his,heels
a,great,square,opened,up,before,them
even,at,this,hour,it,was,crowded,and,noisy,and,ablaze,with,light
lanterns,swung,from,iron,chains,above,the,doors,of,inns,and,pleasure,houses,but,within,the,gates,they,were,made,of,colored,glass,not,parchment
to,their,right,a,nightfire,burned,outside,a,temple,of,red,stone
a,priest,in,scarlet,robes,stood,on,the,temple,balcony,haranguing,the,small,crowd,that,had,gathered,around,the,flames
elsewhere,travelers,sat,playing,cyvasse,in,front,of,an,inn,drunken,soldiers,wandered,in,and,out,of,what,was,obviously,a,brothel,a,woman,beat,a,mule,outside,a,stable
a,twowheeled,cart,went,rumbling,past,them,pulled,by,a,white,dwarf,elephant
this,is,another,world,thought,tyrion,but,not,so,different,from,the,world,i,know
the,square,was,dominated,by,a,white,marble,statue,of,a,headless,man,in,impossibly,ornate,armor,astride,a,warhorse,similarly,arrayed
who,might,that,be
wondered,tyrion
triarch,horonno
a,volantene,hero,from,the,century,of,blood
he,was,returned,as,triarch,every,year,for,forty,years,until,he,wearied,of,elections,and,declared,himself,triarch,for,life
the,volantenes,were,not,amused
he,was,put,to,death,soon,after
tied,between,two,elephants,and,torn,in,half
his,statue,seems,to,lack,a,head
he,was,a,tiger
when,the,elephants,came,to,power,their,followers,went,on,a,rampage,knocking,the,heads,from,the,statues,of,those,they,blamed,for,all,the,wars,and,deaths
he,shrugged
that,was,another,age
come,we’d,best,hear,what,that,priest,is,going,on,about
i,swear,i,heard,the,name,daenerys
across,the,square,they,joined,the,growing,throng,outside,the,red,temple
with,the,locals,towering,above,him,on,every,hand,the,little,man,found,it,hard,to,see,much,beyond,their,arses
he,could,hear,most,every,word,the,priest,was,saying,but,that,was,not,to,say,he,understood,them
do,you,understand,what,he,is,saying
he,asked,haldon,in,the,common,tongue

haldon,led,them,past,the,headless,hero,to,where,a,big,stone,inn,fronted,on,the,square
the,ridged,shell,of,some,immense,turtle,hung,above,its,door,painted,in,garish,colors
inside,a,hundred,dim,red,candles,burned,like,distant,stars
the,air,was,fragrant,with,the,smell,of,roasted,meat,and,spices,and,a,slave,girl,with,a,turtle,on,one,cheek,was,pouring,pale,green,wine
haldon,paused,in,the,doorway
there
those,two
in,the,alcove,two,men,sat,over,a,carved,stone,cyvasse,table,squinting,at,their,pieces,by,the,light,of,a,red,candle
one,was,gaunt,and,sallow,with,thinning,black,hair,and,a,blade,of,a,nose
the,other,was,wide,of,shoulder,and,round,of,belly,with,corkscrew,ringlets,tumbling,past,his,collar
neither,deigned,to,look,up,from,their,game,until,haldon,drew,up,a,chair,between,them,and,said,my,dwarf,plays,better,cyvasse,than,both,of,you,combined
the,bigger,man,raised,his,eyes,to,gaze,at,the,intruders,in,distaste,and,said,something,in,the,tongue,of,old,volantis,too,fast,for,tyrion,to,hope,to,follow
the,thinner,one,leaned,back,in,his,chair
is,he,for,sale
he,asked,in,the,common,tongue,of,westeros
the,triarch’s,grotesquerie,is,in,need,of,a,cyvasse-playing,dwarf
yollo,is,no,slave
what,a,pity

across,the,cyvasse,table,the,man,behind,the,alabaster,army,pursed,his,lips,in,disapproval
he,moved,his,heavy,horse
a,blunder,said,tyrion
he,had,as,well,play,his,part
just,so,the,thin,man,said
he,answered,with,his,own,heavy,horse
a,flurry,of,quick,moves,followed,until,finally,the,thin,man,smiled,and,said,death,my,friend
the,big,man,glowered,at,the,board,then,rose,and,growled,something,in,his,own,tongue
his,opponent,laughed
come,now
the,dwarf,does,not,stink,as,bad,as,that

up,with,you,little,man
put,your,silver,on,the,table,and,we,will,see,how,well,you,play,the,game
which,game
tyrion,might,have,asked
he,climbed,onto,the,chair
i,play,better,with,a,full,belly,and,a,cup,of,wine,to,hand
the,thin,man,turned,obligingly,and,called,for,the,slave,girl,to,fetch,them,food,and,drink
haldon,said,the,noble,qavo,nogarys,is,the,customs,officer,here,in,selhorys
i,have,never,once,defeated,him,at,cyvasse
tyrion,understood
perhaps,i,will,be,more,fortunate
he,opened,his,purse,and,stacked,silver,coins,beside,the,board,one,atop,another,until,finally,qavo,smiled
as,each,of,them,was,setting,up,his,pieces,behind,the,cyvasse,screen,haldon,said,what,news,from,downriver

qavo,shrugged
the,yunkai’i,would,have,it,so
they,style,themselves,the,wise,masters
of,their,wisdom,i,cannot,speak,but,they,do,not,lack,for,cunning
their,envoy,came,to,us,with,chests,of,gold,and,gems,and,two,hundred,slaves,nubile,girls,and,smoothskinned,boys,trained,in,the,way,of,the,seven,sighs

the,yunkishmen,have,bought,your,triarchs
only,nyessos
qavo,removed,the,screen,and,studied,the,placement,of,tyrion’s,army
malaquo,may,be,old,and,toothless,but,he,is,a,tiger,still,and,doniphos,will,not,be,returned,as,triarch
the,city,thirsts,for,war
why
wondered,tyrion
meereen,is,long,leagues,across,the,sea
how,has,this,sweet,child,queen,offended,old,volantis
sweet
qavo,laughed
if,even,half,the,stories,coming,back,from,slaver’s,bay,are,true,this,child,is,a,monster
they,say,that,she,is,bloodthirsty,that,those,who,speak,against,her,are,impaled,on,spikes,to,die,lingering,deaths
they,say,she,is,a,sorceress,who,feeds,her,dragons,on,the,flesh,of,newborn,babes,an,oathbreaker,who,mocks,the,gods,breaks,truces,threatens,envoys,and,turns,on,those,who,have,served,her,loyally
they,say,her,lust,cannot,be,sated,that,she,mates,with,men,women,eunuchs,even,dogs,and,children,and,woe,betide,the,lover,who,fails,to,satisfy,her
she,gives,her,body,to,men,to,take,their,souls,in,thrall
oh,good,thought,tyrion
if,she,gives,her,body,to,me,she,is,welcome,to,my,soul,small,and,stunted,though,it,is
they,say,said,haldon
by,they,you,mean,the,slavers,the,exiles,she,drove,from,astapor,and,meereen
mere,calumnies
the,best,calumnies,are,spiced,with,truth,suggested,qavo,but,the,girl’s,true,sin,cannot,be,denied
this,arrogant,child,has,taken,it,upon,herself,to,smash,the,slave,trade,but,that,traffic,was,never,confined,to,slaver’s,bay
it,was,part,of,the,sea,of,trade,that,spanned,the,world,and,the,dragon,queen,has,clouded,the,water
behind,the,black,wall,lords,of,ancient,blood,sleep,poorly,listening,as,their,kitchen,slaves,sharpen,their,long,knives
slaves,grow,our,food,clean,our,streets,teach,our,young
they,guard,our,walls,row,our,galleys,fight,our,battles
and,now,when,they,look,east,they,see,this,young,queen,shining,from,afar,this,breaker,of,chains
the,old,blood,cannot,suffer,that
poor,men,hate,her,too
even,the,vilest,beggar,stands,higher,than,a,slave
this,dragon,queen,would,rob,him,of,that,consolation
tyrion,advanced,his,spearmen
qavo,replied,with,his,light,horse
tyrion,moved,his,crossbowmen,up,a,square,and,said,the,red,priest,outside,seemed,to,think,volantis,should,fight,for,this,silver,queen,not,against,her
the,red,priests,would,be,wise,to,hold,their,tongues,said,qavo,nogarys
already,there,has,been,fighting,between,their,followers,and,those,who,worship,other,gods
benerro’s,rantings,will,only,serve,to,bring,a,savage,wrath,down,upon,his,head
what,rantings
the,dwarf,asked,toying,with,his,rabble
the,volantene,waved,a,hand
in,volantis,thousands,of,slaves,and,freedmen,crowd,the,temple,plaza,every,night,to,hear,benerro,shriek,of,bleeding,stars,and,a,sword,of,fire,that,will,cleanse,the,world
he,has,been,preaching,that,volantis,will,surely,burn,if,the,triarchs,take,up,arms,against,the,silver,queen
that’s,a,prophecy,even,i,could,make
ah,supper
supper,was,a,plate,of,roasted,goat,served,on,a,bed,of,sliced,onions
the,meat,was,spiced,and,fragrant,charred,outside,and,red,and,juicy,within
tyrion,plucked,at,a,piece
it,was,so,hot,it,burned,his,fingers,but,so,good,he,could,not,help,but,reach,for,another,chunk
he,washed,it,down,with,the,pale,green,volantene,liquor,the,closest,thing,he’d,had,to,wine,for,ages
very,good,he,said,plucking,up,his,dragon
the,most,powerful,piece,in,the,game,he,announced,as,he,removed,one,of,qavo’s,elephants
and,daenerys,targaryen,has,three,it’s,said
three,qavo,allowed,against,thrice,three,thousand,enemies
grazdan,mo,eraz,was,not,the,only,envoy,sent,out,from,the,yellow,city
when,the,wise,masters,move,against,meereen,the,legions,of,new,ghis,will,fight,beside,them
tolosi
elyrians
even,the,dothraki
you,have,dothraki,outside,your,own,gates,haldon,said
khal,pono
qavo,waved,a,pale,hand,in,dismissal
the,horselords,come,we,give,them,gifts,the,horselords,go
he,moved,his,catapult,again,closed,his,hand,around,tyrion’s,alabaster,dragon,removed,it,from,the,board
the,rest,was,slaughter,though,the,dwarf,held,on,another,dozen,moves
the,time,has,come,for,bitter,tears,qavo,said,at,last,scooping,up,the,pile,of,silver
another,game
no,need,said,haldon
my,dwarf,has,had,his,lesson,in,humility
i,think,it,is,best,we,get,back,to,our,boat
outside,in,the,square,the,nightfire,was,still,burning,but,the,priest,was,gone,and,the,crowd,was,long,dispersed
the,glow,of,candles,glimmered,from,the,windows,of,the,brothel
from,inside,came,the,sound,of,women’s,laughter
the,night,is,still,young,said,tyrion
qavo,may,not,have,told,us,everything
and,whores,hear,much,and,more,from,the,men,they,service
do,you,need,a,woman,so,badly,yollo
a,man,grows,weary,of,having,no,lovers,but,his,fingers
selhorys,may,be,where,whores,go
tysha,might,be,in,there,even,now,with,tears,tattooed,upon,her,cheek
i,almost,drowned
a,man,needs,a,woman,after,that
besides,i,need,to,make,sure,my,prick,hasn’t,turned,to,stone
the,halfmaester,laughed
i,will,wait,for,you,in,the,tavern,by,the,gate
do,not,be,too,long,about,your,business
oh,have,no,fear,on,that,count
most,women,prefer,to,be,done,with,me,as,quickly,as,they,can
the,brothel,was,a,modest,one,compared,to,those,the,dwarf,had,been,wont,to,frequent,in,lannisport,and,king’s,landing
the,proprietor,did,not,seem,to,speak,any,tongue,but,that,of,volantis,but,he,understood,the,clank,of,silver,well,enough,and,led,tyrion,through,an,archway,into,a,long,room,that,smelled,of,incense,where,four,bored,slave,girls,were,lounging,about,in,various,states,of,undress
two,had,seen,at,least,forty,namedays,come,and,go,he,guessed,the,youngest,was,perhaps,fifteen,or,sixteen
none,was,as,hideous,as,the,whores,he’d,seen,working,the,docks,though,they,fell,well,short,of,beauty
one,was,plainly,pregnant
another,was,just,fat,and,sported,iron,rings,in,both,her,nipples
all,four,had,tears,tattooed,beneath,one,eye
do,you,have,a,girl,who,speaks,the,tongue,of,westeros
asked,tyrion
the,proprietor,squinted,uncomprehending,so,he,repeated,the,question,in,high,valyrian
this,time,the,man,seemed,to,grasp,a,word,or,three,and,replied,in,volantene
sunset,girl,was,all,the,dwarf,could,get,out,of,his,answer
he,took,that,to,mean,a,girl,from,the,sunset,kingdoms
there,was,only,one,such,in,the,house,and,she,was,not,tysha
she,had,freckled,cheeks,and,tight,red,curls,upon,her,head,which,gave,promise,of,freckled,breasts,and,red,hair,between,her,legs
she’ll,do,said,tyrion,and,i’ll,have,a,flagon,too
red,wine,with,red,flesh
the,whore,was,looking,at,his,noseless,face,with,revulsion,in,her,eyes
do,i,offend,you,sweetling
i,am,an,offensive,creature,as,my,father,would,be,glad,to,tell,you,if,he,were,not,dead,and,rotting
though,she,did,look,westerosi,the,girl,spoke,not,a,word,of,the,common,tongue
perhaps,she,was,captured,by,some,slaver,as,a,child
her,bedchamber,was,small,but,there,was,a,myrish,carpet,on,the,floor,and,a,mattress,stuffed,with,feathers,in,place,of,straw
i,have,seen,worse
will,you,give,me,your,name
he,asked,as,he,took,a,cup,of,wine,from,her
no
the,wine,was,strong,and,sour,and,required,no,translation
i,suppose,i,shall,settle,for,your,cunt
he,wiped,his,mouth,with,the,back,of,his,hand
have,you,ever,bedded,a,monster,before
now’s,as,good,a,time,as,any
out,of,your,clothes,and,onto,your,back,if,it,please,you
or,not
she,looked,at,him,uncomprehending,until,he,took,the,flagon,from,her,hands,and,lifted,her,skirts,up,over,her,head
after,that,she,understood,what,was,required,of,her,though,she,did,not,prove,the,liveliest,of,partners
tyrion,had,been,so,long,without,a,woman,that,he,spent,himself,inside,her,on,the,third,thrust
he,rolled,off,feeling,more,ashamed,than,sated
this,was,a,mistake
what,a,wretched,creature,i’ve,become
do,you,know,a,woman,by,the,name,of,tysha
he,asked,as,he,watched,his,seed,dribble,out,of,her,onto,the,bed
the,whore,did,not,respond
do,you,know,where,whores,go
she,did,not,answer,that,one,either
her,back,was,crisscrossed,by,ridges,of,scar,tissue
this,girl,is,as,good,as,dead
i,have,just,fucked,a,corpse
even,her,eyes,looked,dead
she,does,not,even,have,the,strength,to,loathe,me
he,needed,wine
a,lot,of,wine
he,seized,the,flagon,with,both,hands,and,raised,it,to,his,lips
the,wine,ran,red
down,his,throat,down,his,chin
it,dripped,from,his,beard,and,soaked,the,feather,bed
in,the,candlelight,it,looked,as,dark,as,the,wine,that,had,poisoned,joffrey
when,he,was,done,he,tossed,the,empty,flagon,aside,and,half-rolled,and,halfstaggered,to,the,floor,groping,for,a,chamber,pot
there,was,none,to,be,found
his,stomach,heaved,and,he,found,himself,on,his,knees,retching,on,the,carpet,that,wonderful,thick,myrish,carpet,as,comforting,as,lies
the,whore,cried,out,in,distress
they,will,blame,her,for,this,he,realized,ashamed
cut,off,my,head,and,take,it,to,king’s,landing,tyrion,urged,her
my,sister,will,make,a,lady,of,you,and,no,one,will,ever,whip,you,again
she,did,not,understand,that,either,so,he,shoved,her,legs,apart,crawled,between,them,and,took,her,once,more
that,much,she,could,comprehend,at,least
afterward,the,wine,was,done,and,so,was,he,so,he,wadded,up,the,girl’s,clothing,and,tossed,it,at,the,door
she,took,the,hint,and,fled,leaving,him,alone,in,the,darkness,sinking,deeper,into,his,feather,bed
i,am,stinking,drunk
he,dare,not,close,his,eyes,for,fear,of,sleep
beyond,the,veil,of,dream,the,sorrows,were,waiting,for,him
stone,steps,ascending,endlessly,steep,and,slick,and,treacherous,and,somewhere,at,the,top,the,shrouded,lord
i,do,not,want,to,meet,the,shrouded,lord
tyrion,fumbled,back,into,his,clothes,again,and,groped,his,way,to,the,stair
griff,will,flay,me
well,why,not
if,ever,a,dwarf,deserved,a,skinning,i’m,him
halfway,down,the,steps,he,lost,his,footing
somehow,he,managed,to,break,his,tumble,with,his,hands,and,turn,it,into,a,clumsy,thumping,cartwheel
the,whores,in,the,room,below,looked,up,in,astonishment,when,he,landed,at,the,foot,of,the,steps
tyrion,rolled,onto,his,feet,and,gave,them,a,bow
i,am,more,agile,when,i’m,drunk
he,turned,to,the,proprietor
i,fear,i,ruined,your,carpet
the,girl’s,not,to,blame
let,me,pay
he,pulled,out,a,fistful,of,coins,and,tossed,them,at,the,man
imp,a,deep,voice,said,behind,him
in,the,corner,of,the,room,a,man,sat,in,a,pool,of,shadow,with,a,whore,squirming,on,his,lap
i,never,saw,that,girl
if,i,had,i,would,have,taken,her,upstairs,instead,of,freckles
she,was,younger,than,the,others,slim,and,pretty,with,long,silvery,hair
lyseni,at,a,guess,but,the,man,whose,lap,she,filled,was,from,the,seven,kingdoms
burly,and,broad-shouldered,forty,if,he,was,a,day,and,maybe,older
half,his,head,was,bald,but,coarse,stubble,covered,his,cheeks,and,chin,and,hair,grew,thickly,down,his,arms,sprouting,even,from,his,knuckles
tyrion,did,not,like,the,look,of,him
he,liked,the,big,black,bear,on,his,surcoat,even,less
wool
he’s,wearing,wool,in,this,heat
who,else,but,a,knight,would,be,so,fucking,mad
how,pleasant,to,hear,the,common,tongue,so,far,from,home,he,made,himself,say,but,i,fear,you,have,mistaken,me
my,name,is,hugor,hill
may,i,buy,you,a,cup,of,wine,my,friend
i’ve,drunk,enough
the,knight,shoved,his,whore,aside,and,got,to,his,feet
his,sword,belt,hung,on,a,peg,beside,him
he,took,it,down,and,drew,his,blade
steel,whispered,against,leather
the,whores,were,watching,avidly,candlelight,shining,in,their,eyes
the,proprietor,had,vanished
you’re,mine,hugor
tyrion,could,no,more,outrun,him,than,outfight,him
drunk,as,he,was,he,could,not,even,hope,to,outwit,him
he,spread,his,hands
and,what,do,you,mean,to,do,with,me

even,that,was,preferable,to,the,answer,of,mantarys,which,came,by,way,of,caravan,in,a,cedar,chest
inside,she,had,found,the,heads,of,her,three,envoys,pickled
perhaps,your,gods,can,help,us
ask,them,to,send,a,gale,and,sweep,the,galleys,from,the,bay
i,shall,pray,and,make,sacrifice
mayhaps,the,gods,of,ghis,will,hear,me
galazza,galare,sipped,her,wine,but,her,eyes,did,not,leave,dany

saying,it,left,a,bitter,taste,in,her,mouth
the,cowards,broke,in,on,some,weavers,freedwomen,who,had,done,no,harm,to,anyone
all,they,did,was,make,beautiful,things
i,have,a,tapestry,they,gave,me,hanging,over,my,bed
the,sons,of,the,harpy,broke,their,loom,and,raped,them,before,slitting,their,throats
this,we,have,heard
and,yet,your,radiance,has,found,the,courage,to,answer,butchery,with,mercy
you,have,not,harmed,any,of,the,noble,children,you,hold,as,hostage
not,as,yet,no
dany,had,grown,fond,of,her,young,charges
some,were,shy,and,some,were,bold,some,sweet,and,some,sullen,but,all,were,innocent
if,i,kill,my,cupbearers,who,will,pour,my,wine,and,serve,my,supper
she,said,trying,to,make,light,of,it
the,priestess,did,not,smile
the,shavepate,would,feed,them,to,your,dragons,it,is,said
a,life,for,a,life
for,every,brazen,beast,cut,down,he,would,have,a,child,die
dany,pushed,her,food,about,her,plate
she,dare,not,glance,over,to,where,grazhar,and,qezza,stood,for,fear,that,she,might,cry
the,shavepate,has,a,harder,heart,than,mine
they,had,fought,about,the,hostages,half,a,dozen,times
the,sons,of,the,harpy,are,laughing,in,their,pyramids,skahaz,said,just,this,morning
what,good,are,hostages,if,you,will,not,take,their,heads
in,his,eyes,she,was,only,a,weak,woman
hazzea,was,enough
what,good,is,peace,if,it,must,be,purchased,with,the,blood,of,little,children
these,murders,are,not,their,doing,dany,told,the,green,grace,feebly
i,am,no,butcher,queen
and,for,that,meereen,gives,thanks,said,galazza,galare
we,have,heard,that,the,butcher,king,of,astapor,is,dead
slain,by,his,own,soldiers,when,he,commanded,them,to,march,out,and,attack,the,yunkai’i
the,words,were,bitter,in,her,mouth
he,was,hardly,cold,before,another,took,his,place,calling,himself,cleon,the,second
that,one,lasted,eight,days,before,his,throat,was,opened
then,his,killer,claimed,the,crown
so,did,the,first,cleon’s,concubine
king,cutthroat,and,queen,whore,the,astapori,call,them
their,followers,are,fighting,battles,in,the,streets,while,the,yunkai’i,and,their,sellswords,wait,outside,the,walls
these,are,grievous,times
your,radiance,might,i,presume,to,offer,you,my,counsel
you,know,how,much,i,value,your,wisdom
then,heed,me,now,and,marry
ah
dany,had,been,expecting,this
oftimes,i,have,heard,you,say,that,you,are,only,a,young,girl
to,look,at,you,you,still,seem,half,a,child,too,young,and,frail,to,face,such,trials,by,yourself
you,need,a,king,beside,you,to,help,you,bear,these,burdens
dany,speared,a,chunk,of,lamb,took,a,bite,from,it,chewed,slowly
tell,me,can,this,king,puff,his,cheeks,up,and,blow,xaro’s,galleys,back,to,qarth
can,he,clap,his,hands,and,break,the,siege,of,astapor
can,he,put,food,in,the,bellies,of,my,children,and,bring,peace,back,to,my,streets
can,you
the,green,grace,asked
a,king,is,not,a,god,but,there,is,still,much,that,a,strong,man,might,do
when,my,people,look,at,you,they,see,a,conqueror,from,across,the,seas,come,to,murder,us,and,make,slaves,of,our,children
a,king,could,change,that
a,highborn,king,of,pure,ghiscari,blood,could,reconcile,the,city,to,your,rule
elsewise,i,fear,your,reign,must,end,as,it,began,in,blood,and,fire
dany,pushed,her,food,about,her,plate
and,who,would,the,gods,of,ghis,have,me,take,as,my,king,and,consort
hizdahr,zo,loraq,galazza,galare,said,firmly
dany,did,not,trouble,to,feign,surprise
why,hizdahr
skahaz,is,noble,born,as,well
skahaz,is,kandaq,hizdahr,loraq
your,radiance,will,forgive,me,but,only,one,who,is,not,herself,ghiscari,would,not,understand,the,difference
oft,have,i,heard,that,yours,is,the,blood,of,aegon,the,conqueror,jaehaerys,the,wise,and,daeron,the,dragon
the,noble,hizdahr,is,of,the,blood,of,mazdhan,the,magnificent,hazrak,the,handsome,and,zharaq,the,liberator
his,forebears,are,as,dead,as,mine
will,hizdahr,raise,their,shades,to,defend,meereen,against,its,enemies
i,need,a,man,with,ships,and,swords
you,offer,me,ancestors
we,are,an,old,people
ancestors,are,important,to,us
wed,hizdahr,zo,loraq,and,make,a,son,with,him,a,son,whose,father,is,the,harpy,whose,mother,is,the,dragon
in,him,the,prophecies,shall,be,fulfilled,and,your,enemies,will,melt,away,like,snow
he,shall,be,the,stallion,that,mounts,the,world
dany,knew,how,it,went,with,prophecies
they,were,made,of,words,and,words,were,wind
there,would,be,no,son,for,loraq,no,heir,to,unite,dragon,and,harpy
when,the,sun,rises,in,the,west,and,sets,in,the,east,when,the,seas,go,dry,and,mountains,blow,in,the,wind,like,leaves
only,then,would,her,womb,quicken,once,again,but,daenerys,targaryen,had,other,children,tens,of,thousands,who,had,hailed,her,as,their,mother,when,she,broke,their,chains
she,thought,of,stalwart,shield,of,missandei’s,brother,of,the,woman,rylona,rhee,who,had,played,the,harp,so,beautifully
no,marriage,would,ever,bring,them,back,to,life,but,if,a,husband,could,help,end,the,slaughter,then,she,owed,it,to,her,dead,to,marry
if,i,wed,hizdahr,will,that,turn,skahaz,against,me
she,trusted,skahaz,more,than,she,trusted,hizdahr,but,the,shavepate,would,be,a,disaster,as,a,king
he,was,too,quick,to,anger,too,slow,to,forgive
she,saw,no,gain,in,wedding,a,man,as,hated,as,herself
hizdahr,was,well,respected,so,far,as,she,could,see
what,does,my,prospective,husband,think,of,this
she,asked,the,green,grace
what,does,he,think,of,me
your,grace,need,only,ask,him
the,noble,hizdahr,awaits,below
send,down,to,him,if,that,is,your,pleasure
you,presume,too,much,priestess,the,queen,thought,but,she,swallowed,her,anger,and,made,herself,smile
why,not
she,sent,for,ser,barristan,and,told,the,old,knight,to,bring,hizdahr,to,her
it,is,a,long,climb
have,the,unsullied,help,him,up
by,the,time,the,nobleman,had,made,the,ascent,the,green,grace,had,finished,eating
if,it,please,your,magnificence,i,will,take,my,leave
you,and,the,noble,hizdahr,will,have,many,things,to,discuss,i,do,not,doubt
the,old,woman,dabbed,a,smear,of,honey,off,her,lips,gave,qezza,and,grazhar,each,a,parting,kiss,upon,the,brow,and,fastened,her,silken,veil,across,her,face
i,shall,return,to,the,temple,of,the,graces,and,pray,for,the,gods,to,show,my,queen,the,course,of,wisdom
when,she,was,gone,dany,let,qezza,fill,her,cup,again,dismissed,the,children,and,commanded,that,hizdahr,zo,loraq,be,admitted,to,her,presence
and,if,he,dares,say,one,word,about,his,precious,fighting,pits,i,may,have,him,thrown,off,the,terrace
hizdahr,wore,a,plain,green,robe,beneath,a,quilted,vest
he,bowed,low,when,he,entered,his,face,solemn
have,you,no,smile,for,me
dany,asked,him
am,i,as,fearful,as,all,that
i,always,grow,solemn,in,the,presence,of,such,beauty
it,was,a,good,start
drink,with,me
dany,filled,his,cup,herself
you,know,why,you,are,here
the,green,grace,seems,to,feel,that,if,i,take,you,for,my,husband,all,my,woes,will,vanish
i,would,never,make,so,bold,a,claim
men,are,born,to,strive,and,suffer
our,woes,only,vanish,when,we,die
i,can,be,of,help,to,you,however
i,have,gold,and,friends,and,influence,and,the,blood,of,old,ghis,flows,in,my,veins
though,i,have,never,wed,i,have,two,natural,children,a,boy,and,a,girl,so,i,can,give,you,heirs
i,can,reconcile,the,city,to,your,rule,and,put,an,end,to,this,nightly,slaughter,in,the,streets
can,you
dany,studied,his,eyes
why,should,the,sons,of,the,harpy,lay,down,their,knives,for,you
are,you,one,of,them
no
would,you,tell,me,if,you,were
he,laughed
no
the,shavepate,has,ways,of,finding,the,truth
i,do,not,doubt,that,skahaz,would,soon,have,me,confessing
a,day,with,him,and,i,will,be,one,of,the,harpy’s,sons
two,days,and,i,will,be,the,harpy
three,and,it,will,turn,out,i,slew,your,father,too,back,in,the,sunset,kingdoms,when,i,was,yet,a,boy
then,he,will,impale,me,on,a,stake,and,you,can,watch,me,die,but,afterward,the,killings,will,go,on
hizdahr,leaned,closer
or,you,can,marry,me,and,let,me,try,to,stop,them
why,would,you,want,to,help,me
for,the,crown
a,crown,would,suit,me,well,i,will,not,deny,that
it,is,more,than,that,however
is,it,so,strange,that,i,would,want,to,protect,my,own,people,as,you,protect,your,freedmen
meereen,cannot,endure,another,war,your,radiance
that,was,a,good,answer,and,an,honest,one
i,have,never,wanted,war
i,defeated,the,yunkai’i,once,and,spared,their,city,when,i,might,have,sacked,it
i,refused,to,join,king,cleon,when,he,marched,against,them
even,now,with,astapor,besieged,i,stay,my,hand
and,qarth,i,have,never,done,the,qartheen,any,harm,not,by,intent,no,but,qarth,is,a,city,of,merchants,and,they,love,the,clink,of,silver,coins,the,gleam,of,yellow,gold
when,you,smashed,the,slave,trade,the,blow,was,felt,from,westeros,to,asshai
qarth,depends,upon,its,slaves
so,too,tolos,new,ghis,lys,tyrosh,volantis,the,list,is,long,my,queen
let,them,come
in,me,they,shall,find,a,sterner,foe,than,cleon
i,would,sooner,perish,fighting,than,return,my,children,to,bondage
there,may,be,another,choice
the,yunkai’i,can,be,persuaded,to,allow,all,your,freedmen,to,remain,free,i,believe,if,your,worship,will,agree,that,the,yellow,city,may,trade,and,train,slaves,unmolested,from,this,day,forth
no,more,blood,need,flow
save,for,the,blood,of,those,slaves,that,the,yunkai’i,will,trade,and,train,dany,said,but,she,recognized,the,truth,in,his,words,even,so
it,may,be,that,is,the,best,end,we,can,hope,for
you,have,not,said,you,love,me
i,will,if,it,would,please,your,radiance
that,is,not,the,answer,of,a,man,in,love
what,is,love
desire
no,man,with,all,his,parts,could,ever,look,on,you,and,not,desire,you,daenerys
that,is,not,why,i,would,marry,you,however
before,you,came,meereen,was,dying
our,rulers,were,old,men,with,withered,cocks,and,crones,whose,puckered,cunts,were,dry,as,dust
they,sat,atop,their,pyramids,sipping,apricot,wine,and,talking,of,the,glories,of,the,old,empire,whilst,the,centuries,slipped,by,and,the,very,bricks,of,the,city,crumbled,all,around,them
custom,and,caution,had,an,iron,grip,upon,us,till,you,awakened,us,with,fire,and,blood
a,new,time,has,come,and,new,things,are,possible
marry,me
he,is,not,hard,to,look,at,dany,told,herself,and,he,has,a,king’s,tongue
kiss,me,she,commanded
he,took,her,hand,again,and,kissed,her,fingers
not,that,way
kiss,me,as,if,i,were,your,wife
hizdahr,took,her,by,the,shoulders,as,tenderly,as,if,she,were,a,baby,bird
leaning,forward,he,pressed,his,lips,to,hers
his,kiss,was,light,and,dry,and,quick
dany,felt,no,stirrings
shall,i,kiss,you,again
he,asked,when,it,was,over
no
on,her,terrace,in,her,bathing,pool,the,little,fish,would,nibble,at,her,legs,as,she,soaked
even,they,kissed,with,more,fervor,than,hizdahr,zo,loraq
i,do,not,love,you
hizdahr,shrugged
that,may,come,in,time
it,has,been,known,to,happen,that,way
not,with,us,she,thought
not,whilst,daario,is,so,close
it’s,him,i,want,not,you
one,day,i,will,want,to,return,to,westeros,to,claim,the,seven,kingdoms,that,were,my,father’s
one,day,all,men,must,die,but,it,serves,no,good,to,dwell,on,death
i,prefer,to,take,each,day,as,it,comes
dany,folded,her,hands,together
words,are,wind,even,words,like,love,and,peace
i,put,more,trust,in,deeds
in,my,seven,kingdoms,knights,go,on,quests,to,prove,themselves,worthy,of,the,maiden,that,they,love
they,seek,for,magic,swords,for,chests,of,gold,for,crowns,stolen,from,a,dragon’s,hoard
hizdahr,arched,an,eyebrow
the,only,dragons,that,i,know,are,yours,and,magic,swords,are,even,scarcer
i,will,gladly,bring,you,rings,and,crowns,and,chests,of,gold,if,that,is,your,desire
peace,is,my,desire
you,say,that,you,can,help,me,end,the,nightly,slaughter,in,my,streets
i,say,do,it
put,an,end,to,this,shadow,war,my,lord
that,is,your,quest
give,me,ninety,days,and,ninety,nights,without,a,murder,and,i,will,know,that,you,are,worthy,of,a,throne
can,you,do,that
hizdahr,looked,thoughtful
ninety,days,and,ninety,nights,without,a,corpse,and,on,the,ninety-first,we,wed
perhaps,said,dany,with,a,coy,look
though,young,girls,have,been,known,to,be,fickle
i,may,still,want,a,magic,sword
hizdahr,laughed
then,you,shall,have,that,too,radiance
your,wish,is,my,command
best,tell,your,seneschal,to,begin,making,preparations,for,our,wedding
nothing,would,please,the,noble,reznak,more
if,meereen,knew,that,a,wedding,was,in,the,offing,that,alone,might,buy,her,a,few,nights’,respite,even,if,hizdahr’s,efforts,came,to,naught
the,shavepate,will,not,be,happy,with,me,but,reznak,mo,reznak,will,dance,for,joy
dany,did,not,know,which,of,those,concerned,her,more
she,needed,skahaz,and,the,brazen,beasts,and,she,had,come,to,mistrust,all,of,reznak’s,counsel
beware,the,perfumed,seneschal
has,reznak,made,common,cause,with,hizdahr,and,the,green,grace,and,set,some,trap,to,snare,me
no,sooner,had,hizdahr,zo,loraq,taken,his,leave,of,her,than,ser,barristan,appeared,behind,her,in,his,long,white,cloak
years,of,service,in,the,kingsguard,had,taught,the,white,knight,how,to,remain,unobtrusive,when,she,was,entertaining,but,he,was,never,far
he,knows,she,saw,at,once,and,he,disapproves
the,lines,around,his,mouth,had,deepened
so,she,said,to,him,it,seems,that,i,may,wed,again
are,you,happy,for,me,ser
if,that,is,your,command,your,grace
hizdahr,is,not,the,husband,you,would,have,chosen,for,me
it,is,not,my,place,to,choose,your,husband
it,is,not,she,agreed,but,it,is,important,to,me,that,you,should,understand
my,people,are,bleeding
dying
a,queen,belongs,not,to,herself,but,to,the,realm
marriage,or,carnage,those,are,my,choices
a,wedding,or,a,war
your,grace,may,i,speak,frankly
always
there,is,a,third,choice
westeros

i,am,sworn,to,serve,your,grace,and,to,keep,you,safe,from,harm,wherever,you,may,go
my,place,is,by,your,side,whether,here,or,in,king’s,landing,but,your,place,is,back,in,westeros,upon,the,iron,throne,that,was,your,father’s
the,seven,kingdoms,will,never,accept,hizdahr,zo,loraq,as,king
no,more,than,meereen,will,accept,daenerys,targaryen,as,queen
the,green,grace,has,the,right,of,that
i,need,a,king,beside,me,a,king,of,old,ghiscari,blood
elsewise,they,will,always,see,me,as,the,uncouth,barbarian,who,smashed,through,their,gates,impaled,their,kin,on,spikes,and,stole,their,wealth
in,westeros,you,will,be,the,lost,child,who,returns,to,gladden,her,father’s,heart
your,people,will,cheer,when,you,ride,by,and,all,good,men,will,love,you
westeros,is,far,away
lingering,here,will,never,bring,it,any,closer
the,sooner,we,take,our,leave,of,this,place,i,know

hizdahr,may,fail
and,if,he,does,the,trying,buys,me,time
time,to,make,alliances,to,strengthen,my,defenses,to,and,if,he,does,not,fail

perhaps
ser,barristan,went,on
i,saw,your,father,and,your,mother,wed,as,well

how,many,men,did,you,lose,in,the,fighting

i,told,them,they,would,live,longer,fighting,with,your,dragons,than,against,them,and,they,saw,the,wisdom,in,my,words
that,made,her,wary
they,might,be,spying,for,yunkai
they,are,too,stupid,to,be,spies
you,do,not,know,them

i,only,see,that,you,keep,your,eye,on,them,that’s,all
she,felt,foolish,saying,it
she,always,felt,a,little,foolish,when,she,was,with,daario

the,hilts,of,daario’s,arakh,and,stiletto,were,wrought,in,the,shape,of,golden,women,naked,and,wanton
he,brushed,his,thumbs,across,them,in,a,way,that,was,remarkably,obscene,and,smiled,a,wicked,smile
dany,felt,blood,rushing,to,her,face
it,was,almost,as,if,he,were,caressing,her
would,he,think,me,wanton,too,if,i,pulled,him,into,bed
he,made,her,want,to,be,his,wanton
i,should,never,see,him,alone

he,will,never,be,the,stuff,of,kings

when,they,gather,in,the,temple,of,the,graces,turn,us,loose,upon,them
dany,was,appalled
he,is,a,monster
a,gallant,monster,but,a,monster,still
do,you,take,me,for,the,butcher,king
better,the,butcher,than,the,meat
all,kings,are,butchers
are,queens,so,different
this,queen,is
daario,shrugged
most,queens,have,no,purpose,but,to,warm,some,king’s,bed,and,pop,out,sons,for,him
if,that’s,the,sort,of,queen,you,mean,to,be,best,marry,hizdahr
her,anger,flashed

viserys,would,have,his,head,off,for,that,insolence
i,am,the,blood,of,the,dragon

when,dany,stood,the,lion,pelt,slipped,from,her,shoulders,and,tumbled,to,the,ground
leave,me
daario,gave,her,a,sweeping,bow
i,live,to,obey
when,he,was,gone,daenerys,called,ser,barristan,back
i,want,the,stormcrows,back,in,the,field
your,grace
they,have,only,now,returned,i,want,them,gone
let,them,scout,the,yunkish,hinterlands,and,give,protection,to,any,caravans,coming,over,the,khyzai,pass
henceforth,daario,shall,make,his,reports,to,you
give,him,every,honor,that,is,due,him,and,see,that,his,men,are,well,paid,but,on,no,account,admit,him,to,my,presence
as,you,say,your,grace
that,night,she,could,not,sleep,but,turned,and,twisted,restlessly,in,her,bed
she,even,went,so,far,as,to,summon,irri,hoping,her,caresses,might,help,ease,her,way,to,rest,but,after,a,short,while,she,pushed,the,dothraki,girl,away
irri,was,sweet,and,soft,and,willing,but,she,was,not,daario
what,have,i,done
she,thought,huddled,in,her,empty,bed
i,have,waited,so,long,for,him,to,come,back,and,i,send,him,away
he,would,make,a,monster,of,me,she,whispered,a,butcher,queen
but,then,she,thought,of,drogon,far,away,and,the,dragons,in,the,pit
there,is,blood,on,my,hands,too,and,on,my,heart
we,are,not,so,different,daario,and,i,we,are,both,monsters
the,lost,lord,it,should,not,have,taken,this,long,griff,told,himself,as,he,paced,the,deck,of,the,shy,maid
had,they,lost,haldon,as,they,had,tyrion,lannister
could,the,volantenes,have,taken,him
i,should,have,sent,duckfield,with,him
haldon,alone,could,not,be,trusted,he,had,proved,that,in,selhorys,when,he,let,the,dwarf,escape
the,shy,maid,was,tied,up,in,one,of,the,meaner,sections,of,the,long,chaotic,riverfront,between,a,listing,poleboat,that,had,not,left,the,pier,in,years,and,the,gaily,painted,mummers’,barge
the,mummers,were,a,loud,and,lively,lot,always,quoting,speeches,at,each,other,and,drunk,more,oft,than,not
the,day,was,hot,and,sticky,as,all,the,days,had,been,since,they,left,the,sorrows
a,ferocious,southern,sun,beat,down,upon,the,crowded,riverfront,of,volon,therys,but,heat,was,the,last,and,least,of,griff’s,concerns
the,golden,company,was,encamped,three,miles,south,of,town,well,north,of,where,he,had,expected,them,and,triarch,malaquo,had,come,north,with,five,thousand,foot,and,a,thousand,horse,to,cut,them,off,from,the,delta,road
daenerys,targaryen,remained,a,world,away,and,tyrion,lannister,well,he,could,be,most,anywhere
if,the,gods,were,good,lannister’s,severed,head,was,halfway,back,to,king’s,landing,by,now,but,more,like,the,dwarf,was,hale,and,whole,and,somewhere,close,stinking,drunk,and,plotting,some,new,infamy
where,in,the,seven,hells,is,haldon
griff,complained,to,lady,lemore
how,long,should,it,take,to,buy,three,horses
she,shrugged
my,lord,wouldn’t,it,be,safer,to,leave,the,boy,here,aboard,the,boat
safer,yes
wiser,no
he,is,a,man,grown,now,and,this,is,the,road,that,he,was,born,to,walk
griff,had,no,patience,for,this,quibbling
he,was,sick,of,hiding,sick,of,waiting,sick,of,caution
i,do,not,have,time,enough,for,caution
we,have,gone,to,great,lengths,to,keep,prince,aegon,hidden,all,these,years,lemore,reminded,him
the,time,will,come,for,him,to,wash,his,hair,and,declare,himself,i,know,but,that,time,is,not,now
not,to,a,camp,of,sellswords
if,harry,strickland,means,him,ill,hiding,him,on,the,shy,maid,will,not,protect,him
strickland,has,ten,thousand,swords,at,his,command
we,have,duck
aegon,is,all,that,could,be,wanted,in,a,prince
they,need,to,see,that,strickland,and,the,rest
these,are,his,own,men
his,because,they’re,bought,and,paid,for
ten,thousand,armed,strangers,plus,hangerson,and,camp,followers
all,it,takes,is,one,to,bring,us,all,to,ruin
if,hugor’s,head,was,worth,a,lord’s,honors,how,much,will,cersei,lannister,pay,for,the,rightful,heir,to,the,iron,throne
you,do,not,know,these,men,my,lord
it,has,been,a,dozen,years,since,you,last,rode,with,the,golden,company,and,your,old,friend,is,dead
blackheart
myles,toyne,had,been,so,full,of,life,the,last,time,griff,had,left,him,it,was,hard,to,accept,that,he,was,gone
a,golden,skull,atop,a,pole,and,homeless,harry,strickland,in,his,place
lemore,was,not,wrong,he,knew
whatever,their,sires,or,their,grandsires,might,have,been,back,in,westeros,before,their,exile,the,men,of,the,golden,company,were,sellswords,now,and,no,sellsword,could,be,trusted
even,so,last,night,he’d,dreamt,of,stoney,sept,again
alone,with,sword,in,hand,he,ran,from,house,to,house,smashing,down,doors,racing,up,stairs,leaping,from,roof,to,roof,as,his,ears,rang,to,the,sound,of,distant,bells
deep,bronze,booms,and,silver,chiming,pounded,through,his,skull,a,maddening,cacophony,of,noise,that,grew,ever,louder,until,it,seemed,as,if,his,head,would,explode
seventeen,years,had,come,and,gone,since,the,battle,of,the,bells,yet,the,sound,of,bells,ringing,still,tied,a,knot,in,his,guts
others,might,claim,that,the,realm,was,lost,when,prince,rhaegar,fell,to,robert’s,warhammer,on,the,trident,but,the,battle,of,the,trident,would,never,have,been,fought,if,the,griffin,had,only,slain,the,stag,there,in,stoney,sept,the,bells,tolled,for,all,of,us,that,day
for,aerys,and,his,queen,for,elia,of,dorne,and,her,little,daughter,for,every,true,man,and,honest,woman,in,the,seven,kingdoms
and,for,my,silver,prince
the,plan,was,to,reveal,prince,aegon,only,when,we,reached,queen,daenerys,lemore,was,saying
that,was,when,we,believed,the,girl,was,coming,west
our,dragon,queen,has,burned,that,plan,to,ash,and,thanks,to,that,fat,fool,in,pentos,we,have,grasped,the,she-dragon,by,the,tail,and,burned,our,fingers,to,the,bone
illyrio,could,not,have,been,expected,to,know,that,the,girl,would,choose,to,remain,at,slaver’s,bay
no,more,than,he,knew,that,the,beggar,king,would,die,young,or,that,khal,drogo,would,follow,him,into,the,grave
very,little,of,what,the,fat,man,has,anticipated,has,come,to,pass
griff,slapped,the,hilt,of,his,longsword,with,a,gloved,hand
i,have,danced,to,the,fat,man’s,pipes,for,years,lemore
what,has,it,availed,us
the,prince,is,a,man,grown
his,time,is,griff,yandry,called,loudly,above,the,clanging,of,the,mummers’,bell
it’s,haldon
so,it,was
the,halfmaester,looked,hot,and,bedraggled,as,he,made,his,way,along,the,waterfront,to,the,foot,of,the,pier
sweat,had,left,dark,rings,beneath,the,arms,of,his,light,linen,robes,and,he,had,the,same,sour,look,on,his,long,face,as,at,selhorys,when,he,returned,to,the,shy,maid,to,confess,that,the,dwarf,was,gone
he,was,leading,three,horses,however,and,that,was,all,that,mattered
bring,the,boy,griff,told,lemore
see,that,he’s,ready
as,you,say,she,answered,unhappily
so,be,it
he,had,grown,fond,of,lemore,but,that,did,not,mean,he,required,her,approval
her,task,had,been,to,instruct,the,prince,in,the,doctrines,of,the,faith,and,she,had,done,that
no,amount,of,prayer,would,put,him,on,the,iron,throne,however
that,was,griff’s,task
he,had,failed,prince,rhaegar,once
he,would,not,fail,his,son,not,whilst,life,remained,in,his,body
haldon’s,horses,did,not,please,him
were,these,the,best,that,you,could,find
he,complained,to,the,halfmaester
they,were,said,haldon,in,an,irritated,tone,and,you,had,best,not,ask,what,they,cost,us
with,dothraki,across,the,river,half,the,populace,of,volon,therys,has,decided,they,would,sooner,be,elsewhere,so,horseflesh,grows,more,expensive,every,day
i,should,have,gone,myself
after,selhorys,he,had,found,it,difficult,to,put,the,same,trust,in,haldon,as,previously
he,let,the,dwarf,beguile,him,with,that,glib,tongue,of,his
let,him,wander,off,into,a,whorehouse,alone,while,he,lingered,like,a,mooncalf,in,the,square
the,brothel,keeper,had,insisted,that,the,little,man,had,been,carried,off,at,swordpoint,but,griff,was,still,not,sure,he,believed,that
the,imp,was,clever,enough,to,have,conspired,in,his,own,escape
this,drunken,captor,that,the,whores,spoke,of,could,have,been,some,henchman,in,his,hire
i,share,the,blame
after,the,dwarf,put,himself,between,aegon,and,the,stone,man,i,let,down,my,guard
i,should,have,slit,his,throat,the,first,time,i,laid,eyes,on,him
they,will,do,well,enough,i,suppose,he,told,haldon
the,camp,is,only,three,miles,south
the,shy,maid,would,have,gotten,them,there,more,quickly,but,he,preferred,to,keep,harry,strickland,ignorant,of,where,he,and,the,prince,had,been
nor,did,he,relish,the,prospect,of,splashing,through,the,shallows,to,climb,some,muddy,riverbank
that,sort,of,entrance,might,serve,for,a,sellsword,and,his,son,but,not,for,a,great,lord,and,his,prince
when,the,lad,emerged,from,the,cabin,with,lemore,by,his,side,griff,looked,him,over,carefully,from,head,to,heel
the,prince,wore,sword,and,dagger,black,boots,polished,to,a,high,sheen,a,black,cloak,lined,with,blood-red,silk
with,his,hair,washed,and,cut,and,freshly,dyed,a,deep,dark,blue,his,eyes,looked,blue,as,well
at,his,throat,he,wore,three,huge,square-cut,rubies,on,a,chain,of,black,iron,a,gift,from,magister,illyrio
red,and,black
dragon,colors
that,was,good
you,look,a,proper,prince,he,told,the,boy
your,father,would,be,proud,if,he,could,see,you
young,griff,ran,his,fingers,through,his,hair
i,am,sick,of,this,blue,dye
we,should,have,washed,it,out
soon,enough
griff,would,be,glad,to,go,back,to,his,own,true,colors,too,though,his,once,red,hair,had,gone,to,grey
he,clapped,the,lad,on,the,shoulder
shall,we,go
your,army,awaits,your,coming
i,like,the,sound,of,that
my,army
a,smile,flashed,across,his,face,then,vanished
are,they,though
they’re,sellswords
yollo,warned,me,to,trust,no,one
there,is,wisdom,in,that,griff,admitted
it,might,have,been,different,if,blackheart,still,commanded,but,myles,toyne,was,four,years,dead,and,homeless,harry,strickland,was,a,different,sort,of,man
he,would,not,say,that,to,the,boy,however
that,dwarf,had,already,planted,enough,doubts,in,his,young,head
not,every,man,is,what,he,seems,and,a,prince,especially,has,good,cause,to,be,wary,but,go,too,far,down,that,road,and,the,mistrust,can,poison,you,make,you,sour,and,fearful
king,aerys,was,one,such
by,the,end,even,rhaegar,saw,that,plain,enough
you,would,do,best,to,walk,a,middle,course
let,men,earn,your,trust,with,leal,service,but,when,they,do,be,generous,and,openhearted
the,boy,nodded
i,will,remember
they,gave,the,prince,the,best,of,the,three,horses,a,big,grey,gelding,so,pale,that,he,was,almost,white
griff,and,haldon,rode,beside,him,on,lesser,mounts
the,road,ran,south,beneath,the,high,white,walls,of,volon,therys,for,a,good,half,mile
then,they,left,the,town,behind,following,the,winding,course,of,the,rhoyne,through,willow,groves,and,poppy,fields,and,past,a,tall,wooden,windmill,whose,blades,creaked,like,old,bones,as,they,turned
they,found,the,golden,company,beside,the,river,as,the,sun,was,lowering,in,the,west
it,was,a,camp,that,even,arthur,dayne,might,have,approved,of,compact,orderly,defensible
a,deep,ditch,had,been,dug,around,it,with,sharpened,stakes,inside
the,tents,stood,in,rows,with,broad,avenues,between,them
the,latrines,had,been,placed,beside,the,river,so,the,current,would,wash,away,the,wastes
the,horse,lines,were,to,the,north,and,beyond,them,two,dozen,elephants,grazed,beside,the,water,pulling,up,reeds,with,their,trunks
griff,glanced,at,the,great,grey,beasts,with,approval
there,is,not,a,warhorse,in,all,of,westeros,that,will,stand,against,them
tall,battle,standards,of,cloth-of-gold,flapped,atop,lofty,poles,along,the,perimeters,of,the,camp
beneath,them,armed,and,armored,sentries,walked,their,rounds,with,spears,and,crossbows,watching,every,approach
griff,had,feared,that,the,company,might,have,grown,lax,under,harry,strickland,who,had,always,seemed,more,concerned,with,making,friends,than,enforcing,discipline,but,it,would,seem,his,worries,had,been,misplaced
at,the,gate,haldon,said,something,to,the,serjeant,of,guards,and,a,runner,was,sent,off,to,find,a,captain
when,he,turned,up,he,was,just,as,ugly,as,the,last,time,griff,laid,eyes,on,him
a,big-bellied,shambling,hulk,of,a,man,the,sellsword,had,a,seamed,face,crisscrossed,with,old,scars
his,right,ear,looked,as,if,a,dog,had,chewed,on,it,and,his,left,was,missing
have,they,made,you,a,captain,flowers
griff,said
i,thought,the,golden,company,had,standards
it’s,worse,than,that,you,bugger,said,franklyn,flowers
they,knighted,me,as,well
he,clasped,griff,by,the,forearm,pulled,him,into,a,bone-crushing,hug
you,look,awful,even,for,a,man’s,been,dead,a,dozen,years
blue,hair,is,it
when,harry,said,you’d,be,turning,up,i,almost,shit,myself
and,haldon,you,icy,cunt,good,to,see,you,too
still,have,that,stick,up,your,arse
he,turned,to,young,griff
and,this,would,be,my,squire
lad,this,is,franklyn,flowers
the,prince,acknowledged,him,with,a,nod
flowers,is,a,bastard,name
you’re,from,the,reach
aye
my,mother,was,a,washerwoman,at,cider,hall,till,one,of,milord’s,sons,raped,her
makes,me,a,sort,o’,brown,apple,fossoway,the,way,i,see,it
flowers,waved,them,through,the,gate
come,with,me
strickland’s,called,all,the,officers,to,his,tent
war,council
the,bloody,volantenes,are,rattling,their,spears,and,demanding,to,know,our,intentions
the,men,of,the,golden,company,were,outside,their,tents,dicing,drinking,and,swatting,away,flies
griff,wondered,how,many,of,them,knew,who,he,was
few,enough
twelve,years,is,a,long,time
even,the,men,who’d,ridden,with,him,might,not,recognize,the,exile,lord,jon,connington,of,the,fiery,red,beard,in,the,lined,clean-shaved,face,and,dyed,blue,hair,of,the,sellsword,griff
so,far,as,most,of,them,were,concerned,connington,had,drunk,himself,to,death,in,lys,after,being,driven,from,the,company,in,disgrace,for,stealing,from,the,war,chest
the,shame,of,the,lie,still,stuck,in,his,craw,but,varys,had,insisted,it,was,necessary
we,want,no,songs,about,the,gallant,exile,the,eunuch,had,tittered,in,that,mincing,voice,of,his
those,who,die,heroic,deaths,are,long,remembered,thieves,and,drunks,and,cravens,soon,forgotten
what,does,a,eunuch,know,of,a,man’s,honor
griff,had,gone,along,with,the,spider’s,scheme,for,the,boy’s,sake,but,that,did,not,mean,he,liked,it,any,better
let,me,live,long,enough,to,see,the,boy,sit,the,iron,throne,and,varys,will,pay,for,that,slight,and,so,much,more
then,we’ll,see,who’s,soon,forgotten
the,captain-general’s,tent,was,made,of,cloth-of-gold,and,surrounded,by,a,ring,of,pikes,topped,with,gilded,skulls
one,skull,was,larger,than,the,rest,grotesquely,malformed
below,it,was,a,second,no,larger,than,a,child’s,fist
maelys,the,monstrous,and,his,nameless,brother
the,other,skulls,had,a,sameness,to,them,though,several,had,been,cracked,and,splintered,by,the,blows,that,had,slain,them,and,one,had,filed,pointed,teeth
which,one,is,myles
griff,found,himself,asking
there
on,the,end
flowers,pointed
wait
i’ll,go,announce,you
he,slipped,inside,the,tent,leaving,griff,to,contemplate,the,gilded,skull,of,his,old,friend
in,life,ser,myles,toyne,had,been,ugly,as,sin
his,famous,forebear,the,dark,and,dashing,terrence,toyne,of,whom,the,singers,sang,had,been,so,fair,of,face,that,even,the,king’s,mistress,could,not,resist,him,but,myles,had,been,possessed,of,jug,ears,a,crooked,jaw,and,the,biggest,nose,that,jon,connington,had,ever,seen
when,he,smiled,at,you,though,none,of,that,mattered
blackheart,his,men,had,named,him,for,the,sigil,on,his,shield
myles,had,loved,the,name,and,all,it,hinted,at
a,captain-general,should,be,feared,by,friend,and,foe,alike,he,had,once,confessed
if,men,think,me,cruel,so,much,the,better
the,truth,was,otherwise
soldier,to,the,bone,toyne,was,fierce,but,always,fair,a,father,to,his,men,and,always,generous,to,the,exile,lord,jon,connington
death,had,robbed,him,of,his,ears,his,nose,and,all,his,warmth
the,smile,remained,transformed,into,a,glittering,golden,grin
all,the,skulls,were,grinning,even,bittersteel’s,on,the,tall,pike,in,the,center
what,does,he,have,to,grin,about
he,died,defeated,and,alone,a,broken,man,in,an,alien,land
on,his,deathbed,ser,aegor,rivers,had,famously,commanded,his,men,to,boil,the,flesh,from,his,skull,dip,it,in,gold,and,carry,it,before,them,when,they,crossed,the,sea,to,retake,westeros
his,successors,had,followed,his,example
jon,connington,might,have,been,one,of,those,successors,if,his,exile,had,gone,otherwise
he,had,spent,five,years,with,the,company,rising,from,the,ranks,to,a,place,of,honor,at,toyne’s,right,hand
had,he,stayed,it,might,well,have,been,him,the,men,turned,to,after,myles,died,instead,of,harry,strickland
but,griff,did,not,regret,the,path,he’d,chosen
when,i,return,to,westeros,it,will,not,be,as,a,skull,atop,a,pole
flowers,stepped,out,of,the,tent
go,on,in
the,high,officers,of,the,golden,company,rose,from,stools,and,camp,chairs,as,they,entered
old,friends,greeted,griff,with,smiles,and,embraces,the,new,men,more,formally
not,all,of,them,are,as,glad,to,see,us,as,they,would,have,me,believe
he,sensed,knives,behind,some,of,the,smiles
until,quite,recently,most,of,them,had,believed,that,lord,jon,connington,was,safely,in,his,grave,and,no,doubt,many,felt,that,was,a,fine,place,for,him,a,man,who,would,steal,from,his,brothers-in-arms
griff,might,have,felt,the,same,way,in,their,place
ser,franklyn,did,the,introductions
some,of,the,sellsword,captains,bore,bastard,names,as,flowers,did,rivers,hill,stone
others,claimed,names,that,had,once,loomed,large,in,the,histories,of,the,seven,kingdoms,griff,counted,two,strongs,three,peakes,a,mudd,a,mandrake,a,lothston,a,pair,of,coles
not,all,were,genuine,he,knew
in,the,free,companies,a,man,could,call,himself,whatever,he,chose
by,any,name,the,sellswords,displayed,a,rude,splendor
like,many,in,their,trade,they,kept,their,worldly,wealth,upon,their,persons,jeweled,swords,inlaid,armor,heavy,torcs,and,fine,silks,were,much,in,evidence,and,every,man,there,wore,a,lord’s,ransom,in,golden,arm,rings
each,ring,signified,one,year’s,service,with,the,golden,company
marq,mandrake,whose,poxscarred,face,had,a,hole,in,one,cheek,where,a,slave’s,mark,had,been,burned,away,wore,a,chain,of,golden,skulls,as,well
not,every,captain,was,of,westerosi,blood
black,balaq,a,white-haired,summer,islander,with,skin,dark,as,soot,commanded,the,company’s,archers,as,in,blackheart’s,day
he,wore,a,feathered,cloak,of,green,and,orange,magnificent,to,behold
the,cadaverous,volantene,gorys,edoryen,had,replaced,strickland,as,paymaster
a,leopard,skin,was,draped,across,one,shoulder,and,hair,as,red,as,blood,tumbled,to,his,shoulders,in,oiled,ringlets,though,his,pointed,beard,was,black
the,spymaster,was,new,to,griff,a,lyseni,named,lysono,maar,with,lilac,eyes,and,white-gold,hair,and,lips,that,would,have,been,the,envy,of,a,whore
at,first,glance,griff,had,almost,taken,him,for,a,woman
his,fingernails,were,painted,purple,and,his,earlobes,dripped,with,pearls,and,amethysts
ghosts,and,liars,griff,thought,as,he,surveyed,their,faces
revenants,from,forgotten,wars,lost,causes,failed,rebellions,a,brotherhood,of,the,failed,and,the,fallen,the,disgraced,and,the,disinherited
this,is,my,army
this,is,our,best,hope
he,turned,to,harry,strickland
homeless,harry,looked,little,like,a,warrior
portly,with,a,big,round,head,mild,grey,eyes,and,thinning,hair,that,he,brushed,sideways,to,conceal,a,bald,spot,strickland,sat,in,a,camp,chair,soaking,his,feet,in,a,tub,of,salt,water
you,will,pardon,me,if,i,do,not,rise,he,said,by,way,of,greeting
our,march,was,wearisome,and,my,toes,are,prone,to,blisters
it,is,a,curse
it,is,a,mark,of,weakness
you,sound,like,an,old,woman
the,stricklands,had,been,part,of,the,golden,company,since,its,founding,harry’s,great-grandsire,having,lost,his,lands,when,he,rose,with,the,black,dragon,during,the,first,blackfyre,rebellion
gold,for,four,generations,harry,would,boast,as,if,four,generations,of,exile,and,defeat,were,something,to,take,pride,in
i,can,make,you,an,ointment,for,that,said,haldon,and,there,are,certain,mineral,salts,that,will,toughen,your,skin
that,is,kind,of,you
strickland,beckoned,to,his,squire
watkyn,wine,for,our,friends
thank,you,but,no,said,griff
we,will,drink,water
as,you,prefer
the,captain-general,smiled,up,at,the,prince
and,this,must,be,your,son
does,he,know
griff,wondered
how,much,did,myles,tell,him
varys,had,been,adamant,about,the,need,for,secrecy
the,plans,that,he,and,illyrio,had,made,with,blackheart,had,been,known,to,them,alone
the,rest,of,the,company,had,been,left,ignorant
what,they,did,not,know,they,could,not,let,slip
that,time,was,done,though
no,man,could,have,asked,for,a,worthier,son,griff,said,but,the,lad,is,not,of,my,blood,and,his,name,is,not,griff
my,lords,i,give,you,aegon,targaryen,firstborn,son,of,rhaegar,prince,of,dragonstone,by,princess,elia,of,dorne,soon,with,your,help,to,be,aegon,the,sixth,of,his,name,king,of,andals,the,rhoynar,and,the,first,men,and,lord,of,the,seven,kingdoms
silence,greeted,his,announcement
someone,cleared,his,throat
one,of,the,coles,refilled,his,wine,cup,from,the,flagon
gorys,edoryen,played,with,one,of,his,corkscrew,ringlets,and,murmured,something,in,a,tongue,griff,did,not,know
laswell,peake,coughed,mandrake,and,lothston,exchanged,a,glance
they,know,griff,realized,then
they,have,known,all,along
he,turned,to,look,at,harry,strickland
when,did,you,tell,them
the,captain-general,wriggled,his,blistered,toes,in,his,footbath
when,we,reached,the,river
the,company,was,restless,with,good,reason
we,walked,away,from,an,easy,campaign,in,the,disputed,lands,and,for,what
so,we,could,swelter,in,this,god-awful,heat,watching,our,coins,melt,away,and,our,blades,go,to,rust,whilst,i,turn,away,rich,contracts
that,news,made,griff’s,skin,crawl
who
the,yunkishmen
the,envoy,that,they,sent,to,woo,volantis,has,already,dispatched,three,free,companies,to,slaver’s,bay
he,wishes,us,to,be,the,fourth,and,offers,twice,what,myr,was,paying,us,plus,a,slave,for,every,man,in,the,company,ten,for,every,officer,and,a,hundred,choice,maidens,all,for,me
bloody,hell
that,would,require,thousands,of,slaves
where,do,the,yunkishmen,expect,to,find,so,many
in,meereen
strickland,beckoned,to,his,squire
watkyn,a,towel
this,water’s,growing,cool,and,my,toes,have,wrinkled,up,like,raisins
no,not,that,towel,the,soft,one
you,refused,him,said,griff
i,told,him,i,would,think,on,his,proposal
harry,winced,as,his,squire,toweled,his,feet
gentle,with,the,toes
think,of,them,as,thin-skinned,grapes,lad
you,want,to,dry,them,without,crushing,them
pat,do,not,scrub
yes,like,that
he,turned,back,to,griff
a,blunt,refusal,would,have,been,unwise
the,men,might,rightly,ask,if,i,had,taken,leave,of,my,wits
you,will,have,work,for,your,blades,soon,enough
will,we
asked,lysono,maar
i,assume,you,know,that,the,targaryen,girl,has,not,started,for,the,west
we,heard,that,tale,in,selhorys
no,tale
simple,truth
the,why,of,it,is,harder,to,grasp
sack,meereen,aye,why,not
i,would,have,done,the,same,in,her,place
the,slaver,cities,reek,of,gold,and,conquest,requires,coin
but,why,linger
fear
madness
sloth
the,why,of,it,does,not,matter
harry,strickland,unrolled,a,pair,of,striped,woolen,stockings
she,is,in,meereen,and,we,are,here,where,the,volantenes,grow,daily,more,unhappy,with,our,presence
we,came,to,raise,up,a,king,and,queen,who,would,lead,us,home,to,westeros,but,this,targaryen,girl,seems,more,intent,on,planting,olive,trees,than,in,reclaiming,her,father’s,throne
meanwhile,her,foes,gather
yunkai,new,ghis,tolos
bloodbeard,and,the,tattered,prince,will,both,be,in,the,field,against,her,and,soon,enough,the,fleets,of,old,volantis,will,descend,on,her,as,well
what,does,she,have
bedslaves,with,sticks
unsullied,said,griff
and,dragons
dragons,aye,the,captain-general,said,but,young,ones,hardly,more,than,hatchlings
strickland,eased,his,sock,over,his,blisters,and,up,his,ankle
how,much,will,they,avail,her,when,all,these,armies,close,about,her,city,like,a,fist
tristan,rivers,drummed,his,fingers,on,his,knee
all,the,more,reason,that,we,must,reach,her,quickly,i,say
if,daenerys,will,not,come,to,us,we,must,go,to,daenerys
can,we,walk,across,the,waves,ser
asked,lysono,maar
i,tell,you,again,we,cannot,reach,the,silver,queen,by,sea
i,slipped,into,volantis,myself,posing,as,a,trader,to,learn,how,many,ships,might,be,available,to,us
the,harbor,teems,with,galleys,cogs,and,carracks,of,every,sort,and,size,yet,even,so,i,soon,found,myself,consorting,with,smugglers,and,pirates
we,have,ten,thousand,men,in,the,company,as,i,am,sure,lord,connington,remembers,from,his,years,of,service,with,us
five,hundred,knights,each,with,three,horses
five,hundred,squires,with,one,mount,apiece
and,elephants,we,must,not,forget,the,elephants
a,pirate,ship,will,not,suffice
we,would,need,a,pirate,fleet,and,even,if,we,found,one,the,word,has,come,back,from,slaver’s,bay,that,meereen,has,been,closed,off,by,blockade
we,could,feign,acceptance,of,the,yunkish,offer,urged,gorys,edoryen
allow,the,yunkai’i,to,transport,us,to,the,east,then,return,their,gold,beneath,the,walls,of,meereen
one,broken,contract,is,stain,enough,upon,the,honor,of,the,company
homeless,harry,strickland,paused,with,his,blistered,foot,in,hand
let,me,remind,you,it,was,myles,toyne,who,put,his,seal,to,this,secret,pact,not,me
i,would,honor,his,agreement,if,i,could,but,how
it,seems,plain,to,me,that,the,targaryen,girl,is,never,coming,west
westeros,was,her,father’s,kingdom
meereen,is,hers
if,she,can,break,the,yunkai’i,she’ll,be,queen,of,slaver’s,bay
if,not,she’ll,die,long,before,we,could,hope,to,reach,her
his,words,came,as,no,surprise,to,griff
harry,strickland,had,always,been,a,genial,man,better,at,hammering,out,contracts,than,at,hammering,on,foes
he,had,a,nose,for,gold,but,whether,he,had,the,belly,for,battle,was,another,question
there,is,the,land,route,suggested,franklyn,flowers
the,demon,road,is,death
we,will,lose,half,the,company,to,desertion,if,we,attempt,that,march,and,bury,half,of,those,who,remain,beside,the,road
it,grieves,me,to,say,it,but,magister,illyrio,and,his,friends,may,have,been,unwise,to,put,so,much,hope,on,this,child,queen
no,thought,griff,but,they,were,most,unwise,to,put,their,hopes,on,you
and,then,prince,aegon,spoke
then,put,your,hopes,on,me,he,said
daenerys,is,prince,rhaegar’s,sister,but,i,am,rhaegar’s,son
i,am,the,only,dragon,that,you,need
griff,put,a,black-gloved,hand,upon,prince,aegon’s,shoulder
spoken,boldly,he,said,but,think,what,you,are,saying
i,have,the,lad,insisted
why,should,i,go,running,to,my,aunt,as,if,i,were,a,beggar
my,claim,is,better,than,her,own
let,her,come,to,me,in,westeros
franklyn,flowers,laughed
i,like,it
sail,west,not,east
leave,the,little,queen,to,her,olives,and,seat,prince,aegon,upon,the,iron,throne
the,boy,has,stones,give,him,that
the,captain-general,looked,as,if,someone,had,slapped,his,face
has,the,sun,curdled,your,brains,flowers
we,need,the,girl
we,need,the,marriage
if,daenerys,accepts,our,princeling,and,takes,him,for,her,consort,the,seven,kingdoms,will,do,the,same
without,her,the,lords,will,only,mock,his,claim,and,brand,him,a,fraud,and,a,pretender
and,how,do,you,propose,to,get,to,westeros
you,heard,lysono
there,are,no,ships,to,be,had
this,man,is,afraid,to,fight,griff,realized
how,could,they,have,chosen,him,to,take,the,blackheart’s,place
no,ships,for,slaver’s,bay
westeros,is,another,matter
the,east,is,closed,to,us,not,the,sea
the,triarchs,would,be,glad,to,see,the,back,of,us,i,do,not,doubt
they,might,even,help,us,arrange,passage,back,to,the,seven,kingdoms
no,city,wants,an,army,on,its,doorstep
he’s,not,wrong,said,lysono,maar
by,now,the,lion,surely,has,the,dragon’s,scent,said,one,of,the,coles,but,cersei’s,attentions,will,be,fixed,upon,meereen,and,this,other,queen
she,knows,nothing,of,our,prince
once,we,land,and,raise,our,banners,many,and,more,will,flock,to,join,us
some,allowed,homeless,harry,not,many
rhaegar’s,sister,has,dragons
rhaegar’s,son,does,not
we,do,not,have,the,strength,to,take,the,realm,without,daenerys,and,her,army
her,unsullied
the,first,aegon,took,westeros,without,eunuchs,said,lysono,maar
why,shouldn’t,the,sixth,aegon,do,the,same
the,plan,which,plan
said,tristan,rivers
the,fat,man’s,plan
the,one,that,changes,every,time,the,moon,turns
first,viserys,targaryen,was,to,join,us,with,fifty,thousand,dothraki,screamers,at,his,back
then,the,beggar,king,was,dead,and,it,was,to,be,the,sister,a,pliable,young,child,queen,who,was,on,her,way,to,pentos,with,three,new-hatched,dragons
instead,the,girl,turns,up,on,slaver’s,bay,and,leaves,a,string,of,burning,cities,in,her,wake,and,the,fat,man,decides,we,should,meet,her,by,volantis
now,that,plan,is,in,ruins,as,well
i,have,had,enough,of,illyrio’s,plans
robert,baratheon,won,the,iron,throne,without,the,benefit,of,dragons
we,can,do,the,same
and,if,i,am,wrong,and,the,realm,does,not,rise,for,us,we,can,always,retreat,back,across,the,narrow,sea,as,bittersteel,once,did,and,others,after,him
strickland,shook,his,head,stubbornly
the,risk,is,not,what,it,was,now,that,tywin,lannister,is,dead

it,took,the,windblown,less,than,an,hour,to,strike,their,camp
and,now,we,ride,the,tattered,prince,proclaimed,from,his,huge,grey,warhorse,in,a,classic,high,valyrian,that,was,the,closest,thing,they,had,to,a,company,tongue
his,stallion’s,spotted,hindquarters,were,covered,with,ragged,strips,of,cloth,torn,from,the,surcoats,of,men,his,master,had,slain
the,prince’s,cloak,was,sewn,together,from,more,of,the,same
an,old,man,he,was,past,sixty,yet,he,still,sat,straight,and,tall,in,the,high,saddle,and,his,voice,was,strong,enough,to,carry,to,every,corner,of,the,field
astapor,was,but,a,taste,he,said,meereen,will,be,the,feast,and,the,sellswords,sent,up,a,wild,cheer
streamers,of,pale,blue,silk,fluttered,from,their,lances,whilst,fork-tailed,blue-and-white,banners,flew,overhead,the,standards,of,the,windblown
the,three,dornishmen,cheered,with,all,the,rest
silence,would,have,drawn,notice
but,as,the,windblown,rode,north,along,the,coast,road,close,behind,bloodbeard,and,the,company,of,the,cat,frog,fell,in,beside,dornish,gerrold
soon,he,said,in,the,common,tongue,of,westeros

we,need,to,do,it,soon
not,here,warned,gerris,with,a,mummer’s,empty,smile
we’ll,speak,of,this,tonight,when,we,make,camp
it,was,a,hundred,leagues,from,astapor,to,yunkai,by,the,old,ghiscari,coast,road,and,another,fifty,from,yunkai,to,meereen
the,free,companies,well,mounted,could,reach,yunkai,in,six,days,of,hard,riding,or,eight,at,a,more,leisurely,pace
the,legions,from,old,ghis,would,take,half,again,as,long,marching,afoot,and,the,yunkai’i,and,their,slave,soldiers,with,their,generals,it’s,a,wonder,they,don’t,march,into,the,sea,beans,said
the,yunkai’i,did,not,lack,for,commanders
an,old,hero,named,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,had,the,supreme,command,though,the,men,of,the,windblown,glimpsed,him,only,at,a,distance,coming,and,going,in,a,palanquin,so,huge,it,required,forty,slaves,to,carry,it
they,could,not,help,but,see,his,underlings,however
the,yunkish,lordlings,scuttled,everywhere,like,roaches
half,of,them,seemed,to,be,named,ghazdan,grazdan,mazdhan,or,ghaznak,telling,one,ghiscari,name,from,another,was,an,art,few,of,the,windblown,had,mastered,so,they,gave,them,mocking,styles,of,their,own,devising
foremost,amongst,them,was,the,yellow,whale,an,obscenely,fat,man,who,always,wore,yellow,silk,tokars,with,golden,fringes
too,heavy,even,to,stand,unassisted,he,could,not,hold,his,water,so,he,always,smelled,of,piss,a,stench,so,sharp,that,even,heavy,perfumes,could,not,conceal,it
but,he,was,said,to,be,the,richest,man,in,yunkai,and,he,had,a,passion,for,grotesques,his,slaves,included,a,boy,with,the,legs,and,hooves,of,a,goat,a,bearded,woman,a,two-headed,monster,from,mantarys,and,a,hermaphrodite,who,warmed,his,bed,at,night

then,there,was,the,girl,general,who,rode,about,on,a,white,horse,with,a,red,mane,and,commanded,a,hundred,strapping,slave,soldiers,that,she,had,bred,and,trained,herself,all,of,them,young,lean,rippling,with,muscle,and,naked,but,for,breechclouts,yellow,cloaks,and,long,bronze,shields,with,erotic,inlays
their,mistress,could,not,have,been,more,than,sixteen,and,fancied,herself,yunkai’s,own,daenerys,targaryen
the,little,pigeon,was,not,quite,a,dwarf,but,he,might,have,passed,for,one,in,a,bad,light
yet,he,strutted,about,as,if,he,were,a,giant,with,his,plump,little,legs,spread,wide,and,his,plump,little,chest,puffed,out

even,the,little,pigeon,and,his,herons,paled,beside,the,folly,of,the,brothers,the,sellswords,called,the,clanker,lords
the,last,time,the,slave,soldiers,of,yunkai’i,had,faced,the,dragon,queen’s,unsullied,they,broke,and,ran

every,one,was,wealthy,every,one,was,arrogant,and,every,one,was,a,captain,and,commander,answerable,to,no,one,but,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,disdainful,of,mere,sellswords,and,prone,to,squabbles,over,precedence,that,were,as,endless,as,they,were,incomprehensible
in,the,time,it,took,the,windblown,to,ride,three,miles,the,yunkai’i,had,fallen,two-and-ahalf,miles,behind
a,pack,of,stinking,yellow,fools,beans,complained

a,real,fight,thought,frog
the,words,stuck,in,his,craw
the,fight,beneath,the,walls,of,astapor,had,seemed,real,enough,to,him,though,he,knew,the,sellswords,felt,otherwise
that,was,butchery,not,battle,the,warrior,bard,denzo,d’han,had,been,heard,to,declare,afterward
denzo,was,a,captain,and,veteran,of,a,hundred,battles
frog’s,experience,was,limited,to,practice,yard,and,tourney,ground,so,he,did,not,think,it,was,his,place,to,dispute,the,verdict,of,such,a,seasoned,warrior
it,seemed,like,a,battle,when,it,first,began,though
he,remembered,how,his,gut,had,clenched,when,he,was,kicked,awake,at,dawn,with,the,big,man,looming,over,him
into,your,armor,slugabed,he’d,boomed
the,butcher’s,coming,out,to,give,us,battle
up,unless,you,mean,to,be,his,meat
the,butcher,king,is,dead,frog,had,protested,sleepily
that,was,the,story,all,of,them,had,heard,as,they,scrambled,from,the,ships,that,had,brought,them,from,old,volantis
a,second,king,cleon,had,taken,the,crown,and,died,in,turn,supposedly,and,now,the,astapori,were,ruled,by,a,whore,and,a,mad,barber,whose,followers,were,fighting,with,each,other,to,control,the,city
maybe,they,lied,the,big,man,had,replied
or,else,this,is,some,other,butcher
might,be,the,first,one,come,back,screaming,from,his,tomb,to,kill,some,yunkishmen
makes,no,bloody,matter,frog
get,your,armor,on
the,tent,slept,ten,and,all,of,them,had,been,on,their,feet,by,then,wriggling,into,breeches,and,boots,sliding,long,coats,of,ringmail,down,onto,their,shoulders,buckling,breastplates,tightening,the,straps,on,greaves,or,vambraces,grabbing,for,helms,and,shields,and,sword,belts
gerris,quick,as,ever,was,the,first,one,fully,clad,arch,close,behind,him
together,they,helped,quentyn,don,his,own,harness
three,hundred,yards,away,astapor’s,new,unsullied,had,been,pouring,through,their,gates,and,forming,up,in,ranks,beneath,their,city’s,crumbling,red,brick,walls,dawn,light,glinting,off,their,spiked,bronze,helmets,and,the,points,of,their,long,spears
the,three,dornishmen,spilled,from,the,tent,together,to,join,the,fighters,sprinting,for,the,horse,lines
battle
quentyn,had,trained,with,spear,and,sword,and,shield,since,he,was,old,enough,to,walk,but,that,meant,nothing,now
warrior,make,me,brave,frog,had,prayed,as,drums,beat,in,the,distance,boom,boom,boom,boom,boom,boom
the,big,man,pointed,out,the,butcher,king,to,him,sitting,stiff,and,tall,upon,an,armored,horse,in,a,suit,of,copper,scale,that,flashed,brilliantly,in,the,morning,sun
he,remembered,gerris,sidling,up,just,before,the,fight,began
stay,close,to,arch,whatever,happens
remember,you’re,the,only,one,of,us,who,can,get,the,girl
by,then,the,astapori,were,advancing
dead,or,alive,the,butcher,king,still,took,the,wise,masters,unawares
the,yunkishmen,were,still,running,about,in,fluttering,tokars,trying,to,get,their,half-trained,slave,soldiers,into,some,semblance,of,order,as,unsullied,spears,came,crashing,through,their,siege,lines
if,not,for,their,allies,and,their,despised,hirelings,they,might,well,have,been,overwhelmed,but,the,windblown,and,the,company,of,the,cat,were,ahorse,in,minutes,and,came,thundering,down,on,the,astapori,flanks,even,as,a,legion,from,new,ghis,pushed,through,the,yunkish,camp,from,the,other,side,and,met,the,unsullied,spear,to,spear,and,shield,to,shield
the,rest,was,butchery,but,this,time,it,was,the,butcher,king,on,the,wrong,end,of,the,cleaver
caggo,was,the,one,who,finally,cut,him,down,fighting,through,the,king’s,protectors,on,his,monstrous,warhorse,and,opening,cleon,the,great,from,shoulder,to,hip,with,one,blow,of,his,curved,valyrian,arakh
frog,did,not,see,it,but,those,who,did,claimed,cleon’s,copper,armor,rent,like,silk,and,from,within,came,an,awful,stench,and,a,hundred,wriggling,grave,worms
cleon,had,been,dead,after,all
the,desperate,astapori,had,pulled,him,from,his,tomb,clapped,him,into,armor,and,tied,him,onto,a,horse,in,hopes,of,giving,heart,to,their,unsullied
dead,cleon’s,fall,wrote,an,end,to,that
the,new,unsullied,threw,down,their,spears,and,shields,and,ran,only,to,find,the,gates,of,astapor,shut,behind,them
frog,had,done,his,part,in,the,slaughter,that,followed,riding,down,the,frightened,eunuchs,with,the,other,windblown
hard,by,the,big,man’s,hip,he,rode,slashing,right,and,left,as,their,wedge,went,through,the,unsullied,like,a,spearpoint
when,they,burst,through,on,the,other,side,the,tattered,prince,had,wheeled,them,round,and,led,them,through,again
it,was,only,coming,back,that,frog,got,a,good,look,at,the,faces,beneath,the,spiked,bronze,caps,and,realized,that,most,were,no,older,than,he
green,boys,screaming,for,their,mothers,he’d,thought,but,he,killed,them,all,the,same
by,the,time,he’d,left,the,field,his,sword,was,running,red,with,blood,and,his,arm,was,so,tired,he,could,hardly,lift,it
yet,that,was,no,real,fight,he,thought
the,real,fight,will,be,on,us,soon,and,we,must,be,away,before,it,comes,or,we’ll,find,ourselves,fighting,on,the,wrong,side
that,night,the,windblown,made,camp,beside,the,shore,of,slaver’s,bay
frog,drew,the,first,watch,and,was,sent,to,guard,the,horse,lines
gerris,met,him,there,just,after,sundown,as,a,half-moon,shone,upon,the,waters
the,big,man,should,be,here,as,well,said,quentyn
he’s,gone,to,look,up,old,bill,bone,and,lose,the,rest,of,his,silver,gerris,said
leave,him,out,of,this
he’ll,do,as,we,say,though,he,won’t,like,it,much
no
there,was,much,and,more,about,this,quentyn,did,not,like,himself
sailing,on,an,overcrowded,ship,tossed,by,wind,and,sea,eating,hard-bread,crawling,with,weevils,and,drinking,black,tar,rum,to,sweet,oblivion,sleeping,on,piles,of,moldy,straw,with,the,stench,of,strangers,in,his,nostrils,all,that,he,had,expected,when,he,made,his,mark,on,that,scrap,of,parchment,in,volantis,pledging,the,tattered,prince,his,sword,and,service,for,a,year
those,were,hardships,to,be,endured,the,stuff,of,all,adventures
but,what,must,come,next,was,plain,betrayal
the,yunkai’i,had,brought,them,from,old,volantis,to,fight,for,the,yellow,city,but,now,the,dornishmen,meant,to,turn,their,cloaks,and,go,over,to,the,other,side
that,meant,abandoning,their,new,brothers-in-arms,as,well
the,windblown,were,not,the,sort,of,companions,quentyn,would,have,chosen,but,he,had,crossed,the,sea,with,them,shared,their,meat,and,mead,fought,beside,them,traded,tales,with,those,few,whose,talk,he,understood
and,if,all,his,tales,were,lies,well,that,was,the,cost,of,passage,to,meereen
it,is,not,what,you’d,call,honorable,gerris,had,warned,them,back,at,the,merchant’s,house
daenerys,may,be,halfway,to,yunkai,by,now,with,an,army,at,her,back,quentyn,said,as,they,walked,amongst,the,horses
she,may,be,gerris,said,but,she’s,not
we’ve,heard,such,talk,before
the,astapori,were,convinced,daenerys,was,coming,south,with,her,dragons,to,break,the,siege
she,didn’t,come,then,and,she’s,not,coming,now
we,can’t,know,that,not,for,certain
we,need,to,steal,away,before,we,end,up,fighting,the,woman,i,was,sent,to,woo
wait,till,yunkai
gerris,gestured,at,the,hills
these,lands,belong,to,the,yunkai’i
no,one,is,like,to,want,to,feed,or,shelter,three,deserters
north,of,yunkai,that’s,no-man’sland
he,was,not,wrong
even,so,quentyn,felt,uneasy
the,big,man’s,made,too,many,friends
he,knows,the,plan,was,always,to,steal,off,and,make,our,way,to,daenerys,but,he’s,not,going,to,feel,good,about,abandoning,men,he’s,fought,with
if,we,wait,too,long,it’s,going,to,feel,as,if,we’re,deserting,them,on,the,eve,of,battle
he,will,never,do,that
you,know,him,as,well,as,i,do
it’s,desertion,whenever,we,do,it,argued,gerris,and,the,tattered,prince,takes,a,dim,view,of,deserters
he’ll,send,hunters,after,us,and,seven,save,us,if,they,catch,us
if,we’re,lucky,they’ll,just,chop,off,a,foot,to,make,sure,we,never,run,again
if,we’re,unlucky,they’ll,give,us,to,pretty,meris
that,last,gave,quentyn,pause
pretty,meris,frightened,him
a,westerosi,woman,but,taller,than,he,was,just,a,thumb,under,six,feet
after,twenty,years,amongst,the,free,companies,there,was,nothing,pretty,about,her,inside,or,out
gerris,took,him,by,the,arm
wait
a,few,more,days,that’s,all
we,have,crossed,half,the,world,be,patient,for,a,few,more,leagues
somewhere,north,of,yunkai,our,chance,will,come
if,you,say,said,frog,doubtfully,but,for,once,the,gods,were,listening,and,their,chance,came,much,sooner,than,that
it,was,two,days,later
hugh,hungerford,reined,up,by,their,cookfire,and,said,dornish
you’re,wanted,in,the,command,tent
which,one,of,us
asked,gerris
we’re,all,dornish
all,of,you,then
sour,and,saturnine,with,a,maimed,hand,hungerford,had,been,company,paymaster,for,a,time,until,the,tattered,prince,had,caught,him,stealing,from,the,coffers,and,removed,three,of,his,fingers
now,he,was,just,a,serjeant
what,could,this,be
up,to,now,frog,had,no,notion,that,their,commander,knew,he,was,alive
hungerford,had,already,ridden,off,however,so,there,was,no,time,for,questions
all,they,could,do,was,gather,up,the,big,man,and,report,as,ordered
admit,to,nothing,and,be,prepared,to,fight,quentyn,told,his,friends
i,am,always,prepared,to,fight,said,the,big,man
the,great,grey,sailcloth,pavilion,that,the,tattered,prince,liked,to,call,his,canvas,castle,was,crowded,when,the,dornishmen,arrived
it,took,quentyn,only,a,moment,to,realize,that,most,of,those,assembled,were,from,the,seven,kingdoms,or,boasted,westerosi,blood
exiles,or,the,sons,of,exiles
dick,straw,claimed,there,were,three,score,westerosi,in,the,company,a,good,third,of,those,were,here,including,dick,himself,hugh,hungerford,pretty,meris,and,golden-haired,lewis,lanster,the,company’s,best,archer
denzo,d’han,was,there,as,well,with,caggo,huge,beside,him
caggo,corpsekiller,the,men,were,calling,him,now,though,not,to,his,face,he,was,quick,to,anger,and,that,curved,black,sword,of,his,was,as,nasty,as,its,owner
there,were,hundreds,of,valyrian,longswords,in,the,world,but,only,a,handful,of,valyrian,arakhs
neither,caggo,nor,d’han,was,westerosi,but,both,were,captains,and,stood,high,in,the,tattered,prince’s,regard
his,right,arm,and,his,left
something,major,is,afoot
it,was,the,tattered,prince,himself,who,did,the,speaking
orders,have,come,down,from,yurkhaz,he,said
what,astapori,still,survive,have,come,creeping,from,their,hideyholes,it,seems
there’s,nothing,left,in,astapor,but,corpses,so,they’re,pouring,out,into,the,countryside,hundreds,of,them,maybe,thousands,all,starved,and,sick
the,yunkai’i,don’t,want,them,near,their,yellow,city
we’ve,been,commanded,to,hunt,them,down,and,turn,them,drive,them,back,to,astapor,or,north,to,meereen
if,the,dragon,queen,wants,to,take,them,in,she’s,welcome,to,them
half,of,them,have,the,bloody,flux,and,even,the,healthy,ones,are,mouths,to,feed
yunkai,is,closer,than,meereen,hugh,hungerford,objected
what,if,they,won’t,turn,my,lord
that’s,why,you,have,swords,and,lances,hugh
though,bows,might,serve,you,better
stay,well,away,from,those,who,show,signs,of,the,flux
i’m,sending,half,our,strength,into,the,hills
fifty,patrols,twenty,riders,each
bloodbeard’s,got,the,same,orders,so,the,cats,will,be,in,the,field,as,well
a,look,passed,between,the,men,and,a,few,muttered,under,their,breath
though,the,windblown,and,the,company,of,the,cat,were,both,under,contract,to,yunkai,a,year,ago,in,the,disputed,lands,they,had,been,on,opposite,sides,of,the,battle,lines,and,bad,blood,still,lingered
bloodbeard,the,savage,commander,of,the,cats,was,a,roaring,giant,with,a,ferocious,appetite,for,slaughter,who,made,no,secret,of,his,disdain,for,old,greybeards,in,rags
dick,straw,cleared,his,throat
begging,your,pardon,but,we’re,all,seven,kingdoms,born,here
m’lord,never,broke,up,the,company,by,blood,or,tongue,before
why,send,us,lot,together
a,fair,question
you’re,to,ride,east,deep,into,the,hills,then,swing,wide,about,yunkai,making,for,meereen
should,you,come,on,any,astapori,drive,them,north,or,kill,them,but,know,that,is,not,the,purpose,of,your,mission
beyond,the,yellow,city,you’re,like,to,come,up,against,the,dragon,queen’s,patrols
second,sons,or,stormcrows
either,will,serve
go,over,to,them
go,over,to,them
said,the,bastard,knight,ser,orson,stone
you’d,have,us,turn,our,cloaks
i,would,said,the,tattered,prince
quentyn,martell,almost,laughed,aloud
the,gods,are,mad
the,westerosi,shifted,uneasily
some,stared,into,their,wine,cups,as,if,they,hoped,to,find,some,wisdom,there
hugh,hungerford,frowned
you,think,queen,daenerys,will,take,us,in,i,do
but,if,she,does,what,then
are,we,spies
assassins
envoys
are,you,thinking,to,change,sides
caggo,scowled
that,is,for,the,prince,to,decide,hungerford
your,part,is,to,do,as,you,are,told
always
hungerford,raised,his,two-fingered,hand
let,us,be,frank,said,denzo,d’han,the,warrior,bard
the,yunkai’i,do,not,inspire,confidence
whatever,the,outcome,of,this,war,the,windblown,should,share,in,the,spoils,of,victory
our,prince,is,wise,to,keep,all,roads,open
meris,will,command,you,said,the,tattered,prince
she,knows,my,mind,in,this,and,daenerys,targaryen,may,be,more,accepting,of,another,woman
quentyn,glanced,back,to,pretty,meris
when,her,cold,dead,eyes,met,his,he,felt,a,shiver
i,do,not,like,this
dick,straw,still,had,doubts,as,well
the,girl,would,be,a,fool,to,trust,us
even,with,meris
especially,with,meris
hell,i,don’t,trust,meris,and,i’ve,fucked,her,a,few,times
he,grinned,but,no,one,laughed
least,of,all,pretty,meris
i,think,you,are,mistaken,dick,the,tattered,prince,said
you,are,all,westerosi
friends,from,home
you,speak,her,same,tongue,worship,her,same,gods
as,for,motive,all,of,you,have,suffered,wrongs,at,my,hands
dick,i’ve,whipped,you,more,than,any,man,in,the,company,and,you,have,the,back,to,prove,it
hugh,lost,three,fingers,to,my,discipline
meris,was,raped,half,round,the,company
not,this,company,true,but,we,need,not,mention,that
will,of,the,woods,well,you’re,just,filth
ser,orson,blames,me,for,dispatching,his,brother,to,the,sorrows,and,ser,lucifer,is,still,seething,about,that,slave,girl,caggo,took,from,him
he,could,have,given,her,back,when,he’d,had,her,lucifer,long,complained
he,had,no,cause,to,kill,her
she,was,ugly,said,caggo
that’s,cause,enough
the,tattered,prince,went,on,as,if,no,one,had,spoken
webber,you,nurse,claims,to,lands,lost,in,westeros
lanster,i,killed,that,boy,you,were,so,fond,of
you,dornish,three,you,think,we,lied,to,you
the,plunder,from,astapor,was,much,less,than,you,were,promised,in,volantis,and,i,took,the,lion’s,share,of,it
the,last,part’s,true,ser,orson,said
the,best,ruses,always,have,some,seed,of,truth,said,the,tattered,prince
every,one,of,you,has,ample,reason,for,wanting,to,abandon,me
and,daenerys,targaryen,knows,that,sellswords,are,a,fickle,lot
her,own,second,sons,and,stormcrows,took,yunkish,gold,but,did,not,hesitate,to,join,her,when,the,tide,of,battle,began,to,flow,her,way
when,should,we,leave
asked,lewis,lanster
at,once
be,wary,of,the,cats,and,any,long,lances,you,may,encounter
no,one,will,know,your,defection,is,a,ruse,but,those,of,us,in,this,tent
turn,your,tiles,too,soon,and,you,will,be,maimed,as,deserters,or,disemboweled,as,turncloaks
the,three,dornishmen,were,silent,as,they,left,the,command,tent
twenty,riders,all,speaking,the,common,tongue,thought,quentyn

the,wayward,bride,asha,greyjoy,was,seated,in,galbart,glover’s,longhall,drinking,galbart,glover’s,wine,when,galbart,glover’s,maester,brought,the,letter,to,her
my,lady
the,maester’s,voice,was,anxious,as,it,always,was,when,he,spoke,to,her
a,bird,from,barrowton
he,thrust,the,parchment,at,her,as,if,he,could,not,wait,to,be,rid,of,it
it,was,tightly,rolled,and,sealed,with,a,button,of,hard,pink,wax

and,that,seal,the,boltons,of,the,dreadfort,went,into,battle,beneath,pink,banners,spattered,with,little,drops,of,blood
it,only,stood,to,reason,that,they,would,use,pink,sealing,wax,as,well
this,is,poison,that,i,hold,she,thought

instead,she,cracked,the,seal
a,scrap,of,leather,fluttered,down,into,her,lap

the,hair,between,his,legs,was,a,darker,shade,of,sand,than,the,hair,on,his,head,but,fine,as,down,compared,to,the,coarse,black,bush,around,her,own,sex
she,liked,that,too
he,had,a,swimmer’s,body,long,and,lean,with,not,a,scar,upon,him
a,shy,smile,strong,arms,clever,fingers,and,two,sure,swords
what,more,could,any,woman,want
she,would,have,married,qarl,and,gladly,but,she,was,lord,balon’s,daughter,and,he,was,common-born,the,grandson,of,a,thrall

by,the,time,she,had,him,hard,again,he,was,awake,and,she,was,wet
asha,draped,the,furs,across,her,bare,shoulders,and,mounted,him,drawing,him,so,deep,inside,her,that,she,could,not,tell,who,had,the,cock,and,who,the,cunt
this,time,the,two,of,them,reached,their,peak,together

asha,wanted,to,shout,back,at,him,but,her,throat,was,so,dry,she,could,do,no,more,than,grunt
his,axe,was,shivering,her,shield,cracking,the,wood,on,the,downswing,tearing,off,long,pale,splinters,when,he,wrenched,it,back
soon,she,would,have,only,a,tangle,of,kindling,on,her,arm
she,backed,away,and,shook,free,of,the,ruined,shield,then,backed,away,some,more,and,danced,left,and,right,and,left,again,to,avoid,the,downrushing,axe
and,then,her,back,came,up,hard,against,a,tree,and,she,could,dance,no,more
the,wolf,raised,the,axe,above,his,head,to,split,her,head,in,two
asha,tried,to,slip,to,her,right,but,her,feet,were,tangled,in,some,roots,trapping,her

swarms,of,flies,followed,the,carts,so,the,dung,slaves,had,flies,tattooed,upon,their,cheeks,to,mark,them,for,what,they,were
there’s,a,trade,for,my,sweet,sister,tyrion,mused

what,is,he,saying
tyrion,asked,the,knight
that,daenerys,stands,in,peril
the,dark,eye,has,fallen,upon,her,and,the,minions,of,night,are,plotting,her,destruction,praying,to,their,false,gods,in,temples,of,deceit,conspiring,at,betrayal,with,godless,outlanders,the,hairs,on,the,back,of,tyrion’s,neck,began,to,prickle
prince,aegon,will,find,no,friend,here
the,red,priest,spoke,of,ancient,prophecy,a,prophecy,that,foretold,the,coming,of,a,hero,to,deliver,the,world,from,darkness

not,two
daenerys,has,dragons,aegon,does,not
the,dwarf,did,not,need,to,be,a,prophet,himself,to,foresee,how,benerro,and,his,followers,might,react,to,a,second,targaryen
griff,will,see,that,too,surely,he,thought,surprised,to,find,how,much,he,cared
the,knight,had,forced,their,way,through,most,of,the,press,at,the,back,of,the,plaza,ignoring,the,curses,that,were,flung,at,them,as,they,passed
one,man,stepped,in,front,of,them,but,his,captor,gripped,the,hilt,of,his,longsword,and,drew,it,just,far,enough,to,show,a,foot,of,naked,steel
the,man,melted,away,and,all,at,once,an,alley,opened,up,before,them
the,knight,urged,his,mount,to,a,trot,and,they,left,the,crowd,behind,them
for,a,while,tyrion,could,still,hear,benerro’s,voice,growing,fainter,at,their,back,and,the,roars,his,words,provoked,sudden,as,thunder
they,came,upon,a,stable
the,knight,dismounted,then,hammered,on,the,door,until,a,haggard,slave,with,a,horsehead,on,his,cheek,came,running
the,dwarf,was,pulled,down,roughly,from,the,saddle,and,lashed,to,a,post,whilst,his,captor,woke,the,stable’s,owner,and,haggled,with,him,over,the,price,of,his,horse,and,saddle
cheaper,to,sell,a,horse,than,to,ship,one,half,across,the,world
tyrion,sensed,a,ship,in,his,immediate,future
perhaps,he,was,a,prophet,after,all
when,the,dickering,was,done,the,knight,slung,his,weapons,shield,and,saddlebag,over,his,shoulder,and,asked,for,directions,to,the,nearest,smithy
that,proved,shuttered,too,but,opened,quick,enough,at,the,knight’s,shout
the,smith,gave,tyrion,a,squint,then,nodded,and,accepted,a,fistful,of,coins
come,here,the,knight,told,his,prisoner
he,drew,his,dagger,and,slit,tyrion’s,bonds,apart
my,thanks,said,the,dwarf,as,he,rubbed,his,wrists,but,the,knight,only,laughed,and,said,save,your,gratitude,for,someone,who,deserves,it,imp
you,will,not,like,this,next,bit
he,was,not,wrong
the,manacles,were,black,iron,thick,and,heavy,each,weighing,a,good,two,pounds,if,the,dwarf,was,any,judge
the,chains,added,even,more,weight
i,must,be,more,fearsome,than,i,knew,tyrion,confessed,as,the,last,links,were,hammered,closed

or,were,you,afraid,that,i,would,dash,away,on,these,stunted,little,legs,of,mine
the,ironsmith,did,not,so,much,as,look,up,from,his,work,but,the,knight,chuckled,darkly
it’s,your,mouth,that,concerns,me,not,your,legs
in,fetters,you’re,a,slave
no,one,will,listen,to,a,word,you,say,not,even,those,who,speak,the,tongue,of,westeros
there’s,no,need,for,this,tyrion,protested
i,will,be,a,good,little,prisoner,i,will,i,will
prove,it,then,and,shut,your,mouth
so,he,bowed,his,head,and,bit,his,tongue,as,the,chains,were,fixed,wrist,to,wrist,wrist,to,ankle,ankle,to,ankle
these,bloody,things,weigh,more,than,i,do
still,at,least,he,drew,breath
his,captor,could,just,as,easily,have,cut,his,head,off
that,was,all,cersei,required,after,all
not,striking,it,off,straightaway,had,been,his,captor’s,first,mistake
there,is,half,a,world,between,volantis,and,king’s,landing,and,much,and,more,can,happen,along,the,way,ser
the,rest,of,the,way,they,went,by,foot,tyrion,clanking,and,clattering,as,he,struggled,to,keep,up,with,his,captor’s,long,impatient,strides
whenever,he,threatened,to,fall,behind,the,knight,would,seize,his,fetters,and,yank,them,roughly,sending,the,dwarf,stumbling,and,hopping,along,beside,him
it,could,be,worse
he,could,be,urging,me,along,with,a,whip
volantis,straddled,one,mouth,of,the,rhoyne,where,the,river,kissed,the,sea,its,two,halves,joined,by,the,long,bridge
the,oldest,richest,part,of,the,city,was,east,of,the,river,but,sellswords,barbarians,and,other,uncouth,outlanders,were,not,welcome,there,so,they,must,needs,cross,over,to,the,west
the,gateway,to,the,long,bridge,was,a,black,stone,arch,carved,with,sphinxes,manticores,dragons,and,creatures,stranger,still
beyond,the,arch,stretched,the,great,span,that,the,valyrians,had,built,at,the,height,of,their,glory,its,fused,stone,roadway,supported,by,massive,piers
the,road,was,just,wide,enough,for,two,carts,to,pass,abreast,so,whenever,a,wagon,headed,west,passed,one,going,east,both,had,to,slow,to,a,crawl
it,was,well,they,were,afoot
a,third,of,the,way,out,a,wagon,laden,with,melons,had,gotten,its,wheels,tangled,with,one,piled,high,with,silken,carpets,and,brought,all,wheeled,traffic,to,a,halt
much,of,the,foot,traffic,had,stopped,as,well,to,watch,the,drivers,curse,and,scream,at,one,another,but,the,knight,grabbed,hold,of,tyrion’s,chain,and,bulled,a,path,through,the,throng,for,both,of,them
in,the,middle,of,the,press,a,boy,tried,to,reach,into,his,purse,but,a,hard,elbow,put,an,end,to,that,and,spread,the,thief’s,bloody,nose,across,half,his,face
buildings,rose,to,either,side,of,them,shops,and,temples,taverns,and,inns,cyvasse,parlors,and,brothels
most,were,three,or,four,stories,tall,each,floor,overhanging,the,one,beneath,it
their,top,floors,almost,kissed
crossing,the,bridge,felt,like,passing,through,a,torchlit,tunnel
along,the,span,were,shops,and,stalls,of,every,sort,weavers,and,lacemakers,displayed,their,wares,cheek,by,jowl,with,glassblowers,candlemakers,and,fishwives,selling,eels,and,oysters
each,goldsmith,had,a,guard,at,his,door,and,every,spicer,had,two,for,their,goods,were,twice,as,valuable
here,and,there,between,the,shops,a,traveler,might,catch,a,glimpse,of,the,river,he,was,crossing
to,the,north,the,rhoyne,was,a,broad,black,ribbon,bright,with,stars,five,times,as,wide,as,the,blackwater,rush,at,king’s,landing
south,of,the,bridge,the,river,opened,up,to,embrace,the,briny,sea
at,the,bridge’s,center,span,the,severed,hands,of,thieves,and,cutpurses,hung,like,strings,of,onions,from,iron,stanchions,along,the,roadway
three,heads,were,on,display,as,well,two,men,and,a,woman,their,crimes,scrawled,on,tablets,underneath,them
a,pair,of,spearmen,attended,them,clad,in,polished,helms,and,shirts,of,silver,mail
across,their,cheeks,were,tiger,stripes,as,green,as,jade
from,time,to,time,the,guards,waved,their,spears,to,chase,away,the,kestrels,gulls,and,carrion,crows,paying,court,to,the,deceased
the,birds,returned,to,the,heads,within,moments
what,did,they,do
tyrion,inquired,innocently
the,knight,glanced,at,the,inscriptions
the,woman,was,a,slave,who,raised,her,hand,to,her,mistress
the,older,man,was,accused,of,fomenting,rebellion,and,spying,for,the,dragon,queen
and,the,young,one
killed,his,father
tyrion,gave,the,rotting,head,a,second,look
why,it,almost,looks,as,if,those,lips,are,smiling
farther,on,the,knight,paused,briefly,to,consider,a,jeweled,tiara,displayed,upon,a,bed,of,purple,velvet
he,passed,that,by,but,a,few,steps,on,he,stopped,again,to,haggle,over,a,pair,of,gloves,at,a,leatherworker’s,stall
tyrion,was,grateful,for,the,respites
the,headlong,pace,had,left,him,puffing,and,his,wrists,were,chafed,raw,from,the,manacles
from,the,far,end,of,the,long,bridge,it,was,only,a,short,walk,through,the,teeming,waterfront,districts,of,the,west,bank,down,torchlit,streets,crowded,with,sailors,slaves,and,drunken,merrymakers
once,an,elephant,lumbered,past,with,a,dozen,half-naked,slave,girls,waving,from,the,castle,on,its,back,teasing,passersby,with,glimpses,of,their,breasts,and,crying,malaquo,malaquo
they,made,such,an,entrancing,sight,that,tyrion,almost,waddled,right,into,the,steaming,pile,of,dung,the,elephant,had,left,to,mark,its,passage
he,was,saved,at,the,last,instant,when,the,knight,snatched,him,aside,yanking,on,his,chain,so,hard,it,made,him,reel,and,stumble
how,much,farther
the,dwarf,asked
just,there
fishmonger’s,square
their,destination,proved,to,be,the,merchant’s,house,a,four-story,monstrosity,that,squatted,amongst,the,warehouses,brothels,and,taverns,of,the,waterside,like,some,enormous,fat,man,surrounded,by,children
its,common,room,was,larger,than,the,great,halls,of,half,the,castles,in,westeros,a,dim-lit,maze,of,a,place,with,a,hundred,private,alcoves,and,hidden,nooks,whose,blackened,beams,and,cracked,ceilings,echoed,to,the,din,of,sailors,traders,captains,money,changers,shippers,and,slavers,lying,cursing,and,cheating,each,other,in,half,a,hundred,different,tongues
tyrion,approved,the,choice,of,hostelry
soon,or,late,the,shy,maid,must,reach,volantis
this,was,the,city’s,biggest,inn,first,choice,for,shippers,captains,and,merchantmen
a,lot,of,business,was,done,in,that,cavernous,warren,of,a,common,room
he,knew,enough,of,volantis,to,know,that
let,griff,turn,up,here,with,duck,and,haldon,and,he,would,be,free,again,soon,enough
meanwhile,he,would,be,patient
his,chance,would,come
the,rooms,upstairs,proved,rather,less,than,grand,however,particularly,the,cheap,ones,up,on,the,fourth,floor
wedged,into,a,corner,of,the,building,beneath,a,sloping,roof,the,bedchamber,his,captor,had,engaged,featured,a,low,ceiling,a,sagging,feather,bed,with,an,unpleasant,odor,and,a,slanting,wood-plank,floor,that,reminded,tyrion,of,his,sojourn,at,the,eyrie
at,least,this,room,has,walls
it,had,windows,too,those,were,its,chief,amenity,along,with,the,iron,ring,set,in,the,wall,so,useful,for,chaining,up,one’s,slaves
his,captor,paused,only,long,enough,to,light,a,tallow,candle,before,securing,tyrion’s,chains,to,the,ring
must,you
the,dwarf,protested,rattling,feebly
where,am,i,going,to,go,out,the,window
you,might
we,are,four,floors,up,and,i,cannot,fly
you,can,fall
i,want,you,alive
aye,but,why
cersei,is,not,like,to,care
tyrion,rattled,his,chains
i,know,who,you,are,ser
it,had,not,been,hard,to,puzzle,out
the,bear,on,his,surcoat,the,arms,on,his,shield,the,lost,lordship,he,had,mentioned
i,know,what,you,are
and,if,you,know,who,i,am,you,also,know,that,i,was,the,king’s,hand,and,sat,in,council,with,the,spider
would,it,interest,you,to,know,that,it,was,the,eunuch,who,dispatched,me,on,this,journey
him,and,jaime,but,i’ll,leave,my,brother,out,of,it
i,am,as,much,his,creature,as,you,are
we,ought,not,be,at,odds
that,did,not,please,the,knight
i,took,the,spider’s,coin,i’ll,not,deny,it,but,i,was,never,his,creature
and,my,loyalties,lie,elsewhere,now
with,cersei
more,fool,you
all,my,sister,requires,is,my,head,and,you,have,a,fine,sharp,sword
why,not,end,this,farce,now,and,spare,us,both
the,knight,laughed
is,this,some,dwarf’s,trick
beg,for,death,in,hopes,i’ll,let,you,live
he,went,to,the,door
i’ll,bring,you,something,from,the,kitchens
how,kind,of,you
i’ll,wait,here
i,know,you,will
yet,when,the,knight,left,he,locked,the,door,behind,him,with,a,heavy,iron,key
the,merchant’s,house,was,famous,for,its,locks
as,secure,as,a,gaol,the,dwarf,thought,bitterly,but,at,least,there,are,those,windows
tyrion,knew,that,the,chances,of,his,escaping,his,chains,were,little,and,less,but,even,so,he,felt,obliged,to,try
his,efforts,to,slip,a,hand,through,the,manacle,served,only,to,scrap,off,more,skin,and,leave,his,wrist,slick,with,blood,and,all,his,tugging,or,twisting,could,not,pull,the,iron,ring,from,the,wall
bugger,this,he,thought,slumping,back,as,far,as,his,chains,would,allow
his,legs,had,begun,to,cramp
this,was,going,to,be,a,hellishly,uncomfortable,night
the,first,of,many,i,do,not,doubt
the,room,was,stifling,so,the,knight,had,opened,the,shutters,to,let,in,a,cross,breeze
cramped,into,a,corner,of,the,building,under,the,eaves,the,chamber,was,fortunate,in,having,two,windows
one,looked,toward,the,long,bridge,and,the,black-walled,heart,of,old,volantis,across,the,river
the,other,opened,on,the,square,below
fishermonger’s,square,mormont,called,it
as,tight,as,the,chains,were,tyrion,found,he,could,see,out,the,latter,by,leaning,sideways,and,letting,the,iron,ring,support,his,weight
not,as,long,a,fall,as,the,one,from,lysa,arryn’s,sky,cells,but,it,would,leave,me,just,as,dead
perhaps,if,i,were,drunk,even,at,this,hour,the,square,was,crowded,with,sailors,roistering,whores,prowling,for,custom,and,merchants,going,about,their,business
a,red,priestess,scurried,past,attended,by,a,dozen,acolytes,with,torches,their,robes,whisking,about,their,ankles
elsewhere,a,pair,of,cyvasse,players,waged,war,outside,a,tavern
a,slave,stood,beside,their,table,holding,a,lantern,over,the,board
tyrion,could,hear,a,woman,singing
the,words,were,strange,the,tune,was,soft,and,sad
if,i,knew,what,she,was,singing,i,might,cry
closer,to,hand,a,crowd,was,gathering,around,a,pair,of,jugglers,throwing,flaming,torches,at,each,other
his,captor,returned,shortly,carrying,two,tankards,and,a,roasted,duck
he,kicked,the,door,shut,ripped,the,duck,in,two,and,tossed,half,of,it,to,tyrion
he,would,have,snatched,it,from,the,air,but,his,chains,brought,him,up,short,when,he,tried,to,lift,his,arms
instead,the,bird,struck,his,temple,and,slid,hot,and,greasy,down,his,face,and,he,had,to,hunker,down,and,stretch,for,it,with,fetters,clanking
he,got,it,on,the,third,try,and,tore,into,it,happily,with,his,teeth
some,ale,to,wash,this,down
mormont,handed,him,a,tankard
most,of,volantis,is,getting,drunk,why,not,you
the,ale,was,sweet,as,well
it,tasted,of,fruit
tyrion,drank,a,healthy,swallow,and,belched,happily
the,tankard,was,pewter,very,heavy
empty,it,and,fling,it,at,his,head,he,thought
if,i,am,lucky,it,might,crack,his,skull
if,i’m,very,lucky,it,will,miss,and,he’ll,beat,me,to,death,with,his,fists
he,took,another,gulp
is,this,some,holy,day
third,day,of,their,elections
they,last,for,ten
ten,days,of,madness
torchlight,marches,speeches,mummers,and,minstrels,and,dancers,bravos,fighting,death,duels,for,the,honor,of,their,candidates,elephants,with,the,names,of,would-be,triarchs,painted,on,their,sides

food,drink,spectacle,alios,has,sent,a,hundred,pretty,slave,girls,out,into,the,streets,to,lie,with,voters
i’m,for,him,tyrion,decided
bring,me,a,slave,girl
they’re,for,freeborn,volantenes,with,enough,property,to,vote
precious,few,voters,west,of,the,river
and,this,goes,on,for,ten,days
tyrion,laughed
i,might,enjoy,that,though,three,kings,is,two,too,many
i,am,trying,to,imagine,ruling,the,seven,kingdoms,with,my,sweet,sister,and,brave,brother,beside,me
one,of,us,would,kill,the,other,two,inside,a,year
i,am,surprised,these,triarchs,don’t,do,the,same
a,few,have,tried
might,be,the,volantenes,are,the,clever,ones,and,us,westerosi,the,fools
volantis,has,known,her,share,of,follies,but,she’s,never,suffered,a,boy,triarch
whenever,a,madman’s,been,elected,his,colleagues,restrain,him,until,his,year,has,run,its,course
think,of,the,dead,who,might,still,live,if,mad,aerys,only,had,two,fellow,kings,to,share,the,rule
instead,he,had,my,father,tyrion,thought
some,in,the,free,cities,think,that,we’re,all,savages,on,our,side,of,the,narrow,sea,the,knight,went,on
the,ones,who,don’t,think,that,we’re,children,crying,out,for,a,father’s,strong,hand
or,a,mother’s
cersei,will,love,that
especially,when,he,presents,her,with,my,head
you,seem,to,know,this,city,well
i,spent,the,best,part,of,a,year,here
the,knight,sloshed,the,dregs,at,the,bottom,of,his,tankard
when,stark,drove,me,into,exile,i,fled,to,lys,with,my,second,wife
braavos,would,have,suited,me,better,but,lynesse,wanted,someplace,warm
instead,of,serving,the,braavosi,i,fought,them,on,the,rhoyne,but,for,every,silver,i,earned,my,wife,spent,ten
by,the,time,i,got,back,to,lys,she,had,taken,a,lover,who,told,me,cheerfully,that,i,would,be,enslaved,for,debt,unless,i,gave,her,up,and,left,the,city
that,was,how,i,came,to,volantis,one,step,ahead,of,slavery,owning,nothing,but,my,sword,and,the,clothes,upon,my,back
and,now,you,want,to,run,home
the,knight,drained,the,last,of,his,ale
on,the,morrow,i’ll,find,us,a,ship
the,bed,is,mine
you,can,have,whatever,piece,of,floor,your,chains,will,let,you,reach
sleep,if,you,can
if,not,count,your,crimes
that,should,see,you,through,till,the,morning
you,have,your,crimes,to,answer,for,jorah,mormont,the,dwarf,thought,but,it,seemed,wiser,to,keep,that,thought,to,himself
ser,jorah,hung,his,sword,belt,on,a,bedpost,kicked,off,his,boots,pulled,his,chain,mail,over,his,head,and,stripped,out,of,his,wool,and,leather,and,sweat-stained,undertunic,to,reveal,a,scarred,brawny,torso,covered,with,dark,hair
if,i,could,skin,him,i,could,sell,that,pelt,for,a,fur,cloak,tyrion,thought,as,mormont,tumbled,into,the,slightly,smelly,comfort,of,his,sagging,feather,bed
in,no,time,at,all,the,knight,was,snoring,leaving,his,prize,alone,with,his,chains
with,both,windows,open,wide,the,light,of,the,waning,moon,spilled,across,the,bedchamber
sounds,drifted,up,from,the,square,below,snatches,of,drunken,song,the,yowling,of,a,cat,in,heat,the,far-off,ring,of,steel,on,steel
someone’s,about,to,die,thought,tyrion
his,wrist,was,throbbing,where,he’d,torn,the,skin,and,his,fetters,made,it,impossible,for,him,to,sit,let,alone,stretch,out
the,best,he,could,do,was,twist,sideways,to,lean,against,the,wall,and,before,long,he,began,to,lose,all,feeling,in,his,hands
when,he,moved,to,relieve,the,strain,sensation,came,flooding,back,as,pain
he,had,to,grind,his,teeth,to,keep,from,screaming
he,wondered,how,much,his,father,had,hurt,when,the,quarrel,punched,through,his,groin,what,shae,had,felt,as,he,twisted,the,chain,around,her,lying,throat,what,tysha,had,been,feeling,as,they,raped,her
his,sufferings,were,nothing,compared,to,their,own,but,that,did,not,make,him,hurt,any,less
just,make,it,stop
ser,jorah,had,rolled,onto,one,side,so,all,that,tyrion,could,see,of,him,was,a,broad,hairy,muscular,back
even,if,i,could,slip,these,chains,i’d,need,to,climb,over,him,to,reach,his,sword,belt
perhaps,if,i,could,ease,the,dagger,loose,or,else,he,could,try,for,the,key,unlock,the,door,creep,down,the,stairs,and,through,the,common,room,and,go,where
i,have,no,friends,no,coin,i,do,not,even,speak,the,local,tongue
exhaustion,finally,overwhelmed,his,pains,and,tyrion,drifted,off,into,a,fitful,sleep
but,every,time,another,cramp,took,root,inside,his,calf,and,twisted,the,dwarf,would,cry,out,in,his,sleep,trembling,in,his,chains
he,woke,with,every,muscle,aching,to,find,morning,streaming,through,the,windows,bright,and,golden,as,the,lion,of,lannister
below,he,could,hear,the,cries,of,fishmongers,and,the,rumble,of,iron-rimmed,wheels,on,cobblestones
jorah,mormont,was,standing,over,him
if,i,take,you,off,the,ring,will,you,do,as,you’re,told
will,it,involve,dancing
i,might,find,dancing,difficult
i,cannot,feel,my,legs
they,may,have,fallen,off
elsewise,i,am,your,creature
on,my,honor,as,a,lannister
the,lannisters,have,no,honor
ser,jorah,loosed,his,chains,anyway
tyrion,took,two,wobbly,steps,and,fell
the,blood,rushing,back,into,his,hands,brought,tears,to,his,eyes
he,bit,his,lip,and,said,wherever,we’re,going,you,will,need,to,roll,me,there
instead,the,big,knight,carried,him,hoisting,him,by,the,chain,between,his,wrists
the,common,room,of,the,merchant’s,house,was,a,dim,labyrinth,of,alcoves,and,grottoes,built,around,a,central,courtyard,where,a,trellis,of,flowering,vines,threw,intricate,patterns,across,the,flagstone,floor,and,green,and,purple,moss,grew,between,the,stones
slave,girls,scurried,through,light,and,shadow,bearing,flagons,of,ale,and,wine,and,some,iced,green,drink,that,smelled,of,mint
one,table,in,twenty,was,occupied,at,this,hour,of,the,morning
one,of,those,was,occupied,by,a,dwarf
clean-shaved,and,pink-cheeked,with,a,mop,of,chestnut,hair,a,heavy,brow,and,a,squashed,nose,he,perched,on,a,high,stool,with,a,wooden,spoon,in,hand,contemplating,a,bowl,of,purplish,gruel,with,red-rimmed,eyes
ugly,little,bastard,tyrion,thought
the,other,dwarf,felt,his,stare
when,he,raised,his,head,and,saw,tyrion,the,spoon,slipped,from,his,hand
he,saw,me,tyrion,warned,mormont
what,of,it
he,knows,me
who,i,am
should,i,stuff,you,in,a,sack,so,no,one,will,see,you
the,knight,touched,the,hilt,of,his,longsword
if,he,means,to,try,and,take,you,he,is,welcome,to,try
welcome,to,die,you,mean,thought,tyrion
what,threat,could,he,pose,to,a,big,man,like,you
he,is,only,a,dwarf
ser,jorah,claimed,a,table,in,a,quiet,corner,and,ordered,food,and,drink
they,broke,their,fast,with,warm,soft,flatbread,pink,fish,roe,honey,sausage,and,fried,locusts,washed,down,with,a,bittersweet,black,ale
tyrion,ate,like,a,man,half-starved
you,have,a,healthy,appetite,this,morning,the,knight,observed
i’ve,heard,the,food,in,hell,is,wretched
tyrion,glanced,at,the,door,where,a,man,had,just,come,in,tall,and,stooped,his,pointed,beard,dyed,a,splotchy,purple
some,tyroshi,trader
a,gust,of,sound,came,with,him,from,outside,the,cries,of,gulls,a,woman’s,laughter,the,voices,of,the,fishmongers
for,half,a,heartbeat,he,thought,he,glimpsed,illyrio,mopatis,but,it,was,only,one,of,those,white,dwarf,elephants,passing,the,front,door
mormont,spread,some,fish,roe,across,a,slice,of,flatbread,and,took,a,bite

an,elephant,seven,times,a,triarch,very,rich,a,power,on,the,docks
whilst,other,men,built,the,ships,and,sailed,them,he,built,piers,and,storehouses,brokered,cargoes,changed,money,insured,shipowners,against,the,hazards,of,the,sea
he,dealt,in,slaves,as,well
when,he,grew,besotted,with,one,of,them,a,bedslave,trained,at,yunkai,in,the,way,of,seven,sighs,it,was,a,great,scandal,and,a,greater,scandal,when,he,freed,her,and,took,her,for,his,wife
after,he,died,she,carried,on,his,ventures
no,freedman,may,dwell,within,the,black,wall,so,she,was,compelled,to,sell,vogarro’s,manse

the,remnants,of,her,morning,meal,littered,the,table,sardine,heads,olive,pits,chunks,of,flatbread

and,yet,you,would,go,the,other,way,ser
my,business,is,in,the,east
and,what,business,is,that,i,wonder

ah,there,it,is
the,old,woman’s,smile,turned,feral

you,would,travel,to,meereen
just,wait,a,while,ser

instead,he,saw,two,strangers,and,the,dwarf,who,was,standing,a,few,feet,away,staring,at,him,intently
he,seemed,somehow,familiar
the,widow,sipped,daintily,at,her,wine

the,old,blood,will,have,their,dogs,and,children,voting,before,any,freedman

or,so,they,think
and,what,do,you,think
ser,jorah,asked
good,thought,tyrion
the,right,question
oh,i,think,it,will,be,war,as,well,but,not,the,war,they,want

oh,these,are,dire,days,in,old,volantis,even,for,wrinkled,old,widows

the,dwarf,had,moved,closer,to,their,table

keep,your,silver
i,have,gold
and,spare,me,your,black,looks,ser
i,am,too,old,to,be,frightened,of,a,scowl
you,are,a,hard,man,i,see,and,no,doubt,skilled,with,that,long,sword,at,your,side,but,this,is,my,realm
let,me,crook,a,finger,and,you,may,find,yourself,traveling,to,meereen,chained,to,an,oar,in,the,belly,of,a,galley

it,is,such,a,sweet,morning,though,i,shall,ask,again
why,would,you,seek,daenerys,targaryen,whom,half,the,world,wants,dead
jorah,mormont’s,face,was,dark,with,anger,but,he,answered
to,serve,her
defend,her
die,for,her,if,need,be
that,made,the,widow,laugh
you,want,to,rescue,her,is,that,the,way,of,it
from,more,enemies,than,i,can,name,with,swords,beyond,count,this,is,what,you’d,have,the,poor,widow,believe
that,you,are,a,true,and,chivalrous,westerosi,knight,crossing,half,the,world,to,come,to,the,aid,of,this,well,she,is,no,maiden,though,she,may,still,be,fair

my,cock,if,she,desires,it
my,tongue,if,she,does,not
i,will,lead,her,armies,or,rub,her,feet,as,she,desires
and,the,only,reward,i,ask,is,i,might,be,allowed,to,rape,and,kill,my,sister
that,brought,the,smile,back,to,the,old,woman’s,face
this,one,at,least,is,honest,she,announced,but,you,ser,i,have,known,a,dozen,westerosi,knights,and,a,thousand,adventurers,of,the,same,ilk,but,none,so,pure,as,you,would,paint,yourself
men,are,beasts,selfish,and,brutal
however,gentle,the,words,there,are,always,darker,motives,underneath
i,do,not,trust,you,ser

she’s,a,girl,he,realized,all,at,once,a,girl,dressed,up,in,man’s,clothes
and,she,means,to,gut,me,with,that,knife
for,half,a,heartbeat,ser,jorah,the,widow,and,the,scarred,man,stood,still,as,stone
idlers,watched,from,nearby,tables,sipping,ale,and,wine,but,no,one,moved,to,interfere
tyrion,had,to,move,both,hands,at,once,but,his,chains,had,just,enough,give,for,him,to,reach,the,flagon,on,the,table
he,closed,his,fist,around,it,spun,dashed,its,contents,into,the,face,of,the,charging,dwarf,girl,then,threw,himself,to,one,side,to,avoid,her,knife
the,flagon,shattered,underneath,him,as,the,floor,came,up,to,smack,him,in,the,head
then,the,girl,was,on,him,once,again
tyrion,rolled,on,one,side,as,she,buried,the,knife,blade,in,the,floorboards,yanked,it,free,raised,it,again,and,suddenly,she,was,rising,off,the,floor,legs,kicking,wildly,as,she,struggled,in,ser,jorah’s,grasp

with,the,other,he,wrenched,the,dagger,from,her,grasp
enough
the,landlord,made,his,appearance,then,a,cudgel,in,his,hand
when,he,saw,the,broken,flagon,he,uttered,a,blistering,curse,and,demanded,to,know,what,had,happened,here

the,landlord,seized,her,roughly,by,one,arm,and,wrenched,her,back,to,her,feet,shouting,in,volantene,demanding,to,know,who,was,going,to,pay,for,this,damage
the,widow,of,the,waterfront,gave,mormont,a,cool,look

jon,would,never,count,ser,alliser,thorne,amongst,his,friends,but,he,was,still,a,brother
no,one,ever,said,you,had,to,like,your,brothers
it,was,no,easy,thing,to,send,men,into,the,wild,knowing,that,the,chances,were,good,that,they,might,never,return
they,are,all,seasoned,men,jon,told,himself,but,his,uncle,benjen,and,his,rangers,had,been,seasoned,men,as,well,and,the,haunted,forest,had,swallowed,them,up,without,a,trace
when,two,of,them,finally,came,straggling,back,to,the,wall,it,had,been,as,wights
not,for,the,first,time,or,the,last,jon,snow,found,himself,wondering,what,had,become,of,benjen,stark
perhaps,the,rangers,will,come,upon,some,sign,of,them,he,told,himself,never,truly,believing,it
dywen,would,lead,one,ranging,black,jack,bulwer,and,kedge,whiteye,the,other,two
they,at,least,were,eager,for,the,duty

begging,your,pardon,m’lord,but,we,were,all,o’,us,getting,splinters,up,our,arses,from,sitting,about

from,on,high,their,garrons,looked,no,larger,than,ants,and,jon,could,not,tell,one,ranger,from,another
he,knew,them,though
every,name,was,graven,on,his,heart
eight,good,men,he,thought,and,one,well,we,shall,see
when,the,last,of,the,riders,had,disappeared,into,the,trees,jon,snow,rode,the,winch,cage,down,with,dolorous,edd
a,few,scattered,snowflakes,were,falling,as,they,made,their,slow,descent,dancing,on,the,gusty,wind
one,followed,the,cage,down,drifting,just,beyond,the,bars
it,was,falling,faster,than,they,were,descending,and,from,time,to,time,would,vanish,beneath,them
then,a,gust,of,wind,would,catch,it,and,push,it,upward,once,again

i,had,a,frightening,dream,last,night,m’lord,dolorous,edd,confessed

the,iron,cage,moved,downward,at,the,end,of,its,long,chain,creaking,and,rattling,until,it,finally,jerked,to,a,halt,a,foot,above,the,ground,at,the,base,of,the,wall
dolorous,edd,pushed,open,the,door,and,hopped,down,his,boots,breaking,the,crust,of,the,last,snow

outside,the,armory,iron,emmett,was,still,urging,on,his,charges,in,the,yard
the,song,of,steel,on,steel,woke,a,hunger,in,jon
it,reminded,him,of,warmer,simpler,days,when,he,had,been,a,boy,at,winterfell,matching,blades,with,robb,under,the,watchful,eye,of,ser,rodrik,cassel
ser,rodrik,too,had,fallen,slain,by,theon,turncloak,and,his,ironmen,as,he’d,tried,to,retake,winterfell
the,great,stronghold,of,house,stark,was,a,scorched,desolation
all,my,memories,are,poisoned
when,iron,emmett,spied,him,he,raised,a,hand,and,combat,ceased

a,black,shield,rimmed,with,iron,for,his,left,arm,a,blunted,longsword,for,his,right,hand
the,sword,gleamed,silvery,grey,in,the,dawn,light,almost,new
one,of,the,last,to,come,from,donal’s,forge
a,pity,he,did,not,live,long,enough,to,put,an,edge,on,it
the,blade,was,shorter,than,longclaw,but,made,of,common,steel,which,made,it,heavier
his,blows,would,be,a,little,slower
it,will,serve
jon,turned,to,face,his,foes
come
which,one,do,you,want,first
asked,arron
all,three,of,you
at,once
three,on,one
jace,was,incredulous
that,wouldn’t,be,fair
he,was,one,of,conwy’s,latest,bunch,a,cobbler’s,son,from,fair,isle
maybe,that,explained,it
true
come,here
when,he,did,jon’s,blade,slammed,him,alongside,his,head,knocking,him,off,his,feet
in,the,blink,of,an,eye,the,boy,had,a,boot,on,his,chest,and,a,swordpoint,at,his,throat
war,is,never,fair,jon,told,him
it’s,two,on,one,now,and,you’re,dead
when,he,heard,gravel,crunch,he,knew,the,twins,were,coming
those,two,will,make,rangers,yet
he,spun,blocking,arron’s,cut,with,the,edge,of,his,shield,and,meeting,emrick’s,with,his,sword
those,aren’t,spears,he,shouted
get,in,close
he,went,to,the,attack,to,show,them,how,it,was,done
emrick,first
he,slashed,at,his,head,and,shoulders,right,and,left,and,right,again
the,boy,got,his,shield,up,and,tried,a,clumsy,countercut
jon,slammed,his,own,shield,into,emrick’s,and,brought,him,down,with,a,blow,to,the,lower,leg,none,too,soon,because,arron,was,on,him,with,a,crunching,cut,to,the,back,of,his,thigh,that,sent,him,to,one,knee
that,will,leave,a,bruise
he,caught,the,next,cut,on,his,shield,then,lurched,back,to,his,feet,and,drove,arron,across,the,yard
he’s,quick,he,thought,as,the,longswords,kissed,once,and,twice,and,thrice,but,he,needs,to,get,stronger
when,he,saw,relief,in,arron’s,eyes,he,knew,emrick,was,behind,him
he,came,around,and,dealt,him,a,cut,to,the,back,of,the,shoulders,that,sent,him,crashing,into,his,brother
by,that,time,jace,had,found,his,feet,so,jon,put,him,down,again
i,hate,it,when,dead,men,get,up
you’ll,feel,the,same,the,day,you,meet,a,wight
stepping,back,he,lowered,his,sword
the,big,crow,can,peck,the,little,crows,growled,a,voice,behind,him,but,has,he,belly,enough,to,fight,a,man
rattleshirt,was,leaning,against,a,wall
a,coarse,stubble,covered,his,sunken,cheeks,and,thin,brown,hair,was,blowing,across,his,little,yellow,eyes
you,flatter,yourself,jon,said
aye,but,i’d,flatten,you
stannis,burned,the,wrong,man
no
the,wildling,grinned,at,him,through,a,mouth,of,brown,and,broken,teeth
he,burned,the,man,he,had,to,burn,for,all,the,world,to,see
we,all,do,what,we,have,to,do,snow
even,kings
emmett,find,some,armor,for,him
i,want,him,in,steel,not,old,bones
once,clad,in,mail,and,plate,the,lord,of,bones,seemed,to,stand,a,little,straighter
he,seemed,taller,too,his,shoulders,thicker,and,more,powerful,than,jon,would,have,thought
it’s,the,armor,not,the,man,he,told,himself
even,sam,could,appear,almost,formidable,clad,head,to,heel,in,donal,noye’s,steel
the,wildling,waved,away,the,shield,horse,offered,him
instead,he,asked,for,a,two-handed,sword
there’s,a,sweet,sound,he,said,slashing,at,the,air
flap,closer,snow
i,mean,to,make,your,feathers,fly
jon,rushed,him,hard
rattleshirt,took,a,step,backwards,and,met,the,charge,with,a,two-handed,slash
if,jon,had,not,interposed,his,shield,it,might,have,staved,his,breastplate,in,and,broken,half,his,ribs
the,force,of,the,blow,staggered,him,for,a,moment,and,sent,a,solid,jolt,up,his,arm
he,hits,harder,than,i,would,have,thought
his,quickness,was,another,unpleasant,surprise
they,circled,round,each,other,trading,blow,for,blow
the,lord,of,bones,gave,as,good,as,he,was,getting
by,rights,the,two-handed,greatsword,should,have,been,a,deal,more,cumbersome,than,jon’s,longsword,but,the,wildling,wielded,it,with,blinding,speed
iron,emmett’s,fledglings,cheered,their,lord,commander,at,the,start,but,the,relentless,speed,of,rattleshirt’s,attack,soon,beat,them,down,to,silence
he,cannot,keep,this,up,for,long,jon,told,himself,as,he,stopped,another,blow
the,impact,made,him,grunt
even,dulled,the,greatsword,cracked,his,pinewood,shield,and,bent,the,iron,rim
he,will,tire,soon
he,must
jon,slashed,at,the,wildling’s,face,and,rattleshirt,pulled,back,his,head
he,hacked,down,at,rattleshirt’s,calf,only,to,have,him,deftly,leap,the,blade
the,greatsword,crashed,down,onto,jon’s,shoulder,hard,enough,to,ding,his,pouldron,and,numb,the,arm,beneath
jon,backed,away
the,lord,of,bones,came,after,chortling
he,has,no,shield,jon,reminded,himself,and,that,monster,sword’s,too,cumbersome,for,parries
i,should,be,landing,two,blows,for,every,one,of,his
somehow,he,wasn’t,though,and,the,blows,he,did,land,were,having,no,effect
the,wildling,always,seemed,to,be,moving,away,or,sliding,sideways,so,jon’s,longsword,glanced,off,a,shoulder,or,an,arm
before,long,he,found,himself,giving,more,ground,trying,to,avoid,the,other’s,crashing,cuts,and,failing,half,the,time
his,shield,had,been,reduced,to,kindling
he,shook,it,off,his,arm
sweat,was,running,down,his,face,and,stinging,his,eyes,beneath,his,helm
he,is,too,strong,and,too,quick,he,realized,and,with,that,greatsword,he,has,weight,and,reach,on,me
it,would,have,been,a,different,fight,if,jon,had,been,armed,with,longclaw,but,his,chance,came,on,rattleshirt’s,next,backswing
jon,threw,himself,forward,bulling,into,the,other,man,and,they,went,down,together,legs,entangled
steel,slammed,on,steel
both,men,lost,their,swords,as,they,rolled,on,the,hard,ground
the,wildling,drove,a,knee,between,jon’s,legs
jon,lashed,out,with,a,mailed,fist
somehow,rattleshirt,ended,up,on,top,with,jon’s,head,in,his,hands
he,smashed,it,against,the,ground,then,wrenched,his,visor,open
if,i,had,me,a,dagger,you’d,be,less,an,eye,by,now,he,snarled,before,horse,and,iron,emmett,dragged,him,off,the,lord,commander’s,chest
let,go,o’,me,you,bloody,crows,he,roared
jon,struggled,to,one,knee
his,head,was,ringing,and,his,mouth,was,full,of,blood
he,spat,it,out,and,said,well,fought
you,flatter,yourself,crow
i,never,broke,a,sweat
next,time,you,will,said,jon
dolorous,edd,helped,him,to,his,feet,and,unbuckled,his,helm
it,had,acquired,several,deep,dents,that,had,not,been,there,when,he’d,donned,it
release,him
jon,tossed,the,helm,to,hop-robin,who,dropped,it
my,lord,said,iron,emmett,he,threatened,your,life,we,all,heard
he,said,that,if,he,had,a,dagger,he,does,have,a,dagger
right,there,on,his,belt
there,is,always,someone,quicker,and,stronger,ser,rodrik,had,once,told,jon,and,robb

davos,even,in,the,gloom,of,the,wolf’s,den,davos,seaworth,could,sense,that,something,was,awry,this,morning
he,woke,to,the,sound,of,voices,and,crept,to,the,door,of,his,cell,but,the,wood,was,too,thick,and,he,could,not,make,out,the,words
dawn,had,come,but,not,the,porridge,garth,brought,him,every,morn,to,break,his,fast
that,made,him,anxious
all,the,days,were,much,the,same,inside,the,wolf’s,den,and,any,change,was,usually,for,the,worse
this,may,be,the,day,i,die
garth,may,be,sitting,with,a,whetstone,even,now,to,put,an,edge,on,lady,lu
the,onion,knight,had,not,forgotten,wyman,manderly’s,last,words,to,him
take,this,creature,to,the,wolf’s,den,and,cut,off,head,and,hands,the,fat,lord,had,commanded
i,shall,not,be,able,to,eat,a,bite,until,i,see,this,smuggler’s,head,upon,a,spike,with,an,onion,shoved,between,his,lying,teeth
every,night,davos,went,to,sleep,with,those,words,in,his,head,and,every,morn,he,woke,to,them
and,should,he,forget,garth,was,always,pleased,to,remind,him
dead,man,was,his,name,for,davos
when,he,came,by,in,the,morning,it,was,always,here,porridge,for,the,dead,man
at,night,it,was,blow,out,the,candle,dead,man
once,garth,brought,his,ladies,by,to,introduce,them,to,the,dead,man
the,whore,don’t,look,like,much,he,said,fondling,a,rod,of,cold,black,iron,but,when,i,heat,her,up,red-hot,and,let,her,touch,your,cock,you’ll,cry,for,mother
and,this,here’s,my,lady,lu
it’s,her,who’ll,take,your,head,and,hands,when,lord,wyman,sends,down,word
davos,had,never,seen,a,bigger,axe,than,lady,lu,nor,one,with,a,sharper,edge
garth,spent,his,days,honing,her,the,other,keepers,said
i,will,not,plead,for,mercy,davos,resolved
he,would,go,to,his,death,a,knight,asking,only,that,they,take,his,head,before,his,hands
even,garth,would,not,be,so,cruel,as,to,deny,him,that,he,hoped
the,sounds,coming,through,the,door,were,faint,and,muffled
davos,rose,and,paced,his,cell
as,cells,went,it,was,large,and,queerly,comfortable
he,suspected,it,might,once,have,been,some,lordling’s,bedchamber
it,was,thrice,the,size,of,his,captain’s,cabin,on,black,bessa,and,even,larger,than,the,cabin,salladhor,saan,enjoyed,on,his,valyrian
though,its,only,window,had,been,bricked,in,years,before,one,wall,still,boasted,a,hearth,big,enough,to,hold,a,kettle,and,there,was,an,actual,privy,built,into,a,corner,nook
the,floor,was,made,of,warped,planks,full,of,splinters,and,his,sleeping,pallet,smelled,of,mildew,but,those,discomforts,were,mild,compared,to,what,davos,had,expected
the,food,had,come,as,a,surprise,as,well
in,place,of,gruel,and,stale,bread,and,rotten,meat,the,usual,dungeon,fare,his,keepers,brought,him,fresh-caught,fish,bread,still,warm,from,the,oven,spiced,mutton,turnips,carrots,even,crabs
garth,was,none,too,pleased,by,that
the,dead,should,not,eat,better,than,the,living,he,complained,more,than,once
davos,had,furs,to,keep,him,warm,by,night,wood,to,feed,his,fire,clean,clothing,a,greasy,tallow,candle
when,he,asked,for,paper,quill,and,ink,therry,brought,them,the,next,day
when,he,asked,for,a,book,so,he,might,keep,at,his,reading,therry,turned,up,with,the,seven-pointed,star
for,all,its,comforts,though,his,cell,remained,a,cell
its,walls,were,solid,stone,so,thick,that,he,could,hear,nothing,of,the,outside,world
the,door,was,oak,and,iron,and,his,keepers,kept,it,barred
four,sets,of,heavy,iron,fetters,dangled,from,the,ceiling,waiting,for,the,day,lord,manderly,decided,to,chain,him,up,and,give,him,over,to,the,whore
today,may,be,that,day
the,next,time,garth,opens,my,door,it,may,not,be,to,bring,me,porridge
his,belly,was,rumbling,a,sure,sign,that,the,morning,was,creeping,past,and,still,no,sign,of,food
the,worst,part,is,not,the,dying,it’s,not,knowing,when,or,how
he,had,seen,the,inside,of,a,few,gaols,and,dungeons,in,his,smuggling,days,but,those,he’d,shared,with,other,prisoners,so,there,was,always,someone,to,talk,with,to,share,your,fears,and,hopes
not,here
aside,from,his,keepers,davos,seaworth,had,the,wolf’s,den,to,himself
he,knew,there,were,true,dungeons,down,in,the,castle,cellars,oubliettes,and,torture,chambers,and,dank,pits,where,huge,black,rats,scrabbled,in,the,darkness
his,gaolers,claimed,all,of,them,were,unoccupied,at,present
only,us,here,onion,ser,bartimus,had,told,him
he,was,the,chief,gaoler,a,cadaverous,one-legged,knight,with,a,scarred,face,and,a,blind,eye
when,ser,bartimus,was,in,his,cups,and,ser,bartimus,was,in,his,cups,most,every,day,he,liked,to,boast,of,how,he,had,saved,lord,wyman’s,life,at,the,battle,of,the,trident
the,wolf’s,den,was,his,reward
the,rest,of,us,consisted,of,a,cook,davos,never,saw,six,guardsmen,in,the,groundfloor,barracks,a,pair,of,washerwomen,and,the,two,turnkeys,who,looked,after,the,prisoner
therry,was,the,young,one,the,son,of,one,of,the,washerwomen,a,boy,of,ten-andfour
the,old,one,was,garth,huge,and,bald,and,taciturn,who,wore,the,same,greasy,leather,jerkin,every,day,and,always,seemed,to,have,a,glower,on,his,face
his,years,as,a,smuggler,had,given,davos,seaworth,a,sense,of,when,a,man,was,wrong,and,garth,was,wrong
the,onion,knight,took,care,to,hold,his,tongue,in,garth’s,presence
with,therry,and,ser,bartimus,he,was,less,reticent
he,thanked,them,for,his,food,encouraged,them,to,talk,about,their,hopes,and,histories,answered,their,questions,politely,and,never,pressed,too,hard,with,queries,of,his,own
when,he,made,requests,they,were,small,ones,a,basin,of,water,and,a,bit,of,soap,a,book,to,read,more,candles
most,such,favors,were,granted,and,davos,was,duly,grateful
neither,man,would,speak,about,lord,manderly,or,king,stannis,or,the,freys,but,they,would,talk,of,other,things
therry,wanted,to,go,off,to,war,when,he,was,old,enough,to,fight,in,battles,and,become,a,knight
he,liked,to,complain,about,his,mother,too
she,was,bedding,two,of,the,guardsmen,he,confided
the,men,were,on,different,watches,and,neither,knew,about,the,other,but,one,day,one,man,or,t’other,would,puzzle,it,out,and,then,there,would,be,blood
some,nights,the,boy,would,even,bring,a,skin,of,wine,to,the,cell,and,ask,davos,about,the,smuggler’s,life,as,they,drank
ser,bartimus,had,no,interest,in,the,world,outside,or,indeed,anything,that,had,happened,since,he,lost,his,leg,to,a,riderless,horse,and,a,maester’s,saw
he,had,come,to,love,the,wolf’s,den,however,and,liked,nothing,more,than,to,talk,about,its,long,and,bloody,history
the,den,was,much,older,than,white,harbor,the,knight,told,davos
it,had,been,raised,by,king,jon,stark,to,defend,the,mouth,of,the,white,knife,against,raiders,from,the,sea
many,a,younger,son,of,the,king,in,the,north,had,made,his,seat,there,many,a,brother,many,an,uncle,many,a,cousin
some,passed,the,castle,to,their,own,sons,and,grandsons,and,offshoot,branches,of,house,stark,had,arisen,the,greystarks,had,lasted,the,longest,holding,the,wolf’s,den,for,five,centuries,until,they,presumed,to,join,the,dreadfort,in,rebellion,against,the,starks,of,winterfell
after,their,fall,the,castle,had,passed,through,many,other,hands
house,flint,held,it,for,a,century,house,locke,for,almost,two
slates,longs,holts,and,ashwoods,had,held,sway,here,charged,by,winterfell,to,keep,the,river,safe
reavers,from,the,three,sisters,took,the,castle,once,making,it,their,toehold,in,the,north
during,the,wars,between,winterfell,and,the,vale,it,was,besieged,by,osgood,arryn,the,old,falcon,and,burned,by,his,son,the,one,remembered,as,the,talon
when,old,king,edrick,stark,had,grown,too,feeble,to,defend,his,realm,the,wolf’s,den,was,captured,by,slavers,from,the,stepstones
they,would,brand,their,captives,with,hot,irons,and,break,them,to,the,whip,before,shipping,them,off,across,the,sea,and,these,same,black,stone,walls,bore,witness
then,a,long,cruel,winter,fell,said,ser,bartimus
the,white,knife,froze,hard,and,even,the,firth,was,icing,up
the,winds,came,howling,from,the,north,and,drove,them,slavers,inside,to,huddle,round,their,fires,and,whilst,they,warmed,themselves,the,new,king,come,down,on,them
brandon,stark,this,was,edrick,snowbeard’s,great-grandson,him,that,men,called,ice,eyes
he,took,the,wolf’s,den,back,stripped,the,slavers,naked,and,gave,them,to,the,slaves,he’d,found,chained,up,in,the,dungeons
it’s,said,they,hung,their,entrails,in,the,branches,of,the,heart,tree,as,an,offering,to,the,gods
the,old,gods,not,these,new,ones,from,the,south
your,seven,don’t,know,winter,and,winter,don’t,know,them
davos,could,not,argue,with,the,truth,of,that
from,what,he,had,seen,at,eastwatch-bythe-sea,he,did,not,care,to,know,winter,either
what,gods,do,you,keep
he,asked,the,one-legged,knight
the,old,ones
when,ser,bartimus,grinned,he,looked,just,like,a,skull
me,and,mine,were,here,before,the,manderlys
like,as,not,my,own,forebears,strung,those,entrails,through,the,tree
i,never,knew,that,northmen,made,blood,sacrifice,to,their,heart,trees
there’s,much,and,more,you,southrons,do,not,know,about,the,north,ser,bartimus,replied
he,was,not,wrong
davos,sat,beside,his,candle,and,looked,at,the,letters,he,had,scratched,out,word,by,word,during,the,days,of,his,confinement
i,was,a,better,smuggler,than,a,knight,he,had,written,to,his,wife,a,better,knight,than,a,king’s,hand,a,better,king’s,hand,than,a,husband
i,am,so,sorry
marya,i,have,loved,you

should,stannis,gain,the,iron,throne,house,seaworth,will,survive,and,devan,will,remain,at,court
he,will,help,you,place,the,other,boys,with,noble,lords,where,they,can,serve,as,pages,and,squires,and,win,their,knighthoods
it,was,the,best,counsel,he,had,for,her,though,he,wished,it,sounded,wiser
he,had,written,to,each,of,his,three,surviving,sons,as,well,to,help,them,remember,the,father,who,had,bought,them,names,with,his,fingertips
his,notes,to,steffon,and,young,stannis,were,short,and,stiff,and,awkward,if,truth,be,told,he,did,not,know,them,half,as,well,as,he,had,his,older,boys,the,ones,who’d,burned,or,drowned,upon,the,blackwater
to,devan,he,wrote,more,telling,him,how,proud,he,was,to,see,his,own,son,as,a,king’s,squire,and,reminding,him,that,as,the,eldest,it,was,his,duty,to,protect,his,lady,mother,and,his,younger,brothers

i,am,sorry,that,i,failed,him
i,lost,my,luck,when,i,lost,my,fingerbones,the,day,the,river,burned,below,king’s,landing
davos,shuffled,through,the,letters,slowly,reading,each,one,over,several,times,wondering,whether,he,should,change,a,word,here,or,add,one,there
a,man,should,have,more,to,say,when,staring,at,the,end,of,his,life,he,thought,but,the,words,came,hard
i,did,not,do,so,ill,he,tried,to,tell,himself
i,rose,up,from,flea,bottom,to,be,a,king’s,hand,and,i,learned,to,read,and,write
he,was,still,hunched,over,the,letters,when,he,heard,the,sound,of,iron,keys,rattling,on,a,ring
half,a,heartbeat,later,the,door,to,his,cell,came,swinging,open
the,man,who,stepped,through,the,door,was,not,one,of,his,gaolers
he,was,tall,and,haggard,with,a,deeply,lined,face,and,a,shock,of,grey-brown,hair
a,longsword,hung,from,his,hip,and,his,deep-dyed,scarlet,cloak,was,fastened,at,the,shoulder,with,a,heavy,silver,brooch,in,the,shape,of,a,mailed,fist

quickly,now,with,me
glover,led,him,along,a,darkened,hall,and,down,a,flight,of,worn,steps
they,crossed,the,castle’s,godswood,where,the,heart,tree,had,grown,so,huge,and,tangled,that,it,had,choked,out,all,the,oaks,and,elms,and,birch,and,sent,its,thick,pale,limbs,crashing,through,the,walls,and,windows,that,looked,down,on,it
its,roots,were,as,thick,around,as,a,man’s,waist,its,trunk,so,wide,that,the,face,carved,into,it,looked,fat,and,angry
beyond,the,weirwood,glover,opened,a,rusted,iron,gate,and,paused,to,light,a,torch
when,it,was,blazing,red,and,hot,he,took,davos,down,more,steps,into,a,barrel-vaulted,cellar,where,the,weeping,walls,were,crusted,white,with,salt,and,seawater,sloshed,beneath,their,feet,with,every,step
they,passed,through,several,cellars,and,rows,of,small,damp,foul-smelling,cells,very,different,from,the,room,where,davos,had,been,confined
then,there,was,a,blank,stone,wall,that,turned,when,glover,pushed,on,it
beyond,was,a,long,narrow,tunnel,and,still,more,steps
these,led,up
where,are,we

porridge,for,the,dead,man
davos,climbed
they,emerged,through,another,wall,but,this,one,was,lath,and,plaster,on,the,far,side
the,room,beyond,was,snug,and,warm,and,comfortably,furnished,with,a,myrish,carpet,on,the,floor,and,beeswax,candles,burning,on,a,table

you,and,yours,were,most,convincing
your,good-daughter,seemed,to,want,me,dead,most,earnestly,and,the,little,girl,wylla
lord,wyman,smiled

even,when,i,threatened,to,have,her,tongue,out,she,reminded,me,of,the,debt,white,harbor,owes,to,the,starks,of,winterfell,a,debt,that,can,never,be,repaid

lord,tywin,lannister,wrote,me,himself,to,say,that,he,had,wylis
if,i,would,have,him,freed,unharmed,he,told,me,i,must,repent,my,treason,yield,my,city,declare,my,loyalty,to,the,boy,king,on,the,iron,throne,and,bend,my,knee,to,roose,bolton,his,warden,of,the,north

i,am,fat,and,many,think,that,makes,me,weak,and,foolish
mayhaps,tywin,lannister,was,one,such
i,sent,him,back,a,raven,to,say,that,i,would,bend,my,knee,and,open,my,gates,after,my,son,was,returned,but,not,before
there,the,matter,stood,when,tywin,died
afterward,the,freys,turned,up,with,wendel’s,bones,to,make,a,peace,and,seal,it,with,a,marriage,pact,they,claimed,but,i,was,not,about,to,give,them,what,they,wanted,until,i,had,wylis,safe,and,whole,and,they,were,not,about,to,give,me,wylis,until,i,proved,my,loyalty
your,arrival,gave,me,the,means,to,do,that
that,was,the,reason,for,the,discourtesy,i,showed,you,in,the,merman’s,court,and,for,the,head,and,hands,rotting,above,the,seal,gate
you,took,a,great,risk,my,lord,davos,said

one,of,his,wife’s,handmaids,has,found,her,way,into,the,bed,of,my,own,fool

you,heard,him,in,my,hall
maesters,are,supposed,to,put,aside,old,loyalties,when,they,don,their,chains,but,i,cannot,forget,that,theomore,was,born,a,lannister,of,lannisport,and,claims,some,distant,kinship,to,the,lannisters,of,casterly,rock
foes,and,false,friends,are,all,around,me,lord,davos

did,manderly,have,a,stark,heir,hidden,away,in,his,castle
a,found,boy,or,a,feigned,boy
the,north,would,rise,for,either,he,suspected,but,stannis,baratheon,would,never,make,common,cause,with,an,imposter
the,lad,who,followed,robett,glover,through,the,door,was,not,a,stark,nor,could,he,ever,hope,to,pass,for,one
he,was,older,than,the,young,wolf’s,murdered,brothers,fourteen,or,fifteen,by,the,look,of,him,and,his,eyes,were,older,still
beneath,a,tangle,of,dark,brown,hair,his,face,was,almost,feral,with,a,wide,mouth,sharp,nose,and,pointed,chin
who,are,you

there,was,no,parchment,in,the,chamber
the,boy,carved,the,letters,into,a,wooden,beam,in,the,wall

how,much,does,lord,stannis,know,of,what,transpired,at,winterfell
davos,thought,back,on,the,tales,they’d,heard
winterfell,was,captured,by,theon,greyjoy,who,had,once,been,lord,stark’s,ward
he,had,stark’s,two,young,sons,put,to,death,and,mounted,their,heads,above,the,castle,walls
when,the,northmen,came,to,oust,him,he,put,the,entire,castle,to,sword,down,to,the,last,child,before,he,himself,was,slain,by,lord,bolton’s,bastard
not,slain,said,glover
captured,and,carried,back,to,the,dreadfort
the,bastard,has,been,flaying,him
lord,wyman,nodded
the,tale,you,tell,is,one,we,all,have,heard,as,full,of,lies,as,a,pudding’s,full,of,raisins
it,was,the,bastard,of,bolton,who,put,winterfell,to,the,sword,ramsay,snow,he,was,called,then,before,the,boy,king,made,him,a,bolton
snow,did,not,kill,them,all
he,spared,the,women,roped,them,together,and,marched,them,to,the,dreadfort,for,his,sport
his,sport
he,is,a,great,hunter,said,wyman,manderly,and,women,are,his,favorite,prey
he,strips,them,naked,and,sets,them,loose,in,the,woods
they,have,a,half,day’s,start,before,he,sets,out,after,them,with,hounds,and,horns
from,time,to,time,some,wench,escapes,and,lives,to,tell,the,tale
most,are,less,fortunate
when,ramsay,catches,them,he,rapes,them,flays,them,feeds,their,corpses,to,his,dogs,and,brings,their,skins,back,to,the,dreadfort,as,trophies
if,they,have,given,him,good,sport,he,slits,their,throats,before,he,skins,them
elsewise,t’other,way,around
davos,paled

how,could,any,man,the,evil,is,in,his,blood,said,robett,glover
he,is,a,bastard,born,of,rape
a,snow,no,matter,what,the,boy,king,says
was,ever,snow,so,black
asked,lord,wyman
ramsay,took,lord,hornwood’s,lands,by,forcibly,wedding,his,widow,then,locked,her,in,a,tower,and,forgot,her
it,is,said,she,ate,her,own,fingers,in,her,extremity,and,the,lannister,notion,of,king’s,justice,is,to,reward,her,killer,with,ned,stark’s,little,girl
the,boltons,have,always,been,as,cruel,as,they,were,cunning,but,this,one,seems,a,beast,in,human,skin,said,glover
the,lord,of,white,harbor,leaned,forward
the,freys,are,no,better
they,speak,of,wargs,and,skinchangers,and,assert,that,it,was,robb,stark,who,slew,my,wendel
the,arrogance,of,it
they,do,not,expect,the,north,to,believe,their,lies,not,truly,but,they,think,we,must,pretend,to,believe,or,die
roose,bolton,lies,about,his,part,in,the,red,wedding,and,his,bastard,lies,about,the,fall,of,winterfell
and,yet,so,long,as,they,held,wylis,i,had,no,choice,but,to,eat,all,this,excrement,and,praise,the,taste
and,now,my,lord
asked,davos
he,had,hoped,to,hear,lord,wyman,say,and,now,i,shall,declare,for,king,stannis,but,instead,the,fat,man,smiled,an,odd,twinkling,smile,and,said,and,now,i,have,a,wedding,to,attend
i,am,too,fat,to,sit,a,horse,as,any,man,with,eyes,can,plainly,see
as,a,boy,i,loved,to,ride,and,as,a,young,man,i,handled,a,mount,well,enough,to,win,some,small,acclaim,in,the,lists,but,those,days,are,done
my,body,has,become,a,prison,more,dire,than,the,wolf’s,den
even,so,i,must,go,to,winterfell
roose,bolton,wants,me,on,my,knees,and,beneath,the,velvet,courtesy,he,shows,the,iron,mail
i,shall,go,by,barge,and,litter,attended,by,a,hundred,knights,and,my,good,friends,from,the,twins
the,freys,came,here,by,sea
they,have,no,horses,with,them,so,i,shall,present,each,of,them,with,a,palfrey,as,a,guest,gift
do,hosts,still,give,guest,gifts,in,the,south
some,do,my,lord
on,the,day,their,guest,departs
perhaps,you,understand,then
wyman,manderly,lurched,ponderously,to,his,feet
i,have,been,building,warships,for,more,than,a,year
some,you,saw,but,there,are,as,many,more,hidden,up,the,white,knife
even,with,the,losses,i,have,suffered,i,still,command,more,heavy,horse,than,any,other,lord,north,of,the,neck
my,walls,are,strong,and,my,vaults,are,full,of,silver
oldcastle,and,widow’s,watch,will,take,their,lead,from,me
my,bannermen,include,a,dozen,petty,lords,and,a,hundred,landed,knights
i,can,deliver,king,stannis,the,allegiance,of,all,the,lands,east,of,the,white,knife,from,widow’s,watch,and,ramsgate,to,the,sheepshead,hills,and,the,headwaters,of,the,broken,branch
all,this,i,pledge,to,do,if,you,will,meet,my,price
i,can,bring,your,terms,to,the,king,but,lord,wyman,cut,him,off
if,you,will,meet,my,price,i,said
not,stannis
it’s,not,a,king,i,need,but,a,smuggler
robett,glover,took,up,the,tale
we,may,never,know,all,that,happened,at,winterfell,when,ser,rodrik,cassel,tried,to,take,the,castle,back,from,theon,greyjoy’s,ironmen
the,bastard,of,bolton,claims,that,greyjoy,murdered,ser,rodrik,during,a,parley
wex,says,no
until,he,learns,more,letters,we,will,never,know,half,the,truth,but,he,came,to,us,knowing,yes,and,no,and,those,can,go,a,long,way,once,you,find,the,right,questions
it,was,the,bastard,who,murdered,ser,rodrik,and,the,men,of,winterfell,said,lord,wyman
he,slew,greyjoy’s,ironmen,as,well
wex,saw,men,cut,down,trying,to,yield
when,we,asked,how,he,escaped,he,took,a,chunk,of,chalk,and,drew,a,tree,with,a,face
davos,thought,about,that
the,old,gods,saved,him
after,a,fashion
he,climbed,the,heart,tree,and,hid,himself,amongst,the,leaves
bolton’s,men,searched,the,godswood,twice,and,killed,the,men,they,found,there,but,none,thought,to,clamber,up,into,the,trees
is,that,how,it,happened,wex
the,boy,flipped,up,glover’s,dagger,caught,it,nodded
glover,said,he,stayed,up,in,the,tree,a,long,time
he,slept,amongst,the,branches,not,daring,to,descend
finally,he,heard,voices,down,beneath,him
the,voices,of,the,dead,said,wyman,manderly
wex,held,up,five,fingers,tapped,each,one,with,the,dagger,then,folded,four,away,and,tapped,the,last,again
six,of,them,asked,davos
there,were,six
two,of,them,ned,stark’s,murdered,sons
how,could,a,mute,tell,you,that
with,chalk
he,drew,two,boys,and,two,wolves
the,lad,is,ironborn,so,he,thought,it,best,not,to,show,himself,said,glover
he,listened
the,six,did,not,linger,long,amongst,the,ruins,of,winterfell
four,went,one,way,two,another
wex,stole,after,the,two,a,woman,and,a,boy
he,must,have,stayed,downwind,so,the,wolf,would,not,catch,his,scent
he,knows,where,they,went,lord,wyman,said
davos,understood
you,want,the,boy
roose,bolton,has,lord,eddard’s,daughter
to,thwart,him,white,harbor,must,have,ned’s,son,and,the,direwolf
the,wolf,will,prove,the,boy,is,who,we,say,he,is,should,the,dreadfort,attempt,to,deny,him
that,is,my,price,lord,davos
smuggle,me,back,my,liege,lord,and,i,will,take,stannis,baratheon,as,my,king
old,instinct,made,davos,seaworth,reach,for,his,throat
his,fingerbones,had,been,his,luck,and,somehow,he,felt,he,would,have,need,of,luck,to,do,what,wyman,manderly,was,asking,of,him
the,bones,were,gone,though,so,he,said,you,have,better,men,than,me,in,your,service
knights,and,lords,and,maesters
why,would,you,need,a,smuggler
you,have,ships
ships,lord,wyman,agreed,but,my,crews,are,rivermen,or,fisherfolk,who,have,never,sailed,beyond,the,bite
for,this,i,must,have,a,man,who’s,sailed,in,darker,waters,and,knows,how,to,slip,past,dangers,unseen,and,unmolested
where,is,the,boy
somehow,davos,knew,he,would,not,like,the,answer
where,is,it,you,want,me,to,go,my,lord
robett,glover,said,wex
show,him
the,mute,flipped,the,dagger,caught,it,then,flung,it,end,over,end,at,the,sheepskin,map,that,adorned,lord,wyman’s,wall
it,struck,quivering
then,he,grinned
for,half,a,heartbeat,davos,considered,asking,wyman,manderly,to,send,him,back,to,the,wolf’s,den,to,ser,bartimus,with,his,tales,and,garth,with,his,lethal,ladies
in,the,den,even,prisoners,ate,porridge,in,the,morning
but,there,were,other,places,in,this,world,where,men,were,known,to,break,their,fast,on,human,flesh
daenerys,each,morning,from,her,western,ramparts,the,queen,would,count,the,sails,on,slaver’s,bay
today,she,counted,five-and-twenty,though,some,were,far,away,and,moving,so,it,was,hard,to,be,certain
sometimes,she,missed,one,or,counted,one,twice
what,does,it,matter
a,strangler,only,needs,ten,fingers
all,trade,had,stopped,and,her,fisherfolk,did,not,dare,put,out,into,the,bay
the,boldest,still,dropped,a,few,lines,into,the,river,though,even,that,was,hazardous,more,remained,tied,up,beneath,meereen’s,walls,of,many-colored,brick
there,were,ships,from,meereen,out,in,the,bay,too,warships,and,trading,galleys,whose,captains,had,taken,them,to,sea,when,dany’s,host,first,laid,siege,to,the,city,now,returned,to,augment,the,fleets,from,qarth,tolos,and,new,ghis

the,fire,was,inside,her,an,agony,an,ecstasy,filling,her,searing,her,transforming,her
shimmers,of,heat,traced,patterns,on,her,skin,insistent,as,a,lover’s,hand
strange,voices,called,to,her,from,days,long,past
melony,she,heard,a,woman,cry
a,man’s,voice,called,lot,seven
she,was,weeping,and,her,tears,were,flame
and,still,she,drank,it,in
snowflakes,swirled,from,a,dark,sky,and,ashes,rose,to,meet,them,the,grey,and,the,white,whirling,around,each,other,as,flaming,arrows,arced,above,a,wooden,wall,and,dead,things,shambled,silent,through,the,cold,beneath,a,great,grey,cliff,where,fires,burned,inside,a,hundred,caves
then,the,wind,rose,and,the,white,mist,came,sweeping,in,impossibly,cold,and,one,by,one,the,fires,went,out
afterward,only,the,skulls,remained
death,thought,melisandre
the,skulls,are,death
the,flames,crackled,softly,and,in,their,crackling,she,heard,the,whispered,name,jon,snow
his,long,face,floated,before,her,limned,in,tongues,of,red,and,orange,appearing,and,disappearing,again,a,shadow,half-seen,behind,a,fluttering,curtain
now,he,was,a,man,now,a,wolf,now,a,man,again
but,the,skulls,were,here,as,well,the,skulls,were,all,around,him
melisandre,had,seen,his,danger,before,had,tried,to,warn,the,boy,of,it
enemies,all,around,him,daggers,in,the,dark
he,would,not,listen
unbelievers,never,listened,until,it,was,too,late
what,do,you,see,my,lady
the,boy,asked,softly
skulls
a,thousand,skulls,and,the,bastard,boy,again
jon,snow
whenever,she,was,asked,what,she,saw,within,her,fires,melisandre,would,answer,much,and,more,but,seeing,was,never,as,simple,as,those,words,suggested
it,was,an,art,and,like,all,arts,it,demanded,mastery,discipline,study
pain
that,too
r’hllor,spoke,to,his,chosen,ones,through,blessed,fire,in,a,language,of,ash,and,cinder,and,twisting,flame,that,only,a,god,could,truly,grasp
melisandre,had,practiced,her,art,for,years,beyond,count,and,she,had,paid,the,price
there,was,no,one,even,in,her,order,who,had,her,skill,at,seeing,the,secrets,half-revealed,and,half-concealed,within,the,sacred,flames
yet,now,she,could,not,even,seem,to,find,her,king
i,pray,for,a,glimpse,of,azor,ahai,and,r’hllor,shows,me,only,snow
devan,she,called,a,drink
her,throat,was,raw,and,parched
yes,my,lady
the,boy,poured,her,a,cup,of,water,from,the,stone,jug,by,the,window,and,brought,it,to,her
thank,you
melisandre,took,a,sip,swallowed,and,gave,the,boy,a,smile
that,made,him,blush
the,boy,was,half,in,love,with,her,she,knew
he,fears,me,he,wants,me,and,he,worships,me
all,the,same,devan,was,not,pleased,to,be,here
the,lad,had,taken,great,pride,in,serving,as,a,king’s,squire,and,it,had,wounded,him,when,stannis,commanded,him,to,remain,at,castle,black
like,any,boy,his,age,his,head,was,full,of,dreams,of,glory,no,doubt,he,had,been,picturing,the,prowess,he,would,display,at,deepwood,motte
other,boys,his,age,had,gone,south,to,serve,as,squires,to,the,king’s,knights,and,ride,into,battle,at,their,side
devan’s,exclusion,must,have,seemed,a,rebuke,a,punishment,for,some,failure,on,his,part,or,perhaps,for,some,failure,of,his,father
in,truth,he,was,here,because,melisandre,had,asked,for,him
the,four,eldest,sons,of,davos,seaworth,had,perished,in,the,battle,on,the,blackwater,when,the,king’s,fleet,had,been,consumed,by,green,fire
devan,was,the,fifthborn,and,safer,here,with,her,than,at,the,king’s,side
lord,davos,would,not,thank,her,for,it,no,more,than,the,boy,himself,but,it,seemed,to,her,that,seaworth,had,suffered,enough,grief
misguided,as,he,was,his,loyalty,to,stannis,could,not,be,doubted
she,had,seen,that,in,her,flames
devan,was,quick,and,smart,and,able,too,which,was,more,than,could,be,said,about,most,of,her,attendants
stannis,had,left,a,dozen,of,his,men,behind,to,serve,her,when,he,marched,south,but,most,of,them,were,useless
his,grace,had,need,of,every,sword,so,all,he,could,spare,were,greybeards,and,cripples
one,man,had,been,blinded,by,a,blow,to,his,head,in,the,battle,by,the,wall,another,lamed,when,his,falling,horse,crushed,his,legs
her,serjeant,had,lost,an,arm,to,a,giant’s,club
three,of,her,guard,were,geldings,that,stannis,had,castrated,for,raping,wildling,women
she,had,two,drunkards,and,a,craven,too
the,last,should,have,been,hanged,as,the,king,himself,admitted,but,he,came,from,a,noble,family,and,his,father,and,brothers,had,been,stalwart,from,the,first
having,guards,about,her,would,no,doubt,help,keep,the,black,brothers,properly,respectful,the,red,priestess,knew,but,none,of,the,men,that,stannis,had,given,her,were,like,to,be,much,help,should,she,find,herself,in,peril
it,made,no,matter
melisandre,of,asshai,did,not,fear,for,herself
r’hllor,would,protect,her
she,took,another,sip,of,water,laid,her,cup,aside,blinked,and,stretched,and,rose,from,her,chair,her,muscles,sore,and,stiff
after,gazing,into,the,flames,so,long,it,took,her,a,few,moments,to,adjust,to,the,dimness
her,eyes,were,dry,and,tired,but,if,she,rubbed,them,it,would,only,make,them,worse
her,fire,had,burned,low,she,saw
devan,more,wood
what,hour,is,it
almost,dawn,my,lady

another,day,is,given,us,r’hllor,be,praised
the,terrors,of,the,night,recede
melisandre,had,spent,the,night,in,her,chair,by,the,fire,as,she,often,did
with,stannis,gone,her,bed,saw,little,use
she,had,no,time,for,sleep,with,the,weight,of,the,world,upon,her,shoulders
and,she,feared,to,dream
sleep,is,a,little,death,dreams,the,whisperings,of,the,other,who,would,drag,us,all,into,his,eternal,night
she,would,sooner,sit,bathed,in,the,ruddy,glow,of,her,red,lord’s,blessed,flames,her,cheeks,flushed,by,the,wash,of,heat,as,if,by,a,lover’s,kisses
some,nights,she,drowsed,but,never,for,more,than,an,hour
one,day,melisandre,prayed,she,would,not,sleep,at,all
one,day,she,would,be,free,of,dreams
melony,she,thought
lot,seven
devan,fed,fresh,logs,to,the,fire,until,the,flames,leapt,up,again,fierce,and,furious,driving,the,shadows,back,into,the,corners,of,the,room,devouring,all,her,unwanted,dreams
the,dark,recedes,again,for,a,little,while
but,beyond,the,wall,the,enemy,grows,stronger,and,should,he,win,the,dawn,will,never,come,again
she,wondered,if,it,had,been,his,face,that,she,had,seen,staring,out,at,her,from,the,flames
no
surely,not
his,visage,would,be,more,frightening,than,that,cold,and,black,and,too,terrible,for,any,man,to,gaze,upon,and,live
the,wooden,man,she,had,glimpsed,though,and,the,boy,with,the,wolf’s,face,they,were,his,servants,surely,his,champions,as,stannis,was,hers
melisandre,went,to,her,window,pushed,open,the,shutters
outside,the,east,had,just,begun,to,lighten,and,the,stars,of,morning,still,hung,in,a,pitch-black,sky
castle,black,was,already,beginning,to,stir,as,men,in,black,cloaks,made,their,way,across,the,yard,to,break,their,fast,with,bowls,of,porridge,before,they,relieved,their,brothers,atop,the,wall
a,few,snowflakes,drifted,by,the,open,window,floating,on,the,wind
does,my,lady,wish,to,break,her,fast
asked,devan
food
yes,i,should,eat
some,days,she,forgot
r’hllor,provided,her,with,all,the,nourishment,her,body,needed,but,that,was,something,best,concealed,from,mortal,men
it,was,jon,snow,she,needed,not,fried,bread,and,bacon,but,it,was,no,use,sending,devan,to,the,lord,commander
he,would,not,come,to,her,summons
snow,still,chose,to,dwell,behind,the,armory,in,a,pair,of,modest,rooms,previously,occupied,by,the,watch’s,late,blacksmith
perhaps,he,did,not,think,himself,worthy,of,the,king’s,tower,or,perhaps,he,did,not,care
that,was,his,mistake,the,false,humility,of,youth,that,is,itself,a,sort,of,pride
it,was,never,wise,for,a,ruler,to,eschew,the,trappings,of,power,for,power,itself,flows,in,no,small,measure,from,such,trappings
the,boy,was,not,entirely,naive,however
he,knew,better,than,to,come,to,melisandre’s,chambers,like,a,supplicant,insisting,she,come,to,him,instead,should,she,have,need,of,words,with,him
and,oft,as,not,when,she,did,come,he,would,keep,her,waiting,or,refuse,to,see,her
that,much,at,least,was,shrewd
i,will,have,nettle,tea,a,boiled,egg,and,bread,with,butter
fresh,bread,if,you,please,not,fried
you,may,find,the,wildling,as,well
tell,him,that,i,must,speak,with,him
rattleshirt,my,lady
and,quickly
while,the,boy,was,gone,melisandre,washed,herself,and,changed,her,robes
her,sleeves,were,full,of,hidden,pockets,and,she,checked,them,carefully,as,she,did,every,morning,to,make,certain,all,her,powders,were,in,place
powders,to,turn,fire,green,or,blue,or,silver,powders,to,make,a,flame,roar,and,hiss,and,leap,up,higher,than,a,man,is,tall,powders,to,make,smoke
a,smoke,for,truth,a,smoke,for,lust,a,smoke,for,fear,and,the,thick,black,smoke,that,could,kill,a,man,outright
the,red,priestess,armed,herself,with,a,pinch,of,each,of,them
the,carved,chest,that,she,had,brought,across,the,narrow,sea,was,more,than,threequarters,empty,now
and,while,melisandre,had,the,knowledge,to,make,more,powders,she,lacked,many,rare,ingredients
my,spells,should,suffice
she,was,stronger,at,the,wall,stronger,even,than,in,asshai
her,every,word,and,gesture,was,more,potent,and,she,could,do,things,that,she,had,never,done,before
such,shadows,as,i,bring,forth,here,will,be,terrible,and,no,creature,of,the,dark,will,stand,before,them
with,such,sorceries,at,her,command,she,should,soon,have,no,more,need,of,the,feeble,tricks,of,alchemists,and,pyromancers
she,shut,the,chest,turned,the,lock,and,hid,the,key,inside,her,skirts,in,another,secret,pocket
then,came,a,rapping,at,her,door
her,one-armed,serjeant,from,the,tremulous,sound,of,his,knock
lady,melisandre,the,lord,o’,bones,is,come

melisandre,settled,herself,back,into,the,chair,beside,the,hearth
the,wildling,wore,a,sleeveless,jerkin,of,boiled,leather,dotted,with,bronze,studs,beneath,a,worn,cloak,mottled,in,shades,of,green,and,brown
no,bones
he,was,cloaked,in,shadows,too,in,wisps,of,ragged,grey,mist,half-seen,sliding,across,his,face,and,form,with,every,step,he,took
ugly,things
as,ugly,as,his,bones
a,widow’s,peak,close-set,dark,eyes,pinched,cheeks,a,mustache,wriggling,like,a,worm,above,a,mouthful,of,broken,brown,teeth
melisandre,felt,the,warmth,in,the,hollow,of,her,throat,as,her,ruby,stirred,at,the,closeness,of,its,slave
you,have,put,aside,your,suit,of,bones,she,observed
the,clacking,was,like,to,drive,me,mad
the,bones,protect,you,she,reminded,him
the,black,brothers,do,not,love,you
devan,tells,me,that,only,yesterday,you,had,words,with,some,of,them,over,supper
a,few
i,was,eating,bean-and-bacon,soup,whilst,bowen,marsh,was,going,on,about,the,high,ground
the,old,pomegranate,thought,that,i,was,spying,on,him,and,announced,that,he,would,not,suffer,murderers,listening,to,their,councils
i,told,him,that,if,that,was,true,maybe,they,shouldn’t,have,them,by,the,fire
bowen,turned,red,and,made,some,choking,sounds,but,that,was,as,far,as,it,went
the,wildling,sat,on,the,edge,of,the,window,slid,his,dagger,from,its,sheath
if,some,crow,wants,to,slip,a,knife,between,my,ribs,whilst,i’m,spooning,up,some,supper,he’s,welcome,to,try
hobb’s,gruel,would,taste,better,with,a,drop,of,blood,to,spice,it

snow’s,been,assuming,the,free,folk,would,turn,to,tormund,to,lead,them,because,that’s,what,he,would,do
he,liked,tormund,and,the,old,fraud,liked,him,too

she,would,have,no,need,of,them,today,but,melisandre,made,it,a,point,to,keep,a,pair,of,guards,about,her,everywhere,she,went
it,sent,a,certain,message
the,trappings,of,power
by,the,time,the,three,of,them,emerged,north,of,the,wall,the,snow,was,falling,steadily

tyrion,was,not,entirely,sure,he,had,been,japing
when,the,evening,prayers,had,ended,and,the,ship’s,crew,had,once,again,dispersed,some,to,their,watch,and,others,to,food,and,rum,and,hammocks,moqorro,remained,beside,his,nightfire,as,he,did,every,night
the,red,priest,rested,by,day,but,kept,vigil,through,the,dark,hours,to,tend,his,sacred,flames,so,that,the,sun,might,return,to,them,at,dawn
tyrion,squatted,across,from,him,and,warmed,his,hands,against,the,night’s,chill
moqorro,took,no,notice,of,him,for,several,moments
he,was,staring,into,the,flickering,flames,lost,in,some,vision
does,he,see,days,yet,to,come,as,he,claims
if,so,that,was,a,fearsome,gift
after,a,time,the,priest,raised,his,eyes,to,meet,the,dwarf’s
hugor,hill,he,said,inclining,his,head,in,a,solemn,nod
have,you,come,to,pray,with,me
someone,told,me,that,the,night,is,dark,and,full,of,terrors
what,do,you,see,in,those,flames
dragons,moqorro,said,in,the,common,tongue,of,westeros
he,spoke,it,very,well,with,hardly,a,trace,of,accent
no,doubt,that,was,one,reason,the,high,priest,benerro,had,chosen,him,to,bring,the,faith,of,r’hllor,to,daenerys,targaryen
dragons,old,and,young,true,and,false,bright,and,dark
and,you
a,small,man,with,a,big,shadow,snarling,in,the,midst,of,all
snarling
an,amiable,fellow,like,me
tyrion,was,almost,flattered
and,no,doubt,that,is,just,what,he,intends
every,fool,loves,to,hear,that,he’s,important
perhaps,it,was,penny,you,saw
we’re,almost,of,a,size
no,my,friend
my,friend
when,did,that,happen,i,wonder
did,you,see,how,long,it,will,take,us,to,reach,meereen
you,are,eager,to,behold,the,world’s,deliverer
yes,and,no
the,world’s,deliverer,may,snick,off,my,head,or,give,me,to,her,dragons,as,a,savory
not,me,said,tyrion
for,me,it,is,all,about,the,olives
though,i,fear,i,may,grow,old,and,die,before,i,taste,one
i,could,dog-paddle,faster,than,we’re,sailing
tell,me,was,selaesori,qhoran,a,triarch,or,a,turtle
the,red,priest,chuckled
neither
qhoran,is,not,a,ruler,but,one,who,serves,and,counsels,such,and,helps,conduct,his,business
you,of,westeros,might,say,steward,or,magister
king’s,hand
that,amused,him
and,selaesori
moqorro,touched,his,nose
imbued,with,a,pleasant,aroma
fragrant,would,you,say
flowery
so,selaesori,qhoran,means,stinky,steward,more,or,less
fragrant,steward,rather
tyrion,gave,a,crooked,grin
i,believe,i,will,stay,with,stinky
but,i,do,thank,you,for,the,lesson
i,am,pleased,to,have,enlightened,you
perhaps,someday,you,will,let,me,teach,you,the,truth,of,r’hllor,as,well
someday
when,i,am,a,head,on,a,spike
the,quarters,he,shared,with,ser,jorah,were,a,cabin,only,by,courtesy,the,dank,dark,foul-smelling,closet,had,barely,enough,space,to,hang,a,pair,of,sleeping,hammocks,one,above,the,other
he,found,mormont,stretched,out,in,the,lower,one,swaying,slowly,with,the,motion,of,the,ship
the,girl,finally,poked,her,nose,abovedecks,tyrion,told,him
one,look,at,me,and,she,scurried,right,back,down,below
you’re,not,a,pretty,sight
not,all,of,us,can,be,as,comely,as,you
the,girl,is,lost
it,would,not,surprise,me,if,the,poor,creature,wasn’t,sneaking,up,to,jump,over,the,side,and,drown,herself
the,poor,creature’s,name,is,penny
i,know,her,name
he,hated,her,name
her,brother,had,gone,by,the,name,of,groat,though,his,true,name,had,been,oppo
groat,and,penny
the,smallest,coins,worth,the,least,and,what’s,worse,they,chose,the,names,themselves
it,left,a,bad,taste,in,tyrion’s,mouth
by,any,name,she,needs,a,friend
ser,jorah,sat,up,in,his,hammock
befriend,her,then
marry,her,for,all,i,care
that,left,a,bad,taste,in,his,mouth,as,well
like,with,like,is,that,your,notion
do,you,mean,to,find,a,she-bear,for,yourself,ser
you,were,the,one,who,insisted,that,we,bring,her
i,said,we,could,not,abandon,her,in,volantis
that,does,not,mean,i,want,to,fuck,her
she,wants,me,dead,have,you,forgotten
i’m,the,last,person,she’s,like,to,want,as,a,friend
you’re,both,dwarfs
yes,and,so,was,her,brother,who,was,killed,because,some,drunken,fools,took,him,for,me
feeling,guilty,are,you
no
tyrion,bristled
i,have,sins,enough,to,answer,for,i’ll,have,no,part,of,this,one
i,might,have,nurtured,some,ill,will,toward,her,and,her,brother,for,the,part,they,played,the,night,of,joffrey’s,wedding,but,i,never,wished,them,harm
you,are,a,harmless,creature,to,be,sure
innocent,as,a,lamb
ser,jorah,got,to,his,feet
the,dwarf,girl,is,your,burden
kiss,her,kill,her,or,avoid,her,as,you,like
it’s,naught,to,me
he,shouldered,past,tyrion,and,out,of,the,cabin
twice,exiled,and,small,wonder,tyrion,thought
i’d,exile,him,too,if,i,could
the,man,is,cold,brooding,sullen,deaf,to,humor
and,those,are,his,good,points
ser,jorah,spent,most,of,his,waking,hours,pacing,the,forecastle,or,leaning,on,the,rail,gazing,out,to,sea
looking,for,his,silver,queen
looking,for,daenerys,willing,the,ship,to,sail,faster
well,i,might,do,the,same,if,tysha,waited,in,meereen
could,slaver’s,bay,be,where,whores,went
it,seemed,unlikely
from,what,he’d,read,the,slaver,cities,were,the,place,where,whores,were,made
mormont,should,have,bought,one,for,himself
a,pretty,slave,girl,might,have,done,wonders,to,improve,his,temper,particularly,one,with,silvery,hair,like,the,whore,who,had,been,sitting,on,his,cock,back,in,selhorys
on,the,river,tyrion,had,to,endure,griff,but,there,had,at,least,been,the,mystery,of,the,captain’s,true,identity,to,divert,him,and,the,more,congenial,companionship,of,the,rest,of,the,poleboat’s,little,company
on,the,cog,alas,everyone,was,just,who,they,appeared,to,be,no,one,was,particularly,congenial,and,only,the,red,priest,was,interesting
him,and,maybe,penny
but,the,girl,hates,me,and,she,should
life,aboard,the,selaesori,qhoran,was,nothing,if,not,tedious,tyrion,had,found
the,most,exciting,part,of,his,day,was,pricking,his,toes,and,fingers,with,a,knife
on,the,river,there,had,been,wonders,to,behold,giant,turtles,ruined,cities,stone,men,naked,septas
one,never,knew,what,might,be,lurking,around,the,next,bend
the,days,and,nights,at,sea,were,all,the,same
leaving,volantis,the,cog,had,sailed,within,sight,of,land,at,first,so,tyrion,could,gaze,at,passing,headlands,watch,clouds,of,seabirds,rise,from,stony,cliffs,and,crumbling,watchtowers,count,bare,brown,islands,as,they,slipped,past
he,saw,many,other,ships,as,well,fishing,boats,lumbering,merchantmen,proud,galleys,with,their,oars,lashing,the,waves,into,white,foam
but,once,they,struck,out,into,deeper,waters,there,was,only,sea,and,sky,air,and,water
the,water,looked,like,water
the,sky,looked,like,sky
sometimes,there,was,a,cloud
too,much,blue
and,the,nights,were,worse
tyrion,slept,badly,at,the,best,of,times,and,this,was,far,from,that
sleep,meant,dreams,as,like,as,not,and,in,his,dreams,the,sorrows,waited,and,a,stony,king,with,his,father’s,face
that,left,him,with,the,beggar’s,choice,of,climbing,up,into,his,hammock,and,listening,to,jorah,mormont,snore,beneath,him,or,remaining,abovedecks,to,contemplate,the,sea
on,moonless,nights,the,water,was,as,black,as,maester’s,ink,from,horizon,to,horizon
dark,and,deep,and,forbidding,beautiful,in,a,chilly,sort,of,way,but,when,he,looked,at,it,too,long,tyrion,found,himself,musing,on,how,easy,it,would,be,to,slip,over,the,gunwale,and,drop,down,into,that,darkness
one,very,small,splash,and,the,pathetic,little,tale,that,was,his,life,would,soon,be,done
but,what,if,there,is,a,hell,and,my,father’s,waiting,for,me
the,best,part,of,each,evening,was,supper
the,food,was,not,especially,good,but,it,was,plentiful,so,that,was,where,the,dwarf,went,next
the,galley,where,he,took,his,meals,was,a,cramped,and,uncomfortable,space,with,a,ceiling,so,low,that,the,taller,passengers,were,always,in,danger,of,cracking,their,heads,a,hazard,the,strapping,slave,soldiers,of,the,fiery,hand,seemed,particularly,prone,to
as,much,as,tyrion,enjoyed,sniggering,at,that,he,had,come,to,prefer,taking,his,meals,alone
sitting,at,a,crowded,table,with,men,who,did,not,share,a,common,language,with,you,listening,to,them,talk,and,jape,whilst,understanding,none,of,it,had,quickly,grown,wearisome
particularly,since,he,always,found,himself,wondering,if,the,japes,and,laughter,were,directed,at,him
the,galley,was,also,where,the,ship’s,books,were,kept
her,captain,being,an,especially,bookish,man,she,carried,three,a,collection,of,nautical,poetry,that,went,from,bad,to,worse,a,well-thumbed,tome,about,the,erotic,adventures,of,a,young,slave,girl,in,a,lysene,pillow,house,and,the,fourth,and,final,volume,of,the,life,of,the,triarch,belicho,a,famous,volantene,patriot,whose,unbroken,succession,of,conquests,and,triumphs,ended,rather,abruptly,when,he,was,eaten,by,giants
tyrion,had,finished,them,all,by,their,third,day,at,sea
then,for,lack,of,any,other,books,he,started,reading,them,again
the,slave,girl’s,story,was,the,worst,written,but,the,most,engrossing,and,that,was,the,one,he,took,down,this,evening,to,see,him,through,a,supper,of,buttered,beets,cold,fish,stew,and,biscuits,that,could,have,been,used,to,drive,nails
he,was,reading,the,girl’s,account,of,the,day,she,and,her,sister,were,taken,by,slavers,when,penny,entered,the,galley
oh,she,said,i,thought,i,did,not,mean,to,disturb,m’lord,i,you,are,not,disturbing,me
you’re,not,going,to,try,to,kill,me,again,i,hope
no
she,looked,away,her,face,reddening
in,that,case,i,would,welcome,some,company
there’s,little,enough,aboard,this,ship
tyrion,closed,the,book
come
sit
eat
the,girl,had,left,most,of,her,meals,untouched,outside,her,cabin,door
by,now,she,must,be,starving
the,stew,is,almost,edible
the,fish,is,fresh,at,least
no,i,i,choked,on,a,fish,bone,once,i,can’t,eat,fish
have,some,wine,then
he,filled,a,cup,and,slid,it,toward,her
compliments,of,our,captain
closer,to,piss,than,arbor,gold,if,truth,be,told,but,even,piss,tastes,better,than,the,black,tar,rum,the,sailors,drink
it,might,help,you,sleep
the,girl,made,no,move,to,touch,the,cup
thank,you,m’lord,but,no
she,backed,away
i,should,not,be,bothering,you
do,you,mean,to,spend,your,whole,life,running,away
tyrion,asked,before,she,could,slip,back,out,the,door
that,stopped,her
her,cheeks,turned,a,bright,pink,and,he,was,afraid,she,was,about,to,start,weeping,again
instead,she,thrust,out,her,lip,defiantly,and,said,you’re,running,too
i,am,he,confessed,but,i,am,running,to,and,you,are,running,from,and,there’s,a,world,of,difference,there
we,would,never,have,had,to,run,at,all,but,for,you
it,took,some,courage,to,say,that,to,my,face
are,you,speaking,of,king’s,landing,or,volantis
both
tears,glistened,in,her,eyes
everything
why,couldn’t,you,just,come,joust,with,us,the,way,the,king,wanted
you,wouldn’t,have,gotten,hurt
what,would,that,have,cost,m’lord,to,climb,up,on,our,dog,and,ride,a,tilt,to,please,the,boy
it,was,just,a,bit,of,fun
they,would,have,laughed,at,you,that’s,all
they,would,have,laughed,at,me,said,tyrion
i,made,them,laugh,at,joff,instead
and,wasn’t,that,a,clever,ploy
my,brother,says,that,is,a,good,thing,making,people,laugh
a,noble,thing,and,honorable
my,brother,says,he,the,tears,fell,then,rolling,down,her,face
i,am,sorry,about,your,brother
tyrion,had,said,the,same,words,to,her,before,back,in,volantis,but,she,was,so,far,gone,in,grief,back,there,that,he,doubted,she,had,heard,them
she,heard,them,now
sorry
you,are,sorry
her,lip,was,trembling,her,cheeks,were,wet,her,eyes,were,red-rimmed,holes
we,left,king’s,landing,that,very,night
my,brother,said,it,was,for,the,best,before,someone,wondered,if,we’d,had,some,part,in,the,king’s,death,and,decided,to,torture,us,to,find,out
we,went,to,tyrosh,first
my,brother,thought,that,would,be,far,enough,but,it,wasn’t
we,knew,a,juggler,there
for,years,and,years,he,would,juggle,every,day,by,the,fountain,of,the,drunken,god
he,was,old,so,his,hands,were,not,as,deft,as,they,had,been,and,sometimes,he,would,drop,his,balls,and,chase,them,across,the,square,but,the,tyroshi,would,laugh,and,throw,him,coins,all,the,same
then,one,morning,we,heard,that,his,body,had,been,found,at,the,temple,of,trios
trios,has,three,heads,and,there’s,a,big,statue,of,him,beside,the,temple,doors
the,old,man,had,been,cut,into,three,parts,and,pushed,inside,the,threefold,mouths,of,trios
only,when,the,parts,were,sewn,back,together,his,head,was,gone
a,gift,for,my,sweet,sister
he,was,another,dwarf
a,little,man,aye
like,you,and,oppo
groat
are,you,sorry,about,the,juggler,too
i,never,knew,your,juggler,existed,until,this,very,moment,but,yes,i,am,sorry,he,is,dead
he,died,for,you
his,blood,is,on,your,hands
the,accusation,stung,coming,so,hard,on,the,heels,of,jorah,mormont’s,words
his,blood,is,on,my,sister’s,hands,and,the,hands,of,the,brutes,who,killed,him
my,hands,tyrion,turned,them,over,inspected,them,coiled,them,into,fists
my,hands,are,crusted,with,old,blood,aye
call,me,kinslayer,and,you,won’t,be,wrong
kingslayer,i’ll,answer,to,that,one,as,well
i,have,killed,mothers,fathers,nephews,lovers,men,and,women,kings,and,whores
a,singer,once,annoyed,me,so,i,had,the,bastard,stewed
but,i,have,never,killed,a,juggler,nor,a,dwarf,and,i,am,not,to,blame,for,what,happened,to,your,bloody,brother
penny,picked,the,cup,of,wine,he’d,poured,for,her,and,threw,it,in,his,face
just,like,my,sweet,sister
he,heard,the,galley,door,slam,but,never,saw,her,leave
his,eyes,were,stinging,and,the,world,was,a,blur
so,much,for,befriending,her
tyrion,lannister,had,scant,experience,with,other,dwarfs
his,lord,father,had,not,welcomed,any,reminders,of,his,son’s,deformities,and,such,mummers,as,featured,little,folk,in,their,troupes,soon,learned,to,stay,away,from,lannisport,and,casterly,rock,at,the,risk,of,his,displeasure
growing,up,tyrion,heard,reports,of,a,dwarf,jester,at,the,seat,of,the,dornish,lord,fowler,a,dwarf,maester,in,service,on,the,fingers,and,a,female,dwarf,amongst,the,silent,sisters,but,he,never,felt,the,least,need,to,seek,them,out
less,reliable,tales,also,reached,his,ears,of,a,dwarf,witch,who,haunted,a,hill,in,the,riverlands,and,a,dwarf,whore,in,king’s,landing,renowned,for,coupling,with,dogs
his,own,sweet,sister,had,told,him,of,the,last,even,offering,to,find,him,a,bitch,in,heat,if,he,cared,to,try,it,out
when,he,asked,politely,if,she,were,referring,to,herself,cersei,had,thrown,a,cup,of,wine,in,his,face
that,was,red,as,i,recall,and,this,is,gold
tyrion,mopped,at,his,face,with,a,sleeve
his,eyes,still,stung
he,did,not,see,penny,again,until,the,day,of,the,storm
the,salt,air,lay,still,and,heavy,that,morning,but,the,western,sky,was,a,fiery,red,streaked,with,lowering,clouds,that,glowed,as,bright,as,lannister,crimson
sailors,were,dashing,about,battening,hatches,running,lines,clearing,the,decks,lashing,down,everything,that,was,not,already,lashed,down
bad,wind,coming,one,warned,him
nonose,should,get,below
tyrion,remembered,the,storm,he’d,suffered,crossing,the,narrow,sea,the,way,the,deck,had,jumped,beneath,his,feet,the,hideous,creaking,sounds,the,ship,had,made,the,taste,of,wine,and,vomit
no-nose,will,stay,up,here
if,the,gods,wanted,him,he,would,sooner,die,by,drowning,than,choking,on,his,own,vomit
and,overhead,the,cog’s,canvas,sail,rippled,slowly,like,the,fur,of,some,great,beast,stirring,from,a,long,sleep,then,filled,with,a,sudden,crack,that,turned,every,head,on,the,ship
the,winds,drove,the,cog,before,them,far,off,her,chosen,course
behind,them,black,clouds,piled,one,atop,another,against,a,blood-red,sky
by,midmorning,they,could,see,lightning,flickering,to,the,west,followed,by,the,distant,crash,of,thunder
the,sea,grew,rougher,and,dark,waves,rose,up,to,smash,against,the,hull,of,the,stinky,steward
it,was,about,then,that,the,crew,started,hauling,down,the,canvas
tyrion,was,underfoot,amidships,so,he,climbed,the,forecastle,and,hunkered,down,savoring,the,lash,of,cold,rain,on,his,cheeks
the,cog,went,up,and,down,bucking,more,wildly,than,any,horse,he’d,ever,ridden,lifting,with,each,wave,before,sliding,down,into,the,troughs,between,jarring,him,to,the,bones
even,so,it,was,better,here,where,he,could,see,than,down,below,locked,in,some,airless,cabin
by,the,time,the,storm,broke,evening,was,upon,them,and,tyrion,lannister,was,soaked,through,to,the,smallclothes,yet,somehow,he,felt,elated,and,even,more,so,later,when,he,found,a,drunken,jorah,mormont,in,a,pool,of,vomit,in,their,cabin
the,dwarf,lingered,in,the,galley,after,supper,celebrating,his,survival,by,sharing,a,few,tots,of,black,tar,rum,with,the,ship’s,cook,a,great,greasy,loutish,volantene,who,spoke,only,one,word,of,the,common,tongue,fuck,but,played,a,ferocious,game,of,cyvasse,particularly,when,drunk
they,played,three,games,that,night
tyrion,won,the,first,then,lost,the,other,two
after,that,he,decided,that,he’d,had,enough,and,stumbled,back,up,on,deck,to,clear,his,head,of,rum,and,elephants,alike
he,found,penny,on,the,forecastle,where,he,had,so,often,found,ser,jorah,standing,by,the,rail,beside,the,cog’s,hideous,half-rotted,figurehead,and,gazing,out,across,the,inky,sea
from,behind,she,looked,as,small,and,vulnerable,as,a,child
tyrion,thought,it,best,to,leave,her,undisturbed,but,it,was,too,late
she,had,heard,him
hugor,hill
if,you,like
we,both,know,better
i,am,sorry,to,intrude,on,you
i,will,retire
no
her,face,was,pale,and,sad,but,she,did,not,look,to,have,been,crying
i’m,sorry,too
about,the,wine
it,wasn’t,you,who,killed,my,brother,or,that,poor,old,man,in,tyrosh
i,played,a,part,though,not,by,choice
i,miss,him,so,much
my,brother
i,i,understand
he,found,himself,thinking,of,jaime
count,yourself,lucky
your,brother,died,before,he,could,betray,you
i,thought,i,wanted,to,die,she,said,but,today,when,the,storm,came,and,i,thought,the,ship,would,sink,i,i,you,realized,that,you,wanted,to,live,after,all
i,have,been,there,too
something,else,we,have,in,common
her,teeth,were,crooked,which,made,her,shy,with,her,smiles,but,she,smiled,now
did,you,truly,cook,a,singer,in,a,stew
who,me
no
i,do,not,cook
when,penny,giggled,she,sounded,like,the,sweet,young,girl,she,was,seventeen,eighteen,no,more,than,nineteen
what,did,he,do,this,singer
he,wrote,a,song,about,me
for,she,was,his,secret,treasure,she,was,his,shame,and,his,bliss
and,a,chain,and,a,keep,are,nothing,compared,to,a,woman’s,kiss
it,was,queer,how,quick,the,words,came,back,to,him
perhaps,they,had,never,left,him
hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman’s,hands,are,warm
it,must,have,been,a,very,bad,song

i,always,rode,the,dog
we,performed,for,the,sealord,of,braavos,once,and,he,laughed,so,hard,that,afterward,he,gave,each,of,us,a,a,grand,gift

in,braavos
your,sister
the,girl,looked,lost

and,even,if,the,queen,should,laugh,where,will,i,go,afterward
we,never,stay,in,one,place,long
the,first,time,they,see,us,they,laugh,and,laugh,but,by,the,fourth,or,fifth,time,they,know,what,we’re,going,to,do,before,we,do,it
then,they,stop,laughing,so,we,have,to,go,somewhere,new
we,make,the,most,coin,in,the,big,cities,but,i,always,liked,the,little,towns,the,best
places,like,that,the,people,have,no,silver,but,they,feed,us,at,their,own,tables,and,the,children,follow,us,everywhere
that’s,because,they,have,never,seen,a,dwarf,before,in,their,wretched,pisspot,towns,tyrion,thought
the,bloody,brats,would,follow,around,a,two-headed,goat,if,one,turned,up
until,they,got,bored,with,its,bleating,and,slaughtered,it,for,supper
but,he,had,no,wish,to,make,her,weep,again,so,instead,he,said,daenerys,has,a,kind,heart,and,a,generous,nature
it,was,what,she,needed,to,hear
she,will,find,a,place,for,you,at,her,court,i,don’t,doubt
a,safe,place,beyond,my,sister’s,reach
penny,turned,back,to,him
and,you,will,be,there,too
unless,daenerys,decides,she,needs,some,lannister,blood,to,pay,for,the,targaryen,blood,my,brother,shed
i,will
after,that,the,dwarf,girl,was,seen,more,frequently,above,deck
the,next,day,tyrion,encountered,her,and,her,spotted,sow,amidships,in,midafternoon,when,the,air,was,warm,and,the,sea,calm
her,name,is,pretty,the,girl,told,him,shyly
pretty,the,pig,and,penny,the,girl,he,thought
someone,has,a,deal,to,answer,for
penny,gave,tyrion,some,acorns,and,he,let,pretty,eat,them,from,his,hand
do,not,think,i,don’t,see,what,you,are,doing,girl,he,thought,as,the,big,sow,snuffled,and,squealed
soon,they,began,to,take,their,meals,together
some,nights,it,was,just,the,two,of,them,at,other,meals,they,crowded,in,with,moqorro’s,guards
the,fingers,tyrion,called,them,they,were,men,of,the,fiery,hand,after,all,and,there,were,five,of,them
penny,laughed,at,that,a,sweet,sound,though,not,one,that,he,heard,often
her,wound,was,too,fresh,her,grief,too,deep
he,soon,had,her,calling,the,ship,the,stinky,steward,though,she,got,somewhat,wroth,with,him,whenever,he,called,pretty,bacon
to,atone,for,that,tyrion,made,an,attempt,to,teach,her,cyvasse,though,he,soon,realized,that,was,a,lost,cause
no,he,said,a,dozen,times,the,dragon,flies,not,the,elephants
that,same,night,she,came,right,out,and,asked,him,if,he,would,like,to,tilt,with,her
no,he,answered
only,later,did,it,occur,to,him,that,perhaps,tilt,did,not,mean,tilt
his,answer,would,still,have,been,no,but,he,might,not,have,been,so,brusque
back,in,the,cabin,he,shared,with,jorah,mormont,tyrion,twisted,in,his,hammock,for,hours,slipping,in,and,out,of,sleep
his,dreams,were,full,of,grey,stony,hands,reaching,for,him,from,out,of,the,fog,and,a,stair,that,led,up,to,his,father
finally,he,gave,it,up,and,made,his,way,up,top,for,a,breath,of,night,air
the,selaesori,qhoran,had,furled,her,big,striped,sail,for,the,night,and,her,decks,were,all,but,deserted
one,of,the,mates,was,on,the,sterncastle,and,amidships,moqorro,sat,by,his,brazier,where,a,few,small,flames,still,danced,amongst,the,embers
only,the,brightest,stars,were,visible,all,to,the,west
a,dull,red,glow,lit,the,sky,to,the,northeast,the,color,of,a,blood,bruise
tyrion,had,never,seen,a,bigger,moon
monstrous,swollen,it,looked,as,if,it,had,swallowed,the,sun,and,woken,with,a,fever
its,twin,floating,on,the,sea,beyond,the,ship,shimmered,red,with,every,wave
what,hour,is,this
he,asked,moqorro
that,cannot,be,sunrise,unless,the,east,has,moved
why,is,the,sky,red
the,sky,is,always,red,above,valyria,hugor,hill
a,cold,chill,went,down,his,back
are,we,close
closer,than,the,crew,would,like,moqorro,said,in,his,deep,voice
do,you,know,the,stories,in,your,sunset,kingdoms
i,know,some,sailors,say,that,any,man,who,lays,eyes,upon,that,coast,is,doomed
he,did,not,believe,such,tales,himself,no,more,than,his,uncle,had
gerion,lannister,had,set,sail,for,valyria,when,tyrion,was,eighteen,intent,on,recovering,the,lost,ancestral,blade,of,house,lannister,and,any,other,treasures,that,might,have,survived,the,doom
tyrion,had,wanted,desperately,to,go,with,them,but,his,lord,father,had,dubbed,the,voyage,a,fool’s,quest,and,forbidden,him,to,take,part
and,perhaps,he,was,not,so,wrong
almost,a,decade,had,passed,since,the,laughing,lion,headed,out,from,lannisport,and,gerion,had,never,returned
the,men,lord,tywin,sent,to,seek,after,him,had,traced,his,course,as,far,as,volantis,where,half,his,crew,had,deserted,him,and,he,had,bought,slaves,to,replace,them
no,free,man,would,willingly,sign,aboard,a,ship,whose,captain,spoke,openly,of,his,intent,to,sail,into,the,smoking,sea
so,those,are,fires,of,the,fourteen,flames,we’re,seeing,reflected,on,the,clouds
fourteen,or,fourteen,thousand
what,man,dares,count,them
it,is,not,wise,for,mortals,to,look,too,deeply,at,those,fires,my,friend
those,are,the,fires,of,god’s,own,wrath,and,no,human,flame,can,match,them
we,are,small,creatures,men
some,smaller,than,others

griff,with,his,young,prince
could,all,that,talk,of,the,golden,company,sailing,west,have,been,a,feint

it,seemed,to,him,that,the,prophecy,that,drove,the,red,priests,had,room,for,just,one,hero
a,second,targaryen,would,only,serve,to,confuse,them
have,you,seen,these,others,in,your,fires

their,small,black,eyes,were,full,of,secrets,and,they,would,caw,at,him,and,peck,his,skin,when,they,heard,the,songs

after,the,bone-grinding,cold,of,the,lands,beyond,the,wall,the,caves,were,blessedly,warm,and,when,the,chill,crept,out,of,the,rock,the,singers,would,light,fires,to,drive,it,off,again
down,here,there,was,no,wind,no,snow,no,ice,no,dead,things,reaching,out,to,grab,you,only,dreams,and,rushlight,and,the,kisses,of,the,ravens

the,last,greenseer,the,singers,called,him,but,in,bran’s,dreams,he,was,still,a,three-eyed,crow
when,meera,reed,had,asked,him,his,true,name,he,made,a,ghastly,sound,that,might,have,been,a,chuckle
i,wore,many,names,when,i,was,quick,but,even,i,once,had,a,mother,and,the,name,she,gave,me,at,her,breast,was,brynden

one,day,you,will,know
what,will,i,know
bran,asked,the,reeds,afterward,when,they,came,with,torches,burning,brightly,in,their,hand,to,carry,him,back,to,a,small,chamber,off,the,big,cavern,where,the,singers,had,made,beds,for,them,to,sleep

the,secrets,of,the,old,gods,said,jojen,reed

changing,his,own,skin,for,a,raven’s,night-black,feathers,had,been,harder,but,not,as,hard,as,he,had,feared,not,with,these,ravens
a,wild,stallion,will,buck,and,kick,when,a,man,tries,to,mount,him,and,try,to,bite,the,hand,that,slips,the,bit,between,his,teeth,lord,brynden,said,but,a,horse,that,has,known,one,rider,will,accept,another
young,or,old,these,birds,have,all,been,ridden
choose,one,now,and,fly
he,chose,one,bird,and,then,another,without,success,but,the,third,raven,looked,at,him,with,shrewd,black,eyes,tilted,its,head,and,gave,a,quork,and,quick,as,that,he,was,not,a,boy,looking,at,a,raven,but,a,raven,looking,at,a,boy
the,song,of,the,river,suddenly,grew,louder,the,torches,burned,a,little,brighter,than,before,and,the,air,was,full,of,strange,smells
when,he,tried,to,speak,it,came,out,in,a,scream,and,his,first,flight,ended,when,he,crashed,into,a,wall,and,ended,back,inside,his,own,broken,body
the,raven,was,unhurt
it,flew,to,him,and,landed,on,his,arm,and,bran,stroked,its,feathers,and,slipped,inside,of,it,again

then,he,realized,he,was,not,alone
someone,else,was,in,the,raven,he,told,lord,brynden,once,he,had,returned,to,his,own,skin
some,girl
i,felt,her
a,woman,of,those,who,sing,the,song,of,earth,his,teacher,said
long,dead,yet,a,part,of,her,remains,just,as,a,part,of,you,would,remain,in,summer,if,your,boy’s,flesh,were,to,die,upon,the,morrow
a,shadow,on,the,soul
she,will,not,harm,you
do,all,the,birds,have,singers,in,them
all,lord,brynden,said
it,was,the,singers,who,taught,the,first,men,to,send,messages,by,raven,but,in,those,days,the,birds,would,speak,the,words
the,trees,remember,but,men,forget,and,so,now,they,write,the,messages,on,parchment,and,tie,them,round,the,feet,of,birds,who,have,never,shared,their,skin
old,nan,had,told,him,the,same,story,once,bran,remembered,but,when,he,asked,robb,if,it,was,true,his,brother,laughed,and,asked,him,if,he,believed,in,grumkins,too
he,wished,robb,were,with,them,now
i’d,tell,him,i,could,fly,but,he,wouldn’t,believe,so,i’d,have,to,show,him
i,bet,that,he,could,learn,to,fly,too,him,and,arya,and,sansa,even,baby,rickon,and,jon,snow

that,was,just,another,silly,dream,though
some,days,bran,wondered,if,all,of,this,wasn’t,just,some,dream
maybe,he,had,fallen,asleep,out,in,the,snows,and,dreamed,himself,a,safe,warm,place
you,have,to,wake,he,would,tell,himself,you,have,to,wake,right,now,or,you’ll,go,dreaming,into,death
once,or,twice,he,pinched,his,arm,with,his,fingers,really,hard,but,the,only,thing,that,did,was,make,his,arm,hurt
in,the,beginning,he,had,tried,to,count,the,days,by,making,note,of,when,he,woke,and,slept,but,down,here,sleeping,and,waking,had,a,way,of,melting,into,one,another

only,one,man,in,a,thousand,is,born,a,skinchanger,lord,brynden,said,one,day,after,bran,had,learned,to,fly,and,only,one,skinchanger,in,a,thousand,can,be,a,greenseer
i,thought,the,greenseers,were,the,wizards,of,the,children,bran,said
the,singers,i,mean

the,big,stableboy,no,longer,fought,him,as,he,had,the,first,time,back,in,the,lake,tower,during,the,storm
like,a,dog,who,has,had,all,the,fight,whipped,out,of,him,hodor,would,curl,up,and,hide,whenever,bran,reached,out,for,him

he,often,tagged,along,whether,he,was,wanted,or,not
in,the,end,the,reeds,were,glad,he,came

then,there,came,a,brown-haired,girl,slender,as,a,spear,who,stood,on,the,tips,of,her,toes,to,kiss,the,lips,of,a,young,knight,as,tall,as,hodor
a,dark-eyed,youth,pale,and,fierce,sliced,three,branches,off,the,weirwood,and,shaped,them,into,arrows

he,looked,to,right,and,left,gave,satin,and,horse,a,nod,watched,them,pass,it,on,to,the,men,beyond
they,rushed,the,grove,together,kicking,through,drifts,of,old,snow,with,no,sound,but,their,breathing
ghost,ran,with,them,a,white,shadow,at,jon’s,side
the,weirwoods,rose,in,a,circle,around,the,edges,of,the,clearing
there,were,nine,all,roughly,of,the,same,age,and,size

even,then,it,had,more,life,than,the,wildlings,huddled,near,it
only,one,of,them,reacted,when,jon,stepped,from,the,brush
that,was,the,child,who,began,to,wail,clutching,at,his,mother’s,ragged,cloak

the,giant,was,the,last,to,notice,them
he,had,been,asleep,curled,up,by,the,fire,but,something,woke,him,the,child’s,cry,the,sound,of,snow,crunching,beneath,black,boots,a,sudden,indrawn,breath
when,he,stirred,it,was,as,if,a,boulder,had,come,to,life
he,heaved,himself,into,a,sitting,position,with,a,snort,pawing,at,his,eyes,with,hands,as,big,as,hams,to,rub,the,sleep,away,until,he,saw,iron,emmett,his,sword,shining,in,his,hand

the,moment,jon,set,the,letter,aside,the,parchment,curled,up,again,as,if,eager,to,protect,its,secrets

it,was,painful,just,to,think,of,it,much,less,say,the,words,aloud

half,the,umbers,would,be,across,the,field,with,whoresbane,fighting,beneath,the,flayed,man,of,the,dreadfort,and,the,greater,part,of,the,strength,of,both,houses,had,gone,south,with,robb,never,to,return

how,would,she,do,that

what,if,bolton,never,had,his,sister
this,wedding,could,well,be,just,some,ruse,to,lure,stannis,into,a,trap
eddard,stark,had,never,had,any,reason,to,complain,of,the,lord,of,the,dreadfort,so,far,as,jon,knew,but,even,so,he,had,never,trusted,him,with,his,whispery,voice,and,his,pale,pale,eyes

he,might,have,done,better,to,strike,down,mance,the,moment,he,revealed,himself
jon,had,a,certain,grudging,admiration,for,the,late,king-beyond-the-wall,but,the,man,was,an,oathbreaker,and,a,turncloak
he,had,even,less,trust,in,melisandre

but,if,anyone,spoke,of,him,now,it,was,as,theon,turncloak,and,the,tales,they,told,were,of,his,treachery
this,was,never,my,home
i,was,a,hostage,here
lord,stark,had,not,treated,him,cruelly,but,the,long,steel,shadow,of,his,greatsword,had,always,been,between,them
he,was,kind,to,me,but,never,warm
he,knew,that,one,day,he,might,need,to,put,me,to,death
theon,kept,his,eyes,downcast,as,he,crossed,the,yard,weaving,between,the,tents
i,learned,to,fight,in,this,yard,he,thought,remembering,warm,summer,days,spent,sparring,with,robb,and,jon,snow,under,the,watchful,eyes,of,old,ser,rodrik
that,was,back,when,he,was,whole,when,he,could,grasp,a,sword,hilt,as,well,as,any,man
but,the,yard,held,darker,memories,as,well
this,was,where,he,had,assembled,stark’s,people,the,night,bran,and,rickon,fled,the,castle
ramsay,was,reek,then,standing,at,his,side,whispering,that,he,should,flay,a,few,of,his,captives,to,make,them,tell,him,where,the,boys,had,gone
there,will,be,no,flaying,here,whilst,i,am,prince,of,winterfell,theon,had,responded,little,dreaming,how,short,his,rule,would,prove
none,of,them,would,help,me
i,had,known,them,all,for,half,my,life,and,not,one,of,them,would,help,me
even,so,he,had,done,his,best,to,protect,them,but,once,ramsay,put,reek’s,face,aside,he’d,slain,all,the,men,and,theon’s,ironborn,as,well
he,set,my,horse,afire
that,was,the,last,sight,he,had,seen,the,day,the,castle,fell,smiler,burning,the,flames,leaping,from,his,mane,as,he,reared,up,kicking,screaming,his,eyes,white,with,terror
here,in,this,very,yard
the,doors,of,the,great,hall,loomed,up,in,front,of,him,new-made,to,replace,the,doors,that,burned,they,seemed,crude,and,ugly,to,him,raw,planks,hastily,joined
a,pair,of,spearmen,guarded,them,hunched,and,shivering,under,thick,fur,cloaks,their,beards,crusty,with,ice
they,eyed,theon,resentfully,as,he,hobbled,up,the,steps,pushed,against,the,righthand,door,and,slipped,inside
the,hall,was,blessedly,warm,and,bright,with,torchlight,as,crowded,as,he,had,ever,seen,it
theon,let,the,heat,wash,over,him,then,made,his,way,toward,the,front,of,the,hall
men,sat,crammed,knee,to,knee,along,the,benches,so,tightly,packed,that,the,servers,had,to,squirm,between,them

in,truth,he’s,more,a,pander
lord,manderly,had,brought,musicians,from,white,harbor,but,none,were,singers,so,when,abel,turned,up,at,the,gates,with,a,lute,and,six,women,he,had,been,made,welcome

even,the,roof,was,wrong,its,raw,new,timbers,light,and,bright,where,the,old,rafters,had,been,stained,almost,black,by,centuries,of,smoke
the,largest,banners,were,behind,the,dais,where,the,direwolf,of,winterfell,and,the,flayed,man,of,the,dreadfort,hung,back,of,the,bride,and,groom

even,here,in,this,half-frozen,lichyard,of,a,castle,surrounded,by,snow,and,ice,and,death,there,were,women
washerwomen
that,was,the,polite,way,of,saying,camp,follower,which,was,the,polite,way,of,saying,whore
where,they,came,from,theon,could,not,say
they,just,seemed,to,appear,like,maggots,on,a,corpse,or,ravens,after,a,battle
every,army,drew,them
some,were,hardened,whores,who,could,fuck,twenty,men,in,a,night,and,drink,them,all,blind
others,looked,as,innocent,as,maids,but,that,was,just,a,trick,of,their,trade
some,were,camp,brides,bound,to,the,soldiers,they,followed,with,words,whispered,to,one,god,or,another,but,doomed,to,be,forgotten,once,the,war,was,done
they,would,warm,a,man’s,bed,by,night,patch,the,holes,in,his,boots,at,morning,cook,his,supper,come,dusk,and,loot,his,corpse,after,the,battle
some,even,did,a,bit,of,washing

and,even,such,as,these,made,mock,of,theon,turncloak

if,i,were,queen,the,first,thing,i,would,do,would,be,to,kill,all,those,grey,rats
they,scurry,everywhere,living,on,the,leavings,of,the,lords,chittering,to,one,another,whispering,in,the,ears,of,their,masters
but,who,are,the,masters,and,who,are,the,servants,truly
every,great,lord,has,his,maester,every,lesser,lord,aspires,to,one
if,you,do,not,have,a,maester,it,is,taken,to,mean,that,you,are,of,little,consequence
the,grey,rats,read,and,write,our,letters,even,for,such,lords,as,cannot,read,themselves,and,who,can,say,for,a,certainty,that,they,are,not,twisting,the,words,for,their,own,ends

when,they,fail,they,console,us,in,our,grief,and,we,are,grateful,for,that,as,well
out,of,gratitude,we,give,them,a,place,beneath,our,roof,and,make,them,privy,to,all,our,shames,and,secrets,a,part,of,every,council

that,way,we,cannot,know,who,they,truly,are,or,where,they,come,from,but,if,you,are,dogged,enough,you,can,still,find,out

areo,hotah,knew,better
her,soft,pale,hands,were,as,deadly,as,obara’s,callused,ones,if,not,more,so

i,am,glad,that,i,lived,long,enough,to,taste,it
at,long,last,the,lannisters,have,proved,the,truth,of,their,boast,and,paid,this,old,blood,debt
the,prince,left,it,to,ricasso,his,blind,seneschal,to,rise,and,propose,the,toast

the,wine,was,dornish,strongwine,dark,as,blood,and,sweet,as,vengeance
the,captain,did,not,drink,of,it

nor,did,the,prince,himself,partake
he,had,his,own,wine,prepared,by,maester,myles,and,well,laced,with,poppy,juice,to,ease,the,agony,in,his,swollen,joints
the,white,knight,did,drink,as,was,only,courteous
his,companions,likewise
so,did,the,princess,arianne,lady,jordayne,the,lord,of,godsgrace,the,knight,of,lemonwood,the,lady,of,ghost,hill,even,ellaria,sand,prince,oberyn’s,beloved,paramour,who,had,been,with,him,in,king’s,landing,when,he,died

dorne,was,an,angry,and,divided,land,and,prince,doran’s,hold,on,it,was,not,as,firm,as,it,might,be
many,of,his,own,lords,thought,him,weak,and,would,have,welcomed,open,war,with,the,lannisters,and,the,boy,king,on,the,iron,throne
chief,amongst,those,were,the,sand,snakes,the,bastard,daughters,of,the,prince’s,late,brother,oberyn,the,red,viper,three,of,whom,were,at,the,feast
doran,martell,was,the,wisest,of,princes,and,it,was,not,the,place,of,his,captain,of,guards,to,question,his,decisions,but,areo,hotah,did,wonder,why,he,had,chosen,to,release,the,ladies,obara,nymeria,and,tyene,from,their,lonely,cells,in,the,spear,tower
tyene,declined,ricasso’s,toast,with,a,murmur,and,lady,nym,with,a,flick,of,a,hand
obara,let,them,fill,her,cup,to,the,brim,then,upended,it,to,spill,the,red,wine,on,the,floor
when,a,serving,girl,knelt,to,wipe,up,the,spilled,wine,obara,left,the,hall
after,a,moment,princess,arianne,excused,herself,and,went,after,her
obara,would,never,turn,her,rage,on,the,little,princess,hotah,knew
they,are,cousins,and,she,loves,her,well
the,feast,continued,late,into,the,night,presided,over,by,the,grinning,skull,on,its,pillar,of,black,marble
seven,courses,were,served,in,honor,of,the,seven,gods,and,the,seven,brothers,of,the,kingsguard
the,soup,was,made,with,eggs,and,lemons,the,long,green,peppers,stuffed,with,cheese,and,onions
there,were,lamprey,pies,capons,glazed,with,honey,a,whiskerfish,from,the,bottom,of,the,greenblood,that,was,so,big,it,took,four,serving,men,to,carry,it,to,table
after,that,came,a,savory,snake,stew,chunks,of,seven,different,sorts,of,snake,slow-simmered,with,dragon,peppers,and,blood,oranges,and,a,dash,of,venom,to,give,it,a,good,bite
the,stew,was,fiery,hot,hotah,knew,though,he,tasted,none,of,it

for,the,sweet,each,guest,was,served,a,skull,of,spun,sugar
when,the,crust,was,broken,they,found,sweet,custard,inside,and,bits,of,plum,and,cherry
princess,arianne,returned,in,time,for,the,stuffed,peppers
my,little,princess,hotah,thought,but,arianne,was,a,woman,now
the,scarlet,silks,she,wore,left,no,doubt,of,that
of,late,she,had,changed,in,other,ways,as,well
her,plot,to,crown,myrcella,had,been,betrayed,and,smashed,her,white,knight,had,perished,bloodily,at,hotah’s,hand,and,she,herself,had,been,confined,to,the,spear,tower,condemned,to,solitude,and,silence
all,of,that,had,chastened,her
there,was,something,else,as,well,though,some,secret,her,father,had,confided,in,her,before,releasing,her,from,her,confinement
what,that,was,the,captain,did,not,know
the,prince,had,placed,his,daughter,between,himself,and,the,white,knight,a,place,of,high,honor
arianne,smiled,as,she,slipped,into,her,seat,again,and,murmured,something,in,ser,balon’s,ear
the,knight,did,not,choose,to,respond
he,ate,little,hotah,observed,a,spoon,of,soup,a,bite,of,the,pepper,the,leg,off,a,capon,some,fish
he,shunned,the,lamprey,pie,and,tried,only,one,small,spoonful,of,the,stew
even,that,made,his,brow,break,out,in,sweat
hotah,could,sympathize
when,first,he,came,to,dorne,the,fiery,food,would,tie,his,bowels,in,knots,and,burn,his,tongue
that,was,years,ago,however,now,his,hair,was,white,and,he,could,eat,anything,a,dornishman,could,eat
when,the,spun-sugar,skulls,were,served,ser,balon’s,mouth,grew,tight,and,he,gave,the,prince,a,lingering,look,to,see,if,he,was,being,mocked
doran,martell,took,no,notice,but,his,daughter,did
it,is,the,cook’s,little,jape,ser,balon,said,arianne
even,death,is,not,sacred,to,a,dornishmen
you,won’t,be,cross,with,us,i,pray
she,brushed,the,back,of,the,white,knight’s,hand,with,her,fingers
i,hope,you,have,enjoyed,your,time,in,dorne
everyone,has,been,most,hospitable,my,lady
arianne,touched,the,pin,that,clasped,his,cloak,with,its,quarreling,swans
i,have,always,been,fond,of,swans
no,other,bird,is,half,so,beautiful,this,side,of,the,summer,isles
your,peacocks,might,dispute,that,said,ser,balon
they,might,said,arianne,but,peacocks,are,vain,proud,creatures,strutting,about,in,all,those,gaudy,colors
give,me,a,swan,serene,in,white,or,beautiful,in,black
ser,balon,gave,a,nod,and,sipped,his,wine
this,one,is,not,so,easily,seduced,as,was,his,sworn,brother,hotah,thought
ser,arys,was,a,boy,despite,his,years
this,one,is,a,man,and,wary
the,captain,had,only,to,look,at,him,to,see,that,the,white,knight,was,ill,at,ease
this,place,is,strange,to,him,and,little,to,his,liking
hotah,could,understand,that
dorne,had,seemed,a,queer,place,to,him,as,well,when,first,he,came,here,with,his,own,princess,many,years,ago
the,bearded,priests,had,drilled,him,on,the,common,speech,of,westeros,before,they,sent,him,forth,but,the,dornishmen,all,spoke,too,quickly,for,him,to,understand
dornish,women,were,lewd,dornish,wine,was,sour,and,dornish,food,was,full,of,queer,hot,spices
and,the,dornish,sun,was,hotter,than,the,pale,wan,sun,of,norvos,glaring,down,from,a,blue,sky,day,after,day
ser,balon’s,journey,had,been,shorter,but,troubling,in,its,own,way,the,captain,knew
three,knights,eight,squires,twenty,men-at-arms,and,sundry,grooms,and,servants,had,accompanied,him,from,king’s,landing,but,once,they,crossed,the,mountains,into,dorne,their,progress,had,been,slowed,by,a,round,of,feasts,hunts,and,celebrations,at,every,castle,that,they,chanced,to,pass
and,now,that,they,had,reached,sunspear,neither,princess,myrcella,nor,ser,arys,oakheart,was,on,hand,to,greet,them
the,white,knight,knows,that,something,is,amiss,hotah,could,tell,but,it,is,more,than,that
perhaps,the,presence,of,the,sand,snakes,unnerved,him
if,so,obara’s,return,to,the,hall,must,have,been,vinegar,in,the,wound
she,slipped,back,into,her,place,without,a,word,and,sat,there,sullen,and,scowling,neither,smiling,nor,speaking
midnight,was,close,at,hand,when,prince,doran,turned,to,the,white,knight,and,said,ser,balon,i,have,read,the,letter,that,you,brought,me,from,our,gracious,queen
might,i,assume,that,you,are,familiar,with,its,contents,ser
hotah,saw,the,knight,tense
i,am,my,lord
her,grace,informed,me,that,i,might,be,called,upon,to,escort,her,daughter,back,to,king’s,landing
king,tommen,has,been,pining,for,his,sister,and,would,like,princess,myrcella,to,return,to,court,for,a,short,visit
princess,arianne,made,a,sad,face
oh,but,we,have,all,grown,so,fond,of,myrcella,ser
she,and,my,brother,trystane,have,become,inseparable
prince,trystane,would,be,welcome,in,king’s,landing,as,well,said,balon,swann
king,tommen,would,wish,to,meet,him,i,am,sure
his,grace,has,so,few,companions,near,his,own,age
the,bonds,formed,in,boyhood,can,last,a,man,for,life,said,prince,doran
when,trystane,and,myrcella,wed,he,and,tommen,will,be,as,brothers
queen,cersei,has,the,right,of,it
the,boys,should,meet,become,friends
dorne,will,miss,him,to,be,sure,but,it,is,past,time,trystane,saw,something,of,the,world,beyond,the,walls,of,sunspear
i,know,king’s,landing,will,welcome,him,most,warmly
why,is,he,sweating,now
the,captain,wondered,watching
the,hall,is,cool,enough,and,he,never,touched,the,stew
as,for,the,other,matter,that,queen,cersei,raises,prince,doran,was,saying,it,is,true,dorne’s,seat,upon,the,small,council,has,been,vacant,since,my,brother’s,death,and,it,is,past,time,that,it,was,filled,again
i,am,flattered,that,her,grace,feels,my,counsel,might,be,of,use,to,her,though,i,wonder,if,i,have,the,strength,for,such,a,journey
perhaps,if,we,went,by,sea
by,ship

one,of,my,ancestors,had,them,built,to,please,his,targaryen,bride,and,free,her,from,the,dust,and,heat,of,sunspear
daenerys,was,her,name
she,was,sister,to,king,daeron,the,good,and,it,was,her,marriage,that,made,dorne,part,of,the,seven,kingdoms
the,whole,realm,knew,that,the,girl,loved,daeron’s,bastard,brother,daemon,blackfyre,and,was,loved,by,him,in,turn,but,the,king,was,wise,enough,to,see,that,the,good,of,thousands,must,come,before,the,desires,of,two,even,if,those,two,were,dear,to,him
it,was,daenerys,who,filled,the,gardens,with,laughing,children
her,own,children,at,the,start,but,later,the,sons,and,daughters,of,lords,and,landed,knights,were,brought,in,to,be,companions,to,the,boys,and,girls,of,princely,blood
and,one,summer’s,day,when,it,was,scorching,hot,she,took,pity,on,the,children,of,her,grooms,and,cooks,and,serving,men,and,invited,them,to,use,the,pools,and,fountains,too,a,tradition,that,has,endured,till,this,day

we,could,kill,him,to,be,sure,said,tyene,but,then,we,would,need,to,kill,the,rest,of,his,party,too,even,those,sweet,young,squires
that,would,be,oh,so,messy
prince,doran,shut,his,eyes,and,opened,them,again
hotah,could,see,his,leg,trembling,underneath,the,blanket
if,you,were,not,my,brother’s,daughters,i,would,send,the,three,of,you,back,to,your,cells,and,keep,you,there,until,your,bones,were,grey

areo,hotah,remained,as,well,as,was,his,place
they,are,their,father’s,daughters,the,prince,said
the,little,princess,smiled

no,word,as,to,who,they,are,or,where,they,might,be,bound
there,was,talk,of,elephants
no,dragons
elephants
easy,enough,to,hide,a,young,dragon,in,a,big,cog’s,hold,though
daenerys,is,most,vulnerable,at,sea
if,i,were,her,i,would,keep,myself,and,my,intentions,hidden,as,long,as,i,could,so,i,might,take,king’s,landing,unawares
do,you,think,that,quentyn,will,be,with,them
he,could,be
or,not
we,will,know,by,where,they,land,if,westeros,is,indeed,their,destination
quentyn,will,bring,her,up,the,greenblood,if,he,can
but,it,does,no,good,to,speak,of,it
kiss,me
we,leave,for,the,water,gardens,at,first,light

it,was,a,feeble,sort,of,evasion,a,sad,rag,wrapped,around,his,wounded,word
his,father,would,never,have,approved
i,am,the,sword,that,guards,the,realm,of,men,jon,reminded,himself,and,in,the,end,that,must,be,worth,more,than,one,man’s,honor
the,road,beneath,the,wall,was,as,dark,and,cold,as,the,belly,of,an,ice,dragon,and,as,twisty,as,a,serpent

spearmen,at,each,gate,knuckled,their,foreheads,at,jon,snow,but,stared,openly,at,val,and,her,garron
when,they,emerged,north,of,the,wall,through,a,thick,door,made,of,freshly,hewn,green,wood,the,wildling,princess,paused,for,a,moment,to,gaze,out,across,the,snow-covered,field,where,king,stannis,had,won,his,battle
beyond,the,haunted,forest,waited,dark,and,silent
the,light,of,the,half-moon,turned,val’s,honey-blond,hair,a,pale,silver,and,left,her,cheeks,as,white,as,snow

cold
val,laughed,lightly
no
when,it,is,cold,it,will,hurt,to,breathe
when,the,others,come,the,thought,was,a,disquieting,one
six,of,the,rangers,jon,had,sent,out,were,still,missing
it,is,too,soon
they,may,yet,be,back
but,another,part,of,him,insisted,they,are,dead,every,man,of,them
you,sent,them,out,to,die,and,you,are,doing,the,same,to,val
tell,tormund,what,i’ve,said
he,may,not,heed,your,words,but,he,will,hear,them
val,kissed,him,lightly,on,the,cheek
you,have,my,thanks,lord,snow
for,the,half-blind,horse,the,salt,cod,the,free,air
for,hope
their,breath,mingled,a,white,mist,in,the,air

you,have,my,word
i,did,not,kill,him
though,i,might,have,if,things,had,gone,otherwise
this,is,farewell,then,she,said,almost,playfully
jon,snow,was,in,no,mood,for,it
it,is,too,cold,and,dark,to,play,and,the,hour,is,too,late
only,for,a,time
you,will,return
for,the,boy,if,for,no,other,reason
craster’s,son
val,shrugged
he,is,no,kin,to,me
i,have,heard,you,singing,to,him
i,was,singing,to,myself

a,faint,smile,brushed,her,lips
it,makes,him,laugh
oh,very,well
he,is,a,sweet,little,monster
monster

for,his,mother’s,sake,and,mine
and,keep,him,away,from,the,red,woman
she,knows,who,he,is
she,sees,things,in,her,fires
arya,he,thought,hoping,it,was,so
ashes,and,cinders
kings,and,dragons
dragons,again
for,a,moment,jon,could,almost,see,them,too,coiling,in,the,night,their,dark,wings,outlined,against,a,sea,of,flame
if,she,knew,she,would,have,taken,the,boy,away,from,us
dalla’s,boy,not,your,monster
a,word,in,the,king’s,ear,would,have,been,the,end,of,it
and,of,me

why,let,it,happen,if,she,knew
because,it,suited,her
fire,is,a,fickle,thing
no,one,knows,which,way,a,flame,will,go
val,put,a,foot,into,a,stirrup,swung,her,leg,over,her,horse’s,back,and,looked,down,from,the,saddle
do,you,remember,what,my,sister,told,you
yes
a,sword,without,a,hilt,with,no,safe,way,to,hold,it
but,melisandre,had,the,right,of,it
even,a,sword,without,a,hilt,is,better,than,an,empty,hand,when,foes,are,all,around,you
good
val,wheeled,the,garron,toward,the,north
the,first,night,of,the,full,moon,then
jon,watched,her,ride,away,wondering,if,he,would,ever,see,her,face,again
i,am,no,southron,lady,he,could,hear,her,say,but,a,woman,of,the,free,folk
i,don’t,care,what,she,says,muttered,dolorous,edd,as,val,vanished,behind,a,stand,of,soldier,pines
the,air,is,so,cold,it,hurts,to,breathe
i,would,stop,but,that,would,hurt,worse
he,rubbed,his,hands,together
this,is,going,to,end,badly
you,say,that,of,everything
aye,m’lord
usually,i’m,right
mully,cleared,his,throat
m’lord
the,wildling,princess,letting,her,go,the,men,may,say,that,i,am,half,a,wildling,myself,a,turncloak,who,means,to,sell,the,realm,to,our,raiders,cannibals,and,giants
jon,did,not,need,to,stare,into,a,fire,to,know,what,was,being,said,of,him
the,worst,part,was,they,were,not,wrong,not,wholly
words,are,wind,and,the,wind,is,always,blowing,at,the,wall

it,was,still,dark,when,jon,returned,to,his,chambers,behind,the,armory
ghost,was,not,yet,back,he,saw
still,hunting
the,big,white,direwolf,was,gone,more,oft,than,not,of,late,ranging,farther,and,farther,in,search,of,prey
between,the,men,of,the,watch,and,the,wildlings,down,in,mole’s,town,the,hills,and,fields,near,castle,black,had,been,hunted,clean,and,there,had,been,little,enough,game,to,begin,with
winter,is,coming,jon,reflected
and,soon,too,soon
he,wondered,if,they,would,ever,see,a,spring
dolorous,edd,made,the,trek,to,the,kitchens,and,soon,was,back,with,a,tankard,of,brown,ale,and,a,covered,platter
under,the,lid,jon,discovered,three,duck’s,eggs,fried,in,drippings,a,strip,of,bacon,two,sausages,a,blood,pudding,and,half,a,loaf,of,bread,still,warm,from,the,oven
he,ate,the,bread,and,half,an,egg
he,would,have,eaten,the,bacon,too,but,the,raven,made,off,with,it,before,he,had,the,chance
thief,jon,said,as,the,bird,flapped,up,to,the,lintel,above,the,door,to,devour,its,prize
thief,the,raven,agreed
jon,tried,a,bite,of,sausage
he,was,washing,the,taste,from,his,mouth,with,a,sip,of,ale,when,edd,returned,to,tell,him,bowen,marsh,was,without
othell’s,with,him,and,septon,cellador
that,was,quick
he,wondered,who,was,telling,tales,and,if,there,was,more,than,one
send,them,in
aye,m’lord
you’ll,want,to,watch,your,sausages,with,this,lot,though
they,have,a,hungry,look,about,them
hungry,was,not,the,word,jon,would,have,used
septon,cellador,appeared,confused,and,groggy,and,in,dire,need,of,some,scales,from,the,dragon,that,had,flamed,him,whilst,first,builder,othell,yarwyck,looked,as,if,he,had,swallowed,something,he,could,not,quite,digest
bowen,marsh,was,angry

that,red,is,not,from,cold
please,sit,he,said
may,i,offer,you,food,or,drink
we,broke,our,fast,in,the,commons,said,marsh
i,could,do,with,more
yarwyck,eased,himself,down,onto,a,chair
good,of,you,to,offer
perhaps,some,wine
said,septon,cellador
corn,screamed,the,raven,from,the,lintel
corn,corn
wine,for,the,septon,and,a,plate,for,our,first,builder,jon,told,dolorous,edd
nothing,for,the,bird
he,turned,back,to,his,visitors
you’re,here,about,val
and,other,matters,said,bowen,marsh
the,men,have,concerns,my,lord
and,who,is,it,who,appointed,you,to,speak,for,them
as,do,i,othell,how,goes,the,work,at,the,nightfort
i,have,had,a,letter,from,ser,axell,florent,who,styles,himself,the,queen’s,hand
he,tells,me,that,queen,selyse,is,not,pleased,with,her,quarters,at,eastwatch-by-the-sea,and,wishes,to,move,into,her,husband’s,new,seat,at,once
will,that,be,possible
yarwyck,shrugged
we’ve,got,most,of,the,keep,restored,and,put,a,roof,back,on,the,kitchens
she’d,need,food,and,furnishings,and,firewood,mind,you,but,it,might,serve
not,so,many,comforts,as,eastwatch,to,be,sure
and,a,long,way,from,the,ships,should,her,grace,wish,to,leave,us,but,aye,she,could,live,there,though,it,will,be,years,before,the,place,looks,a,proper,castle
sooner,if,i,had,more,builders
i,could,offer,you,a,giant
that,gave,othell,a,start
the,monster,in,the,yard
his,name,is,wun,weg,wun,dar,wun,leathers,tells,me
a,lot,to,wrap,a,tongue,around,i,know
leathers,calls,him,wun,wun,and,that,seems,to,serve
wun,wun,was,very,little,like,the,giants,in,old,nan’s,tales,those,huge,savage,creatures,who,mixed,blood,into,their,morning,porridge,and,devoured,whole,bulls,hair,and,hide,and,horns
this,giant,ate,no,meat,at,all,though,he,was,a,holy,terror,when,served,a,basket,of,roots,crunching,onions,and,turnips,and,even,raw,hard,neeps,between,his,big,square,teeth
he’s,a,willing,worker,though,getting,him,to,understand,what,you,want,is,not,always,easy
he,speaks,the,old,tongue,after,a,fashion,but,nothing,of,the,common
tireless,though,and,his,strength,is,prodigious
he,could,do,the,work,of,a,dozen,men
i,my,lord,the,men,would,never,giants,eat,human,flesh,i,think,no,my,lord,i,thank,you,but,i,do,not,have,the,men,to,watch,over,such,a,creature,he,jon,snow,was,unsurprised
as,you,wish
we,will,keep,the,giant,here
truth,be,told,he,would,have,been,loath,to,part,with,wun,wun
you,know,nothing,jon,snow,ygritte,might,say,but,jon,spoke,with,the,giant,whenever,he,could,through,leathers,or,one,of,the,free,folk,they,had,brought,back,from,the,grove,and,was,learning,much,and,more,about,his,people,and,their,history
he,only,wished,that,sam,were,here,to,write,the,stories,down
that,was,not,to,say,that,he,was,blind,to,the,danger,wun,wun,represented
the,giant,would,lash,out,violently,when,threatened,and,those,huge,hands,were,strong,enough,to,rip,a,man,apart
he,reminded,jon,of,hodor
hodor,twice,as,big,twice,as,strong,and,half,as,clever
there’s,a,thought,to,sober,even,septon,cellador
but,if,tormund,has,giants,with,him,wun,weg,wun,dar,wun,may,help,us,treat,with,them
mormont’s,raven,muttered,his,annoyance,as,the,door,opened,beneath,him,heralding,the,return,of,dolorous,edd,with,a,flagon,of,wine,and,a,plate,of,eggs,and,sausages
bowen,marsh,waited,with,obvious,impatience,as,edd,poured,resuming,only,when,he,left,again
tollett,is,a,good,man,and,well,liked,and,iron,emmett,has,been,a,fine,master-at-arms,he,said,then
yet,the,talk,is,that,you,mean,to,send,them,away
we,need,good,men,at,long,barrow
whore’s,hole,the,men,have,started,calling,it,said,marsh,but,be,that,as,it,may
is,it,true,that,you,mean,to,replace,emmett,with,this,savage,leathers,as,our,master-at-arms
that,is,an,office,most,oft,reserved,for,knights,or,rangers,at,the,least
leathers,is,savage,jon,agreed,mildly
i,can,attest,to,that
i’ve,tried,him,in,the,practice,yard
he’s,as,dangerous,with,a,stone,axe,as,most,knights,are,with,castle-forged,steel
i,grant,you,he,is,not,as,patient,as,i’d,like,and,some,of,the,boys,are,terrified,of,him,but,that’s,not,all,for,the,bad
one,day,they’ll,find,themselves,in,a,real,fight,and,a,certain,familiarity,with,terror,will,serve,them,well
he’s,a,wildling
he,was,until,he,said,the,words
now,he,is,our,brother
one,who,can,teach,the,boys,more,than,swordcraft
it,would,not,hurt,them,to,learn,a,few,words,of,the,old,tongue,and,something,of,the,ways,of,the,free,folk

and,you,are,a,drunk
what,he,was,in,oldtown,is,none,of,our,concern
he’s,quick,to,learn,and,very,clever
the,other,recruits,started,out,despising,him,but,he,won,them,over,and,made,friends,of,them,all
he’s,fearless,in,a,fight,and,can,even,read,and,write,after,a,fashion
he,should,be,capable,of,fetching,me,my,meals,and,saddling,my,horse,don’t,you,think

tyrion,the,sow,had,a,sweeter,temper,than,some,horses,he,had,ridden
patient,and,sure-footed,she,accepted,tyrion,with,hardly,a,squeal,when,he,clambered,onto,her,back,and,remained,motionless,as,he,reached,for,shield,and,lance
yet,when,he,gathered,up,her,reins,and,pressed,his,feet,into,her,side,she,moved,at,once
her,name,was,pretty,short,for,pretty,pig,and,she,had,been,trained,to,saddle,and,bridle,since,she,was,a,piglet
the,painted,wooden,armor,clattered,as,pretty,trotted,across,the,deck
tyrion’s,armpits,were,prickly,with,perspiration,and,a,bead,of,sweat,was,trickling,down,his,scar,beneath,the,oversized,ill-fitting,helm,yet,for,one,absurd,moment,he,felt,almost,like,jaime,riding,out,onto,a,tourney,field,with,lance,in,hand,his,golden,armor,flashing,in,the,sun
when,the,laughter,began,the,dream,dissolved
he,was,no,champion,just,a,dwarf,on,a,pig,clutching,a,stick,capering,for,the,amusement,of,some,restless,rum-soaked,sailors,in,hopes,of,sweetening,their,mood
somewhere,down,in,hell,his,father,was,seething,and,joffrey,was,chuckling
tyrion,could,feel,their,cold,dead,eyes,watching,this,mummer’s,face,as,avid,as,the,crew,of,the,selaesori,qhoran
and,now,here,came,his,foe
penny,rode,her,big,grey,dog,her,striped,lance,waving,drunkenly,as,the,beast,bounded,across,the,deck
her,shield,and,armor,had,been,painted,red,though,the,paint,was,chipped,and,fading,his,own,armor,was,blue
not,mine
groat’s
never,mine,i,pray
tyrion,kicked,at,pretty’s,haunches,to,speed,her,to,a,charge,as,the,sailors,urged,him,on,with,hoots,and,shouts
whether,they,were,shouting,encouragement,or,mocking,him,he,could,not,have,said,for,certain,though,he,had,a,fair,notion
why,did,i,ever,allow,myself,to,be,talked,into,this,farce
he,knew,the,answer,though
for,twelve,days,now,the,ship,had,floated,becalmed,in,the,gulf,of,grief
the,mood,of,the,crew,was,ugly,and,like,to,turn,uglier,when,their,daily,rum,ration,went,dry
there,were,only,so,many,hours,a,man,could,devote,to,mending,sails,caulking,leaks,and,fishing
jorah,mormont,had,heard,the,muttering,about,how,dwarf,luck,had,failed,them
whilst,the,ship’s,cook,still,gave,tyrion’s,head,a,rub,from,time,to,time,in,hopes,that,it,might,stir,a,wind,the,rest,had,taken,to,giving,him,venomous,looks,whenever,he,crossed,their,paths
penny’s,lot,was,even,worse,since,the,cook,had,put,about,the,notion,that,squeezing,a,dwarf,girl’s,breast,might,be,just,the,thing,to,win,their,luck,back
he,had,also,started,referring,to,pretty,pig,as,bacon,a,jape,that,had,seemed,much,funnier,when,tyrion,had,made,it
we,have,to,make,them,laugh,penny,had,said,pleading
we,have,to,make,them,like,us
if,we,give,them,a,show,it,will,help,them,forget
please,m’lord
and,somehow,somewise,someway,he,had,consented
it,must,have,been,the,rum
the,captain’s,wine,had,been,the,first,thing,to,run,out
you,could,get,drunk,much,quicker,on,rum,than,on,wine,tyrion,lannister,had,discovered
so,he,found,himself,clad,in,groat’s,painted,wooden,armor,astride,groat’s,sow,whilst,groat’s,sister,instructed,him,in,the,finer,points,of,the,mummer’s,joust,that,had,been,their,bread,and,salt
it,had,a,certain,delicious,irony,to,it,considering,that,tyrion,had,almost,lost,his,head,once,by,refusing,to,mount,the,dog,for,his,nephew’s,twisted,amusement
yet,somehow,he,found,it,difficult,to,appreciate,the,humor,of,it,all,from,sowback
penny’s,lance,descended,just,in,time,for,its,blunted,point,to,brush,his,shoulder,his,own,lance,wobbled,as,he,brought,it,down,and,banged,it,noisily,off,a,corner,of,her,shield
she,kept,her,seat
he,lost,his
but,then,he,was,supposed,to
easy,as,falling,off,a,pig,though,falling,off,this,particular,pig,was,harder,than,it,looked
tyrion,curled,into,a,ball,as,he,dropped,remembering,his,lesson,but,even,so,he,hit,the,deck,with,a,solid,thump,and,bit,his,tongue,so,hard,he,tasted,blood
he,felt,as,if,he,were,twelve,again,cartwheeling,across,the,supper,table,in,casterly,rock’s,great,hall
back,then,his,uncle,gerion,had,been,on,hand,to,praise,his,efforts,in,place,of,surly,sailors
their,laughter,seemed,sparse,and,strained,compared,to,the,great,gales,that,had,greeted,groat’s,and,penny’s,antics,at,joffrey’s,wedding,feast,and,some,hissed,at,him,in,anger
no-nose,you,ride,same,way,you,look,ugly,one,man,shouted,from,the,sterncastle
must,have,no,balls,let,girl,beat,you
he,wagered,coin,on,me,tyrion,decided
he,let,the,insult,wash,right,over,him
he,had,heard,worse,in,his,time
the,wooden,armor,made,rising,awkward
he,found,himself,flailing,like,a,turtle,on,its,back
that,at,least,set,a,few,of,the,sailors,to,laughing
a,shame,i,did,not,break,my,leg,that,would,have,left,them,howling
and,if,they,had,been,in,that,privy,when,i,shot,my,father,through,the,bowels,they,might,have,laughed,hard,enough,to,shit,their,breeches,right,along,with,him
but,anything,to,keep,the,bloody,bastards,sweet
jorah,mormont,finally,took,pity,on,tyrion’s,struggles,and,pulled,him,to,his,feet
you,looked,a,fool
that,was,the,intent
it,is,hard,to,look,a,hero,when,mounted,on,a,pig
that,must,be,why,i,stay,off,pigs
tyrion,unbuckled,his,helm,twisted,it,off,and,spat,a,gobbet,of,bloody,pink,phlegm,over,the,side
it,feels,as,though,i,bit,through,half,my,tongue
next,time,bite,harder
ser,jorah,shrugged
truth,be,told,i’ve,seen,worse,jousters
was,that,praise
i,fell,off,the,bloody,pig,and,bit,my,tongue
what,could,possibly,be,worse,than,that
getting,a,splinter,through,your,eye,and,dying
penny,had,vaulted,off,her,dog,a,big,grey,brute,called,crunch
the,thing,is,not,to,joust,well,hugor
she,was,always,careful,to,call,him,hugor,where,anyone,might,hear
the,thing,is,to,make,them,laugh,and,throw,coins
poor,payment,for,the,blood,and,bruises,tyrion,thought,but,he,kept,that,to,himself,as,well
we,failed,at,that,as,well
no,one,threw,coins
not,a,penny,not,a,groat
they,will,when,we,get,better
penny,pulled,off,her,helm
mouse-brown,hair,spilled,down,to,her,ears
her,eyes,were,brown,too,beneath,a,heavy,shelf,of,brow,her,cheeks,smooth,and,flushed
she,pulled,some,acorns,from,a,leather,bag,for,pretty,pig
the,sow,ate,them,from,her,hand,squealing,happily
when,we,perform,for,queen,daenerys,the,silver,will,rain,down,you’ll,see
some,of,the,sailors,were,shouting,at,them,and,slamming,their,heels,against,the,deck,demanding,another,tilt
the,ship’s,cook,was,the,loudest,as,always
tyrion,had,learned,to,despise,that,man,even,if,he,was,the,only,half-decent,cyvasse,player,on,the,cog
you,see,they,liked,us,penny,said,with,a,hopeful,little,smile
shall,we,go,again,hugor
he,was,on,the,point,of,refusing,when,a,shout,from,one,of,the,mates,spared,him,the,necessity
it,was,midmorning,and,the,captain,wanted,the,boats,out,again
the,cog’s,huge,striped,sail,hung,limply,from,her,mast,as,it,had,for,days,but,he,was,hopeful,that,they,could,find,a,wind,somewhere,to,the,north
that,meant,rowing
the,boats,were,small,however,and,the,cog,was,large,towing,it,was,hot,sweaty,exhausting,work,that,left,the,hands,blistered,and,the,back,aching,and,accomplished,nothing
the,crew,hated,it
tyrion,could,not,blame,them
the,widow,should,have,put,us,on,a,galley,he,muttered,sourly
if,someone,could,help,me,out,of,these,bloody,planks,i,would,be,grateful
i,think,i,may,have,a,splinter,through,my,crotch
mormont,did,the,duty,albeit,with,poor,grace
penny,collected,her,dog,and,pig,and,led,them,both,below
you,might,want,to,tell,your,lady,to,keep,her,door,closed,and,barred,when,she’s,inside,ser,jorah,said,as,he,was,undoing,the,buckles,on,the,straps,that,joined,the,wooden,breastplate,to,the,backplate
i’m,hearing,too,much,talk,about,ribs,and,hams,and,bacon
that,pig,is,half,her,livelihood
a,ghiscari,crew,would,eat,the,dog,as,well
mormont,pulled,the,breastplate,and,backplate,apart
just,tell,her
as,you,wish
his,tunic,was,soaked,with,sweat,and,clinging,to,his,chest
tyrion,plucked,at,it,wishing,for,a,bit,of,breeze
the,wooden,armor,was,as,hot,and,heavy,as,it,was,uncomfortable
half,of,it,looked,to,be,old,paint,layer,on,layer,on,layer,of,it,from,a,hundred,past,repaintings
at,joffrey’s,wedding,feast,he,recalled,one,rider,had,displayed,the,direwolf,of,robb,stark,the,other,the,arms,and,colors,of,stannis,baratheon
we,will,need,both,animals,if,we’re,to,tilt,for,queen,daenerys,he,said
if,the,sailors,took,it,in,their,heads,to,butcher,pretty,pig,neither,he,nor,penny,could,hope,to,stop,them,but,ser,jorah’s,longsword,might,give,them,pause,at,least
is,that,how,you,hope,to,keep,your,head,imp
ser,imp,if,you,please
and,yes
once,her,grace,knows,my,true,worth,she’ll,cherish,me
i,am,a,lovable,little,fellow,after,all,and,i,know,many,useful,things,about,my,kin
but,until,such,time,i,had,best,keep,her,amused
caper,as,you,like,it,won’t,wash,out,your,crimes
daenerys,targaryen,is,no,silly,child,to,be,diverted,by,japes,and,tumbles
she,will,deal,with,you,justly
oh,i,hope,not
tyrion,studied,mormont,with,his,mismatched,eyes
and,how,will,she,welcome,you,this,just,queen
a,warm,embrace,a,girlish,titter,a,headsman’s,axe
he,grinned,at,the,knight’s,obvious,discomfit
did,you,truly,expect,me,to,believe,you,were,about,the,queen’s,business,in,that,whorehouse
defending,her,from,half,a,world,away
or,could,it,be,that,you,were,running,that,your,dragon,queen,sent,you,from,her,side
but,why,would,she,oh,wait,you,were,spying,on,her
tyrion,made,a,clucking,sound
you,hope,to,buy,your,way,back,into,her,favor,by,presenting,her,with,me
an,ill-considered,scheme,i’d,say
one,might,even,say,an,act,of,drunken,desperation
perhaps,if,i,were,jaime,but,jaime,killed,her,father,i,only,killed,my,own
you,think,daenerys,will,execute,me,and,pardon,you,but,the,reverse,is,just,as,likely
maybe,you,should,hop,up,on,that,pig,ser,jorah
put,on,a,suit,of,iron,motley,like,florian,the,the,blow,the,big,knight,gave,him,cracked,his,head,around,and,knocked,him,sideways,so,hard,that,his,head,bounced,off,the,deck
blood,filled,his,mouth,as,he,staggered,back,onto,one,knee
he,spat,out,a,broken,tooth
growing,prettier,every,day,but,i,do,believe,i,poked,a,wound
did,the,dwarf,say,something,to,offend,you,ser
tyrion,asked,innocently,wiping,bubbles,of,blood,off,his,broken,lip,with,the,back,of,his,hand
i,am,sick,of,your,mouth,dwarf,said,mormont
you,still,have,a,few,teeth,left
if,you,want,to,keep,them,stay,away,from,me,for,the,rest,of,this,voyage
that,could,be,difficult
we,share,a,cabin
you,can,find,somewhere,else,to,sleep
down,in,the,hold,up,on,deck,it,makes,no,matter
just,keep,out,of,my,sight
tyrion,pulled,himself,back,to,his,feet
as,you,wish,he,answered,through,a,mouthful,of,blood,but,the,big,knight,was,already,gone,his,boots,pounding,on,the,deckboards
below,in,the,galley,tyrion,was,rinsing,out,his,mouth,with,rum,and,water,and,wincing,at,the,sting,when,penny,found,him
i,heard,what,happened
oh,are,you,hurt
he,shrugged
a,bit,of,blood,and,a,broken,tooth
but,i,believe,i,hurt,him,more
and,him,a,knight
sad,to,say,i,would,not,count,on,ser,jorah,should,we,need,protection
what,did,you,do
oh,your,lip,is,bleeding
she,slipped,a,square,from,her,sleeve,and,dabbed,at,it
what,did,you,say
a,few,truths,ser,bezoar,did,not,care,to,hear
you,mustn’t,mock,him
don’t,you,know,anything
you,can’t,talk,that,way,to,a,big,person
they,can,hurt,you
ser,jorah,could,have,tossed,you,in,the,sea
the,sailors,would,have,laughed,to,see,you,drown
you,have,to,be,careful,around,big,people
be,jolly,and,playful,with,them,keep,them,smiling,make,them,laugh,that’s,what,my,father,always,said
didn’t,your,father,ever,tell,you,how,to,act,with,big,people
my,father,called,them,smallfolk,said,tyrion,and,he,was,not,what,you’d,call,a,jolly,man
he,took,another,sip,of,watered,rum,sloshed,it,around,his,mouth,spat,it,out
still,i,take,your,point
i,have,a,deal,to,learn,about,being,a,dwarf
perhaps,you,will,be,good,enough,to,teach,me,in,between,the,jousting,and,the,pig-riding
i,will,m’lord
gladly
but,what,were,these,truths
why,did,ser,jorah,hit,you,so,hard
why,for,love
the,same,reason,that,i,stewed,that,singer
he,thought,of,shae,and,the,look,in,her,eyes,as,he,tightened,the,chain,about,her,throat,twisting,it,in,his,fist
a,chain,of,golden,hands
for,hands,of,gold,are,always,gold,but,a,woman’s,hands,are,warm
are,you,a,maid,penny
she,blushed
yes
of,course
who,would,have,stay,that,way
love,is,madness,and,lust,is,poison
keep,your,maidenhead
you’ll,be,happier,for,it,and,you’re,less,like,to,find,yourself,in,some,dingy,brothel,on,the,rhoyne,with,a,whore,who,looks,a,bit,like,your,lost,love
or,chasing,across,half,the,world,hoping,to,find,wherever,whores,go
ser,jorah,dreams,of,rescuing,his,dragon,queen,and,basking,in,her,gratitude,but,i,know,a,thing,or,two,about,the,gratitude,of,kings,and,i’d,sooner,have,a,palace,in,valyria
he,broke,off,suddenly
did,you,feel,that
the,ship,moved
it,did
penny’s,face,lit,up,with,joy
we’re,moving,again
the,wind,she,rushed,to,the,door
i,want,to,see
come,i’ll,race,you,up
off,she,went
she,is,young,tyrion,had,to,remind,himself,as,penny,scrambled,from,the,galley,and,up,the,steep,wooden,steps,as,fast,as,her,short,legs,would,allow
almost,a,child
still,it,tickled,him,to,see,her,excitement
he,followed,her,topside
the,sail,had,come,to,life,again,billowing,emptying,then,billowing,again,the,red,stripes,on,the,canvas,wriggling,like,snakes
sailors,dashed,across,the,decks,and,hauled,on,lines,as,the,mates,bellowed,orders,in,the,tongue,of,old,volantis
the,rowers,in,the,ship’s,boats,had,loosed,their,tow,ropes,and,turned,back,toward,the,cog,stroking,hard
the,wind,was,blowing,from,the,west,swirling,and,gusting,clutching,at,ropes,and,cloaks,like,a,mischievous,child
the,selaesori,qhoran,was,under,way
might,be,we’ll,make,meereen,after,all,tyrion,thought
but,when,he,clambered,up,the,ladder,to,the,sterncastle,and,looked,off,from,the,stern,his,smile,faltered
blue,sky,and,blue,sea,here,but,off,west,i,have,never,seen,a,sky,that,color
a,thick,band,of,clouds,ran,along,the,horizon
a,bar,sinister,he,said,to,penny,pointing
what,does,that,mean
she,asked
it,means,some,big,bastard,is,creeping,up,behind,us
he,was,surprised,to,find,that,moqorro,and,two,of,his,fiery,fingers,had,joined,them,on,the,sterncastle
it,was,only,midday,and,the,red,priest,and,his,men,did,not,normally,emerge,till,dusk
the,priest,gave,him,a,solemn,nod
there,you,see,it,hugor,hill
god’s,wroth
the,lord,of,light,will,not,be,mocked
tyrion,had,a,bad,feeling,about,this
the,widow,said,this,ship,would,never,reach,her,destination
i,took,that,to,mean,that,once,we,were,out,to,sea,beyond,the,reach,of,triarchs,the,captain,would,change,course,for,meereen
or,perhaps,that,you,would,seize,the,ship,with,your,fiery,hand,and,take,us,to,daenerys
but,that,isn’t,what,your,high,priest,saw,at,all,is,it
no
moqorro’s,deep,voice,tolled,as,solemnly,as,a,funeral,bell
this,is,what,he,saw
the,red,priest,lifted,his,staff,and,inclined,its,head,toward,the,west
penny,was,lost
i,don’t,understand

yes,she,said
you,would,be,oh,for,the,better,part,of,three,hours,they,ran,before,the,wind,as,the,storm,grew,closer
the,western,sky,went,green,then,grey,then,black
a,wall,of,dark,clouds,loomed,up,behind,them,churning,like,a,kettle,of,milk,left,on,the,fire,too,long
tyrion,and,penny,watched,from,the,forecastle,huddled,by,the,figurehead,and,holding,hands,careful,to,stay,out,of,the,way,of,captain,and,crew
the,last,storm,had,been,thrilling,intoxicating,a,sudden,squall,that,had,left,him,feeling,cleansed,and,refreshed
this,one,felt,different,right,from,the,first
the,captain,sensed,it,too
he,changed,their,course,to,north,by,northeast,to,try,and,get,out,of,the,storm’s,path
it,was,a,futile,effort
this,storm,was,too,big
the,seas,around,them,grew,rougher
the,wind,began,to,howl
the,stinky,steward,rose,and,fell,as,waves,smashed,against,her,hull
behind,them,lightning,stabbed,down,from,the,sky,blinding,purple,bolts,that,danced,across,the,sea,in,webs,of,light
thunder,followed
the,time,has,come,to,hide
tyrion,took,penny,by,the,arm,and,led,her,belowdecks
pretty,and,crunch,were,were,both,half-mad,with,fear
the,dog,was,barking,barking,barking
he,knocked,tyrion,right,off,his,feet,as,they,entered
the,sow,had,been,shitting,everywhere
tyrion,cleaned,that,up,as,best,he,could,whilst,penny,tried,to,calm,the,animals
then,they,tied,down,or,put,away,anything,that,was,still,loose
i’m,frightened,penny,confessed
the,cabin,had,begun,to,tilt,and,jump,going,this,way,and,that,as,the,waves,hammered,at,the,hull,of,the,ship
there,are,worse,ways,to,die,than,drowning
your,brother,learned,that,and,so,did,my,lord,father
and,shae,that,lying,cunt
hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman’s,hands,are,warm
we,should,play,a,game,tyrion,suggested
that,might,help,take,our,thoughts,off,the,storm
not,cyvasse,she,said,at,once
not,cyvasse,tyrion,agreed,as,the,deck,rose,under,him
that,would,only,lead,to,pieces,flying,violently,across,the,cabin,and,raining,down,on,sow,and,dog
when,you,were,a,little,girl,did,you,ever,play,come-into-my-castle
no
can,you,teach,me
could,he
tyrion,hesitated
fool,of,a,dwarf
of,course,she’s,never,played,come-intomy-castle
she,never,had,a,castle
come-into-my-castle,was,a,game,for,highborn,children,one,meant,to,teach,them,courtesy,heraldry,and,a,thing,or,two,about,their,lord,father’s,friends,and,foes
that,won’t,he,started
the,deck,gave,another,violent,heave,slamming,the,two,of,them,together
penny,gave,a,squeak,of,fright
that,game,won’t,do,tyrion,told,her,gritting,his,teeth
sorry
i,don’t,know,what,game,i,do
penny,kissed,him
it,was,an,awkward,kiss,rushed,clumsy
but,it,took,him,utterly,by,surprise
his,hands,jerked,up,and,grabbed,hold,of,her,shoulders,to,shove,her,away
instead,he,hesitated,then,pulled,her,closer,gave,her,a,squeeze
her,lips,were,dry,hard,closed,up,tighter,than,a,miser’s,purse
a,small,mercy,thought,tyrion
this,was,nothing,he,had,wanted
he,liked,penny,he,pitied,penny,he,even,admired,penny,in,a,way,but,he,did,not,desire,her
he,had,no,wish,to,hurt,her,though,the,gods,and,his,sweet,sister,had,given,her,enough,pain
so,he,let,the,kiss,go,on,holding,her,gently,by,the,shoulders
his,own,lips,stayed,firmly,shut
the,selaesori,qhoran,rolled,and,shuddered,around,them
finally,she,pulled,back,an,inch,or,two
tyrion,could,see,his,own,reflection,shining,in,her,eyes
pretty,eyes,he,thought,but,he,saw,other,things,as,well
a,lot,of,fear,a,little,hope,but,not,a,bit,of,lust
she,does,not,want,me,no,more,than,i,want,her
when,she,lowered,her,head,he,took,her,under,the,chin,and,raised,it,up,again
we,cannot,play,that,game,my,lady
above,the,thunder,boomed,close,at,hand,now
i,never,meant,i,never,kissed,a,boy,before,but,i,only,thought,what,if,we,drown,and,i,i,it,was,sweet,lied,tyrion,but,i,am,married
she,was,with,me,at,the,feast,you,may,remember,her
lady,sansa
was,she,your,wife
she,she,was,very,beautiful,and,false
sansa,shae,all,my,women,tysha,was,the,only,one,who,ever,loved,me
where,do,whores,go
a,lovely,girl,said,tyrion,and,we,were,joined,beneath,the,eyes,of,gods,and,men
it,may,be,that,she,is,lost,to,me,but,until,i,know,that,for,a,certainty,i,must,be,true,to,her
i,understand
penny,turned,her,face,away,from,his
my,perfect,woman,tyrion,thought,bitterly
one,still,young,enough,to,believe,such,blatant,lies
the,hull,was,creaking,the,deck,moving,and,pretty,was,squealing,in,distress
penny,crawled,across,the,cabin,floor,on,her,hands,and,knees,wrapped,her,arms,around,the,sow’s,head,and,murmured,reassurance,to,her
looking,at,the,two,of,them,it,was,hard,to,know,who,was,comforting,whom
the,sight,was,so,grotesque,it,should,have,been,hilarious,but,tyrion,could,not,even,find,a,smile
the,girl,deserves,better,than,a,pig,he,thought
an,honest,kiss,a,little,kindness,everyone,deserves,that,much,however,big,or,small
he,looked,about,for,his,wine,cup,but,when,he,found,it,all,the,rum,had,spilled
drowning,is,bad,enough,he,reflected,sourly,but,drowning,sad,and,sober,that’s,too,cruel
in,the,end,they,did,not,drown,though,there,were,times,when,the,prospect,of,a,nice,peaceful,drowning,had,a,certain,appeal
the,storm,raged,for,the,rest,of,that,day,and,well,into,the,night
wet,winds,howled,around,them,and,waves,rose,like,the,fists,of,drowned,giants,to,smash,down,on,their,decks
above,they,learned,later,a,mate,and,two,sailors,were,swept,overboard,the,ship’s,cook,was,blinded,when,a,kettle,of,hot,grease,flew,up,into,his,face,and,the,captain,was,thrown,from,the,sterncastle,to,the,main,deck,so,violently,he,broke,both,legs
below,crunch,howled,and,barked,and,snapped,at,penny,and,pretty,pig,began,to,shit,again,turning,the,cramped,damp,cabin,into,a,sty
tyrion,managed,to,avoid,retching,his,way,through,all,of,this,chiefly,thanks,to,the,lack,of,wine
penny,was,not,so,fortunate,but,he,held,her,anyway,as,the,ship’s,hull,creaked,and,groaned,alarmingly,around,them,like,a,cask,about,to,burst
nearby,midnight,the,winds,finally,died,away,and,the,sea,grew,calm,enough,for,tyrion,to,make,his,way,back,up,onto,deck
what,he,saw,there,did,not,reassure,him
the,cog,was,drifting,on,a,sea,of,dragonglass,beneath,a,bowl,of,stars,but,all,around,the,storm,raged,on
east,west,north,south,everywhere,he,looked,the,clouds,rose,up,like,black,mountains,their,tumbled,slopes,and,collossal,cliffs,alive,with,blue,and,purple,lightning
no,rain,was,falling,but,the,decks,were,slick,and,wet,underfoot
tyrion,could,hear,someone,screaming,from,below,a,thin,high,voice,hysterical,with,fear
he,could,hear,moqorro,too
the,red,priest,stood,on,the,forecastle,facing,the,storm,his,staff,raised,above,his,head,as,he,boomed,a,prayer
amidships,a,dozen,sailors,and,two,of,the,fiery,fingers,were,struggling,with,tangled,lines,and,sodden,canvas,but,whether,they,were,trying,to,raise,the,sail,again,or,pull,it,down,he,never,knew
whatever,they,were,doing,it,seemed,to,him,a,very,bad,idea
and,so,it,was
the,wind,returned,as,a,whispered,threat,cold,and,damp,brushing,over,his,cheek,flapping,the,wet,sail,swirling,and,tugging,at,moqorro’s,scarlet,robes
some,instinct,made,tyrion,grab,hold,of,the,nearest,rail,just,in,time
in,the,space,of,three,heartbeats,the,little,breeze,became,a,howling,gale
moqorro,shouted,something,and,green,flames,leapt,from,the,dragon’s,maw,atop,his,staff,to,vanish,in,the,night
then,the,rains,came,black,and,blinding,and,forecastle,and,sterncastle,both,vanished,behind,a,wall,of,water
something,huge,flapped,overhead,and,tyrion,glanced,up,in,time,to,see,the,sail,taking,wing,with,two,men,still,dangling,from,the,lines
then,he,heard,a,crack
oh,bloody,hell,he,had,time,to,think,that,had,to,be,the,mast
he,found,a,line,and,pulled,on,it,fighting,toward,the,hatch,to,get,himself,below,out,of,the,storm,but,a,gust,of,wind,knocked,his,feet,from,under,him,and,a,second,slammed,him,into,the,rail,and,there,he,clung
rain,lashed,at,his,face,blinding,him
his,mouth,was,full,of,blood,again
the,ship,groaned,and,growled,beneath,him,like,a,constipated,fat,man,straining,to,shit
then,the,mast,burst
tyrion,never,saw,it,but,he,heard,it
that,cracking,sound,again,and,then,a,scream,of,tortured,wood,and,suddenly,the,air,was,full,of,shards,and,splinters
one,missed,his,eye,by,half,an,inch,a,second,found,his,neck,a,third,went,through,his,calf,boots,and,breeches,and,all
he,screamed
but,he,held,on,to,the,line,held,on,with,a,desperate,strength,he,did,not,know,he,had
the,widow,said,this,ship,would,never,reach,her,destination,he,remembered
then,he,laughed,and,laughed,wild,and,hysterical,as,thunder,boomed,and,timbers,moaned,and,waves,crashed,all,around,him
by,the,time,the,storm,abated,and,the,surviving,passengers,and,crew,came,crawling,back,on,deck,like,pale,pink,worms,wriggling,to,the,surface,after,a,rain,the,selaesori,qhoran,was,a,broken,thing,floating,low,in,the,water,and,listing,ten,degrees,to,port,her,hull,sprung,in,half,a,hundred,places,her,hold,awash,in,seawater,her,mast,a,splintered,ruin,no,taller,than,a,dwarf
even,her,figurehead,had,not,escaped,one,of,his,arms,had,broken,off,the,one,with,all,his,scrolls
nine,men,had,been,lost,including,a,mate,two,of,the,fiery,fingers,and,moqorro,himself
did,benerro,see,this,in,his,fires
tyrion,wondered,when,he,realized,the,huge,red,priest,was,gone
did,moqorro
prophecy,is,like,a,half-trained,mule,he,complained,to,jorah,mormont
it,looks,as,though,it,might,be,useful,but,the,moment,you,trust,in,it,it,kicks,you,in,the,head
that,bloody,widow,knew,the,ship,would,never,reach,her,destination,she,warned,us,of,that,said,benerro,saw,it,in,his,fires,only,i,took,that,to,mean,well,what,does,it,matter
his,mouth,twisted
what,it,really,meant,was,that,some,bloody,big,storm,would,turn,our,mast,to,kindling,so,we,could,drift,aimlessly,across,the,gulf,of,grief,until,our,food,ran,out,and,we,started,eating,one,another
who,do,you,suppose,they’ll,carve,up,first,the,pig,the,dog,or,me
the,noisiest,i’d,say
the,captain,died,the,following,day,the,ship’s,cook,three,nights,later
it,was,all,that,the,remaining,crew,could,do,to,keep,the,wreck,afloat
the,mate,who,had,assumed,command,reckoned,that,they,were,somewhere,off,the,southern,end,of,the,isle,of,cedars
when,he,lowered,the,ship’s,boats,to,tow,them,toward,the,nearest,land,one,sank,and,the,men,in,the,other,cut,the,line,and,rowed,off,north,abandoning,the,cog,and,all,their,shipmates
slaves,said,jorah,mormont,contemptuous
the,big,knight,had,slept,through,the,storm,to,hear,him,tell,it
tyrion,had,his,doubts,but,he,kept,them,to,himself
one,day,he,might,want,to,bite,someone,in,the,leg,and,for,that,you,needed,teeth
mormont,seemed,content,to,ignore,their,disagreement,so,tyrion,decided,to,pretend,it,had,not,happened
for,nineteen,days,they,drifted,as,food,and,water,dwindled
the,sun,beat,down,on,them,relentless
penny,huddled,in,her,cabin,with,her,dog,and,her,pig,and,tyrion,brought,her,food,limping,on,his,bandaged,calf,and,sniffing,at,the,wound,by,night
when,he,had,nothing,else,to,do,he,pricked,his,toes,and,fingers,too
ser,jorah,made,a,point,of,sharpening,his,sword,each,day,honing,the,point,until,it,gleamed
the,three,remaining,fiery,fingers,lit,the,nightfire,as,the,sun,went,down,but,they,wore,their,ornate,armor,as,they,led,the,crew,in,prayer,and,their,spears,were,close,at,hand
and,not,a,single,sailor,tried,to,rub,the,head,of,either,dwarf
should,we,joust,for,them,again
penny,asked,one,night
best,not,said,tyrion
that,would,only,serve,to,remind,them,we,have,a,nice,plump,pig
though,pretty,was,growing,less,plump,with,every,passing,day,and,crunch,was,fur,and,bones
that,night,he,dreamed,that,he,was,back,in,king’s,landing,again,a,crossbow,in,his,hand
wherever,whores,go,lord,tywin,said,but,when,tyrion’s,finger,clenched,and,the,bowstring,thrummed,it,was,penny,with,the,quarrel,buried,in,her,belly
he,woke,to,the,sound,of,shouting
the,deck,was,moving,under,him,and,for,half,a,heartbeat,he,was,so,confused,he,thought,he,was,back,on,the,shy,maid
a,whiff,of,pigshit,brought,him,to,his,senses
the,sorrows,were,behind,him,half,a,world,away,and,the,joys,of,that,time,as,well
he,remembered,how,sweet,lemore,had,looked,after,her,morning,swims,with,beads,of,water,glistening,on,her,naked,skin,but,the,only,maiden,here,was,his,poor,penny,the,stunted,little,dwarf,girl
something,was,afoot,though
tyrion,slipped,from,the,hammock,yawning,and,looked,about,for,his,boots
and,mad,though,it,was,he,looked,for,the,crossbow,as,well,but,of,course,there,was,none,such,to,be,found
a,pity,he,mused,it,might,have,been,some,use,when,the,big,folk,come,to,eat,me
he,pulled,his,boots,on,and,climbed,on,deck,to,see,what,the,shouting,was,about
penny,was,there,before,him,her,eyes,wide,with,wonder
a,sail,she,shouted,there,there,do,you,see
a,sail,and,they’ve,seen,us,they,have
a,sail
this,time,he,kissed,her,once,on,each,cheek,once,on,the,brow,and,one,last,one,on,the,mouth
she,was,flushed,and,laughing,by,the,last,kiss,suddenly,shy,again,but,it,made,no,matter
the,other,ship,was,closing
a,big,galley,he,saw
her,oars,left,a,long,white,wake,behind,her
what,ship,is,that
he,asked,ser,jorah,mormont
can,you,read,her,name
i,don’t,need,to,read,her,name
we’re,downwind
i,can,smell,her
mormont,drew,his,sword
that’s,a,slaver
the,turncloak,the,first,flakes,came,drifting,down,as,the,sun,was,setting,in,the,west
by,nightfall,snow,was,coming,down,so,heavily,that,the,moon,rose,behind,a,white,curtain,unseen
the,gods,of,the,north,have,unleashed,their,wroth,on,lord,stannis,roose,bolton,announced,come,morning,as,men,gathered,in,winterfell’s,great,hall,to,break,their,fast
he,is,a,stranger,here,and,the,old,gods,will,not,suffer,him,to,live
his,men,roared,their,approval,banging,their,fists,on,the,long,plank,tables
winterfell,might,be,ruined,but,its,granite,walls,would,still,keep,the,worst,of,the,wind,and,weather,at,bay
they,were,well,stocked,with,food,and,drink,they,had,fires,to,warm,them,when,off,duty,a,place,to,dry,their,clothes,snug,corners,to,lie,down,and,sleep
lord,bolton,had,laid,by,enough,wood,to,keep,the,fires,fed,for,half,a,year,so,the,great,hall,was,always,warm,and,cozy
stannis,had,none,of,that
theon,greyjoy,did,not,join,the,uproar
neither,did,the,men,of,house,frey,he,did,not,fail,to,note
they,are,strangers,here,as,well,he,thought,watching,ser,aenys,frey,and,his,half-brother,ser,hosteen
born,and,bred,in,the,riverlands,the,freys,had,never,seen,a,snow,like,this
the,north,has,already,claimed,three,of,their,blood,theon,thought,recalling,the,men,that,ramsay,had,searched,for,fruitlessly,lost,between,white,harbor,and,barrowton
on,the,dais,lord,wyman,manderly,sat,between,a,pair,of,his,white,harbor,knights,spooning,porridge,into,his,fat,face
he,did,not,seem,to,be,enjoying,it,near,as,much,as,he,had,the,pork,pies,at,the,wedding
elsewhere,one-armed,harwood,stout,talked,quietly,with,the,cadaverous,whoresbane,umber
theon,queued,up,with,the,other,men,for,porridge,ladled,into,wooden,bowls,from,a,row,of,copper,kettles
the,lords,and,knights,had,milk,and,honey,and,even,a,bit,of,butter,to,sweeten,their,portions,he,saw,but,none,of,that,would,be,offered,him
his,reign,as,prince,of,winterfell,had,been,a,brief,one
he,had,played,his,part,in,the,mummer’s,show,giving,the,feigned,arya,to,be,wed,and,now,he,was,of,no,further,use,to,roose,bolton
first,winter,i,remember,the,snows,came,over,my,head,said,a,hornwood,man,in,the,queue,ahead,of,him
aye,but,you,were,only,three,foot,tall,at,the,time,a,rider,from,the,rills,replied
last,night,unable,to,sleep,theon,had,found,himself,brooding,on,escape,of,slipping,away,unseen,whilst,ramsay,and,his,lord,father,had,their,attention,elsewhere
every,gate,was,closed,and,barred,and,heavily,guarded,though,no,one,was,allowed,to,enter,or,depart,the,castle,without,lord,bolton’s,leave
even,if,he,found,some,secret,way,out,theon,would,not,have,trusted,it
he,had,not,forgotten,kyra,and,her,keys
and,if,he,did,get,out,where,would,he,go
his,father,was,dead,and,his,uncles,had,no,use,for,him
pyke,was,lost,to,him
the,nearest,thing,to,a,home,that,remained,to,him,was,here,amongst,the,bones,of,winterfell
a,ruined,man,a,ruined,castle
this,is,my,place
he,was,still,waiting,for,his,porridge,when,ramsay,swept,into,the,hall,with,his,bastard’s,boys,shouting,for,music
abel,rubbed,the,sleep,from,his,eyes,took,up,his,lute,and,launched,into,the,dornishman’s,wife,whilst,one,of,his,washerwomen,beat,time,on,her,drum
the,singer,changed,the,words,though
instead,of,tasting,a,dornishman’s,wife,he,sang,of,tasting,a,northman’s,daughter
he,could,lose,his,tongue,for,that,theon,thought,as,his,bowl,was,being,filled
he,is,only,a,singer
lord,ramsay,could,flay,the,skin,off,both,his,hands,and,no,one,would,say,a,word
but,lord,bolton,smiled,at,the,lyric,and,ramsay,laughed,aloud
then,others,knew,that,it,was,safe,to,laugh,as,well
yellow,dick,found,the,song,so,funny,that,wine,snorted,out,his,nose
lady,arya,was,not,there,to,share,the,merriment
she,had,not,been,seen,outside,her,chambers,since,her,wedding,night
sour,alyn,had,been,saying,that,ramsay,kept,his,bride,naked,and,chained,to,a,bedpost,but,theon,knew,that,was,only,talk
there,were,no,chains,at,least,none,that,men,could,see
just,a,pair,of,guards,outside,the,bedchamber,to,keep,the,girl,from,wandering
and,she,is,only,naked,when,she,bathes
that,she,did,most,every,night,though
lord,ramsay,wanted,his,wife,clean
she,has,no,handmaids,poor,thing,he,had,said,to,theon
that,leaves,you,reek
should,i,put,you,in,a,dress
he,laughed
perhaps,if,you,beg,it,of,me
just,now,it,will,suffice,for,you,to,be,her,bath,maid
i,won’t,have,her,smelling,like,you
so,whenever,ramsay,had,an,itch,to,bed,his,wife,it,fell,to,theon,to,borrow,some,servingwomen,from,lady,walda,or,lady,dustin,and,fetch,hot,water,from,the,kitchens
though,arya,never,spoke,to,any,of,them,they,could,not,fail,to,see,her,bruises
it,is,her,own,fault
she,has,not,pleased,him
just,be,arya,he,told,the,girl,once,as,he,helped,her,into,the,water
lord,ramsay,does,not,want,to,hurt,you
he,only,hurts,us,when,we,when,we,forget
he,never,cut,me,without,cause
theon,she,whispered,weeping
reek
he,grabbed,her,arm,and,shook,her
in,here,i’m,reek
you,have,to,remember,arya
but,the,girl,was,no,true,stark,only,a,steward’s,whelp
jeyne,her,name,is,jeyne
she,should,not,look,to,me,for,rescue
theon,greyjoy,might,have,tried,to,help,her,once

kyra,he,remembered
the,new,bitch,he,calls,kyra
he,took,his,bowl,to,the,back,of,the,hall,and,found,a,place,on,an,empty,bench,yards,away,from,the,nearest,torch
day,or,night,the,benches,below,the,salt,were,never,less,than,half-full,with,men,drinking,dicing,talking,or,sleeping,in,their,clothes,in,quiet,corners
their,serjeants,would,kick,them,awake,when,it,came,their,turn,to,shrug,back,into,their,cloaks,and,walk,the,walls
but,no,man,of,them,would,welcome,the,company,of,theon,turncloak,nor,did,he,have,much,taste,for,theirs
the,gruel,was,grey,and,watery,and,he,pushed,it,away,after,his,third,spoonful,and,let,it,congeal,in,the,bowl
at,the,next,table,men,were,arguing,about,the,storm,and,wondering,aloud,how,long,the,snow,would,fall
all,day,and,all,night,might,be,even,longer,insisted,one,big,black-bearded,archer,with,a,cerwyn,axe,sewn,on,his,breast
a,few,of,the,older,men,spoke,of,other,snowstorms,and,insisted,this,was,no,more,than,a,light,dusting,compared,to,what,they’d,seen,in,the,winters,of,their,youth
the,riverlanders,were,aghast
they,have,no,love,of,snow,and,cold,these,southron,swords
men,entering,the,hall,huddled,by,the,fires,or,clapped,their,hands,together,over,glowing,braziers,as,their,cloaks,hung,dripping,from,pegs,inside,the,door
the,air,was,thick,and,smoky,and,a,crust,had,formed,atop,his,porridge,when,a,woman’s,voice,behind,him,said,theon,greyjoy
my,name,is,reek,he,almost,said

what,good,would,coin,do,me,here
what,would,i,buy,with,it,some,snow

he,jerked,to,his,feet,and,made,his,way,wordlessly,to,the,doors,limping,on,his,maimed,feet
outside,the,snow,was,falling,still
wet,heavy,silent,it,had,already,begun,to,cover,the,footsteps,left,by,the,men,coming,and,going,from,the,hall
the,drifts,came,almost,to,the,top,of,his,boots
it,will,be,deeper,in,the,wolfswood,and,out,on,the,kingsroad,where,the,wind,is,blowing,there,will,be,no,escape,from,it
a,battle,was,being,fought,in,the,yard,ryswells,pelting,barrowton,boys,with,snowballs
above,he,could,see,some,squires,building,snowmen,along,the,battlements
they,were,arming,them,with,spears,and,shields,putting,iron,halfhelms,on,their,heads,and,arraying,them,along,the,inner,wall,a,rank,of,snowy,sentinels
lord,winter,has,joined,us,with,his,levies,one,of,the,sentries,outside,the,great,hall,japed,until,he,saw,theon’s,face,and,realized,who,he,was,talking,to
then,he,turned,his,head,and,spat
beyond,the,tents,the,big,destriers,of,the,knights,from,white,harbor,and,the,twins,were,shivering,in,their,horse,lines
ramsay,had,burned,the,stables,when,he,sacked,winterfell,so,his,father,had,thrown,up,new,ones,twice,as,large,as,the,old,to,accommodate,the,warhorses,and,palfreys,of,his,lords’,bannermen,and,knights
the,rest,of,the,horses,were,tethered,in,the,wards
hooded,grooms,moved,amongst,them,covering,them,with,blankets,to,keep,them,warm
theon,made,his,way,deeper,into,the,ruined,parts,of,the,castle
as,he,picked,through,the,shattered,stone,that,had,once,been,maester,luwin’s,turret,ravens,looked,down,from,the,gash,in,the,wall,above,muttering,to,one,another
from,time,to,time,one,would,let,out,a,raucous,scream
he,stood,in,the,doorway,of,a,bedchamber,that,had,once,been,his,own,ankle,deep,in,snow,that,had,blown,in,through,a,shattered,window,visited,the,ruins,of,mikken’s,forge,and,lady,catelyn’s,sept,beneath,the,burned,tower,he,passed,rickard,ryswell,nuzzling,at,the,neck,of,another,one,of,abel’s,washerwomen,the,plump,one,with,the,apple,cheeks,and,pug,nose
the,girl,was,barefoot,in,the,snow,bundled,up,in,a,fur,cloak
he,thought,she,might,be,naked,underneath
when,she,saw,him,she,said,something,to,ryswell,that,made,him,laugh,aloud
theon,trudged,away,from,them
there,was,a,stair,beyond,the,mews,seldom,used,it,was,there,his,feet,took,him
the,steps,were,steep,and,treacherous
he,climbed,carefully,and,found,himself,alone,on,the,battlements,of,the,inner,wall,well,away,from,the,squires,and,their,snowmen
no,one,had,given,him,freedom,of,the,castle,but,no,one,had,denied,it,to,him,either
he,could,go,where,he,would,within,the,walls
winterfell’s,inner,wall,was,the,older,and,taller,of,the,two,its,ancient,grey,crenellations,rising,one,hundred,feet,high,with,square,towers,at,every,corner
the,outer,wall,raised,many,centuries,later,was,twenty,feet,lower,but,thicker,and,in,better,repair,boasting,octagonal,towers,in,place,of,square,ones
between,the,two,walls,was,the,moat,deep,and,wide,and,frozen
drifts,of,snow,had,begun,to,creep,across,its,icy,surface
snow,was,building,up,along,the,battlements,too,filling,the,gaps,between,the,merlons,and,putting,pale,soft,caps,on,every,tower,top
beyond,the,walls,as,far,as,he,could,see,the,world,was,turning,white
the,woods,the,fields,the,kingsroad,the,snows,were,covering,all,of,them,beneath,a,pale,soft,mantle,burying,the,remnants,of,the,winter,town,hiding,the,blackened,walls,ramsay’s,men,had,left,behind,when,they,put,the,houses,to,the,torch
the,wounds,snow,made,snow,conceals,but,that,was,wrong
ramsay,was,a,bolton,now,not,a,snow,never,a,snow
farther,off,the,rutted,kingsroad,had,vanished,lost,amidst,the,fields,and,rolling,hills,all,one,vast,expanse,of,white
and,still,the,snow,was,falling,drifting,down,in,silence,from,a,windless,sky
stannis,baratheon,is,out,there,somewhere,freezing
would,lord,stannis,try,to,take,winterfell,by,storm
if,he,does,his,cause,is,doomed
the,castle,was,too,strong
even,with,the,moat,frozen,over,winterfell’s,defenses,remained,formidable
theon,had,captured,the,castle,by,stealth,sending,his,best,men,to,scale,the,walls,and,swim,the,moat,under,the,cover,of,darkness
the,defenders,had,not,even,known,they,were,under,attack,until,it,was,too,late
no,such,subterfuge,was,possible,for,stannis
he,might,prefer,to,cut,the,castle,off,from,the,outside,world,and,starve,out,its,defenders
winterfell’s,storerooms,and,cellar,vaults,were,empty
a,long,supply,train,had,come,with,bolton,and,his,friends,of,frey,up,through,the,neck,lady,dustin,had,brought,food,and,fodder,from,barrowton,and,lord,manderly,had,arrived,well,provisioned,from,white,harbor,but,the,host,was,large
with,so,many,mouths,to,feed,their,stores,could,not,last,for,long
lord,stannis,and,his,men,will,be,just,as,hungry,though
and,cold,and,footsore,as,well,in,no,condition,for,a,fight,but,the,storm,will,make,them,desperate,to,get,inside,the,castle
snow,was,falling,on,the,godswood,too,melting,when,it,touched,the,ground
beneath,the,white-cloaked,trees,the,earth,had,turned,to,mud
tendrils,of,mist,hung,in,the,air,like,ghostly,ribbons
why,did,i,come,here
these,are,not,my,gods
this,is,not,my,place
the,heart,tree,stood,before,him,a,pale,giant,with,a,carved,face,and,leaves,like,bloody,hands
a,thin,film,of,ice,covered,the,surface,of,the,pool,beneath,the,weirwood
theon,sank,to,his,knees,beside,it
please,he,murmured,through,his,broken,teeth,i,never,meant,the,words,caught,in,his,throat
save,me,he,finally,managed
give,me,what
strength
courage
mercy
snow,fell,around,him,pale,and,silent,keeping,its,own,counsel
the,only,sound,was,a,faint,soft,sobbing
jeyne,he,thought
it,is,her,sobbing,in,her,bridal,bed
who,else,could,it,be
gods,do,not,weep
or,do,they
the,sound,was,too,painful,to,endure
theon,grabbed,hold,of,a,branch,and,pulled,himself,back,to,his,feet,knocked,the,snow,off,his,legs,and,limped,back,toward,the,lights
there,are,ghosts,in,winterfell,he,thought,and,i,am,one,of,them
more,snowmen,had,risen,in,the,yard,by,the,time,theon,greyjoy,made,his,way,back
to,command,the,snowy,sentinels,on,the,walls,the,squires,had,erected,a,dozen,snowy,lords
one,was,plainly,meant,to,be,lord,manderly,it,was,the,fattest,snowman,that,theon,had,ever,seen
the,one-armed,lord,could,only,be,harwood,stout,the,snow,lady,barbrey,dustin
and,the,one,closest,to,the,door,with,the,beard,made,of,icicles,had,to,be,old,whoresbane,umber
inside,the,cooks,were,ladling,out,beef-and-barley,stew,thick,with,carrots,and,onions,served,in,trenchers,hollowed,from,loaves,of,yesterday’s,bread
scraps,were,thrown,onto,the,floor,to,be,gobbled,up,by,ramsay’s,girls,and,the,other,dogs
the,girls,were,glad,to,see,him
they,knew,him,by,his,smell
red,jeyne,loped,over,to,lick,at,his,hand,and,helicent,slipped,under,the,table,and,curled,up,by,his,feet,gnawing,at,a,bone
they,were,good,dogs
it,was,easy,to,forget,that,every,one,was,named,for,a,girl,that,ramsay,had,hunted,and,killed
weary,as,he,was,theon,had,appetite,enough,to,eat,a,little,stew,washed,down,with,ale
by,then,the,hall,had,grown,raucous
two,of,roose,bolton’s,scouts,had,come,straggling,back,through,the,hunter’s,gate,to,report,that,lord,stannis’s,advance,had,slowed,to,a,crawl
his,knights,rode,destriers,and,the,big,warhorses,were,foundering,in,the,snow
the,small,sure-footed,garrons,of,the,hill,clans,were,faring,better,the,scouts,said,but,the,clansmen,dared,not,press,too,far,ahead,or,the,whole,host,would,come,apart
lord,ramsay,commanded,abel,to,give,them,a,marching,song,in,honor,of,stannis,trudging,through,the,snows,so,the,bard,took,up,his,lute,again,whilst,one,of,his,washerwomen,coaxed,a,sword,from,sour,alyn,and,mimed,stannis,slashing,at,the,snowflakes
theon,was,staring,down,into,the,last,dregs,of,his,third,tankard,when,lady,barbrey,dustin,swept,into,the,hall,and,sent,two,of,her,sworn,swords,to,bring,him,to,her
when,he,stood,below,the,dais,she,looked,him,up,and,down,and,sniffed
those,are,the,same,clothes,you,wore,for,the,wedding
yes,my,lady
they,are,the,clothes,i,was,given
that,was,one,of,the,lessons,he,had,learned,at,the,dreadfort,to,take,what,he,was,given,and,never,ask,for,more
lady,dustin,wore,black,as,ever,though,her,sleeves,were,lined,with,vair
her,gown,had,a,high,stiff,collar,that,framed,her,face
you,know,this,castle
once
somewhere,beneath,us,are,the,crypts,where,the,old,stark,kings,sit,in,darkness
my,men,have,not,been,able,to,find,the,way,down,into,them
they,have,been,through,all,the,undercrofts,and,cellars,even,the,dungeons,but,the,crypts,cannot,be,accessed,from,the,dungeons,my,lady

my,lady,will,want,a,warm,cloak,cautioned,theon
we,will,need,to,go,outside
the,snow,was,coming,down,heavier,than,ever,when,they,left,the,hall,with,lady,dustin,wrapped,in,sable
huddled,in,their,hooded,cloaks,the,guards,outside,were,almost,indistinguishable,from,the,snowmen
only,their,breath,fogging,the,air,gave,proof,that,they,still,lived
fires,burned,along,the,battlements,a,vain,attempt,to,drive,the,gloom,away
their,small,party,found,themselves,slogging,through,a,smooth,unbroken,expanse,of,white,that,came,halfway,up,their,calves
the,tents,in,the,yard,were,half-buried,sagging,under,the,weight,of,the,accumulation
the,entrance,to,the,crypts,was,in,the,oldest,section,of,the,castle,near,the,foot,of,the,first,keep,which,had,sat,unused,for,hundreds,of,years
ramsay,had,put,it,to,the,torch,when,he,sacked,winterfell,and,much,of,what,had,not,burned,had,collapsed
only,a,shell,remained,one,side,open,to,the,elements,and,filling,up,with,snow
rubble,was,strewn,all,about,it,great,chunks,of,shattered,masonry,burned,beams,broken,gargoyles
the,falling,snow,had,covered,almost,all,of,it,but,part,of,one,gargoyle,still,poked,above,the,drift,its,grotesque,face,snarling,sightless,at,the,sky
this,is,where,they,found,bran,when,he,fell
theon,had,been,out,hunting,that,day,riding,with,lord,eddard,and,king,robert,with,no,hint,of,the,dire,news,that,awaited,them,back,at,the,castle
he,remembered,robb’s,face,when,they,told,him
no,one,had,expected,the,broken,boy,to,live
the,gods,could,not,kill,bran,no,more,than,i,could
it,was,a,strange,thought,and,stranger,still,to,remember,that,bran,might,still,be,alive
there
theon,pointed,to,where,a,snowbank,had,crept,up,the,wall,of,the,keep
under,there

the,thick,beards,of,the,wolves,were,soon,caked,with,ice,where,their,breath,had,frozen,and,every,clean-shaved,southron,boy,was,letting,his,whiskers,grow,out,to,keep,his,face,warm

the,king’s,host,became,a,column,of,snowmen,staggering,through,knee-high,drifts
on,the,third,day,of,snow,the,king’s,host,began,to,come,apart
whilst,the,southron,knights,and,lordlings,struggled,the,men,of,the,northern,hills,fared,better

some,had,bear-paws,for,their,horses,too,and,the,shaggy,little,garrons,wore,them,as,easily,as,other,mounts,wore,iron,horseshoes,but,the,palfreys,and,destriers,wanted,no,part,of,them
when,a,few,of,the,king’s,knights,strapped,them,onto,their,feet,nonetheless,the,big,southern,horses,balked,and,refused,to,move,or,tried,to,shake,the,things,off,their,feet
one,destrier,broke,an,ankle,trying,to,walk,in,them
the,northmen,on,their,bear-paws,soon,began,to,outdistance,the,rest,of,the,host

that,same,night,he,slipped,into,a,feverish,sleep

then,all,the,hillmen,were,shouting,banging,their,cups,and,drinking,horns,on,the,table,filling,the,king’s,tent,with,the,clangor
asha,greyjoy,would,have,welcomed,a,fight,herself
one,battle,to,put,an,end,to,this,misery
steel,on,steel,pink,snow,broken,shields,and,severed,limbs,and,it,would,all,be,done
the,next,day,the,king’s,scouts,chanced,upon,an,abandoned,crofters’,village,between,two,lakes,a,mean,and,meagre,place,no,more,than,a,few,huts,a,longhall,and,a,watchtower

it,was,well,past,moonrise,before,the,baggage,train,and,rear,guard,straggled,in
asha,was,amongst,them
there,are,fish,in,those,lakes,horpe,told,the,king
we’ll,cut,holes,in,the,ice
the,northmen,know,how,it’s,done
even,in,his,bulky,fur,cloak,and,heavy,armor,stannis,looked,like,a,man,with,one,foot,in,the,grave
what,little,flesh,he’d,carried,on,his,tall,spare,frame,at,deepwood,motte,had,melted,away,during,the,march
the,shape,of,his,skull,could,be,seen,under,his,skin,and,his,jaw,was,clenched,so,hard,asha,feared,his,teeth,might,shatter

but,we,march,at,first,light
yet,when,light,came,the,camp,woke,to,snow,and,silence
the,sky,turned,from,black,to,white,and,seemed,no,brighter
asha,greyjoy,awoke,cramped,and,cold,beneath,the,pile,of,sleeping,furs,listening,to,the,she-bear’s,snores
she,had,never,known,a,woman,to,snore,so,loudly,but,she,had,grown,used,to,it,whilst,on,the,march,and,even,took,some,comfort,in,it,now
it,was,the,silence,that,troubled,her
no,trumpets,blew,to,rouse,the,men,to,mount,up,form,column,prepare,to,march
no,warhorns,summoned,forth,the,northmen
something,is,wrong
asha,crawled,out,from,under,her,sleeping,furs,and,pushed,her,way,out,of,the,tent,knocking,aside,the,wall,of,snow,that,had,sealed,them,in,during,the,night
her,irons,clanked,as,she,climbed,to,her,feet,and,took,a,breath,of,the,icy,morning,air
the,snow,was,still,falling,even,more,heavily,than,when,she’d,crawled,inside,the,tent
the,lakes,had,vanished,and,the,woods,as,well
she,could,see,the,shapes,of,other,tents,and,lean-tos,and,the,fuzzy,orange,glow,of,the,beacon,fire,burning,atop,the,watchtower,but,not,the,tower,itself
the,storm,had,swallowed,the,rest
somewhere,ahead,roose,bolton,awaited,them,behind,the,walls,of,winterfell,but,stannis,baratheon’s,host,sat,snowbound,and,unmoving,walled,in,by,ice,and,snow,starving
daenerys,the,candle,was,almost,gone
less,than,an,inch,remained,jutting,from,a,pool,of,warm,melted,wax,to,cast,its,light,over,the,queen’s,bed
the,flame,had,begun,to,gutter
it,will,go,out,before,much,longer,dany,realized,and,when,it,does,another,night,will,be,at,its,end
dawn,always,came,too,soon
she,had,not,slept,could,not,sleep,would,not,sleep
she,had,not,even,dared,to,close,her,eyes,for,fear,it,would,be,morning,when,she,opened,them,again
if,only,she,had,the,power,she,would,have,made,their,nights,go,on,forever,but,the,best,that,she,could,do,was,stay,awake,to,try,and,savor,every,last,sweet,moment,before,daybreak,turned,them,into,no,more,than,fading,memories
beside,her,daario,naharis,was,sleeping,as,peacefully,as,a,newborn,babe
he,had,a,gift,for,sleeping,he’d,boasted,smiling,in,that,cocksure,way,of,his
in,the,field,he,would,sleep,in,the,saddle,oft,as,not,he,claimed,so,as,to,be,well,rested,should,he,come,upon,a,battle
sun,or,storm,it,made,no,matter
a,warrior,who,cannot,sleep,soon,has,no,strength,to,fight,he,said
he,was,never,vexed,by,nightmares,either
when,dany,told,him,how,serwyn,of,the,mirror,shield,was,haunted,by,the,ghosts,of,all,the,knights,he’d,killed,daario,only,laughed
if,the,ones,i,killed,come,bother,me,i,will,kill,them,all,again
he,has,a,sellsword’s,conscience,she,realized,then
that,is,to,say,none,at,all
daario,lay,upon,his,stomach,the,light,linen,coverlets,tangled,about,his,long,legs,his,face,half-buried,in,the,pillows
dany,ran,her,hand,down,his,back,tracing,the,line,of,his,spine
his,skin,was,smooth,beneath,her,touch,almost,hairless
his,skin,is,silk,and,satin
she,loved,the,feel,of,him,beneath,her,fingers
she,loved,to,run,her,fingers,through,his,hair,to,knead,the,ache,from,his,calves,after,a,long,day,in,the,saddle,to,cup,his,cock,and,feel,it,harden,against,her,palm
if,she,had,been,some,ordinary,woman,she,would,gladly,have,spent,her,whole,life,touching,daario,tracing,his,scars,and,making,him,tell,her,how,he’d,come,by,every,one
i,would,give,up,my,crown,if,he,asked,it,of,me,dany,thought,but,he,had,not,asked,it,and,never,would
daario,might,whisper,words,of,love,when,the,two,of,them,were,as,one,but,she,knew,it,was,the,dragon,queen,he,loved
if,i,gave,up,my,crown,he,would,not,want,me
besides,kings,who,lost,their,crowns,oft,lost,their,heads,as,well,and,she,could,see,no,reason,why,it,would,be,any,different,for,a,queen
the,candle,flickered,one,last,time,and,died,drowned,in,its,own,wax
darkness,swallowed,the,feather,bed,and,its,two,occupants,and,filled,every,corner,of,the,chamber
dany,wrapped,her,arms,around,her,captain,and,pressed,herself,against,his,back
she,drank,in,the,scent,of,him,savoring,the,warmth,of,his,flesh,the,feel,of,his,skin,against,her,own
remember,she,told,herself
remember,how,he,felt
she,kissed,him,on,his,shoulder
daario,rolled,toward,her,his,eyes,open
daenerys
he,smiled,a,lazy,smile
that,was,another,of,his,talents,he,woke,all,at,once,like,a,cat

khal,drogo,had,been,her,sun-and-stars,but,he,had,been,dead,so,long,that,daenerys,had,almost,forgotten,how,it,felt,to,love,and,be,loved
daario,had,helped,her,to,remember
i,was,dead,and,he,brought,me,back,to,life
i,was,asleep,and,he,woke,me
my,brave,captain
even,so,of,late,he,grew,too,bold
on,the,day,that,he,returned,from,his,latest,sortie,he,had,tossed,the,head,of,a,yunkish,lord,at,her,feet,and,kissed,her,in,the,hall,for,all,the,world,to,see,until,barristan,selmy,pulled,the,two,of,them,apart
ser,grandfather,had,been,so,wroth,that,dany,feared,blood,might,be,shed

ghiscari,men,like,to,prance,about,in,horns
they,make,them,from,their,own,hair,with,combs,and,wax,and,irons
daario,found,his,breeches,and,pulled,them,on
he,did,not,trouble,himself,with,smallclothes
once,i,am,wed,it,will,be,high,treason,to,desire,me
dany,pulled,the,coverlet,up,over,her,breasts
then,i,must,be,a,traitor
he,slipped,a,blue,silk,tunic,over,his,head,and,straightened,the,prongs,of,his,beard,with,his,fingers
he,had,dyed,it,afresh,for,her,taking,it,from,purple,back,to,blue,as,it,had,been,when,first,she,met,him
i,smell,of,you,he,said,sniffing,at,his,fingers,and,grinning
dany,loved,the,way,his,gold,tooth,gleamed,when,he,grinned
she,loved,the,fine,hairs,on,his,chest
she,loved,the,strength,in,his,arms,the,sound,of,his,laughter,the,way,he,would,always,look,into,her,eyes,and,say,her,name,as,he,slid,his,cock,inside,her
you,are,beautiful,she,blurted,as,she,watched,him,don,his,riding,boots,and,lace,them,up
some,days,he,let,her,do,that,for,him,but,not,today,it,seemed
that’s,done,with,too
not,beautiful,enough,to,marry
daario,took,his,sword,belt,off,the,peg,where,he,had,hung,it
where,are,you,going

my,new,men,do,not,believe,that,you,are,real
the,ones,who,came,over,from,the,windblown
bred,and,born,in,westeros,most,of,them,full,of,tales,about,targaryens
they,want,to,see,one,with,their,own,eyes
the,frog,has,a,gift,for,you

i,told,him,he,could,give,his,gift,to,me,and,i’d,deliver,it,but,he,wouldn’t,have,it
oh,a,clever,frog

daario,stroked,his,gilded,mustachio
would,i,steal,from,my,sweet,queen
if,it,were,a,gift,worthy,of,you,i,would,have,put,it,into,your,soft,hands,myself
as,a,token,of,your,love
as,to,that,i,will,not,say,but,i,told,him,that,he,could,give,it,to,you
you,would,not,make,a,liar,of,daario,naharis
dany,was,helpless,to,refuse
as,you,wish
bring,your,frog,to,court,tomorrow
the,others,too
the,westerosi
it,would,be,nice,to,hear,the,common,tongue,from,someone,besides,ser,barristan
as,my,queen,commands
daario,bowed,deeply,grinned,and,took,his,leave,his,cloak,swirling,behind,him
dany,sat,amongst,the,rumpled,bedclothes,with,her,arms,about,her,knees,so,forlorn,that,she,did,not,hear,when,missandei,came,creeping,in,with,bread,and,milk,and,figs
your,grace
are,you,unwell
in,the,black,of,night,this,one,heard,you,scream
dany,took,a,fig
it,was,black,and,plump,still,moist,with,dew
will,hizdahr,ever,make,me,scream
it,was,the,wind,that,you,heard,screaming
she,took,a,bite,but,the,fruit,had,lost,its,savor,now,that,daario,was,gone
sighing,she,rose,and,called,to,irri,for,a,robe,then,wandered,out,onto,her,terrace
her,foes,were,all,about,her
there,were,never,less,than,a,dozen,ships,drawn,up,on,the,shore
some,days,there,were,as,many,as,a,hundred,when,the,soldiers,were,disembarking
the,yunkai’i,were,even,bringing,in,wood,by,sea
behind,their,ditches,they,were,building,catapults,scorpions,tall,trebuchets
on,still,nights,she,could,hear,the,hammers,ringing,through,the,warm,dry,air
no,siege,towers,though
no,battering,rams
they,would,not,try,to,take,meereen,by,storm
they,would,wait,behind,their,siege,lines,flinging,stones,at,her,until,famine,and,disease,had,brought,her,people,to,their,knees
hizdahr,will,bring,me,peace
he,must
that,night,her,cooks,roasted,her,a,kid,with,dates,and,carrots,but,dany,could,only,eat,a,bite,of,it
the,prospect,of,wrestling,with,meereen,once,more,left,her,feeling,weary
sleep,came,hard,even,when,daario,came,back,so,drunk,that,he,could,hardly,stand
beneath,her,coverlets,she,tossed,and,turned,dreaming,that,hizdahr,was,kissing,her,but,his,lips,were,blue,and,bruised,and,when,he,thrust,himself,inside,her,his,manhood,was,cold,as,ice
she,sat,up,with,her,hair,disheveled,and,the,bedclothes,atangle
her,captain,slept,beside,her,yet,she,was,alone
she,wanted,to,shake,him,wake,him,make,him,hold,her,fuck,her,help,her,forget,but,she,knew,that,if,she,did,he,would,only,smile,and,yawn,and,say,it,was,just,a,dream,my,queen
go,back,to,sleep
instead,she,slipped,into,a,hooded,robe,and,stepped,out,onto,her,terrace
she,went,to,the,parapet,and,stood,there,gazing,down,upon,the,city,as,she,had,done,a,hundred,times,before
it,will,never,be,my,city
it,will,never,be,my,home
the,pale,pink,light,of,dawn,found,her,still,out,on,her,terrace,asleep,upon,the,grass,beneath,a,blanket,of,fine,dew

summon,the,first,petitioner
it,had,been,so,long,since,she,last,held,court,that,the,crush,of,cases,was,almost,overwhelming
the,back,of,the,hall,was,a,solid,press,of,people,and,scuffles,broke,out,over,precedence
inevitably,it,was,galazza,galare,who,stepped,forward,her,head,held,high,her,face,hidden,behind,a,shimmering,green,veil
your,radiance,it,might,be,best,were,we,to,speak,in,private

she,has,courage,i,grant,that,but,if,she,thinks,i,am,about,to,suffer,another,scolding,she,could,not,be,more,wrong
the,treachery,of,brown,ben,plumm,has,shocked,us,all,she,said,but,your,warning,comes,too,late

she,sat,upon,her,cushions,listening,one,foot,jiggling,with,impatience
jhiqui,brought,a,platter,of,figs,and,ham,at,midday
there,seemed,to,be,no,end,to,the,petitioners
for,every,two,she,sent,off,smiling,one,left,redeyed,or,muttering
it,was,close,to,sunset,before,daario,naharis,appeared,with,his,new,stormcrows,the,westerosi,who,had,come,over,to,him,from,the,windblown
dany,found,herself,glancing,at,them,as,yet,another,petitioner,droned,on,and,on
these,are,my,people
i,am,their,rightful,queen

plunder
for,the,most,part,their,clothes,were,plainly,made,and,showed,signs,of,hard,wear
when,daario,brought,them,forward,she,saw,that,one,of,them,was,a,woman,big,and,blond,and,all,in,mail
pretty,meris,her,captain,named,her,though,pretty,was,the,last,thing,dany,would,have,called,her
she,was,six,feet,tall,and,earless,with,a,slit,nose,deep,scars,in,both,cheeks,and,the,coldest,eyes,the,queen,had,ever,seen
as,for,the,rest,hugh,hungerford,was,slim,and,saturnine,long-legged,long-faced,clad,in,faded,finery
webber,was,short,and,muscular,with,spiders,tattooed,across,his,head,and,chest,and,arms

he,bit,off,half,his,tongue,in,his,first,battle,hungerford,explained,to,her
the,dornishmen,seemed,different

a,scrap,of,writing
daario,snatched,the,parchment,out,of,the,dornishman’s,hands,and,unrolled,it,squinting,at,the,seals,and,signatures
very,pretty,all,the,gold,and,ribbons,but,i,do,not,read,your,westerosi,scratchings

daario,please,you,must,not,tease,me

the,parchment,was,written,in,the,common,tongue
the,queen,unrolled,it,slowly,studying,the,seals,and,signatures
when,she,saw,the,name,ser,willem,darry,her,heart,beat,a,little,faster

no,doubt,that,was,why,prince,doran,chose,to,keep,the,pact,a,secret,suggested,daenerys
if,my,brother,viserys,had,known,that,he,had,a,dornish,princess,waiting,for,him,he,would,have,crossed,to,sunspear,as,soon,as,he,was,old,enough,to,wed,and,thereby,brought,robert’s,warhammer,down,upon,himself,and,dorne,as,well,said,frog

why,do,you,laugh

smiling,at,the,dornish,knights,she,switched,back,to,the,common,tongue

daario,brushed,his,thumbs,across,his,sword,hilts,and,smiled,dangerously
skahaz,scowled,as,only,he,could,scowl
this,boy,might,serve,for,dorne,but,meereen,needs,a,king,of,ghiscari,blood
i,know,of,this,dorne,said,reznak,mo,reznak

fifty,thousand
mocked,daario
i,count,three
enough,daenerys,said

as,you,wish,your,radiance
the,queen,rose
then,we,are,done,for,now
daario,and,ser,barristan,followed,her,up,the,steps,to,her,apartments
this,changes,everything,the,old,knight,said
this,changes,nothing,dany,said,as,irri,removed,her,crown
what,good,are,three,men
three,knights,said,selmy
three,liars,daario,said,darkly
they,deceived,me
and,bought,you,too,i,do,not,doubt
he,did,not,trouble,to,deny,it
dany,unrolled,the,parchment,and,examined,it,again
braavos
this,was,done,in,braavos,while,we,were,living,in,the,house,with,the,red,door
why,did,that,make,her,feel,so,strange
she,found,herself,remembering,her,nightmare
sometimes,there,is,truth,in,dreams
could,hizdahr,zo,loraq,be,working,for,the,warlocks,was,that,what,the,dream,had,meant
could,the,dream,have,been,a,sending
were,the,gods,telling,her,to,put,hizdahr,aside,and,wed,this,dornish,prince,instead
something,tickled,at,her,memory
ser,barristan,what,are,the,arms,of,house,martell
a,sun,in,splendor,transfixed,by,a,spear
the,sun’s,son
a,shiver,went,through,her
shadows,and,whispers
what,else,had,quaithe,said
the,pale,mare,and,the,sun’s,son
there,was,a,lion,in,it,too,and,a,dragon
or,am,i,the,dragon
beware,the,perfumed,seneschal
that,she,remembered
dreams,and,prophecies
why,must,they,always,be,in,riddles
i,hate,this
oh,leave,me,ser
tomorrow,is,my,wedding,day
that,night,daario,had,her,every,way,a,man,can,have,a,woman,and,she,gave,herself,to,him,willingly
the,last,time,as,the,sun,was,coming,up,she,used,her,mouth,to,make,him,hard,again,as,doreah,had,taught,her,long,ago,then,rode,him,so,wildly,that,his,wound,began,to,bleed,again,and,for,one,sweet,heartbeat,she,could,not,tell,whether,he,was,inside,of,her,or,her,inside,of,him
but,when,the,sun,rose,upon,her,wedding,day,so,did,daario,naharis,donning,his,clothes,and,buckling,on,his,sword,belt,with,its,gleaming,golden,wantons
where,are,you,going

do,i,have,your,leave,to,go
no
she,wanted,him,to,stay,and,hold,her
one,day,he,will,go,and,not,return,she,thought
one,day,some,archer,will,put,an,arrow,through,his,chest,or,ten,men,will,fall,on,him,with,spears,and,swords,and,axes,ten,would-be,heroes
five,of,them,would,die,but,that,would,not,make,her,grief,easier,to,bear
one,day,i,will,lose,him,as,i,lost,my,sun-andstars
but,please,gods,not,today
come,back,to,bed,and,kiss,me
no,one,had,ever,kissed,her,like,daario,naharis
i,am,your,queen,and,i,command,you,to,fuck,me
she,had,meant,it,playfully,but,daario’s,eyes,hardened,at,her,words
fucking,queens,is,king’s,work
your,noble,hizdahr,can,attend,to,that,once,you’re,wed,and,if,he,proves,to,be,too,highborn,for,such,sweaty,work,he,has,servants,who,will,be,pleased,to,do,that,for,him,as,well
or,perhaps,you,can,call,the,dornish,boy,into,your,bed,and,his,pretty,friend,as,well,why,not
he,strode,from,the,bedchamber
he,is,going,to,make,a,sortie,dany,realized,and,if,he,takes,ben,plumm’s,head,he’ll,walk,into,the,wedding,feast,and,throw,it,at,my,feet
seven,save,me
why,couldn’t,he,be,better,born
when,he,was,gone,missandei,brought,the,queen,a,simple,meal,of,goat,cheese,and,olives,with,raisins,for,a,sweet
your,grace,needs,more,than,wine,to,break,her,fast
you,are,such,a,tiny,thing,and,you,will,surely,need,your,strength,today
that,made,daenerys,laugh,coming,from,a,girl,so,small
she,relied,so,much,on,the,little,scribe,that,she,oft,forgot,that,missandei,had,only,turned,eleven
they,shared,the,food,together,on,her,terrace
as,dany,nibbled,on,an,olive,the,naathi,girl,gazed,at,her,with,eyes,like,molten,gold,and,said,it,is,not,too,late,to,tell,them,that,you,have,decided,not,to,wed,it,is,though,the,queen,thought,sadly
hizdahr’s,blood,is,ancient,and,noble
our,joining,will,join,my,freedmen,to,his,people
when,we,become,as,one,so,will,our,city
your,grace,does,not,love,the,noble,hizdahr
this,one,thinks,you,would,sooner,have,another,for,your,husband
i,must,not,think,of,daario,today
a,queen,loves,where,she,must,not,where,she,will
her,appetite,had,left,her
take,this,food,away,she,told,missandei

it,was,long,ago
your,grace,would,not,know,them
you,know,though

the,old,knight,inclined,his,head
the,queen,your,mother,was,always,mindful,of,her,duty
he,was,handsome,in,his,gold-and-silver,armor,his,white,cloak,streaming,from,his,shoulders,but,he,sounded,like,a,man,in,pain,as,if,every,word,were,a,stone,he,had,to,pass
as,a,girl,though,she,was,once,smitten,with,a,young,knight,from,the,stormlands,who,wore,her,favor,at,a,tourney,and,named,her,queen,of,love,and,beauty
a,brief,thing
what,happened,to,this,knight
he,put,away,his,lance,the,day,your,lady,mother,wed,your,father
afterward,he,became,most,pious,and,was,heard,to,say,that,only,the,maiden,could,replace,queen,rhaella,in,his,heart
his,passion,was,impossible,of,course
a,landed,knight,is,no,fit,consort,for,a,princess,of,royal,blood
and,daario,naharis,is,only,a,sellsword,not,fit,to,buckle,on,the,golden,spurs,of,even,a,landed,knight
and,my,father
was,there,some,woman,he,loved,better,than,his,queen
ser,barristan,shifted,in,the,saddle

i,never,knew,my,father
i,want,to,know,everything,about,him
the,good,and,the,rest
as,you,command
the,white,knight,chose,his,words,with,care
prince,aerys,as,a,youth,he,was,taken,with,a,certain,lady,of,casterly,rock,a,cousin,of,tywin,lannister
when,she,and,tywin,wed,your,father,drank,too,much,wine,at,the,wedding,feast,and,was,heard,to,say,that,it,was,a,great,pity,that,the,lord’s,right,to,the,first,night,had,been,abolished
a,drunken,jape,no,more,but,tywin,lannister,was,not,a,man,to,forget,such,words,or,the,the,liberties,your,father,took,during,the,bedding

i,have,said,too,much,your,grace
i,gracious,queen,well,met
another,procession,had,come,up,beside,her,own,and,hizdahr,zo,loraq,was,smiling,at,her,from,his,own,sedan,chair
my,king
dany,wondered,where,daario,naharis,was,what,he,was,doing
if,this,were,a,story,he,would,gallop,up,just,as,we,reached,the,temple,to,challenge,hizdahr,for,my,hand
side,by,side,the,queen’s,procession,and,hizdahr,zo,loraq’s,made,their,slow,way,across,meereen,until,finally,the,temple,of,the,graces,loomed,up,before,them,its,golden,domes,flashing,in,the,sun
how,beautiful,the,queen,tried,to,tell,herself,but,inside,her,was,some,foolish,little,girl,who,could,not,help,but,look,about,for,daario
if,he,loved,you,he,would,come,and,carry,you,off,at,swordpoint,as,rhaegar,carried,off,his,northern,girl,the,girl,in,her,insisted,but,the,queen,knew,that,was,folly
even,if,her,captain,was,mad,enough,to,attempt,it,the,brazen,beasts,would,cut,him,down,before,he,got,within,a,hundred,yards,of,her
galazza,galare,awaited,them,outside,the,temple,doors,surrounded,by,her,sisters,in,white,and,pink,and,red,blue,and,gold,and,purple
there,are,fewer,than,there,were
dany,looked,for,ezzara,and,did,not,see,her
has,the,bloody,flux,taken,even,her
though,the,queen,had,let,the,astapori,starve,outside,her,walls,to,keep,the,bloody,flux,from,spreading,it,was,spreading,nonetheless
many,had,been,stricken,freedmen,sellswords,brazen,beasts,even,dothraki,though,as,yet,none,of,the,unsullied,had,been,touched

the,iron,bank,is,always,prudent,in,such,matters

the,matter,that,i,mean,to,put,to,him,is,too,delicate,to,entrust,to,letters
a,debt
what,else,could,it,be
his,own,debt
or,his,brother’s
the,banker,pressed,his,fingers,together
it,would,not,be,proper,for,me,to,discuss,lord,stannis’s,indebtedness,or,lack,of,same
as,to,king,robert,it,was,indeed,our,pleasure,to,assist,his,grace,in,his,need
for,so,long,as,robert,lived,all,was,well
now,however,the,iron,throne,has,ceased,all,repayment
could,the,lannisters,truly,be,so,foolish
you,cannot,mean,to,hold,stannis,responsible,for,his,brother’s,debts
the,debts,belong,to,the,iron,throne,tycho,declared,and,whosoever,sits,on,that,chair,must,pay,them
since,young,king,tommen,and,his,counsellors,have,become,so,obdurate,we,mean,to,broach,the,subject,with,king,stannis
should,he,prove,himself,more,worthy,of,our,trust,it,would,of,course,be,our,great,pleasure,to,lend,him,whatever,help,he,needs

much,of,this,jon,had,surmised,the,moment,he,learned,that,the,iron,bank,had,sent,an,envoy,to,the,wall

how,will,i,return,to,braavos
i,only,need,them,for,a,single,voyage
a,hazardous,voyage,i,assume

it,is,not,possible,my,lord
what,was,it,stannis,had,said,to,him
you,haggle,like,a,crone,with,a,codfish,lord,snow
did,lord,eddard,father,you,on,a,fishwife
perhaps,he,had,at,that
it,took,the,better,part,of,an,hour,before,the,impossible,became,possible,and,another,hour,before,they,could,agree,on,terms
the,flagon,of,mulled,wine,that,satin,delivered,helped,them,settle,the,more,nettlesome,points
by,the,time,jon,snow,signed,the,parchment,the,braavosi,drew,up,both,of,them,were,half-drunk,and,quite,unhappy
jon,thought,that,a,good,sign
the,three,braavosi,ships,would,bring,the,fleet,at,eastwatch,up,to,eleven,including,the,ibbenese,whaler,that,cotter,pyke,had,commandeered,on,jon’s,order,a,trading,galley,out,of,pentos,similarly,impressed,and,three,battered,lysene,warships,remnants,of,salladhor,saan’s,former,fleet,driven,back,north,by,the,autumn,storms
all,three,of,saan’s,ships,had,been,in,dire,need,of,refitting,but,by,now,the,work,should,be,complete
eleven,ships,was,no,wise,enough,but,if,he,waited,any,longer,the,free,folk,at,hardhome,would,be,dead,by,the,time,the,rescue,fleet,arrived
sail,now,or,not,at,all
whether,mother,mole,and,her,people,would,be,desperate,enough,to,entrust,their,lives,to,the,night’s,watch,though,the,day,had,darkened,by,the,time,he,and,tycho,nestoris,left,the,solar
snow,had,begun,to,fall
our,respite,was,a,brief,one,it,would,seem
jon,drew,his,cloak,about,himself,more,tightly
winter,is,nigh,upon,us
the,day,i,left,braavos,there,was,ice,on,the,canals
three,of,my,men,passed,through,braavos,not,long,ago,jon,told,him
an,old,maester,a,singer,and,a,young,steward
they,were,escorting,a,wildling,girl,and,her,child,to,oldtown
i,do,not,suppose,you,chanced,to,encounter,them
i,fear,not,my,lord

the,ships,of,the,iron,bank,moor,at,the,purple,harbor
if,you,wish,i,can,make,inquiries,after,them,when,i,return,home
no,need
by,now,they,should,be,safe,in,oldtown
let,us,hope,so
the,narrow,sea,is,perilous,this,time,of,year,and,of,late,there,have,been,troubling,reports,of,strange,ships,seen,amongst,the,stepstones
salladhor,saan
the,lysene,pirate
some,say,he,has,returned,to,his,old,haunts,this,is,so
and,lord,redwyne’s,war,fleet,creeps,through,the,broken,arm,as,well
on,its,way,home,no,doubt
but,these,men,and,their,ships,are,well-known,to,us
no,these,other,sails,from,farther,east,perhaps,one,hears,queer,talk,of,dragons
would,that,we,had,one,here
a,dragon,might,warm,things,up,a,bit
my,lord,jests
you,will,forgive,me,if,i,do,not,laugh
we,braavosi,are,descended,from,those,who,fled,valyria,and,the,wroth,of,its,dragonlords
we,do,not,jape,of,dragons
no,i,suppose,not
my,apologies,lord,tycho
none,is,required,lord,commander
now,i,find,that,i,am,hungry
lending,such,large,sums,of,gold,will,give,a,man,an,appetite
will,you,be,so,good,as,to,point,me,to,your,feast,hall
i,will,take,you,there,myself
jon,gestured
this,way
once,there,it,would,have,been,discourteous,not,to,break,bread,with,the,banker,so,jon,sent,satin,off,to,fetch,them,food
the,novelty,of,newcomers,had,brought,out,almost,all,the,men,who,were,not,on,duty,or,asleep,so,the,cellar,was,crowded,and,warm
the,queen,herself,was,absent,as,was,her,daughter
by,now,presumably,they,were,settling,into,the,king’s,tower
but,ser,brus,and,ser,malegorn,were,on,hand,entertaining,such,brothers,as,had,gathered,with,the,latest,tidings,from,eastwatch,and,beyond,the,sea
three,of,the,queen’s,ladies,sat,together,attended,by,their,serving,maids,and,a,dozen,admiring,men,of,the,night’s,watch
nearer,the,door,the,queen’s,hand,was,attacking,a,brace,of,capons,sucking,the,meat,off,the,bones,and,washing,down,each,bite,with,ale
when,he,espied,jon,snow,axell,florent,tossed,a,bone,aside,wiped,his,mouth,with,the,back,of,his,hand,and,sauntered,over
with,his,bowed,legs,barrel,chest,and,prominent,ears,he,presented,a,comical,appearance,but,jon,knew,better,than,to,laugh,at,him

in,the,evening,she,played,the,lying,game,with,the,waif,but,without,eyes,to,see,the,game,was,very,different
sometimes,all,she,had,to,go,on,was,tone,and,choice,of,words,other,times,the,waif,allowed,her,to,lay,hands,upon,her,face
at,first,the,game,was,much,much,harder,the,next,thing,to,impossible,but,just,when,she,was,near,the,point,of,screaming,with,frustration,it,all,became,much,easier
she,learned,to,hear,the,lies,to,feel,them,in,the,play,of,the,muscles,around,the,mouth,and,eyes
many,of,her,other,duties,had,remained,the,same,but,as,she,went,about,them,she,stumbled,over,furnishings,walked,into,walls,dropped,trays,got,hopelessly,helplessly,lost,inside,the,temple

one,of,her,duties,was,to,find,them,in,the,temple,every,morning,wherever,they,had,chosen,to,lie,down,and,close,their,eyes,after,drinking,from,the,pool
this,morning,she,found,two
one,man,had,died,at,the,feet,of,the,stranger,a,single,candle,flickering,above,him
she,could,feel,its,heat,and,the,scent,that,it,gave,off,tickled,her,nose
the,candle,burned,with,a,dark,red,flame,she,knew,for,those,with,eyes,the,corpse,would,have,seemed,awash,in,a,ruddy,glow
before,summoning,the,serving,men,to,carry,him,away,she,knelt,and,felt,his,face,tracing,the,line,of,his,jaw,brushing,her,fingers,across,his,cheeks,and,nose,touching,his,hair
curly,hair,and,thick
a,handsome,face,unlined
he,was,young

dying,bravos,oft,found,their,way,to,the,house,of,black,and,white,to,hasten,their,ends,but,this,man,had,no,wounds,that,she,could,find
the,second,body,was,that,of,an,old,woman
she,had,gone,to,sleep,upon,a,dreaming,couch,in,one,of,the,hidden,alcoves,where,special,candles,conjured,visions,of,things,loved,and,lost
a,sweet,death,and,a,gentle,one,the,kindly,man,was,fond,of,saying
her,fingers,told,her,that,the,old,woman,had,died,with,a,smile,on,her,face
she,had,not,been,dead,long
her,body,was,still,warm,to,the,touch

when,the,serving,men,arrived,to,bear,the,corpse,away,the,blind,girl,followed,them
she,let,their,footsteps,be,her,guide,but,when,they,made,their,descent,she,counted
she,knew,the,counts,of,all,the,steps,by,heart
under,the,temple,was,a,maze,of,vaults,and,tunnels,where,even,men,with,two,good,eyes,were,often,lost,but,the,blind,girl,had,learned,every,inch,of,it,and,she,had,her,stick,to,help,her,find,her,way,should,her,memory,falter

telling,one,coin,from,another,by,touch,alone,was,one,of,the,first,things,the,waif,had,taught,her,after,they,took,away,her,eyes
the,braavosi,coins,were,old,friends,she,need,only,brush,her,fingertips,across,their,faces,to,recognize,them

one,of,the,acolytes,she,supposed
she,did,not,remember,ever,hearing,his,voice,before,but,what,was,there,to,say,that,the,servants,of,the,many-faced,god,could,not,change,their,voices,as,easily,as,they,did,their,faces
besides,her,the,house,of,black,and,white,was,home,to,two,serving,men,three,acolytes,umma,the,cook,and,the,two,priests,that,she,called,the,waif,and,the,kindly,man

she,had,said,as,much,to,the,kindly,man
and,are,you,a,god,to,decide,who,should,live,and,who,should,die
he,asked,her

so,has,it,always,been,from,the,beginning
i,have,told,you,of,the,founding,of,our,order,of,how,the,first,of,us,answered,the,prayers,of,slaves,who,wished,for,death
the,gift,was,given,only,to,those,who,yearned,for,it,in,the,beginning,but,one,day,the,first,of,us,heard,a,slave,praying,not,for,his,own,death,but,for,his,master’s
so,fervently,did,he,desire,this,that,he,offered,all,he,had,that,his,prayer,might,be,answered
and,it,seemed,to,our,first,brother,that,this,sacrifice,would,be,pleasing,to,him,of,many,faces,so,that,night,he,granted,the,prayer
then,he,went,to,the,slave,and,said,you,offered,all,you,had,for,this,man’s,death,but,slaves,have,nothing,but,their,lives
that,is,what,the,god,desires,of,you
for,the,rest,of,your,days,on,earth,you,will,serve,him,’,and,from,that,moment,we,were,two

the,waif,had,shaved,her,head,for,her,when,they,took,her,eyes,a,mummer’s,cut,she,called,it,since,many,mummers,did,the,same,so,their,wigs,might,fit,them,better
but,it,worked,for,beggars,too,and,helped,to,keep,their,heads,free,from,fleas,and,lice
more,than,a,wig,was,needed,though
i,could,cover,you,with,weeping,sores,the,waif,said,but,then,innkeeps,and,taverners,would,chase,you,from,their,doors

she,had,learned,early,on,that,innkeeps,and,taverners,were,more,apt,to,tolerate,her,presence,if,it,was,not,a,frequent,occurrence
last,night,she,had,spent,outside,the,inn,of,the,green,eel,so,tonight,she,turned,right,instead,of,left,after,the,bloody,bridge,and,made,her,way,to,pynto’s,at,the,other,end,of,ragman’s,harbor,right,on,the,edge,of,the,drowned,town
loud,and,smelly,he,might,be,but,pynto,had,a,soft,heart,under,all,his,unwashed,clothes,and,bluster
oft,as,not,he,would,let,her,come,inside,where,it,was,warm,if,the,place,was,not,too,crowded,and,now,and,again,he,might,even,let,her,have,a,mug,of,ale,and,a,crust,of,food,whilst,regaling,her,with,his,stories
in,his,younger,days,pynto,had,been,the,most,notorious,pirate,in,the,stepstones,to,hear,him,tell,it,he,loved,nothing,better,than,to,speak,at,great,length,about,his,exploits
she,was,in,luck,tonight
the,tavern,was,near,empty,and,she,was,able,to,claim,a,quiet,corner,not,far,from,the,fire
no,sooner,had,she,settled,there,and,crossed,her,legs,than,something,brushed,up,against,her,thigh

braavos,was,full,of,cats,and,no,place,more,than,pynto’s
the,old,pirate,believed,they,brought,good,luck,and,kept,his,tavern,free,of,vermin
you,know,me,don’t,you
she,whispered
cats,were,not,fooled,by,a,mummer’s,moles
they,remembered,cat,of,the,canals
it,was,a,good,night,for,the,blind,girl
pynto,was,in,a,jolly,mood,and,gave,her,a,cup,of,watered,wine,a,chunk,of,stinky,cheese,and,half,of,an,eel,pie
pynto,is,a,very,good,man,he,announced,then,settled,down,to,tell,her,of,the,time,he,seized,the,spice,ship,a,tale,she,had,heard,a,dozen,times,before
as,the,hours,passed,the,tavern,filled
pynto,was,soon,too,busy,to,pay,her,any,mind,but,several,of,his,regulars,dropped,coins,into,her,begging,bowl
other,tables,were,occupied,by,strangers,ibbenese,whalers,who,reeked,of,blood,and,blubber,a,pair,of,bravos,with,scented,oil,in,their,hair,a,fat,man,out,of,lorath,who,complained,that,pynto’s,booths,were,too,small,for,his,belly
and,later,three,lyseni,sailors,off,the,goodheart,a,storm-wracked,galley,that,had,limped,into,braavos,last,night,and,been,seized,this,morning,by,the,sealord’s,guards
the,lyseni,took,the,table,nearest,to,the,fire,and,spoke,quietly,over,cups,of,black,tar,rum,keeping,their,voices,low,so,no,one,could,overhear
but,she,was,no,one,and,she,heard,most,every,word
and,for,a,time,it,seemed,that,she,could,see,them,too,through,the,slitted,yellow,eyes,of,the,tomcat,purring,in,her,lap
one,was,old,and,one,was,young,and,one,had,lost,an,ear,but,all,three,had,the,white-blond,hair,and,smooth,fair,skin,of,lys,where,the,blood,of,the,old,freehold,still,ran,strong
the,next,morning,when,the,kindly,man,asked,her,what,three,things,she,knew,that,she,had,not,known,before,she,was,ready
i,know,why,the,sealord,seized,the,goodheart
she,was,carrying,slaves
hundreds,of,slaves,women,and,children,roped,together,in,her,hold
braavos,had,been,founded,by,escaped,slaves,and,the,slave,trade,was,forbidden,here
i,know,where,the,slaves,came,from
they,were,wildlings,from,westeros,from,a,place,called,hardhome
an,old,ruined,place,accursed
old,nan,had,told,her,tales,of,hardhome,back,at,winterfell,when,she,had,still,been,arya,stark
after,the,big,battle,where,the,king-beyond-the-wall,was,killed,the,wildlings,ran,away,and,this,woods,witch,said,that,if,they,went,to,hardhome,ships,would,come,and,carry,them,away,to,someplace,warm
but,no,ships,came,except,these,two,lyseni,pirates,goodheart,and,elephant,that,had,been,driven,north,by,a,storm
they,dropped,anchor,off,hardhome,to,make,repairs,and,saw,the,wildlings,but,there,were,thousands,and,they,didn’t,have,room,for,all,of,them,so,they,said,they’d,just,take,the,women,and,the,children
the,wildlings,had,nothing,to,eat,so,the,men,sent,out,their,wives,and,daughters,but,as,soon,as,the,ships,were,out,to,sea,the,lyseni,drove,them,below,and,roped,them,up
they,meant,to,sell,them,all,in,lys
only,then,they,ran,into,another,storm,and,the,ships,were,parted
the,goodheart,was,so,damaged,her,captain,had,no,choice,but,to,put,in,here,but,the,elephant,may,have,made,it,back,to,lys
the,lyseni,at,pynto’s,think,that,she’ll,return,with,more,ships
the,price,of,slaves,is,rising,they,said,and,there,are,thousands,more,women,and,children,at,hardhome
it,is,good,to,know
this,is,two

and,how,could,a,blind,girl,know,that
i,saw,you
i,gave,you,three
i,don’t,need,to,give,you,four
maybe,on,the,morrow,she,would,tell,him,about,the,cat,that,had,followed,her,home,last,night,from,pynto’s,the,cat,that,was,hiding,in,the,rafters,looking,down,on,them
or,maybe,not
if,he,could,have,secrets,so,could,she
that,evening,umma,served,salt-crusted,crabs,for,supper
when,her,cup,was,presented,to,her,the,blind,girl,wrinkled,her,nose,and,drank,it,down,in,three,long,gulps
then,she,gasped,and,dropped,the,cup
her,tongue,was,on,fire,and,when,she,gulped,a,cup,of,wine,the,flames,spread,down,her,throat,and,up,her,nose

by,midday,most,of,winterfell,had,heard,many,from,the,lips,of,ramsay,bolton,whose,boy,yellow,dick,had,been
when,we,find,the,man,who,did,this,lord,ramsay,promised,i,will,flay,the,skin,off,him,cook,it,crisp,as,crackling,and,make,him,eat,it,every,bite
word,went,out,that,the,killer’s,name,would,be,worth,a,golden,dragon
the,reek,within,the,great,hall,was,palpable,by,eventide
with,hundreds,of,horses,dogs,and,men,squeezed,underneath,one,roof,the,floors,slimy,with,mud,and,melting,snow,horseshit,dog,turds,and,even,human,feces,the,air,redolent,with,the,smells,of,wet,dog,wet,wool,and,sodden,horse,blankets,there,was,no,comfort,to,be,found,amongst,the,crowded,benches,but,there,was,food
the,cooks,served,up,great,slabs,of,fresh,horsemeat,charred,outside,and,bloody,red,within,with,roast,onions,and,neeps,and,for,once,the,common,soldiers,ate,as,well,as,the,lords,and,knights
the,horsemeat,was,too,tough,for,the,ruins,of,theon’s,teeth
his,attempts,to,chew,gave,him,excruciating,pain
so,he,mashed,the,neeps,and,onions,up,together,with,the,flat,of,his,dagger,and,made,a,meal,of,that,then,cut,the,horse,up,very,small,sucked,on,each,piece,and,spat,it,out
that,way,at,least,he,had,the,taste,and,some,nourishment,from,the,grease,and,blood
the,bone,was,beyond,him,though,so,he,tossed,it,to,the,dogs,and,watched,grey,jeyne,make,off,with,it,whilst,sara,and,willow,snapped,at,her,heels
lord,bolton,commanded,abel,to,play,for,them,as,they,ate
the,bard,sang,iron,lances,then,the,winter,maid
when,barbrey,dustin,asked,for,something,more,cheerful,he,gave,them,the,queen,took,off,her,sandal,the,king,took,off,his,crown,and,the,bear,and,the,maiden,fair
the,freys,joined,the,singing,and,even,a,few,northmen,slammed,their,fists,on,the,table,to,the,chorus,bellowing,a,bear
a,bear
but,the,noise,frightened,the,horses,so,the,singers,soon,let,off,and,the,music,died,away
the,bastard’s,boys,gathered,beneath,a,wall,sconce,where,a,torch,was,flaming,smokily

his,tormentors,would,not,follow,him,outside
not,so,long,as,there,was,food,and,drink,within,willing,women,and,warm,fires
as,he,left,the,hall,abel,was,singing,the,maids,that,bloom,in,spring
outside,the,snow,was,coming,down,so,heavily,that,theon,could,not,see,more,than,three,feet,ahead,of,him
he,found,himself,alone,in,a,white,wilderness,walls,of,snow,looming,up,to,either,side,of,him,chest,high
when,he,raised,his,head,the,snowflakes,brushed,his,cheeks,like,cold,soft,kisses
he,could,hear,the,sound,of,music,from,the,hall,behind,him
a,soft,song,now,and,sad
for,a,moment,he,felt,almost,at,peace
farther,on,he,came,upon,a,man,striding,in,the,opposite,direction,a,hooded,cloak,flapping,behind,him

theon,trudged,through,the,storm,until,his,arms,and,legs,were,caked,with,snow,and,his,hands,and,feet,had,gone,numb,from,cold,then,climbed,to,the,battlements,of,the,inner,wall,again

his,shrieks,mingled,in,the,morning,air,with,the,laughter,of,camp,followers,and,the,curses,of,those,who’d,wagered,good,coin,that,the,slinger,would,miss
penny,looked,away,but,nurse,grasped,her,under,the,chin,and,twisted,her,head,back,around
watch,he,commanded
you,too,bear
jorah,mormont,raised,his,head,and,stared,at,nurse
tyrion,could,see,the,tightness,in,his,arms
he’s,going,to,throttle,him,and,that,will,be,the,end,for,all,of,us
but,the,knight,only,grimaced,then,turned,to,watch,the,bloody,show
to,the,east,the,massive,brick,walls,of,meereen,shimmered,through,the,morning,heat
that,was,the,refuge,these,poor,fools,had,hoped,to,reach
how,long,will,it,remain,a,refuge,though
all,three,of,the,would-be,escapees,were,dead,before,nurse,gathered,up,the,reins,again
the,mule,cart,rumbled,on
their,master’s,camp,was,south,and,east,of,the,harridan,almost,in,its,shadow,and,spread,over,several,acres
the,humble,tent,of,yezzan,zo,qaggaz,proved,to,be,a,palace,of,lemon-colored,silk
gilded,harpies,stood,atop,the,center,poles,of,each,of,its,nine,peaked,roofs,shining,in,the,sun
lesser,tents,ringed,it,on,all,sides
those,are,the,dwellings,of,our,noble,master’s,cooks,concubines,and,warriors,and,a,few,less-favored,kinsmen,nurse,told,them,but,you,little,darlings,shall,have,the,rare,privilege,of,sleeping,within,yezzan’s,own,pavilion
it,pleases,him,to,keep,his,treasures,close
he,frowned,at,mormont
not,you,bear
you,are,big,and,ugly,you,will,be,chained,outside
the,knight,did,not,respond
first,all,of,you,must,be,fitted,for,collars
the,collars,were,made,of,iron,lightly,gilded,to,make,them,glitter,in,the,light
yezzan’s,name,was,incised,into,the,metal,in,valyrian,glyphs,and,a,pair,of,tiny,bells,were,affixed,below,the,ears,so,the,wearer’s,every,step,produced,a,merry,little,tinkling,sound
jorah,mormont,accepted,his,collar,in,a,sullen,silence,but,penny,began,to,cry,as,the,armorer,was,fastening,her,own,into,place
it’s,so,heavy,she,complained
tyrion,squeezed,her,hand
it’s,solid,gold,he,lied
in,westeros,highborn,ladies,dream,of,such,a,necklace
better,a,collar,than,a,brand
a,collar,can,be,removed
he,remembered,shae,and,the,way,the,golden,chain,had,glimmered,as,he,twisted,it,tighter,and,tighter,about,her,throat
afterward,nurse,had,ser,jorah’s,chains,fastened,to,a,stake,near,the,cookfire,whilst,he,escorted,the,two,dwarfs,inside,the,master’s,pavilion,and,showed,them,where,they,would,sleep,in,a,carpeted,alcove,separated,from,the,main,tent,by,walls,of,yellow,silk
they,would,share,this,space,with,yezzan’s,other,treasures,a,boy,with,twisted,hairy,goat,legs,a,two-headed,girl,out,of,mantarys,a,bearded,woman,and,a,willowy,creature,called,sweets,who,dressed,in,moonstones,and,myrish,lace
you,are,trying,to,decide,if,i’m,a,man,or,woman,sweets,said,when,she,was,brought,before,the,dwarfs
then,she,lifted,her,skirts,and,showed,them,what,was,underneath
i’m,both,and,master,loves,me,best
a,grotesquerie,tyrion,realized
somewhere,some,god,is,laughing
lovely,he,said,to,sweets,who,had,purple,hair,and,violet,eyes,but,we,were,hoping,to,be,the,pretty,ones,for,once
sweets,sniggered,but,nurse,was,not,amused
save,your,japes,for,this,evening,when,you,perform,for,our,noble,master
if,you,please,him,you,will,be,well,rewarded
if,not,he,slapped,tyrion,across,the,face
you,will,want,to,be,careful,with,nurse,said,sweets,when,the,overseer,had,departed
he,is,the,only,true,monster,here
the,bearded,woman,spoke,an,incomprehensible,variety,of,ghiscari,the,goat,boy,some,guttural,sailor’s,pidgin,called,the,trade,talk
the,two-headed,girl,was,feebleminded,one,head,was,no,bigger,than,an,orange,and,did,not,speak,at,all,the,other,had,filed,teeth,and,was,like,to,growl,at,anyone,who,came,too,close,to,her,cage
but,sweets,was,fluent,in,four,tongues,one,of,them,high,valyrian
what,is,the,master,like
penny,asked,anxiously
his,eyes,are,yellow,and,he,stinks,said,sweets
ten,years,ago,he,went,to,sothoros,and,he,has,been,rotting,from,the,inside,out,ever,since
make,him,forget,that,he,is,dying,even,for,a,little,while,and,he,can,be,most,generous
deny,him,nothing
they,had,only,the,afternoon,to,learn,the,ways,of,chattel
yezzan’s,body,slaves,filled,a,tub,with,hot,water,and,the,dwarfs,were,allowed,to,bathe,penny,first,then,tyrion
afterward,another,slave,spread,a,stinging,ointment,across,the,cuts,on,his,back,to,keep,them,from,mortifying,then,covered,them,with,a,cool,poultice
penny’s,hair,was,cut,and,tyrion’s,beard,got,a,trim
they,were,given,soft,slippers,and,fresh,clothing,plain,but,clean
as,evening,fell,nurse,returned,to,tell,them,that,it,was,time,to,don,their,mummer’s,plate
yezzan,would,be,hosting,the,yunkish,supreme,commander,the,noble,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,and,they,would,be,expected,to,perform
shall,we,unchain,your,bear
not,this,night,tyrion,said
let,us,joust,for,our,master,first,and,save,the,bear,for,some,other,time
just,so
after,your,capers,are,concluded,you,will,help,serve,and,pour
see,that,you,do,not,spill,on,the,guests,or,it,will,go,ill,for,you
a,juggler,began,the,evening’s,frolics
then,came,a,trio,of,energetic,tumblers
after,them,the,goat-legged,boy,came,out,and,did,a,grotesque,jig,whilst,one,of,yurkhaz’s,slaves,played,on,a,bone,flute
tyrion,had,half,a,mind,to,ask,him,if,he,knew,the,rains,of,castamere
as,they,waited,their,own,turn,to,perform,he,watched,yezzan,and,his,guests
the,human,prune,in,the,place,of,honor,was,evidently,the,yunkish,supreme,commander,who,looked,about,as,formidable,as,a,loose,stool
a,dozen,other,yunkish,lords,attended,him
two,sellsword,captains,were,on,hand,as,well,each,accompanied,by,a,dozen,men,of,his,company
one,was,an,elegant,pentoshi,grey-haired,and,clad,in,silk,but,for,his,cloak,a,ragged,thing,sewn,from,dozens,of,strips,of,torn,bloodstained,cloth
the,other,captain,was,the,man,who’d,tried,to,buy,them,that,morning,the,brown-skinned,bidder,with,the,saltand-pepper,beard
brown,ben,plumm,sweets,named,him
captain,of,the,second,sons
a,westerosi,and,a,plumm
better,and,better
you,are,next,nurse,informed,them
be,amusing,my,little,darlings,or,you,will,wish,you,had
tyrion,had,not,mastered,half,of,groat’s,old,tricks,but,he,could,ride,the,sow,fall,off,when,he,was,meant,to,roll,and,pop,back,onto,his,feet
all,of,that,proved,well,received
the,sight,of,little,people,running,about,drunkenly,and,whacking,at,one,another,with,wooden,weapons,appeared,to,be,just,as,hilarious,in,a,siege,camp,by,slaver’s,bay,as,at,joffrey’s,wedding,feast,in,king’s,landing
contempt,thought,tyrion,the,universal,tongue
their,master,yezzan,laughed,loudest,and,longest,whenever,one,of,his,dwarfs,suffered,a,fall,or,took,a,blow,his,whole,vast,body,shaking,like,suet,in,an,earthquake,his,guests,waited,to,see,how,yurkhaz,no,yunzak,responded,before,joining,in
the,supreme,commander,appeared,so,frail,that,tyrion,was,afraid,laughing,might,kill,him
when,penny’s,helm,was,struck,off,and,flew,into,the,lap,of,a,sour-faced,yunkishman,in,a,striped,green-and-gold,tokar,yurkhaz,cackled,like,a,chicken
when,said,lord,reached,inside,the,helm,and,drew,out,a,large,purple,melon,dribbling,pulp,he,wheezed,until,his,face,turned,the,same,color,as,the,fruit
he,turned,to,his,host,and,whispered,something,that,made,their,master,chortle,and,lick,his,lips,though,there,was,a,hint,of,anger,in,those,slitted,yellow,eyes,it,seemed,to,tyrion
afterward,the,dwarfs,stripped,off,their,wooden,armor,and,the,sweat-soaked,clothing,beneath,and,changed,into,the,fresh,yellow,tunics,that,had,been,provided,them,for,serving
tyrion,was,given,a,flagon,of,purple,wine,penny,a,flagon,of,water
they,moved,about,the,tent,filling,cups,their,slippered,feet,whispering,over,thick,carpets
it,was,harder,work,than,it,appeared
before,long,his,legs,were,cramping,badly,and,one,of,the,cuts,on,his,back,had,begun,to,bleed,again,the,red,seeping,through,the,yellow,linen,of,his,tunic
tyrion,bit,his,tongue,and,kept,on,pouring
most,of,the,guests,paid,them,no,more,mind,than,they,did,the,other,slaves,but,one,yunkishman,declared,drunkenly,that,yezzan,should,make,the,two,dwarfs,fuck,and,another,demanded,to,know,how,tyrion,had,lost,his,nose
i,shoved,it,up,your,wife’s,cunt,and,she,bit,it,off,he,almost,replied,but,the,storm,had,persuaded,him,that,he,did,not,want,to,die,as,yet,so,instead,he,said,it,was,cut,off,to,punish,me,for,insolence,lord
then,a,lord,in,a,blue,tokar,fringed,with,tiger’s,eyes,recalled,that,tyrion,had,boasted,of,his,skill,at,cyvasse,on,the,auction,block
let,us,put,him,to,the,test,he,said
a,table,and,set,of,pieces,was,duly,produced
a,scant,few,moments,later,the,red-faced,lord,shoved,the,table,over,in,fury,scattering,the,pieces,across,the,carpets,to,the,sound,of,yunkish,laughter
you,should,have,let,him,win,penny,whispered
brown,ben,plumm,lifted,the,fallen,table,smiling
try,me,next,dwarf
when,i,was,younger,the,second,sons,took,contract,with,volantis
i,learned,the,game,there
i,am,only,a,slave
my,noble,master,decides,when,and,who,i,play
tyrion,turned,to,yezzan
master
the,yellow,lord,seemed,amused,by,the,notion
what,stakes,do,you,propose,captain
if,i,win,give,this,slave,to,me,said,plumm
no,yezzan,zo,qaggaz,said
but,if,you,can,defeat,my,dwarf,you,may,have,the,price,i,paid,for,him,in,gold
done,the,sellsword,said
the,scattered,pieces,were,picked,up,off,the,carpet,and,they,sat,down,to,play
tyrion,won,the,first,game
plumm,took,the,second,for,double,the,stakes
as,they,set,up,for,their,third,contest,the,dwarf,studied,his,opponent
brown-skinned,his,cheeks,and,jaw,covered,by,a,close-cropped,bristly,beard,of,grey,and,white,his,face,creased,by,a,thousand,wrinkles,and,a,few,old,scars,plumm,had,an,amiable,look,to,him,especially,when,he,smiled
the,faithful,retainer,tyrion,decided
every,man’s,favorite,nuncle,full,of,chuckles,and,old,sayings,and,roughspun,wisdom
it,was,all,sham
those,smiles,never,touched,plumm’s,eyes,where,greed,hid,behind,a,veil,of,caution
hungry,but,wary,this,one
the,sellsword,was,nearly,as,bad,a,player,as,the,yunkish,lord,had,been,but,his,play,was,stolid,and,tenacious,rather,than,bold
his,opening,arrays,were,different,every,time,yet,all,the,same,conservative,defensive,passive
he,does,not,play,to,win,tyrion,realized
he,plays,so,as,not,to,lose
it,worked,in,their,second,game,when,the,little,man,overreached,himself,with,an,unsound,assault
it,did,not,work,in,the,third,game,nor,the,fourth,nor,the,fifth,which,proved,to,be,their,last
near,the,end,of,that,final,contest,with,his,fortress,in,ruins,his,dragon,dead,elephants,before,him,and,heavy,horse,circling,round,his,rear,plumm,looked,up,smiling,and,said,yollo,wins,again
death,in,four
three
tyrion,tapped,his,dragon
i,was,lucky
perhaps,you,should,give,my,head,a,good,rub,before,our,next,game,captain
some,of,that,luck,might,rub,off,on,your,fingers
you,will,still,lose,but,you,might,give,me,a,better,game
grinning,he,pushed,back,from,the,cyvasse,table,picked,up,his,wine,flagon,and,returned,to,pouring,with,yezzan,zo,qaggaz,considerably,richer,and,brown,ben,plumm,considerably,impoverished
his,gargantuan,master,had,fallen,off,into,drunken,sleep,during,the,third,game,his,goblet,slipping,from,his,yellowed,fingers,to,spill,its,contents,on,the,carpet,but,perhaps,he,would,be,pleased,when,he,awakened
when,the,supreme,commander,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,departed,supported,by,a,pair,of,burly,slaves,that,seemed,to,be,a,general,signal,for,the,other,guests,to,take,their,leaves,as,well
after,the,tent,had,emptied,out,nurse,reappeared,to,tell,the,servers,that,they,might,make,their,own,feast,from,the,leavings
eat,quickly
all,this,must,be,clean,again,before,you,sleep
tyrion,was,on,his,knees,his,legs,aching,and,his,bloody,back,screaming,with,pain,trying,to,scrub,out,the,stain,that,the,noble,yezzan’s,spilled,wine,had,left,upon,the,noble,yezzan’s,carpet,when,the,overseer,tapped,his,cheek,gently,with,the,end,of,his,whip

what,have,we,done
much,and,more,said,the,overseer
nurse,said,you,would,be,rewarded,if,you,pleased,your,father,did,he,not
though,the,noble,yezzan,is,loath,to,lose,his,little,treasures,as,you,have,seen,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,persuaded,him,that,it,would,be,selfish,to,keep,such,droll,antics,to,himself

his,men,formed,up,and,followed,banners,streaming
castle,and,camp,were,soon,lost,behind,them,obscured,by,the,dust,of,their,hooves
neither,outlaws,nor,wolves,had,troubled,them,on,their,way,to,raventree,so,jaime,decided,to,return,by,a,different,route
if,the,gods,were,good,he,might,stumble,on,the,blackfish,or,lure,beric,dondarrion,into,an,unwise,attack
they,were,following,the,widow’s,wash,when,they,ran,out,of,day
jaime,called,his,hostage,forward,and,asked,him,where,to,find,the,nearest,ford,and,the,boy,led,them,there

there’s,a,village,between,those,hills
pennytree,the,lad,confirmed
we’ll,camp,there,for,the,night
if,there,were,villagers,about,they,might,have,knowledge,of,ser,brynden,or,the,outlaws
lord,jonos,made,some,remark,about,whose,teats,they,were,he,recalled,to,the,blackwood,boy,as,they,rode,toward,the,darkening,hills,and,the,last,light,of,the,day
the,brackens,call,them,by,one,name,and,the,blackwoods,by,another
aye,my,lord
for,a,hundred,years,or,so
before,that,they,were,the,mother’s,teats,or,just,the,teats
there,are,two,of,them,and,it,was,thought,that,they,resembled,i,can,see,what,they,resemble
jaime,found,himself,thinking,back,on,the,woman,in,the,tent,and,the,way,she’d,tried,to,hide,her,large,dark,nipples
what,changed,a,hundred,years,ago
aegon,the,unworthy,took,barba,bracken,as,his,mistress,the,bookish,boy,replied
she,was,a,very,buxom,wench,they,say,and,one,day,when,the,king,was,visiting,at,the,stone,hedge,he,went,out,hunting,and,saw,the,teats,and,named,them,for,his,mistress
aegon,the,fourth,had,died,long,before,jaime,had,been,born,but,he,recalled,enough,of,the,history,of,his,reign,to,guess,what,must,have,happened,next
only,later,he,put,the,bracken,girl,aside,and,took,up,with,a,blackwood,was,that,the,way,of,it
lady,melissa,hoster,confirmed
missy,they,called,her
there’s,a,statue,of,her,in,our,godswood
she,was,much,more,beautiful,than,barba,bracken,but,slender,and,barba,was,heard,to,say,that,missy,was,flat,as,a,boy
when,king,aegon,heard,he,gave,her,barba’s,teats
jaime,laughed
how,did,all,this,begin,between,blackwood,and,bracken
is,it,written,down
it,is,my,lord,the,boy,said,but,some,of,the,histories,were,penned,by,their,maesters,and,some,by,ours,centuries,after,the,events,that,they,purport,to,chronicle
it,goes,back,to,the,age,of,heroes
the,blackwoods,were,kings,in,those,days
the,brackens,were,petty,lords,renowned,for,breeding,horses
rather,than,pay,their,king,his,just,due,they,used,the,gold,their,horses,brought,them,to,hire,swords,and,cast,him,down
when,did,all,this,happen
five,hundred,years,before,the,andals
a,thousand,if,the,true,history,is,to,be,believed
only,no,one,knows,when,the,andals,crossed,the,narrow,sea
the,true,history,says,four,thousand,years,have,passed,since,then,but,some,maesters,claim,that,it,was,only,two
past,a,certain,point,all,the,dates,grow,hazy,and,confused,and,the,clarity,of,history,becomes,the,fog,of,legend
tyrion,would,like,this,one
they,could,talk,from,dusk,to,dawn,arguing,about,books
for,a,moment,his,bitterness,toward,his,brother,was,forgotten,until,he,remembered,what,the,imp,had,done
so,you,are,fighting,over,a,crown,that,one,of,you,took,from,the,other,back,when,the,casterlys,still,held,casterly,rock,is,that,the,root,of,it
the,crown,of,a,kingdom,that,has,not,existed,for,thousands,of,years
he,chuckled
so,many,years,so,many,wars,so,many,kings,you’d,think,someone,would,have,made,a,peace
someone,did,my,lord
many,someones
we’ve,had,a,hundred,peaces,with,the,brackens,many,sealed,with,marriages
there’s,blackwood,blood,in,every,bracken,and,bracken,blood,in,every,blackwood
the,old,king’s,peace,lasted,half,a,century
but,then,some,fresh,quarrel,broke,out,and,the,old,wounds,opened,and,began,to,bleed,again
that’s,how,it,always,happens,my,father,says
so,long,as,men,remember,the,wrongs,done,to,their,forebears,no,peace,will,ever,last
so,we,go,on,century,after,century,with,us,hating,the,brackens,and,them,hating,us

this,is,what,i,wanted,what,i,worked,for,this,is,why,i,married,hizdahr
so,why,does,it,taste,so,much,like,defeat
it,is,only,for,a,little,while,more,my,love,hizdahr,had,assured,her
the,yunkai’i,will,soon,be,gone,and,their,allies,and,hirelings,with,them

they,can,close,their,fingers,around,our,throat,again,whenever,they,wish
they,have,opened,a,slave,market,within,sight,of,my,walls
outside,our,walls,sweet,queen
that,was,a,condition,of,the,peace,that,yunkai,would,be,free,to,trade,in,slaves,as,before,unmolested

the,third,was,young,fit,and,dashing,but,so,drunk,that,dany,could,scarce,understand,a,word,he,said
how,could,i,have,been,brought,to,this,pass,by,creatures,such,as,these
the,sellswords,were,a,different,matter
each,of,the,four,free,companies,serving,yunkai,had,sent,its,commander
the,windblown,were,represented,by,the,pentoshi,nobleman,known,as,the,tattered,prince,the,long,lances,by,gylo,rhegan,who,looked,more,shoemaker,than,soldier,and,spoke,in,murmurs
bloodbeard,from,the,company,of,the,cat,made,enough,noise,for,him,and,a,dozen,more
a,huge,man,with,a,great,bush,of,beard,and,a,prodigious,appetite,for,wine,and,women,he,bellowed,belched,farted,like,a,thunderclap,and,pinched,every,serving,girl,who,came,within,his,reach
from,time,to,time,he,would,pull,one,down,into,his,lap,to,squeeze,her,breasts,and,fondle,her,between,the,legs
the,second,sons,were,represented,too
if,daario,were,here,this,meal,would,end,in,blood
no,promised,peace,could,ever,have,persuaded,her,captain,to,permit,brown,ben,plumm,to,stroll,back,into,meereen,and,leave,alive
dany,had,sworn,that,no,harm,would,come,to,the,seven,envoys,and,commanders,though,that,had,not,been,enough,for,the,yunkai’i
they,had,required,hostages,of,her,as,well
to,balance,the,three,yunkish,nobles,and,four,sellsword,captains,meereen,sent,seven,of,its,own,out,to,the,siege,camp,hizdahr’s,sister,two,of,his,cousins,dany’s,bloodrider,jhogo,her,admiral,groleo,the,unsullied,captain,hero,and,daario,naharis

we,would,not,want,them,making,bloody,mischief,amongst,the,yunkai’i
the,shavepate,was,absent,as,well
the,first,thing,hizdahr,had,done,upon,being,crowned,was,to,remove,him,from,command,of,the,brazen,beasts,replacing,him,with,his,own,cousin,the,plump,and,pasty,marghaz,zo,loraq
it,is,for,the,best
the,green,grace,says,there,is,blood,between,loraq,and,kandaq,and,the,shavepate,never,made,a,secret,of,his,disdain,for,my,lord,husband
and,daario,daario,had,only,grown,wilder,since,her,wedding
her,peace,did,not,please,him,her,marriage,pleased,him,less,and,he,had,been,furious,at,being,deceived,by,the,dornishmen
when,prince,quentyn,told,them,that,the,other,westerosi,had,come,over,to,the,stormcrows,at,the,command,of,the,tattered,prince,only,the,intercession,of,grey,worm,and,his,unsullied,prevented,daario,from,killing,them,all
the,false,deserters,had,been,imprisoned,safely,in,the,bowels,of,the,pyramid,but,daario’s,rage,continued,to,fester
he,will,be,safer,as,a,hostage
my,captain,was,not,made,for,peace
dany,could,not,risk,his,cutting,down,brown,ben,plumm,making,mock,of,hizdahr,before,the,court,provoking,the,yunkai’i,or,otherwise,upsetting,the,agreement,that,she,had,given,up,so,much,to,win
daario,was,war,and,woe
henceforth,she,must,keep,him,out,of,her,bed,out,of,her,heart,and,out,of,her
if,he,did,not,betray,her,he,would,master,her
she,did,not,know,which,of,those,she,feared,the,most
when,the,gluttony,was,done,and,all,the,half-eaten,food,had,been,cleared,away,to,be,given,to,the,poor,who,gathered,below,at,the,queen’s,insistence,tall,glass,flutes,were,filled,with,a,spiced,liqueur,from,qarth,as,dark,as,amber
then,began,the,entertainments
a,troupe,of,yunkish,castrati,owned,by,yurkhaz,zo,yunzak,sang,them,songs,in,the,ancient,tongue,of,the,old,empire,their,voices,high,and,sweet,and,impossibly,pure
have,you,ever,heard,such,singing,my,love
hizdahr,asked,her
they,have,the,voices,of,gods,do,they,not
yes,she,said,though,i,wonder,if,they,might,not,have,preferred,to,have,the,fruits,of,men
all,of,the,entertainers,were,slaves
that,had,been,part,of,the,peace,that,slaveowners,be,allowed,the,right,to,bring,their,chattels,into,meereen,without,fear,of,having,them,freed
in,return,the,yunkai’i,had,promised,to,respect,the,rights,and,liberties,of,the,former,slaves,that,dany,had,freed
a,fair,bargain,hizdahr,said,but,the,taste,it,left,in,the,queen’s,mouth,was,foul
she,drank,another,cup,of,wine,to,wash,it,out
if,it,please,you,yurkhaz,will,be,pleased,to,give,us,the,singers,i,do,not,doubt,her,noble,husband,said
a,gift,to,seal,our,peace,an,ornament,to,our,court
he,will,give,us,these,castrati,dany,thought,and,then,he,will,march,home,and,make,some,more
the,world,is,full,of,boys
the,tumblers,who,came,next,failed,to,move,her,either,even,when,they,formed,a,human,pyramid,nine,levels,high,with,a,naked,little,girl,on,top

this,one,you,might
the,head,of,an,old,foe
your,own
she,said,sweetly
you,betrayed,me
now,that’s,a,harsh,way,o’,putting,it,if,you,don’t,mind,me,saying
brown,ben,scratched,at,his,speckled,grey-and-white,whiskers
we,went,over,to,the,winning,side,is,all
same,as,we,done,before
it,weren’t,all,me,neither
i,put,it,to,my,men
so,they,betrayed,me,is,that,what,you,are,saying
why
did,i,mistreat,the,second,sons
did,i,cheat,you,on,your,pay
never,that,said,brown,ben,but,it’s,not,all,about,the,coin,your,high-andmightiness
i,learned,that,a,long,time,back,at,my,first,battle
morning,after,the,fight,i,was,rooting,through,the,dead,looking,for,the,odd,bit,o’,plunder,as,it,were
came,upon,this,one,corpse,some,axeman,had,taken,his,whole,arm,off,at,the,shoulder
he,was,covered,with,flies,all,crusty,with,dried,blood,might,be,why,no,one,else,had,touched,him,but,under,them,he,wore,this,studded,jerkin,looked,to,be,good,leather
i,figured,it,might,fit,me,well,enough,so,i,chased,away,the,flies,and,cut,it,off,him
the,damn,thing,was,heavier,than,it,had,any,right,to,be,though
under,the,lining,he’d,sewn,a,fortune,in,coin
gold,your,worship,sweet,yellow,gold
enough,for,any,man,to,live,like,a,lord,for,the,rest,o’,his,days
but,what,good,did,it,do,him
there,he,was,with,all,his,coin,lying,in,the,blood,and,mud,with,his,fucking,arm,cut,off
and,that’s,the,lesson,see
silver’s,sweet,and,gold’s,our,mother,but,once,you’re,dead,they’re,worth,less,than,that,last,shit,you,take,as,you,lie,dying
i,told,you,once,there,are,old,sellswords,and,there,are,bold,sellswords,but,there,are,no,old,bold,sellswords
my,boys,didn’t,care,to,die,that’s,all,and,when,i,told,them,that,you,couldn’t,unleash,them,dragons,against,the,yunkishmen,well,you,saw,me,as,defeated,dany,thought,and,who,am,i,to,say,that,you,were,wrong
i,understand
she,might,have,ended,it,there,but,she,was,curious
enough,gold,to,live,like,a,lord,you,said
what,did,you,do,with,all,that,wealth
brown,ben,laughed
fool,boy,that,i,was,i,told,a,man,i,took,to,be,my,friend,and,he,told,our,serjeant,and,my,brothers-in-arms,come,and,relieved,me,o’,that,burden
serjeant,said,i,was,too,young,that,i’d,only,waste,it,all,on,whores,and,such
he,let,me,keep,the,jerkin,though
he,spat
you,don’t,never,want,to,trust,a,sellsword,m’lady
i,have,learned,that,much
one,day,i,must,be,sure,to,thank,you,for,the,lesson
brown,ben’s,eyes,crinkled,up
no,need
i,know,the,sort,o’,thanks,you,have,in,mind
he,bowed,again,and,moved,away

perhaps
i,would,not,know,your,grace

i,am,only,a,young,girl,and,know,little,of,such,things,but,it,seems,to,me,that,we,want,them,to,be,treacherous
once,you’ll,recall,i,convinced,the,second,sons,and,stormcrows,to,join,us
if,your,grace,wishes,a,privy,word,with,gylo,rhegan,or,the,tattered,prince,i,could,bring,them,up,to,your,apartments
this,is,not,the,time
too,many,eyes,too,many,ears
their,absence,would,be,noted,even,if,you,could,separate,them,discreetly,from,the,yunkai’i
we,must,find,some,quieter,way,of,reaching,out,to,them,not,tonight,but,soon

rhaegal,roared,in,answer,and,fire,filled,the,pit,a,spear,of,red,and,yellow

when,he,flapped,his,wings,a,cloud,of,grey,ash,filled,the,air
broken,chains,clanked,and,clattered,about,his,legs
quentyn,martell,jumped,back,a,foot
a,crueler,woman,might,have,laughed,at,him,but,dany,squeezed,his,hand,and,said,they,frighten,me,as,well
there,is,no,shame,in,that
my,children,have,grown,wild,and,angry,in,the,dark
you,you,mean,to,ride,them
one,of,them
all,i,know,of,dragons,is,what,my,brother,told,me,when,i,was,a,girl,and,some,i,read,in,books,but,it,is,said,that,even,aegon,the,conqueror,never,dared,mount,vhagar,or,meraxes,nor,did,his,sisters,ride,balerion,the,black,dread
dragons,live,longer,than,men,some,for,hundreds,of,years,so,balerion,had,other,riders,after,aegon,died,but,no,rider,ever,flew,two,dragons

they,are,they,are,fearsome,creatures
they,are,dragons,quentyn
dany,stood,on,her,toes,and,kissed,him,lightly,once,on,each,cheek
and,so,am,i
the,young,prince,swallowed
i,i,have,the,blood,of,the,dragon,in,me,as,well,your,grace
i,can,trace,my,lineage,back,to,the,first,daenerys,the,targaryen,princess,who,was,sister,to,king,daeron,the,good,and,wife,to,the,prince,of,dorne
he,built,the,water,gardens,for,her
the,water,gardens
she,knew,little,and,less,of,dorne,or,its,history,if,truth,be,told
my,father’s,favorite,palace
it,would,please,me,to,show,them,to,you,one,day
they,are,all,of,pink,marble,with,pools,and,fountains,overlooking,the,sea
they,sound,lovely
she,drew,him,away,from,the,pit
he,does,not,belong,here
he,should,never,have,come
you,ought,to,return,there
my,court,is,no,safe,place,for,you,i,fear
you,have,more,enemies,than,you,know
you,made,daario,look,a,fool,and,he,is,not,a,man,to,forget,such,a,slight
i,have,my,knights
my,sworn,shields
two,knights
daario,has,five,hundred,stormcrows
and,you,would,do,well,to,beware,of,my,lord,husband,too
he,seems,a,mild,and,pleasant,man,i,know,but,do,not,be,deceived
hizdahr’s,crown,derives,from,mine,and,he,commands,the,allegiance,of,some,of,the,most,fearsome,fighters,in,the,world
if,one,of,them,should,think,to,win,his,favor,by,disposing,of,a,rival,i,am,a,prince,of,dorne,your,grace
i,will,not,run,from,slaves,and,sell,swords
then,you,truly,are,a,fool,prince,frog
dany,gave,her,wild,children,one,last,lingering,look
she,could,hear,the,dragons,screaming,as,she,led,the,boy,back,to,the,door,and,see,the,play,of,light,against,the,bricks,reflections,of,their,fires
if,i,look,back,i,am,lost
ser,barristan,will,have,summoned,a,pair,of,sedan,chairs,to,carry,us,back,up,to,the,banquet,but,the,climb,can,still,be,wearisome
behind,them,the,great,iron,doors,closed,with,a,resounding,clang
tell,me,of,this,other,daenerys
i,know,less,than,i,should,of,the,history,of,my,father’s,kingdom
i,never,had,a,maester,growing,up
only,a,brother
it,would,be,my,pleasure,your,grace,said,quentyn
it,was,well,past,midnight,before,the,last,of,their,guests,took,their,leave,and,dany,retired,to,her,own,apartments,to,join,her,lord,and,king
hizdahr,at,least,was,happy,if,somewhat,drunk
i,keep,my,promises,he,told,her,as,irri,and,jhiqui,were,robing,them,for,bed
you,wished,for,peace,and,it,is,yours
and,you,wished,for,blood,and,soon,enough,i,must,give,it,to,you,dany,thought,but,what,she,said,was,i,am,grateful
the,excitement,of,the,day,had,inflamed,her,husband’s,passions
no,sooner,had,her,handmaids,retired,for,the,night,than,he,tore,the,robe,from,her,and,tumbled,her,backwards,into,bed
dany,slid,her,arms,around,him,and,let,him,have,his,way
drunk,as,he,was,she,knew,he,would,not,be,inside,her,long
nor,was,he
afterward,he,nuzzled,at,her,ear,and,whispered,gods,grant,that,we,have,made,a,son,tonight
the,words,of,mirri,maz,duur,rang,in,her,head
when,the,sun,rises,in,the,west,and,sets,in,the,east
when,the,seas,go,dry,and,mountains,blow,in,the,wind,like,leaves
when,your,womb,quickens,again,and,you,bear,a,living,child
then,he,will,return,and,not,before
the,meaning,was,plain,enough,khal,drogo,was,as,like,to,return,from,the,dead,as,she,was,to,bear,a,living,child
but,there,are,some,secrets,she,could,not,bring,herself,to,share,even,with,a,husband,so,she,let,hizdahr,zo,loraq,keep,his,hopes
her,noble,husband,was,soon,fast,asleep
daenerys,could,only,twist,and,turn,beside,him
she,wanted,to,shake,him,wake,him,make,him,hold,her,kiss,her,fuck,her,again,but,even,if,he,did,he,would,fall,back,to,sleep,again,afterward,leaving,her,alone,in,the,darkness
she,wondered,what,daario,was,doing
was,he,restless,as,well
was,he,thinking,about,her
did,he,love,her,truly
did,he,hate,her,for,marrying,hizdahr
i,should,never,have,taken,him,into,my,bed
he,was,only,a,sellsword,no,fit,consort,for,a,queen,and,yet,i,knew,that,all,along,but,i,did,it,anyway
my,queen
said,a,soft,voice,in,the,darkness
dany,flinched
who,is,there
only,missandei
the,naathi,scribe,moved,closer,to,the,bed
this,one,heard,you,crying
crying
i,was,not,crying
why,would,i,cry
i,have,my,peace,i,have,my,king,i,have,everything,a,queen,might,wish,for
you,had,a,bad,dream,that,was,all
as,you,say,your,grace
she,bowed,and,made,to,go
stay,said,dany
i,do,not,wish,to,be,alone
his,grace,is,with,you,missandei,pointed,out
his,grace,is,dreaming,but,i,cannot,sleep
on,the,morrow,i,must,bathe,in,blood
the,price,of,peace
she,smiled,wanly,and,patted,the,bed
come
sit
talk,with,me
if,it,please,you
missandei,sat,down,beside,her
what,shall,we,talk,of
home,said,dany
naath
butterflies,and,brothers
tell,me,of,the,things,that,make,you,happy,the,things,that,make,you,giggle,all,your,sweetest,memories
remind,me,that,there,is,still,good,in,the,world
missandei,did,her,best
she,was,still,talking,when,dany,finally,fell,to,sleep,to,dream,queer,half-formed,dreams,of,smoke,and,fire
the,morning,came,too,soon
theon,day,stole,upon,them,just,as,stannis,had,unseen
winterfell,had,been,awake,for,hours,its,battlements,and,towers,crammed,with,men,in,wool,and,mail,and,leather,awaiting,an,attack,that,never,came
by,the,time,the,sky,began,to,lighten,the,sound,of,drums,had,faded,away,though,warhorns,were,heard,thrice,more,each,time,a,little,closer
and,still,the,snow,fell
the,storm,will,end,today,one,of,the,surviving,stableboys,was,insisting,loudly
why,it,isn’t,even,winter
theon,would,have,laughed,if,he,had,dared
he,remembered,tales,old,nan,had,told,them,of,storms,that,raged,for,forty,days,and,forty,nights,for,a,year,for,ten,years,storms,that,buried,castles,and,cities,and,whole,kingdoms,under,a,hundred,feet,of,snow
he,sat,in,the,back,of,the,great,hall,not,far,from,the,horses,watching,abel,rowan,and,a,mousy,brown-haired,washerwoman,called,squirrel,attack,slabs,of,stale,brown,bread,fried,in,bacon,grease
theon,broke,his,own,fast,with,a,tankard,of,dark,ale,cloudy,with,yeast,and,thick,enough,to,chew,on
a,few,more,tankards,and,perhaps,abel’s,plan,might,not,seem,quite,so,mad
roose,bolton,entered,pale-eyed,and,yawning,accompanied,by,his,plump,and,pregnant,wife,fat,walda
several,lords,and,captains,had,preceded,him,amongst,them,whoresbane,umber,aenys,frey,and,roger,ryswell
farther,down,the,table,wyman,manderly,sat,wolfing,down,sausages,and,boiled,eggs,whilst,old,lord,locke,beside,him,spooned,gruel,into,his,toothless,mouth
lord,ramsay,soon,appeared,as,well,buckling,on,his,sword,belt,as,he,made,his,way,to,the,front,of,the,hall
his,mood,is,foul,this,morning
theon,could,tell
the,drums,kept,him,awake,all,night,he,guessed,or,someone,has,displeased,him
one,wrong,word,an,illconsidered,look,an,ill-timed,laugh,any,of,them,could,provoke,his,lordship’s,wroth,and,cost,a,man,a,strip,of,skin
please,m’lord,don’t,look,this,way
one,glance,would,be,all,it,would,take,for,ramsay,to,know,everything
he’ll,see,it,written,on,my,face
he’ll,know
he,always,knows
theon,turned,to,abel
this,will,not,work
his,voice,was,pitched,so,low,that,even,the,horses,could,not,have,overheard
we,will,be,caught,before,we,leave,the,castle
even,if,we,do,escape,lord,ramsay,will,hunt,us,down,him,and,ben,bones,and,the,girls
lord,stannis,is,outside,the,walls,and,not,far,by,the,sound,of,it
all,we,need,do,is,reach,him
abel’s,fingers,danced,across,the,strings,of,his,lute
the,singer’s,beard,was,brown,though,his,long,hair,had,largely,gone,to,grey
if,the,bastard,does,come,after,us,he,might,live,long,enough,to,rue,it
think,that,theon,thought
believe,that
tell,yourself,it’s,true
ramsay,will,use,your,women,as,his,prey,he,told,the,singer
he’ll,hunt,them,down,rape,them,and,feed,their,corpses,to,his,dogs
if,they,lead,him,a,good,chase,he,may,name,his,next,litter,of,bitches,after,them
you,he’ll,flay
him,and,skinner,and,damon,dance-for-me,they,will,make,a,game,of,it
you’ll,be,begging,them,to,kill,you
he,clutched,the,singer’s,arm,with,a,maimed,hand
you,swore,you,would,not,let,me,fall,into,his,hands,again
i,have,your,word,on,that
he,needed,to,hear,it,again
abel’s,word,said,squirrel
strong,as,oak
abel,himself,only,shrugged
no,matter,what,my,prince
up,on,the,dais,ramsay,was,arguing,with,his,father
they,were,too,far,away,for,theon,to,make,out,any,of,the,words,but,the,fear,on,fat,walda’s,round,pink,face,spoke,volumes
he,did,hear,wyman,manderly,calling,for,more,sausages,and,roger,ryswell’s,laughter,at,some,jape,from,one-armed,harwood,stout
theon,wondered,if,he,would,ever,see,the,drowned,god’s,watery,halls,or,if,his,ghost,would,linger,here,at,winterfell
dead,is,dead
better,dead,than,reek
if,abel’s,scheme,went,awry,ramsay,would,make,their,dying,long,and,hard
he,will,flay,me,from,head,to,heel,this,time,and,no,amount,of,begging,will,end,the,anguish
no,pain,theon,had,ever,known,came,close,to,the,agony,that,skinner,could,evoke,with,a,little,flensing,blade
abel,would,learn,that,lesson,soon,enough
and,for,what
jeyne,her,name,is,jeyne,and,her,eyes,are,the,wrong,color
a,mummer,playing,a,part
lord,bolton,knows,and,ramsay,but,the,rest,are,blind,even,this,bloody,bard,with,his,sly,smiles
the,jape,is,on,you,abel,you,and,your,murdering,whores
you’ll,die,for,the,wrong,girl
he,had,come,this,close,to,telling,them,the,truth,when,rowan,had,delivered,him,to,abel,in,the,ruins,of,the,burned,tower,but,at,the,last,instant,he,had,held,his,tongue
the,singer,seemed,intent,on,making,off,with,the,daughter,of,eddard,stark
if,he,knew,that,lord,ramsay’s,bride,was,but,a,steward’s,whelp,well,the,doors,of,the,great,hall,opened,with,a,crash
a,cold,wind,came,swirling,through,and,a,cloud,of,ice,crystals,sparkled,blue-white,in,the,air
through,it,strode,ser,hosteen,frey,caked,with,snow,to,the,waist,a,body,in,his,arms

lord,ramsay,descended,from,the,dais,to,the,dead,boy
his,father,rose,more,slowly,pale-eyed,still-faced,solemn
this,was,foul,work
for,once,roose,bolton’s,voice,was,loud,enough,to,carry

holly,and,her,knife,would,be,of,small,use,against,six,men,in,mail,with,swords,and,spears

even,the,serjeant,did,not,spare,them,more,than,a,quick,glance
theon,felt,a,stab,of,pity,for,him,and,his,men

madder,and,madder,thought,theon,greyjoy
escape,had,seemed,unlikely,with,all,six,of,abel’s,women,with,only,two,it,seemed,impossible
but,they,had,gone,too,far,to,return,the,girl,to,her,bedchamber,and,pretend,none,of,this,had,ever,happened
instead,he,took,jeyne,by,the,arm,and,drew,her,down,the,pathway,to,the,battlements,gate
only,a,halfgate,he,reminded,himself
even,if,the,guards,let,us,pass,there,is,no,way,through,the,outer,wall
on,other,nights,the,guards,had,allowed,theon,through,but,all,those,times,he’d,come,alone

there,before,them,behind,a,veil,of,falling,snow,yawned,the,battlements,gate,flanked,by,a,pair,of,guards

i,i,have,brought,some,women,for,you
you,poor,boys,must,be,freezing,said,holly
here,let,me,warm,you,up
she,slipped,past,the,guard’s,spearpoint,and,reached,up,to,his,face,pulling,loose,the,half-frozen,scarf,to,plant,a,kiss,upon,his,mouth
and,as,their,lips,touched,her,blade,slid,through,the,meat,of,his,neck,just,below,the,ear
theon,saw,the,man’s,eyes,widen
there,was,blood,on,holly’s,lips,as,she,stepped,back,and,blood,dribbling,from,his,mouth,as,he,fell
the,second,guard,was,still,gaping,in,confusion,when,frenya,grabbed,the,shaft,of,his,spear
they,struggled,for,a,moment,tugging,till,the,woman,wrenched,the,weapon,from,his,fingers,and,clouted,him,across,the,temple,with,its,butt
as,he,stumbled,backwards,she,spun,the,spear,around,and,drove,its,point,through,his,belly,with,a,grunt
jeyne,poole,let,out,a,shrill,high,scream

theon,clapped,one,hand,around,jeyne’s,mouth,grabbed,her,about,the,waist,with,the,other,and,pulled,her,past,the,dead,and,dying,guards,through,the,gate,and,over,the,frozen,moat
and,perhaps,the,old,gods,were,still,watching,over,them,the,drawbridge,had,been,left,down,to,allow,winterfell’s,defenders,to,cross,to,and,from,the,outer,battlements,more,quickly
from,behind,them,came,alarums,and,the,sounds,of,running,feet,then,the,blast,of,a,trumpet,from,the,ramparts,of,the,inner,wall
on,the,drawbridge,frenya,stopped,and,turned

he,slung,the,girl,over,his,shoulder,and,began,to,climb
jeyne,had,ceased,to,struggle,by,then,and,she,was,such,a,little,thing,besides,but,the,steps,were,slick,with,ice,beneath,soft,powdery,snow,and,halfway,up,he,lost,his,footing,and,went,down,hard,on,one,knee
the,pain,was,so,bad,he,almost,lost,the,girl,and,for,half,a,heartbeat,he,feared,this,was,as,far,as,he,would,go
but,holly,pulled,him,back,onto,his,feet,and,between,the,two,of,them,they,finally,got,jeyne,up,to,the,battlements
as,he,leaned,up,against,a,merlon,breathing,hard,theon,could,hear,the,shouting,from,below,where,frenya,was,fighting,half,a,dozen,guardsmen,in,the,snow
which,way
he,shouted,at,holly
where,do,we,go,now

hizdahr’s,kin,of,the,ancient,line,of,loraq,seemed,to,favor,tokars,of,purple,and,indigo,and,lilac,whilst,those,of,pahl,were,striped,in,pink,and,white
the,envoys,from,yunkai,were,all,in,yellow,and,filled,the,box,beside,the,king’s,each,of,them,with,his,slaves,and,servants

they,cried,instead,in,the,old,dead,tongue,of,ghis,the,word,was,mhysa
they,stamped,their,feet,and,slapped,their,bellies,and,shouted,mhysa,mhysa,mhysa,until,the,whole,pit,seemed,to,tremble

i,am,not,your,mother,she,might,have,shouted,back,i,am,the,mother,of,your,slaves,of,every,boy,who,ever,died,upon,these,sands,whilst,you,gorged,on,honeyed,locusts

his,foe,was,an,ebon-skinned,spearman,from,the,summer,isles,whose,thrusts,kept,khrazz,at,bay,for,a,time,but,once,he,slipped,inside,the,spear,with,his,shortsword,only,butchery,remained

the,foe,hizdahr,had,found,for,the,walking,poem,was,as,tall,as,goghor,and,as,broad,as,belwas,but,slow
they,were,fighting,six,feet,from,dany’s,box,when,the,spotted,cat,hamstrung,him
as,the,man,stumbled,to,his,knees,the,cat,put,a,foot,on,his,back,and,a,hand,around,his,head,and,opened,his,throat,from,ear,to,ear

this,one,shows,much,promise,my,sweet,hizdahr,said,of,a,lysene,youth,with,long,blond,hair,that,fluttered,in,the,wind,but,his,foe,grabbed,a,handful,of,that,hair,pulled,the,boy,offbalance,and,gutted,him
in,death,he,looked,even,younger,than,he,had,with,blade,in,hand
a,boy,said,dany
he,was,only,a,boy
six-and-ten,hizdahr,insisted
a,man,grown,who,freely,chose,to,risk,his,life,for,gold,and,glory
no,children,die,today,in,daznak’s,as,my,gentle,queen,in,her,wisdom,has,decreed
another,small,victory
perhaps,i,cannot,make,my,people,good,she,told,herself,but,i,should,at,least,try,to,make,them,a,little,less,bad
daenerys,would,have,prohibited,contests,between,women,as,well,but,barsena,blackhair,protested,that,she,had,as,much,right,to,risk,her,life,as,any,man
the,queen,had,also,wished,to,forbid,the,follies,comic,combats,where,cripples,dwarfs,and,crones,had,at,one,another,with,cleavers,torches,and,hammers,the,more,inept,the,fighters,the,funnier,the,folly,it,was,thought,but,hizdahr,said,his,people,would,love,her,more,if,she,laughed,with,them,and,argued,that,without,such,frolics,the,cripples,dwarfs,and,crones,would,starve
so,dany,had,relented
it,had,been,the,custom,to,sentence,criminals,to,the,pits,that,practice,she,agreed,might,resume,but,only,for,certain,crimes
murderers,and,rapers,may,be,forced,to,fight,and,all,those,who,persist,in,slaving,but,not,thieves,or,debtors
beasts,were,still,allowed,though
dany,watched,an,elephant,make,short,work,of,a,pack,of,six,red,wolves
next,a,bull,was,set,against,a,bear,in,a,bloody,battle,that,left,both,animals,torn,and,dying
the,flesh,is,not,wasted,said,hizdahr
the,butchers,use,the,carcasses,to,make,a,healthful,stew,for,the,hungry
any,man,who,presents,himself,at,the,gates,of,fate,may,have,a,bowl
a,good,law,dany,said
you,have,so,few,of,them
we,must,make,certain,that,this,tradition,is,continued
after,the,beast,fights,came,a,mock,battle,pitting,six,men,on,foot,against,six,horsemen,the,former,armed,with,shields,and,longswords,the,latter,with,dothraki,arakhs
the,mock,knights,were,clad,in,mail,hauberks,whilst,the,mock,dothraki,wore,no,armor
at,first,the,riders,seemed,to,have,the,advantage,riding,down,two,of,their,foes,and,slashing,the,ear,from,a,third,but,then,the,surviving,knights,began,to,attack,the,horses,and,one,by,one,the,riders,were,unmounted,and,slain,to,jhiqui’s,great,disgust
that,was,no,true,khalasar,she,said
these,carcasses,are,not,destined,for,your,healthful,stew,i,would,hope,dany,said,as,the,slain,were,being,removed
the,horses,yes,said,hizdahr
the,men,no
horsemeat,and,onions,makes,you,strong,said,belwas
the,battle,was,followed,by,the,day’s,first,folly,a,tilt,between,a,pair,of,jousting,dwarfs,presented,by,one,of,the,yunkish,lords,that,hizdahr,had,invited,to,the,games
one,rode,a,hound,the,other,a,sow
their,wooden,armor,had,been,freshly,painted,so,one,bore,the,stag,of,the,usurper,robert,baratheon,the,other,the,golden,lion,of,house,lannister
that,was,for,her,sake,plainly
their,antics,soon,had,belwas,snorting,laughter,though,dany’s,smile,was,faint,and,forced
when,the,dwarf,in,red,tumbled,from,the,saddle,and,began,to,chase,his,sow,across,the,sands,whilst,the,dwarf,on,the,dog,galloped,after,him,whapping,at,his,buttocks,with,a,wooden,sword,she,said,this,is,sweet,and,silly,but,be,patient,my,sweet,said,hizdahr
they,are,about,to,loose,the,lions
daenerys,gave,him,a,quizzical,look
lions
three,of,them
the,dwarfs,will,not,expect,them
she,frowned
the,dwarfs,have,wooden,swords
wooden,armor
how,do,you,expect,them,to,fight,lions
badly,said,hizdahr,though,perhaps,they,will,surprise,us
more,like,they,will,shriek,and,run,about,and,try,to,climb,out,of,the,pit
that,is,what,makes,this,a,folly
dany,was,not,pleased
i,forbid,it
gentle,queen
you,do,not,want,to,disappoint,your,people
you,swore,to,me,that,the,fighters,would,be,grown,men,who,had,freely,consented,to,risk,their,lives,for,gold,and,honor
these,dwarfs,did,not,consent,to,battle,lions,with,wooden,swords
you,will,stop,it
now
the,king’s,mouth,tightened
for,a,heartbeat,dany,thought,she,saw,a,flash,of,anger,in,those,placid,eyes
as,you,command
hizdahr,beckoned,to,his,pitmaster
no,lions,he,said,when,the,man,trotted,over,whip,in,hand
not,one,magnificence
where,is,the,fun,in,that
my,queen,has,spoken
the,dwarfs,will,not,be,harmed
the,crowd,will,not,like,it
then,bring,on,barsena
that,should,appease,them
your,worship,knows,best
the,pitmaster,snapped,his,whip,and,shouted,out,commands
the,dwarfs,were,herded,off,pig,and,dog,and,all,as,the,spectators,hissed,their,disapproval,and,pelted,them,with,stones,and,rotten,fruit
a,roar,went,up,as,barsena,blackhair,strode,onto,the,sands,naked,save,for,breechclout,and,sandals
a,tall,dark,woman,of,some,thirty,years,she,moved,with,the,feral,grace,of,a,panther
barsena,is,much,loved,hizdahr,said,as,the,sound,swelled,to,fill,the,pit
the,bravest,woman,i,have,ever,seen
strong,belwas,said,fighting,girls,is,not,so,brave
fighting,strong,belwas,would,be,brave
today,she,fights,a,boar,said,hizdahr
aye,thought,dany,because,you,could,not,find,a,woman,to,face,her,no,matter,how,plump,the,purse
and,not,with,a,wooden,sword,it,would,seem
the,boar,was,a,huge,beast,with,tusks,as,long,as,a,man’s,forearm,and,small,eyes,that,swam,with,rage
she,wondered,whether,the,boar,that,had,killed,robert,baratheon,had,looked,as,fierce
a,terrible,creature,and,a,terrible,death
for,a,heartbeat,she,felt,almost,sorry,for,the,usurper
barsena,is,very,quick,reznak,said
she,will,dance,with,the,boar,magnificence,and,slice,him,when,he,passes,near,her
he,will,be,awash,in,blood,before,he,falls,you,shall,see
it,began,just,as,he,said
the,boar,charged,barsena,spun,aside,her,blade,flashed,silver,in,the,sun
she,needs,a,spear,ser,barristan,said,as,barsena,vaulted,over,the,beast’s,second,charge
that,is,no,way,to,fight,a,boar
he,sounded,like,someone’s,fussy,old,grandsire,just,as,daario,was,always,saying
barsena’s,blade,was,running,red,but,the,boar,soon,stopped
he,is,smarter,than,a,bull,dany,realized
he,will,not,charge,again
barsena,came,to,the,same,realization
shouting,she,edged,closer,to,the,boar,tossing,her,knife,from,hand,to,hand
when,the,beast,backed,away,she,cursed,and,slashed,at,his,snout,trying,to,provoke,him,and,succeeding
this,time,her,leap,came,an,instant,too,late,and,a,tusk,ripped,her,left,leg,open,from,knee,to,crotch
a,moan,went,up,from,thirty,thousand,throats
clutching,at,her,torn,leg,barsena,dropped,her,knife,and,tried,to,hobble,off,but,before,she,had,gone,two,feet,the,boar,was,on,her,once,again
dany,turned,her,face,away
was,that,brave,enough
she,asked,strong,belwas,as,a,scream,rang,out,across,the,sand
fighting,pigs,is,brave,but,it,is,not,brave,to,scream,so,loud
it,hurts,strong,belwas,in,the,ears
the,eunuch,rubbed,his,swollen,stomach,crisscrossed,with,old,white,scars
it,makes,strong,belwas,sick,in,his,belly,too
the,boar,buried,his,snout,in,barsena’s,belly,and,began,rooting,out,her,entrails
the,smell,was,more,than,the,queen,could,stand
the,heat,the,flies,the,shouts,from,the,crowd,i,cannot,breathe
she,lifted,her,veil,and,let,it,flutter,away

a,dozen,men,with,boar,spears,came,trotting,out,onto,the,sand,to,drive,the,boar,away,from,the,corpse,and,back,to,his,pen

a,warm,wind,brushed,dany’s,cheeks,and,above,the,beating,of,her,heart,she,heard,the,sound,of,wings
two,spearmen,dashed,for,shelter
the,pitmaster,froze,where,he,stood
the,boar,went,snuffling,back,to,barsena

perhaps,he,had,loved,barsena,blackhair,from,afar,or,had,heard,some,whisper,of,the,girl,hazzea

afternoon,brought,ser,barristan,a,brief,respite,from,his,doubts
he,spent,it,in,the,training,hall,on,the,pyramid’s,third,level,working,with,his,boys,teaching,them,the,art,of,sword,and,shield,horse,and,lance,and,chivalry,the,code,that,made,a,knight,more,than,any,pit,fighter
daenerys,would,need,protectors,her,own,age,about,her,after,he,was,gone,and,ser,barristan,was,determined,to,give,her,such
the,lads,he,was,instructing,ranged,in,age,from,eight,to,twenty
he,had,started,with,more,than,sixty,of,them,but,the,training,had,proved,too,rigorous,for,many
less,than,half,that,number,now,remained,but,some,showed,great,promise
with,no,king,to,guard,i,will,have,more,time,to,train,them,now,he,realized,as,he,walked,from,pair,to,pair,watching,them,go,at,one,another,with,blunted,swords,and,spears,with,rounded,heads
brave,boys
baseborn,aye,but,some,will,make,good,knights,and,they,love,the,queen

together,now
low,high,low,low,high,low,selmy,took,his,simple,supper,out,onto,the,queen’s,terrace,that,night,and,ate,it,as,the,sun,went,down
through,the,purple,twilight,he,watched,fires,waken,one,by,one,in,the,great,stepped,pyramids,as,the,many-colored,bricks,of,meereen,faded,to,grey,and,then,to,black
shadows,gathered,in,the,streets,and,alleys,below,making,pools,and,rivers
in,the,dusk,the,city,seemed,a,tranquil,place,even,beautiful
that,is,pestilence,not,peace,the,old,knight,told,himself,with,his,last,sip,of,wine
he,did,not,wish,to,be,conspicuous,so,when,he,was,finished,with,his,supper,he,changed,out,of,his,court,clothes,trading,the,white,cloak,of,the,queensguard,for,a,hooded,brown,traveler’s,cloak,such,as,any,common,man,might,wear
he,kept,his,sword,and,dagger
this,could,still,be,some,trap
he,had,little,trust,in,hizdahr,and,less,in,reznak,mo,reznak
the,perfumed,seneschal,could,well,be,part,of,this,trying,to,lure,him,into,a,secret,meeting,so,he,could,sweep,up,him,and,skahaz,both,and,charge,them,with,conspiring,against,the,king
if,the,shavepate,speaks,treason,he,will,leave,me,no,choice,but,to,arrest,him
hizdahr,is,my,queen’s,consort,however,little,i,may,like,it
my,duty,is,to,him,not,skahaz
or,was,it
the,first,duty,of,the,kingsguard,was,to,defend,the,king,from,harm,or,threat
the,white,knights,were,sworn,to,obey,the,king’s,commands,as,well,to,keep,his,secrets,counsel,him,when,counsel,was,requested,and,keep,silent,when,it,was,not,serve,his,pleasure,and,defend,his,name,and,honor
strictly,speaking,it,was,purely,the,king’s,choice,whether,or,not,to,extend,kingsguard,protection,to,others,even,those,of,royal,blood
some,kings,thought,it,right,and,proper,to,dispatch,kingsguard,to,serve,and,defend,their,wives,and,children,siblings,aunts,uncles,and,cousins,of,greater,and,lesser,degree,and,occasionally,even,their,lovers,mistresses,and,bastards
but,others,preferred,to,use,household,knights,and,men-at-arms,for,those,purposes,whilst,keeping,their,seven,as,their,own,personal,guard,never,far,from,their,sides
if,the,queen,had,commanded,me,to,protect,hizdahr,i,would,have,had,no,choice,but,to,obey
but,daenerys,targaryen,had,never,established,a,proper,queensguard,even,for,herself,nor,issued,any,commands,in,respect,to,her,consort
the,world,was,simpler,when,i,had,a,lord,commander,to,decide,such,matters,selmy,reflected
now,i,am,the,lord,commander,and,it,is,hard,to,know,which,path,is,right
when,at,last,he,came,to,the,bottom,of,the,last,flight,of,steps,he,found,himself,all,but,alone,amongst,the,torchlit,corridors,inside,the,pyramid’s,massive,brick,walls
the,great,gates,were,closed,and,barred,as,he,had,anticipated
four,brazen,beasts,stood,guard,outside,those,doors,four,more,within

all,quiet,ser,the,bear,told,him

it,was,not,unknown,for,ser,barristan,to,walk,around,at,night,to,make,certain,the,pyramid,was,secure

as,the,dragons,grew,so,did,their,appetites
it,was,time,to,find,the,shavepate

an,ass,nickered,as,he,went,by,and,a,few,of,the,horses,stirred,at,the,light,of,his,lantern
elsewise,all,was,dark,and,silent
then,a,shadow,detached,itself,from,inside,an,empty,stall,and,became,another,brazen,beast,clad,in,pleated,black,skirt,greaves,and,muscled,breastplate
a,cat
said,barristan,selmy,when,he,saw,the,brass,beneath,the,hood
when,the,shavepate,had,commanded,the,brazen,beasts,he,had,favored,a,serpent’s-head,mask,imperious,and,frightening
cats,go,everywhere,replied,the,familiar,voice,of,skahaz,mo,kandaq
no,one,ever,looks,at,them

silently,he,cursed,the,storm,god,for,his,malice,his,rage,a,black,stone,in,his,belly
where,are,my,ships
he,had,set,sail,from,the,shields,with,ninety-three,of,the,hundred,that,had,once,made,up,the,iron,fleet,a,fleet,belonging,not,to,a,single,lord,but,to,the,seastone,chair,itself,captained,and,crewed,by,men,from,all,the,islands
ships,smaller,than,the,great,war,dromonds,of,the,green,lands,aye,but,thrice,the,size,of,any,common,longship,with,deep,hulls,and,savage,rams,fit,to,meet,the,king’s,own,fleets,in,battle
in,the,stepstones,they,had,taken,on,grain,and,game,and,fresh,water,after,the,long,voyage,along,the,bleak,and,barren,coast,of,dorne,with,its,shoals,and,whirlpools
there,the,iron,victory,had,captured,a,fat,merchant,ship,the,great,cog,noble,lady,on,her,way,to,oldtown,by,way,of,gulltown,duskendale,and,king’s,landing,with,a,cargo,of,salt,cod,whale,oil,and,pickled,herring

twenty-two,of,victarion’s,own,had,straggled,in,by,threes,and,fours,sometimes,alone,fourteen,of,ralf,the,limper’s,only,nine,of,those,that,had,sailed,with,red,ralf,stonehouse
red,ralf,himself,was,amongst,the,missing
to,their,number,the,fleet,had,added,nine,new,prizes,taken,on,the,seas,so,the,sum,was,fifty-four,but,the,captured,ships,were,cogs,and,fishing,boats,merchantmen,and,slavers,not,warships
in,battle,they,would,be,poor,substitutes,for,the,lost,ships,of,the,iron,fleet
the,last,ship,to,appear,had,been,the,maiden’s,bane,three,days,previous
the,day,before,that,three,ships,had,come,out,of,the,south,together,his,captive,noble,lady,lumbering,along,between,ravenfeeder,and,iron,kiss
but,the,day,before,and,the,day,before,there,had,been,nothing,and,only,headless,jeyne,and,fear,before,that,then,two,more,days,of,empty,seas,and,cloudless,skies,after,ralf,the,limper,appeared,with,the,remnants,of,his,squadron
lord,quellon,white,widow,lamentation,woe,leviathan,iron,lady,reaper’s,wind,and,warhammer,with,six,more,ships,behind,two,of,them,stormwracked,and,under,tow

three,big,storms,and,foul,winds,between
red,winds,out,of,valyria,that,smelled,of,ash,and,brimstone,and,black,winds,that,drove,us,toward,that,blighted,shore
this,voyage,was,cursed,from,the,first
the,crow’s,eye,fears,you,my,lord,why,else,send,you,so,far,away
he,does,not,mean,for,us,to,return
victarion,had,thought,the,same,when,he,met,the,first,storm,a,day,out,of,old,volantis
the,gods,hate,kinslayers,he,brooded,elsewise,euron,crow’s,eye,would,have,died,a,dozen,deaths,by,my,hand
as,the,sea,crashed,around,him,and,the,deck,rose,and,fell,beneath,his,feet,he,had,seen,dagon’s,feast,and,red,tide,slammed,together,so,violently,that,both,exploded,into,splinters
my,brother’s,work,he’d,thought
those,were,the,first,two,ships,he’d,lost,from,his,own,third,of,the,fleet
but,not,the,last
so,he,had,slapped,the,limper,twice,across,the,face,and,said,the,first,is,for,the,ships,you,lost,the,second,for,your,talk,of,curses
speak,of,that,again,and,i,will,nail,your,tongue,to,the,mast
if,the,crow’s,eye,can,make,mutes,so,can,i
the,throb,of,pain,in,his,left,hand,made,the,words,harsher,than,they,might,have,been,elsewise,but,he,meant,what,he,said
more,ships,will,come
the,storms,are,done,for,now
i,will,have,my,fleet
a,monkey,on,the,mast,above,howled,derision,almost,as,if,it,could,taste,his,frustration
filthy,noisy,beast
he,could,send,a,man,up,after,it,but,the,monkeys,seemed,to,like,that,game,and,had,proved,themselves,more,agile,than,his,crew
the,howls,rang,in,his,ears,though,and,made,the,throbbing,in,his,hand,seem,worse
fifty-four,he,grumbled
it,would,have,been,too,much,to,hope,for,the,full,strength,of,the,iron,fleet,after,a,voyage,of,such,length,but,seventy,ships,even,eighty,the,drowned,god,might,have,granted,him,that,much
would,that,we,had,the,damphair,with,us,or,some,other,priest
victarion,had,made,sacrifice,before,setting,sail,and,again,in,the,stepstones,when,he,split,the,fleet,in,three,but,perhaps,he,had,said,the,wrong,prayers
that,or,the,drowned,god,has,no,power,here
more,and,more,he,had,come,to,fear,that,they,had,sailed,too,far,into,strange,seas,where,even,the,gods,were,queer,but,such,doubts,he,confided,only,to,his,dusky,woman,who,had,no,tongue,to,repeat,them
when,grief,appeared,victarion,summoned,wulfe,one-ear
i,will,want,words,with,the,vole

she,would,need,that,long,to,make,repairs,the,storms,had,left,her,little,more,than,a,hulk
that,would,bring,them,down,to,fifty-three,but,there,was,no,help,for,it
the,fleet,departs,upon,the,morrow,on,the,evening,tide
as,you,command,said,wulfe,but,another,day,might,mean,another,ship,lord,captain
aye
and,ten,days,might,mean,ten,ships,or,none,at,all
we,have,squandered,too,many,days,waiting,on,the,sight,of,sails
our,victory,will,be,that,much,the,sweeter,if,we,win,it,with,a,smaller,fleet
and,i,must,needs,reach,the,dragon,queen,before,the,volantenes

all,the,talk,had,been,of,the,gold,and,gems,and,slaves,that,would,flood,into,volantis,once,the,dragon,queen,was,dead
one,day,of,such,reports,was,all,that,victarion,greyjoy,could,stomach,he,paid,the,gold,price,for,food,and,water,though,it,shamed,him,and,took,his,ships,back,out,to,sea
the,storms,would,have,scattered,and,delayed,the,volantenes,even,as,they,had,his,own,ships
if,fortune,smiled,many,of,their,warships,might,have,sunk,or,run,aground
but,not,all
no,god,was,that,good,and,those,green,galleys,that,survived,by,now,could,well,have,sailed,around,valyria

the,isle,of,cedars
where,were,these,cedars

victarion,had,gone,ashore,a,dozen,times,hunting,fresh,meat,and,had,yet,to,see,a,cedar
the,girlish,maester,euron,had,inflicted,upon,him,back,in,westeros,claimed,this,place,had,once,been,called,the,isle,of,a,hundred,battles,’,but,the,men,who,had,fought,those,battles,had,all,gone,to,dust,centuries,ago
the,isle,of,monkeys,that’s,what,they,should,call,it
there,were,pigs,as,well,the,biggest,blackest,boars,that,any,of,the,ironborn,had,ever,seen,and,plenty,of,squealing,piglets,in,the,brush,bold,creatures,that,had,no,fear,of,man
they,were,learning,though
the,larders,of,the,iron,fleet,were,filling,up,with,smoked,hams,salted,pork,and,bacon
the,monkeys,though,the,monkeys,were,a,plague
victarion,had,forbidden,his,men,to,bring,any,of,the,demonic,creatures,aboard,ship,yet,somehow,half,his,fleet,was,now,infested,with,them,even,his,own,iron,victory
he,could,see,some,now,swinging,from,spar,to,spar,and,ship,to,ship
would,that,i,had,a,crossbow
victarion,did,not,like,this,sea,nor,these,endless,cloudless,skies,nor,the,blazing,sun,that,beat,down,on,their,heads,and,baked,the,decks,until,the,boards,were,hot,enough,to,scorch,bare,feet
he,did,not,like,these,storms,which,seemed,to,come,up,out,of,nowhere
the,seas,around,pyke,were,often,stormy,but,there,at,least,a,man,could,smell,them,coming
these,southron,storms,were,as,treacherous,as,women
even,the,water,was,the,wrong,color,a,shimmering,turquoise,close,to,shore,and,farther,out,a,blue,so,deep,that,it,was,almost,black
victarion,missed,the,grey-green,waters,of,home,with,their,whitecaps,and,surges
he,did,not,like,this,isle,of,cedars,either
the,hunting,might,be,good,but,the,forests,were,too,green,and,still,full,of,twisted,trees,and,queer,bright,flowers,like,none,his,men,had,ever,seen,before,and,there,were,horrors,lurking,amongst,the,broken,palaces,and,shattered,statues,of,drowned,velos,half,a,league,north,of,the,point,where,the,fleet,lay,at,anchor
the,last,time,victarion,had,spent,a,night,ashore,his,dreams,had,been,dark,and,disturbing,and,when,he,woke,his,mouth,was,full,of,blood
the,maester,said,he,had,bitten,his,own,tongue,in,his,sleep,but,he,took,it,for,a,sign,from,the,drowned,god,a,warning,that,if,he,lingered,here,too,long,he,would,choke,on,his,own,blood
on,the,day,the,doom,came,to,valyria,it,was,said,a,wall,of,water,three,hundred,feet,high,had,descended,on,the,island,drowning,hundreds,of,thousands,of,men,women,and,children,leaving,none,to,tell,the,tale,but,some,fisherfolk,who,had,been,at,sea,and,a,handful,of,velosi,spearmen,posted,in,a,stout,stone,tower,on,the,island’s,highest,hill,who,had,seen,the,hills,and,valleys,beneath,them,turn,into,a,raging,sea
fair,velos,with,its,palaces,of,cedar,and,pink,marble,had,vanished,in,a,heartbeat
on,the,north,end,of,the,island,the,ancient,brick,walls,and,stepped,pyramids,of,the,slaver,port,ghozai,had,suffered,the,same,fate
so,many,drowned,men,the,drowned,god,will,be,strong,there,victarion,had,thought,when,he,chose,the,island,for,the,three,parts,of,his,fleet,to,join,up,again
he,was,no,priest,though
what,if,he,had,gotten,it,backwards
perhaps,the,drowned,god,had,destroyed,the,island,in,his,wroth
his,brother,aeron,might,have,known,but,the,damphair,was,back,on,the,iron,islands,preaching,against,the,crow’s,eye,and,his,rule
no,godless,man,may,sit,the,seastone,chair
yet,the,captains,and,kings,had,cried,for,euron,at,the,kingsmoot,choosing,him,above,victarion,and,other,godly,men
the,morning,sun,was,shining,off,the,water,in,ripples,of,light,too,bright,to,look,upon
victarion’s,head,had,begun,to,pound,though,whether,from,the,sun,his,hand,or,the,doubts,that,troubled,him,he,could,not,say
he,made,his,way,below,to,his,cabin,where,the,air,was,cool,and,dim
the,dusky,woman,knew,what,he,wanted,without,his,even,asking
as,he,eased,himself,into,his,chair,she,took,a,soft,damp,cloth,from,the,basin,and,laid,it,across,his,brow
good,he,said
good
and,now,the,hand
the,dusky,woman,made,no,reply
euron,had,sliced,her,tongue,out,before,giving,her,to,him

that,was,his,brother’s,way
euron’s,gifts,are,poisoned,the,captain,had,reminded,himself,the,day,the,dusky,woman,came,aboard
i,want,none,of,his,leavings
he,had,decided,then,that,he,would,slit,her,throat,and,toss,her,in,the,sea,a,blood,sacrifice,to,the,drowned,god
somehow,though,he,had,never,quite,gotten,around,to,it
they,had,come,a,long,way,since
victarion,could,talk,to,the,dusky,woman

some,will,say,i,should,not,have,split,the,fleet
fools
nine-and-ninety,ships,we,had,a,cumbersome,beast,to,shepherd,across,the,seas,to,the,far,end,of,the,world
if,i’d,kept,them,together,the,faster,ships,would,have,been,held,hostage,to,the,slowest
and,where,to,find,provisions,for,so,many,mouths
no,port,wants,so,many,warships,in,their,waters
the,storms,would,have,scattered,us,in,any,case
like,leaves,strewn,across,the,summer,sea
instead,he,had,broken,the,great,fleet,into,squadrons,and,sent,each,by,a,different,route,to,slaver’s,bay
the,swiftest,ships,he,gave,to,red,ralf,stonehouse,to,sail,the,corsair’s,road,along,the,northern,coast,of,sothoryos
the,dead,cities,rotting,on,that,fervid,sweltering,shore,were,best,avoided,every,seamen,knew,but,in,the,mud-and-blood,towns,of,the,basilisks,isles,teeming,with,escaped,slaves,slavers,skinners,whores,hunters,brindled,men,and,worse,there,were,always,provisions,to,be,had,for,men,who,were,not,afraid,to,pay,the,iron,price
the,larger,heavier,slower,ships,made,for,lys,to,sell,the,captives,taken,on,the,shields,the,women,and,children,of,lord,hewett’s,town,and,other,islands,along,with,such,men,who,decided,they,would,sooner,yield,than,die
victarion,had,only,contempt,for,such,weaklings
even,so,the,selling,left,a,foul,taste,in,his,mouth
taking,a,man,as,thrall,or,a,woman,as,a,salt,wife,that,was,right,and,proper,but,men,were,not,goats,or,fowl,to,be,bought,and,sold,for,gold
he,was,glad,to,leave,the,selling,to,ralf,the,limper,who,would,use,the,coin,to,load,his,big,ships,with,provisions,for,the,long,slow,middle,passage,east
his,own,ships,crept,along,the,shores,of,the,disputed,lands,to,take,on,food,and,wine,and,fresh,water,at,volantis,before,swinging,south,around,valyria
that,was,the,most,common,way,east,and,the,one,most,heavily,trafficked,with,prizes,for,the,taking,and,small,islands,where,they,could,shelter,during,storms,make,repairs,and,renew,their,stores,if,need,be
four-and-fifty,ships,is,too,few,he,told,the,dusky,woman,but,i,can,wait,no,longer
the,only,way,he,grunted,as,she,peeled,the,bandage,off,tearing,a,crust,of,scab,as,well
the,flesh,beneath,was,green,and,black,where,the,sword,had,sliced,him,the,only,way,to,do,this,is,to,take,the,slavers,unawares,as,once,i,did,at,lannisport
sweep,in,from,the,sea,and,smash,them,then,take,the,girl,and,race,for,home,before,the,volantenes,descend,upon,us
victarion,was,no,craven,but,no,more,was,he,a,fool,he,could,not,defeat,three,hundred,ships,with,fifty-four
she’ll,be,my,wife,and,you,will,be,her,maid
a,maid,without,a,tongue,could,never,let,slip,any,secrets
he,might,have,said,more,but,that,was,when,the,maester,came,rapping,at,the,cabin,door,as,timid,as,a,mouse
enter,victarion,called,out,and,bar,the,door
you,know,why,you,are,here
lord,captain
the,maester,looked,like,a,mouse,as,well,with,his,grey,robes,and,little,brown,mustachio
does,he,think,that,makes,him,look,more,manly
kerwin,was,his,name
he,was,very,young,two-and-twenty,maybe
may,i,see,your,hand
he,asked
a,fool’s,question
maesters,had,their,uses,but,victarion,had,nothing,but,contempt,for,this,kerwin
with,his,smooth,pink,cheeks,soft,hands,and,brown,curls,he,looked,more,girlish,than,most,girls
when,first,he,came,aboard,the,iron,victory,he,had,a,smirky,little,smile,too,but,one,night,off,the,stepstones,he,had,smiled,at,the,wrong,man,and,burton,humble,had,knocked,out,four,of,his,teeth
not,long,after,that,kerwin,had,come,creeping,to,the,captain,to,complain,that,four,of,the,crew,had,dragged,him,belowdecks,and,used,him,as,a,woman
here,is,how,you,put,an,end,to,that,victarion,had,told,him,slamming,a,dagger,down,on,the,table,between,them
kerwin,took,the,blade,too,afraid,to,refuse,it,the,captain,judged,but,he,had,never,used,it
my,hand,is,here,victarion,said
look,all,you,like
maester,kerwin,went,down,to,one,knee,the,better,to,inspect,the,wound
he,even,sniffed,at,it,like,a,dog
i,will,need,to,let,the,pus,again
the,color,lord,captain,the,cut,is,not,healing
it,may,be,that,i,will,need,to,take,your,hand
they,had,talked,of,this,before
if,you,take,my,hand,i,will,kill,you
but,first,i,will,tie,you,over,the,rail,and,make,the,crew,a,gift,of,your,arse
get,on,with,it
there,will,be,pain
always
life,is,pain,you,fool
there,is,no,joy,but,in,the,drowned,god’s,watery,halls
do,it
the,boy,it,was,hard,to,think,of,one,so,soft,and,pink,as,a,man,laid,the,edge,of,the,dagger,across,the,captain’s,palm,and,slashed
the,pus,that,burst,forth,was,thick,and,yellow,as,sour,milk
the,dusky,woman,wrinkled,her,nose,at,the,smell,the,maester,gagged,and,even,victarion,himself,felt,his,stomach,churn
cut,deeper
get,it,all
show,me,the,blood
maester,kerwin,pressed,the,dagger,deep
this,time,it,hurt,but,blood,welled,up,as,well,as,pus,blood,so,dark,that,it,looked,black,in,the,lantern,light
blood,was,good
victarion,grunted,in,approval
he,sat,there,unflinching,as,the,maester,dabbed,and,squeezed,and,cleaned,the,pus,away,with,squares,of,soft,cloth,boiled,in,vinegar
by,the,time,he,finished,the,clean,water,in,his,basin,had,become,a,scummy,soup
the,sight,alone,would,sicken,any,man
take,that,filth,and,go
victarion,nodded,at,the,dusky,woman
she,can,bind,me,up
even,after,the,boy,had,fled,the,stink,remained
of,late,there,was,no,escaping,it
the,maester,had,suggested,that,the,wound,might,best,be,drained,up,on,deck,amidst,fresh,air,and,sunlight,but,victarion,forbade,it
this,was,not,something,that,his,crew,could,see
they,were,half,a,world,away,from,home,too,far,to,let,them,see,that,their,iron,captain,had,begun,to,rust
his,left,hand,still,throbbed,a,dull,pain,but,persistent
when,he,closed,his,hand,into,a,fist,it,sharpened,as,if,a,knife,were,stabbing,up,his,arm
not,a,knife,a,longsword
a,longsword,in,the,hand,of,a,ghost
serry,that,had,been,his,name
a,knight,and,heir,to,southshield
i,killed,him,but,he,stabs,at,me,from,beyond,the,grave
from,the,hot,heart,of,whatever,hell,i,sent,him,to,he,thrusts,his,steel,into,my,hand,and,twists
victarion,remembered,the,fight,as,if,it,had,been,yesterday
his,shield,had,been,in,shards,hanging,useless,from,his,arm,so,when,serry’s,longsword,came,flashing,down,he,had,reached,up,and,caught,it
the,stripling,had,been,stronger,than,he,looked,his,blade,bit,through,the,lobstered,steel,of,the,captain’s,gauntlet,and,the,padded,glove,beneath,into,the,meat,of,his,palm
a,scratch,from,a,little,kitten,victarion,told,himself,afterward
he,had,washed,the,cut,poured,some,boiled,vinegar,over,it,bound,it,up,and,thought,little,more,of,it,trusting,that,the,pain,would,fade,and,the,hand,heal,itself,in,time
instead,the,wound,had,festered,until,victarion,began,to,wonder,whether,serry’s,blade,had,been,poisoned
why,else,would,the,cut,refuse,to,heal
the,thought,made,him,rage
no,true,man,killed,with,poison
at,moat,cailin,the,bog,devils,had,loosed,poisoned,arrows,at,his,men,but,that,was,to,be,expected,from,such,degraded,creatures
serry,had,been,a,knight,highborn
poison,was,for,cravens,women,and,dornishmen
if,not,serry,who
he,asked,the,dusky,woman
could,that,mouse,of,a,maester,be,doing,this
maesters,know,spells,and,other,tricks
he,might,be,using,one,to,poison,me,hoping,i,will,let,him,cut,my,hand,off
the,more,he,thought,on,it,the,more,likely,it,seemed
the,crow’s,eye,gave,him,to,me,wretched,creature,that,he,is
euron,had,taken,kerwin,off,greenshield,where,he,had,been,in,service,to,lord,chester,tending,his,ravens,and,teaching,his,children,or,perhaps,the,other,away,around
and,how,the,mouse,had,squealed,when,one,of,euron’s,mutes,delivered,him,aboard,the,iron,victory,dragging,him,along,by,the,convenient,chain,about,his,neck
if,this,is,his,revenge,he,wrongs,me
it,was,euron,who,insisted,he,be,taken,to,keep,him,from,making,mischief,with,his,birds
his,brother,had,given,him,three,cages,of,ravens,too,so,kerwin,could,send,back,word,of,their,voyaging,but,victarion,had,forbidden,him,to,loose,them
let,the,crow’s,eye,stew,and,wonder
the,dusky,woman,was,binding,his,hand,with,fresh,linen,wrapping,it,six,times,around,his,palm,when,longwater,pyke,came,pounding,at,the,cabin,door,to,tell,him,that,the,captain,of,grief,had,come,aboard,with,a,prisoner
says,he’s,brought,us,a,wizard,captain
says,he,fished,him,from,the,sea
a,wizard
could,the,drowned,god,have,sent,a,gift,to,him,here,on,the,far,side,of,the,world
his,brother,aeron,would,have,known,but,aeron,had,seen,the,majesty,of,the,drowned,god’s,watery,halls,below,the,sea,before,being,returned,to,life
victarion,had,a,healthy,fear,of,his,god,as,all,men,should,but,put,his,faith,in,steel
he,flexed,his,wounded,hand,grimacing,then,pulled,his,glove,on,and,rose
show,me,this,wizard
grief’s,master,awaited,them,on,deck
a,small,man,as,hairy,as,he,was,homely,he,was,a,sparr,by,birth
his,men,called,him,the,vole
lord,captain,he,said,when,victarion,appeared,this,is,moqorro
a,gift,to,us,from,the,drowned,god
the,wizard,was,a,monster,of,a,man,as,tall,as,victarion,himself,and,twice,as,wide,with,a,belly,like,a,boulder,and,a,tangle,of,bone-white,hair,that,grew,about,his,face,like,a,lion’s,mane
his,skin,was,black
not,the,nut,brown,of,the,summer,islanders,on,their,swan,ships,nor,the,red-brown,of,the,dothraki,horselords,nor,the,charcoal-and-earth,color,of,the,dusky,woman’s,skin,but,black
blacker,than,coal,blacker,than,jet,blacker,than,a,raven’s,wing
burned,victarion,thought,like,a,man,who,has,been,roasted,in,the,flames,until,his,flesh,chars,and,crisps,and,falls,smoking,from,his,bones
the,fires,that,had,charred,him,still,danced,across,his,cheeks,and,forehead,where,his,eyes,peered,out,from,amongst,a,mask,of,frozen,flames

marks,of,evil
we,found,him,clinging,to,a,broken,spar,said,the,vole

salt,water,was,holy,aeron,damphair,and,other,priests,might,bless,men,with,it,and,swallow,a,mouthful,or,two,from,time,to,time,to,strengthen,their,faith,but,no,mortal,man,could,drink,of,the,deep,sea,for,days,at,a,time,and,hope,to,live
you,claim,to,be,a,sorcerer
victarion,asked,the,prisoner
no,captain,the,black,man,answered,in,the,common,tongue

a,red,priest,then

those,had,worn,rich,red,robes,of,silk,and,velvet,and,lambswool
this,one,was,dressed,in,faded,salt-stained,rags,that,clung,to,his,thick,legs,and,hung,about,his,torso,in,tatters,but,when,the,captain,peered,at,the,rags,more,closely,it,did,appear,as,if,they,might,once,have,been,red
a,pink,priest,victarion,announced
a,demon,priest,said,wulfe,one-ear

even,the,monkeys,were,amused
they,chattered,overhead,and,one,flung,down,a,handful,of,his,own,shit,to,spatter,on,the,boards
victarion,greyjoy,mistrusted,laughter
the,sound,of,it,always,left,him,with,the,uneasy,feeling,that,he,was,the,butt,of,some,jape,he,did,not,understand
euron,crow’s,eye,had,oft,made,mock,of,him,when,they,were,boys
so,had,aeron,before,he,had,become,the,damphair
their,mockery,oft,came,disguised,as,praise,and,sometimes,victarion,had,not,even,realized,he,was,being,mocked
not,until,he,heard,the,laughter
then,came,the,anger,boiling,up,in,the,back,of,his,throat,until,he,was,like,to,choke,upon,the,taste
that,was,how,he,felt,about,the,monkeys
their,antics,never,brought,so,much,as,a,smile,to,the,captain’s,face,though,his,crew,would,roar,and,hoot,and,whistle
send,him,down,to,the,drowned,god,before,he,brings,a,curse,upon,us,urged,burton,humble

why,would,the,drowned,god,cast,him,up,unless,he,meant,for,us,to,find,him
his,brother,euron,had,his,pet,wizards
perhaps,the,drowned,god,meant,for,victarion,to,have,one,too
why,do,you,say,this,man,is,a,wizard

serving,at,his,nightly,banquets,tyrion,had,soon,learned,that,yezzan,stood,foremost,amongst,those,yunkish,lords,who,favored,honoring,the,peace,with,meereen
most,of,the,others,were,only,biding,their,time,waiting,for,the,armies,of,volantis,to,arrive
a,few,wanted,to,assault,the,city,immediately,lest,the,volantenes,rob,them,of,their,glory,and,the,best,part,of,the,plunder
yezzan,would,have,no,part,of,that
nor,would,he,consent,to,returning,meereen’s,hostages,by,way,of,trebuchet,as,the,sellsword,bloodbeard,had,proposed
but,much,and,more,can,change,in,two,days
two,days,ago,nurse,had,been,hale,and,healthy
two,days,ago,yezzan,had,not,heard,the,pale,mare’s,ghostly,hoofbeats
two,days,ago,the,fleets,of,old,volantis,had,been,two,days,farther,off
and,now,is,yezzan,going,to,die

yezzan,must,not,die
the,hermaphrodite,stroked,the,brow,of,their,gargantuan,master,pushing,back,his,sweat-damp,hair
the,yunkishman,moaned,and,another,flood,of,brown,water,gushed,down,his,legs

you,on,your,dog,and,me,on,my,sow,chasing,a,dragon,across,the,dothraki,sea
tyrion,scratched,his,scar,to,keep,from,laughing
this,particular,dragon,has,already,evinced,a,fondness,for,roast,pork
and,roast,dwarf,is,twice,as,tasty
it,was,just,a,wish,said,penny,wistfully
we,could,sail,away

yezzan,must,live
or,we,all,die,with,him
the,pale,mare,does,not,carry,off,every,rider
the,master,will,recover
that,was,a,bald-faced,lie
it,would,be,a,wonder,if,yezzan,lived,another,day
the,lord,of,suet,was,already,dying,from,whatever,hideous,disease,he,had,brought,back,from,sothoryos,it,seemed,to,tyrion
this,would,just,hasten,his,end

the,healer,said,he,needs,fresh,water
we,will,see,to,that

penny,come,with,me
tyrion,opened,the,tent,flap,and,ushered,her,out,into,the,heat,of,a,meereenese,morning
the,air,was,muggy,and,oppressive,yet,still,a,welcome,relief,from,the,miasma,of,sweat,shit,and,sickness,that,filled,the,inside,of,yezzan’s,palatial,pavilion

yezzan’s,other,slaves,had,refused,to,go,near,the,overseer,once,the,cramps,began,so,it,was,left,to,tyrion,to,keep,him,warm,and,bring,him,drinks

you,fill,the,pails,and,come,right,back,dwarf
you,know,what,happens,to,slaves,who,try,to,escape
bring,the,pails,tyrion,told,penny
he,went,off,with,the,man,morgo,to,fetch,ser,jorah,mormont,from,his,cage
the,knight,had,not,adapted,well,to,bondage
when,called,upon,to,play,the,bear,and,carry,off,the,maiden,fair,he,had,been,sullen,and,uncooperative,shuffling,lifelessly,through,his,paces,when,he,deigned,to,take,part,in,their,mummery,at,all
though,he,had,not,attempted,escape,nor,offered,violence,to,his,captors,he,would,ignore,their,commands,oft,as,not,or,reply,with,muttered,curses
none,of,this,had,amused,nurse,who,made,his,displeasure,clear,by,confining,mormont,in,an,iron,cage,and,having,him,beaten,every,evening,as,the,sun,sank,into,slaver’s,bay
the,knight,absorbed,the,beatings,silently,the,only,sounds,were,the,muttered,curses,of,the,slaves,who,beat,him,and,the,dull,thuds,of,their,clubs,pounding,against,ser,jorah’s,bruised,and,battered,flesh
the,man,is,a,shell,tyrion,thought,the,first,time,he,saw,the,big,knight,beaten
i,should,have,held,my,tongue,and,let,zahrina,have,him
it,might,have,been,a,kinder,fate,than,this
mormont,emerged,from,the,cramped,confines,of,the,cage,bent,and,squinting,with,both,eyes,blackened,and,his,back,crusty,with,dried,blood
his,face,was,so,bruised,and,swollen,that,he,hardly,looked,human
he,was,naked,except,for,a,breechclout,a,filthy,bit,of,yellow,rag
you’re,to,help,them,carry,water,morgo,told,him
ser,jorah’s,only,reply,was,a,sullen,stare
some,men,would,sooner,die,free,than,live,a,slave,i,suppose
tyrion,was,not,stricken,with,that,affliction,himself,thankfully,but,if,mormont,murdered,morgo,the,other,slaves,might,not,draw,that,distinction
come,he,said,before,the,knight,did,something,brave,and,stupid
he,waddled,off,and,hoped,mormont,would,follow
the,gods,were,good,for,once
mormont,followed
two,pails,for,penny,two,for,tyrion,and,four,for,ser,jorah,two,in,either,hand
the,nearest,well,was,south,and,west,of,the,harridan,so,they,set,off,in,that,direction,the,bells,on,their,collars,ringing,merrily,with,every,step
no,one,paid,them,any,mind
they,were,just,slaves,fetching,water,for,their,master
wearing,a,collar,conferred,certain,advantages,particularly,a,gilded,collar,inscribed,with,the,name,of,yezzan,zo,qaggaz
the,chime,of,those,little,bells,proclaimed,their,value,to,anyone,with,ears
a,slave,was,only,as,important,as,his,master,yezzan,was,the,richest,man,in,the,yellow,city,and,had,brought,six,hundred,slave,soldiers,to,the,war,even,if,he,did,look,like,a,monstrous,yellow,slug,and,smell,of,piss
their,collars,gave,them,leave,to,go,anywhere,they,might,wish,within,the,camp
until,yezzan,dies
the,clanker,lords,had,their,slave,soldiers,drilling,in,the,nearest,field
the,clatter,of,the,chains,that,bound,them,made,a,harsh,metallic,music,as,they,marched,across,the,sand,in,lockstep,and,formed,up,with,their,long,spears
elsewhere,teams,of,slaves,were,raising,ramps,of,stone,and,sand,beneath,their,mangonels,and,scorpions,angling,them,upward,at,the,sky,the,better,to,defend,the,camp,should,the,black,dragon,return
it,made,the,dwarf,smile,to,see,them,sweating,and,cursing,as,they,wrestled,the,heavy,machines,onto,the,inclines
crossbows,were,much,in,evidence,as,well
every,other,man,seemed,to,be,clutching,one,with,a,quiverfull,of,bolts,hanging,from,his,hip
if,anyone,had,thought,to,ask,him,tyrion,could,have,told,them,not,to,bother
unless,one,of,those,long,iron,scorpion,bolts,chanced,to,find,an,eye,the,queen’s,pet,monster,was,not,like,to,be,brought,down,by,such,toys
dragons,are,not,so,easy,to,kill,as,that
tickle,him,with,these,and,you’ll,only,make,him,angry
the,eyes,were,where,a,dragon,was,most,vulnerable
the,eyes,and,the,brain,behind,them
not,the,underbelly,as,certain,old,tales,would,have,it
the,scales,there,were,just,as,tough,as,those,along,a,dragon’s,back,and,flanks
and,not,down,the,gullet,either
that,was,madness
these,would-be,dragonslayers,might,as,well,try,to,quench,a,fire,with,a,spear,thrust
death,comes,out,of,the,dragon’s,mouth,septon,barth,had,written,in,his,unnatural,history,but,death,does,not,go,in,that,way
farther,on,two,legions,from,new,ghis,were,facing,off,shield,wall,to,shield,wall,whilst,serjeants,in,iron,halfhelms,with,horsehair,crests,screamed,commands,in,their,own,incomprehensible,dialect
to,the,naked,eye,the,ghiscari,looked,more,formidable,than,the,yunkish,slave,soldiers,but,tyrion,nursed,doubts
the,legionaries,might,be,armed,and,organized,in,the,same,manner,as,unsullied,but,the,eunuchs,knew,no,other,life,whereas,the,ghiscari,were,free,citizens,who,served,for,three-year,terms
the,line,at,the,well,stretched,back,a,quarter,mile
there,were,only,a,handful,of,wells,within,a,day’s,march,of,meereen,so,the,wait,was,always,long
most,of,the,yunkish,host,drew,their,drinking,water,from,the,skahazadhan,which,tyrion,had,known,was,a,very,bad,idea,even,before,the,healer’s,warning
the,clever,ones,took,care,to,stay,upstream,of,the,latrines,but,they,were,still,downstream,of,the,city
the,fact,that,there,were,any,good,wells,at,all,within,a,day’s,march,of,the,city,only,went,to,prove,that,daenerys,targaryen,was,still,an,innocent,where,siegecraft,was,concerned
she,should,have,poisoned,every,well
then,all,the,yunkishmen,would,be,drinking,from,the,river
see,how,long,their,siege,lasts,then
that,was,what,his,lord,father,would,have,done,tyrion,did,not,doubt
every,time,they,shuffled,forward,another,place,the,bells,on,their,collars,tinkled,brightly
such,a,happy,sound,it,makes,me,want,to,scoop,out,someone’s,eyeballs,with,a,spoon
by,now,griff,and,duck,and,haldon,halfmaester,should,be,in,westeros,with,their,young,prince
i,should,be,with,them,but,no,i,had,to,have,a,whore
kinslaying,was,not,enough,i,needed,cunt,and,wine,to,seal,my,ruin,and,here,i,am,on,the,wrong,side,of,the,world,wearing,a,slave,collar,with,little,golden,bells,to,announce,my,coming
if,i,dance,just,right,maybe,i,can,ring,the,rains,of,castamere
there,was,no,better,place,to,hear,the,latest,news,and,rumors,than,around,the,well
i,know,what,i,saw,an,old,slave,in,a,rusted,iron,collar,was,saying,as,tyrion,and,penny,shuffled,along,in,the,queue,and,i,saw,that,dragon,ripping,off,arms,and,legs,tearing,men,in,half,burning,them,down,to,ash,and,bones
people,started,running,trying,to,get,out,of,that,pit,but,i,come,to,see,a,show,and,by,all,the,gods,of,ghis,i,saw,one
i,was,up,in,the,purple,so,i,didn’t,think,the,dragon,was,like,to,trouble,me
the,queen,climbed,onto,the,dragon’s,back,and,flew,away,insisted,a,tall,brown,woman
she,tried,said,the,old,man,but,she,couldn’t,hold,on
the,crossbows,wounded,the,dragon,and,the,queen,was,struck,right,between,her,sweet,pink,teats,i,hear
that,was,when,she,fell
she,died,in,the,gutter,crushed,beneath,a,wagon’s,wheels
i,know,a,girl,who,knows,a,man,who,saw,her,die
in,this,company,silence,was,the,better,part,of,wisdom,but,tyrion,could,not,help,himself
no,corpse,was,found,he,said
the,old,man,frowned
what,would,you,know,about,it
they,were,there,said,the,brown,woman
it’s,them,the,jousting,dwarfs,the,ones,who,tilted,for,the,queen
the,old,man,squinted,down,as,if,seeing,him,and,penny,for,the,first,time
you’re,the,ones,who,rode,the,pigs
our,notoriety,precedes,us
tyrion,sketched,a,courtly,bow,and,refrained,from,pointing,out,that,one,of,the,pigs,was,really,a,dog
the,sow,i,ride,is,actually,my,sister
we,have,the,same,nose,could,you,tell
a,wizard,cast,a,spell,on,her,but,if,you,give,her,a,big,wet,kiss,she,will,turn,into,a,beautiful,woman
the,pity,is,once,you,get,to,know,her,you’ll,want,to,kiss,her,again,to,turn,her,back
laughter,erupted,all,around,them
even,the,old,man,joined,in
you,saw,her,then,said,the,redheaded,boy,behind,them
you,saw,the,queen
is,she,as,beautiful,as,they,say
i,saw,a,slender,girl,with,silvery,hair,wrapped,in,a,tokar,he,might,have,told,them
her,face,was,veiled,and,i,never,got,close,enough,for,a,good,look
i,was,riding,on,a,pig
daenerys,targaryen,had,been,seated,in,the,owner’s,box,beside,her,ghiscari,king,but,tyrion’s,eyes,had,been,drawn,to,the,knight,in,the,white-and-gold,armor,behind,her
though,his,features,were,concealed,the,dwarf,would,have,known,barristan,selmy,anywhere
illyrio,was,right,about,that,much,at,least,he,remembered,thinking
will,selmy,know,me,though
and,what,will,he,do,if,he,does
he,had,almost,revealed,himself,then,and,there,but,something,stopped,him,caution,cowardice,instinct,call,it,what,you,will
he,could,not,imagine,barristan,the,bold,greeting,him,with,anything,but,hostility
selmy,had,never,approved,of,jaime’s,presence,in,his,precious,kingsguard
before,the,rebellion,the,old,knight,thought,him,too,young,and,untried,afterward,he,had,been,known,to,say,that,the,kingslayer,should,exchange,that,white,cloak,for,a,black,one
and,his,own,crimes,were,worse
jaime,had,killed,a,madman
tyrion,had,put,a,quarrel,through,the,groin,of,his,own,sire,a,man,ser,barristan,had,known,and,served,for,years
he,might,have,chanced,it,all,the,same,but,then,penny,had,landed,a,blow,on,his,shield,and,the,moment,was,gone,never,to,return
the,queen,watched,us,tilt,penny,was,telling,the,other,slaves,in,line,but,that,was,the,only,time,we,saw,her
you,must,have,seen,the,dragon,said,the,old,man
would,that,we,had
the,gods,had,not,even,vouchsafed,him,that,much
as,daenerys,targaryen,was,taking,wing,nurse,had,been,clapping,irons,round,their,ankles,to,make,certain,they,would,not,attempt,escape,on,their,way,back,to,their,master
if,the,overseer,had,only,taken,his,leave,after,delivering,them,to,the,abbatoir,or,fled,with,the,rest,of,the,slavers,when,the,dragon,descended,from,the,sky,the,two,dwarfs,might,have,strolled,away,free
or,run,away,more,like,our,little,bells,a-jingle
was,there,a,dragon
tyrion,said,with,a,shrug
all,i,know,is,that,no,dead,queens,were,found
the,old,man,was,not,convinced
ah,they,found,corpses,by,the,hundred
they,dragged,them,inside,the,pit,and,burned,them,though,half,was,crisp,already
might,be,they,didn’t,know,her,burned,and,bloody,and,crushed
might,be,they,did,but,decided,to,say,elsewise,to,keep,you,slaves,quiet
us,slaves
said,the,brown,woman
you,wear,a,collar,too
ghazdor’s,collar,the,old,man,boasted
known,him,since,we,was,born
i’m,almost,like,a,brother,to,him
slaves,like,you,sweepings,out,of,astapor,and,yunkai,you,whine,about,being,free,but,i,wouldn’t,give,the,dragon,queen,my,collar,if,she,offered,to,suck,my,cock,for,it
man,has,the,right,master,that’s,better
tyrion,did,not,dispute,him
the,most,insidious,thing,about,bondage,was,how,easy,it,was,to,grow,accustomed,to,it
the,life,of,most,slaves,was,not,all,that,different,from,the,life,of,a,serving,man,at,casterly,rock,it,seemed,to,him
true,some,slaveowners,and,their,overseers,were,brutal,and,cruel,but,the,same,was,true,of,some,westerosi,lords,and,their,stewards,and,bailiffs
most,of,the,yunkai’i,treated,their,chattels,decently,enough,so,long,as,they,did,their,jobs,and,caused,no,trouble,and,this,old,man,in,his,rusted,collar,with,his,fierce,loyalty,to,lord,wobblecheeks,his,owner,was,not,at,all,atypical
ghazdor,the,great-hearted
tyrion,said,sweetly
our,master,yezzan,has,often,spoken,of,his,wits
what,yezzan,had,actually,said,was,on,the,order,of,i,have,more,wits,in,the,left,cheek,of,my,arse,than,ghazdor,and,his,brothers,have,between,them
he,thought,it,prudent,to,omit,the,actual,words
midday,had,come,and,gone,before,he,and,penny,reached,the,well,where,a,scrawny,one-legged,slave,was,drawing,water
he,squinted,at,them,suspiciously
nurse,always,comes,for,yezzan’s,water,with,four,men,and,a,mule,cart
he,dropped,the,bucket,down,the,well,once,more
there,was,a,soft,splash
the,one-legged,man,let,the,bucket,fill,then,began,to,draw,it,upward
his,arms,were,sunburnt,and,peeling,scrawny,to,look,at,but,all,muscle
the,mule,died,said,tyrion
so,did,nurse,poor,man
and,now,yezzan,himself,has,mounted,the,pale,mare,and,six,of,his,soldiers,have,the,shits
may,i,have,two,pails,full
as,you,like
that,was,the,end,of,idle,talk
is,that,hoofbeats,you,hear
the,lie,about,the,soldiers,got,old,one-leg,moving,much,more,quickly
they,started,back,each,of,the,dwarfs,carrying,two,brim-full,pails,of,sweet,water,and,ser,jorah,with,two,pails,in,each,hand
the,day,was,growing,hotter,the,air,as,thick,and,wet,as,damp,wool,and,the,pails,seemed,to,grow,heavier,with,every,step
a,long,walk,on,short,legs
water,sloshed,from,his,pails,with,every,stride,splashing,round,his,legs,whilst,his,bells,played,a,marching,song
had,i,known,it,would,come,to,this,father,i,might,have,let,you,live
half,a,mile,east,a,dark,plume,of,smoke,was,rising,where,a,tent,had,been,set,afire
burning,last,night’s,dead
this,way,tyrion,said,jerking,his,head,to,the,right
penny,gave,him,a,puzzled,look
that’s,not,how,we,came
we,don’t,want,to,breathe,that,smoke
it’s,full,of,malign,humors
it,was,not,a,lie
not,entirely
penny,was,soon,puffing,struggling,with,the,weight,of,her,pails
i,need,to,rest
as,you,wish
tyrion,set,the,pails,of,water,on,the,ground,grateful,for,the,halt
his,legs,were,cramping,badly,so,he,found,himself,a,likely,rock,and,sat,on,it,to,rub,his,thighs
i,could,do,that,for,you,offered,penny
i,know,where,the,knots,are
as,fond,as,he,had,grown,of,the,girl,it,still,made,him,uncomfortable,when,she,touched,him
he,turned,to,ser,jorah
a,few,more,beatings,and,you’ll,be,uglier,than,i,am,mormont
tell,me,is,there,any,fight,left,in,you
the,big,knight,raised,two,blackened,eyes,and,looked,at,him,as,he,might,look,at,a,bug
enough,to,crack,your,neck,imp
good
tyrion,picked,up,his,pails
this,way,then
penny,wrinkled,her,brow
no
it’s,to,the,left
she,pointed
that’s,the,harridan,there
and,that’s,the,wicked,sister
tyrion,nodded,in,the,other,direction
trust,me,he,said
my,way,is,quicker
he,set,off,his,bells,jingling
penny,would,follow,he,knew
sometimes,he,envied,the,girl,all,her,pretty,little,dreams
she,reminded,him,of,sansa,stark,the,child,bride,he,had,wed,and,lost
despite,the,horrors,penny,had,suffered,she,remained,somehow,trusting
she,should,know,better
she,is,older,than,sansa
and,she’s,a,dwarf
she,acts,as,if,she,has,forgotten,that,as,if,she,were,highborn,and,fair,to,look,upon,instead,of,a,slave,in,a,grotesquerie
at,night,tyrion,would,oft,hear,her,praying
a,waste,of,words
if,there,are,gods,to,listen,they,are,monstrous,gods,who,torment,us,for,their,sport
who,else,would,make,a,world,like,this,so,full,of,bondage,blood,and,pain
who,else,would,shape,us,as,they,have
sometimes,he,wanted,to,slap,her,shake,her,scream,at,her,anything,to,wake,her,from,her,dreams
no,one,is,going,to,save,us,he,wanted,to,scream,at,her
the,worst,is,yet,to,come
yet,somehow,he,could,never,say,the,words
instead,of,giving,her,a,good,hard,crack,across,that,ugly,face,of,hers,to,knock,the,blinders,from,her,eyes,he,would,find,himself,squeezing,her,shoulder,or,giving,her,a,hug
every,touch,a,lie
i,have,paid,her,so,much,false,coin,that,she,half,thinks,she’s,rich
he,had,even,kept,the,truth,of,daznak’s,pit,from,her
lions
they,were,going,to,set,lions,on,us
it,would,have,been,exquisitely,ironic,that
perhaps,he,would,have,had,time,for,a,short,bitter,chortle,before,being,torn,apart
no,one,ever,told,him,the,end,that,had,been,planned,for,them,not,in,so,many,words,but,it,had,not,been,hard,to,puzzle,out,down,beneath,the,bricks,of,daznak’s,pit,in,the,hidden,world,below,the,seats,the,dark,domain,of,the,pit,fighters,and,the,serving,men,who,tended,to,them,quick,and,dead,the,cooks,who,fed,them,the,ironmongers,who,armed,them,the,barber-surgeons,who,bled,them,and,shaved,them,and,bound,up,their,wounds,the,whores,who,serviced,them,before,and,after,fights,the,corpse,handlers,who,dragged,the,losers,off,the,sands,with,chains,and,iron,hooks
nurse’s,face,had,given,tyrion,his,first,inkling
after,their,show,he,and,penny,had,returned,to,the,torchlit,vault,where,the,fighters,gathered,before,and,after,their,matches
some,sat,sharpening,their,weapons,others,sacrificed,to,queer,gods,or,dulled,their,nerves,with,milk,of,the,poppy,before,going,out,to,die
those,who’d,fought,and,won,were,dicing,in,a,corner,laughing,as,only,men,who,have,just,faced,death,and,lived,can,laugh
nurse,was,paying,out,some,silver,to,a,pit,man,on,a,lost,wager,when,he,spied,penny,leading,crunch
the,confusion,in,his,eyes,was,gone,in,half,a,heartbeat,but,not,before,tyrion,grasped,what,it,meant
nurse,did,not,expect,us,back
he,had,looked,around,at,other,faces
none,of,them,expected,us,back
we,were,meant,to,die,out,there
the,final,piece,fell,into,place,when,he,overheard,an,animal,trainer,complaining,loudly,to,the,pitmaster
the,lions,are,hungry
two,days,since,they,ate
i,was,told,not,to,feed,them,and,i,haven’t
the,queen,should,pay,for,meat
you,take,that,up,with,her,the,next,time,she,holds,court,the,pitmaster,threw,back,at,him
even,now,penny,did,not,suspect
when,she,spoke,about,the,pit,her,chief,worry,was,that,more,people,had,not,laughed
they,would,have,pissed,themselves,laughing,if,the,lions,had,been,loosed,tyrion,almost,told,her
instead,he’d,squeezed,her,shoulder
penny,came,to,a,sudden,halt
we’re,going,the,wrong,way
we’re,not
tyrion,lowered,his,pails,to,the,ground
the,handles,had,gouged,deep,grooves,in,his,fingers
those,are,the,tents,we,want,there
the,second,sons
a,queer,smile,split,ser,jorah’s,face
if,you,think,to,find,help,there,you,don’t,know,brown,ben,plumm
oh,i,do
plumm,and,i,have,played,five,games,of,cyvasse
brown,ben,is,shrewd,tenacious,not,unintelligent,but,wary

more,like,scar,and,his,friends,would,soon,be,feasting,on,ham,and,bacon,and,a,savory,dog,stew,but,penny,did,not,need,to,hear,that
nurse,is,dead,and,yezzan’s,dying
it,could,be,dark,before,anyone,thinks,to,miss,us
we,will,never,have,a,better,chance,than,now

mormont,fell,in,beside,him
after,a,moment,he,heard,the,sounds,of,penny,hurrying,after,him,down,a,sandy,slope,to,a,circle,of,ragged,tents

like,all,good,queens,she,put,her,people,first,else,she,would,never,have,wed,hizdahr,zo,loraq,but,the,girl,in,her,still,yearned,for,poetry,passion,and,laughter

if,this,one,had,been,the,prince,things,might,have,gone,elsewise,he,could,not,help,but,think,but,there,was,something,a,bit,too,pleasant,about,drinkwater,for,his,taste
false,coin,the,old,knight,thought
he,had,known,such,men,before
whatever,he,was,whispering,must,have,been,amusing,for,his,big,bald,friend,gave,a,sudden,snort,of,laughter,loud,enough,so,that,the,king,himself,turned,his,head,toward,the,dornishmen
when,he,saw,the,prince,hizdahr,zo,loraq,frowned
ser,barristan,did,not,like,that,frown
and,when,the,king,beckoned,his,cousin,marghaz,closer,leaned,down,and,whispered,in,his,ear,he,liked,that,even,less
i,swore,no,oath,to,dorne,ser,barristan,told,himself

i,could,not,help,prince,lewyn,on,the,trident,but,i,can,help,his,nephew,now

his,continued,presence,even,after,daenerys,had,given,herself,to,another,before,the,eyes,of,gods,and,men,would,provoke,any,husband,and,quentyn,no,longer,had,the,queen,to,shield,him,from,hizdahr’s,wroth
although,the,thought,hit,him,like,a,slap,across,the,face

plots,and,poisons,were,no,strangers,to,him
nor,was,prince,lewyn,his,only,uncle

daenerys,had,taken,another,for,her,consort,but,if,hizdahr,died,she,would,be,free,to,wed,again
could,the,shavepate,have,been,wrong
who,can,say,that,the,locusts,were,meant,for,daenerys
it,was,the,king’s,own,box
what,if,he,was,meant,to,be,the,victim,all,along
hizdahr’s,death,would,have,smashed,the,fragile,peace
the,sons,of,the,harpy,would,have,resumed,their,murders,the,yunkishmen,their,war
daenerys,might,have,had,no,better,choice,than,quentyn,and,his,marriage,pact

the,yunkishmen,had,come
three,wise,masters,led,the,procession,from,the,yellow,city,each,with,his,own,armed,retinue

should,we,be,frightened,of,hizdahr,zo,loraq
you,saw,him,just,now
he,quailed,before,the,yunkishmen
they,sent,him,a,head,and,he,did,nothing
quentyn,martell,nodded,in,agreement
a,prince,does,well,to,think,before,he,acts
this,king,i,do,not,know,what,to,think,of,him
the,queen,warned,me,against,him,as,well,true,but,she,warned,you
selmy,frowned
why,are,you,still,here
prince,quentyn,flushed
the,marriage,pact,was,made,by,two,dead,men,and,contained,not,a,word,about,the,queen,or,you
it,promised,your,sister’s,hand,to,the,queen’s,brother,another,dead,man
it,has,no,force
until,you,turned,up,here,her,grace,was,ignorant,of,its,existence
your,father,keeps,his,secrets,well,prince,quentyn
too,well,i,fear
if,the,queen,had,known,of,this,pact,in,qarth,she,might,never,have,turned,aside,for,slaver’s,bay,but,you,came,too,late
i,have,no,wish,to,salt,your,wounds,but,her,grace,has,a,new,husband,and,an,old,paramour,and,seems,to,prefer,the,both,of,them,to,you
anger,flashed,in,the,prince’s,dark,eyes
this,ghiscari,lordling,is,no,fit,consort,for,the,queen,of,the,seven,kingdoms
that,is,not,for,you,to,judge
ser,barristan,paused,wondering,if,he,had,said,too,much,already
no
tell,him,the,rest,of,it
that,day,at,daznak’s,pit,some,of,the,food,in,the,royal,box,was,poisoned
it,was,only,chance,that,strong,belwas,ate,it,all
the,blue,graces,say,that,only,his,size,and,freakish,strength,have,saved,him,but,it,was,a,near,thing
he,may,yet,die
the,shock,was,plain,on,prince,quentyn’s,face
poison,meant,for,daenerys
her,or,hizdahr
perhaps,both
the,box,was,his,though
his,grace,made,all,the,arrangements
if,the,poison,was,his,doing,well,he,will,need,a,scapegoat
who,better,than,a,rival,from,a,distant,land,who,has,no,friends,at,this,court
who,better,than,a,suitor,the,queen,spurned
quentyn,martell,went,pale
me
i,would,never,you,cannot,think,i,had,any,part,in,any,that,was,the,truth,or,he,is,a,master,mummer
others,might,said,ser,barristan
the,red,viper,was,your,uncle
and,you,have,good,reason,to,want,king,hizdahr,dead
so,do,others,suggested,gerris,drinkwater
naharis,for,one
the,queen’s,paramour,ser,barristan,finished,before,the,dornish,knight,could,say,anything,that,might,besmirch,the,queen’s,honor
that,is,what,you,call,them,down,in,dorne,is,it,not
he,did,not,wait,for,a,reply
prince,lewyn,was,my,sworn,brother
in,those,days,there,were,few,secrets,amongst,the,kingsguard
i,know,he,kept,a,paramour
he,did,not,feel,there,was,any,shame,in,that
no,said,quentyn,red-faced,but,daario,would,kill,hizdahr,in,a,heartbeat,if,he,dared,ser,barristan,went,on
but,not,with,poison
never
and,daario,was,not,there,in,any,case
hizdahr,would,be,pleased,to,blame,him,for,the,locusts,all,the,same,but,the,king,may,yet,have,need,of,the,stormcrows,and,he,will,lose,them,if,he,appears,complicit,in,the,death,of,their,captain
no,my,prince
if,his,grace,needs,a,poisoner,he,will,look,to,you
he,had,said,all,that,he,could,safely,say
in,a,few,more,days,if,the,gods,smiled,on,them,hizdahr,zo,loraq,would,no,longer,rule,meereen,but,no,good,would,be,served,by,having,prince,quentyn,caught,up,in,the,bloodbath,that,was,coming
if,you,must,remain,in,meereen,you,would,do,well,to,stay,away,from,court,and,hope,hizdahr,forgets,you,ser,barristan,finished,but,a,ship,for,volantis,would,be,wiser,my,prince
whatever,course,you,choose,i,wish,you,well
before,he,had,gone,three,steps,quentyn,martell,called,out,to,him
barristan,the,bold,they,call,you
some,do
selmy,had,won,that,name,when,he,was,ten,years,old,a,new-made,squire,yet,so,vain,and,proud,and,foolish,that,he,got,it,in,his,head,that,he,could,joust,with,tried,and,proven,knights
so,he’d,borrowed,a,warhorse,and,some,plate,from,lord,dondarrion’s,armory,and,entered,the,lists,at,blackhaven,as,a,mystery,knight
even,the,herald,laughed
my,arms,were,so,thin,that,when,i,lowered,my,lance,it,was,all,i,could,do,to,keep,the,point,from,furrowing,the,ground
lord,dondarrion,would,have,been,within,his,rights,to,pull,him,off,the,horse,and,spank,him,but,the,prince,of,dragonflies,had,taken,pity,on,the,addlepated,boy,in,the,ill-fitting,armor,and,accorded,him,the,respect,of,taking,up,his,challenge
one,course,was,all,that,it,required
afterward,prince,duncan,helped,him,to,his,feet,and,removed,his,helm
a,boy,he,had,proclaimed,to,the,crowd
a,bold,boy
fiftythree,years,ago
how,many,men,are,still,alive,who,were,there,at,blackhaven
what,name,do,you,think,they,will,give,me,should,i,return,to,dorne,without,daenerys
prince,quentyn,asked
quentyn,the,cautious
quentyn,the,craven
quentyn,the,quail
the,prince,who,came,too,late,the,old,knight,thought,but,if,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,learns,nothing,else,he,learns,to,guard,his,tongue
quentyn,the,wise,he,suggested
and,hoped,that,it,was,true
the,spurned,suitor,the,hour,of,ghosts,was,almost,upon,them,when,ser,gerris,drinkwater,returned,to,the,pyramid,to,report,that,he,had,found,beans,books,and,old,bill,bone,in,one,of,meereen’s,less,savory,cellars,drinking,yellow,wine,and,watching,naked,slaves,kill,one,another,with,bare,hands,and,filed,teeth
beans,pulled,a,blade,and,proposed,a,wager,to,determine,if,deserters,had,bellies,full,of,yellow,slime,ser,gerris,reported,so,i,tossed,him,a,dragon,and,asked,if,yellow,gold,would,do
he,bit,the,coin,and,asked,what,i,meant,to,buy
when,i,told,him,he,slipped,the,knife,away,and,asked,if,i,was,drunk,or,mad
let,him,think,what,he,wants,so,long,as,he,delivers,the,message,said,quentyn
he’ll,do,that,much
i’ll,wager,you,get,your,meeting,too,if,only,so,rags,can,have,pretty,meris,cut,your,liver,out,and,fry,it,up,with,onions
we,should,be,heeding,selmy
when,barristan,the,bold,tells,you,to,run,a,wise,man,laces,up,his,boots
we,should,find,a,ship,for,volantis,whilst,the,port,is,still,open
just,the,mention,turned,ser,archibald’s,cheeks,green
no,more,ships
i’d,sooner,hop,back,to,volantis,on,one,foot

then,lys,then,home
back,the,way,i,came,empty-handed
three,brave,men,dead,for,what
it,would,be,sweet,to,see,the,greenblood,again,to,visit,sunspear,and,the,water,gardens,and,breathe,the,clean,sweet,mountain,air,of,yronwood,in,place,of,the,hot,wet,filthy,humors,of,slaver’s,bay
his,father,would,speak,no,word,of,rebuke,quentyn,knew,but,the,disappointment,would,be,there,in,his,eyes
his,sister,would,be,scornful,the,sand,snakes,would,mock,him,with,smiles,sharp,as,swords,and,lord,yronwood,his,second,father,who,had,sent,his,own,son,along,to,keep,him,safe,i,will,not,keep,you,here,quentyn,told,his,friends
my,father,laid,this,task,on,me,not,you

quentyn,sat
one,wrong,word,and,this,could,turn,to,blood,in,half,a,heartbeat
i,ask,your,pardon,for,our,deception
the,only,ships,sailing,for,slaver’s,bay,were,those,that,had,been,hired,to,bring,you,to,the,wars
the,tattered,prince,gave,a,shrug

another,fellow,told,me,our,food,was,so,wretched,that,he,had,to,flee,before,it,made,him,sick,so,i,had,his,foot,cut,off,roasted,it,up,and,fed,it,to,him
then,i,made,him,our,camp,cook

i,am,a,prince,of,dorne,said,quentyn
i,had,a,duty,to,my,father,and,my,people
there,was,a,secret,marriage,pact

surely,not
what,of,your,marriage,pact
she,laughed,at,him,said,pretty,meris
daenerys,never,laughed
the,rest,of,meereen,might,see,him,as,an,amusing,curiosity,like,the,exiled,summer,islander,king,robert,used,to,keep,at,king’s,landing,but,the,queen,had,always,spoken,to,him,gently
we,came,too,late,said,quentyn
a,pity,you,did,not,desert,me,sooner
the,tattered,prince,sipped,at,his,wine

it,will,get,harder
so,far,we,have,taken,them,unawares
that,cannot,last,forever,even,if,black,balaq,brings,down,every,raven,in,the,realm

below
a,hidden,cove,beneath,the,crag,which,appears,only,when,the,tide,is,out
but,connington,had,no,intention,of,letting,them,come
griffin’s,roost,was,strong,but,small,and,so,long,as,they,sat,here,they,would,seem,small,as,well
but,there,was,another,castle,nearby,vastly,larger,and,impregnable
take,that,and,the,realm,will,shake
you,must,excuse,me,captain-general
my,lord,father,is,buried,beneath,the,sept,and,it,has,been,too,many,years,since,last,i,prayed,for,him
of,course,my,lord
yet,when,they,parted,jon,connington,did,not,go,to,the,sept,instead,his,steps,led,him,up,to,the,roof,of,the,east,tower,the,tallest,at,griffin’s,roost
as,he,climbed,he,remembered,past,ascents,a,hundred,with,his,lord,father,who,liked,to,stand,and,look,out,over,woods,and,crags,and,sea,and,know,that,all,he,saw,belonged,to,house,connington,and,one,only,one
with,rhaegar,targaryen
prince,rhaegar,was,returning,from,dorne,and,he,and,his,escort,had,lingered,here,a,fortnight
he,was,so,young,then,and,i,was,younger
boys,the,both,of,us
at,the,welcoming,feast,the,prince,had,taken,up,his,silverstringed,harp,and,played,for,them
a,song,of,love,and,doom,jon,connington,recalled,and,every,woman,in,the,hall,was,weeping,when,he,put,down,the,harp
not,the,men,of,course
particularly,not,his,own,father,whose,only,love,was,land
lord,armond,connington,spent,the,entire,evening,trying,to,win,the,prince,to,his,side,in,his,dispute,with,lord,morrigen
the,door,to,the,roof,of,the,tower,was,stuck,so,fast,that,it,was,plain,no,one,had,opened,it,in,years
he,had,to,put,his,shoulder,to,it,to,force,it,open
but,when,jon,connington,stepped,out,onto,the,high,battlements,the,view,was,just,as,intoxicating,as,he,remembered,the,crag,with,its,wind-carved,rocks,and,jagged,spires,the,sea,below,growling,and,worrying,at,the,foot,of,the,castle,like,some,restless,beast,endless,leagues,of,sky,and,cloud,the,wood,with,its,autumnal,colors
your,father’s,lands,are,beautiful,prince,rhaegar,had,said,standing,right,where,jon,was,standing,now
and,the,boy,he’d,been,had,replied,one,day,they,will,all,be,mine
as,if,that,could,impress,a,prince,who,was,heir,to,the,entire,realm,from,the,arbor,to,the,wall
griffin’s,roost,had,been,his,eventually,if,only,for,a,few,short,years
from,here,jon,connington,had,ruled,broad,lands,extending,many,leagues,to,the,west,north,and,south,just,as,his,father,and,his,father’s,father,had,before,him
but,his,father,and,his,father’s,father,had,never,lost,their,lands
he,had
i,rose,too,high,loved,too,hard,dared,too,much
i,tried,to,grasp,a,star,overreached,and,fell
after,the,battle,of,the,bells,when,aerys,targaryen,had,stripped,him,of,his,titles,and,sent,him,into,exile,in,a,mad,fit,of,ingratitude,and,suspicion,the,lands,and,lordship,had,remained,within,house,connington,passing,to,his,cousin,ser,ronald,the,man,whom,jon,had,made,his,castellan,when,he,went,to,king’s,landing,to,attend,prince,rhaegar
robert,baratheon,had,completed,the,destruction,of,the,griffins,after,the,war
cousin,ronald,was,permitted,to,retain,his,castle,and,his,head,but,he,lost,his,lordship,thereafter,being,merely,the,knight,of,griffin’s,roost,and,nine-tenths,of,his,lands,were,taken,from,him,and,parceled,out,to,neighbor,lords,who,had,supported,robert’s,claim
ronald,connington,had,died,years,before
the,present,knight,of,griffin’s,roost,his,son,ronnet,was,said,to,be,off,at,war,in,the,riverlands
that,was,for,the,best
in,jon,connington’s,experience,men,would,fight,for,things,they,felt,were,theirs,even,things,they’d,gained,by,theft
he,did,not,relish,the,notion,of,celebrating,his,return,by,killing,one,of,his,own,kin
red,ronnet’s,sire,had,been,quick,to,take,advantage,of,his,lord,cousin’s,downfall,true,but,his,son,had,been,a,child,at,the,time
jon,connington,did,not,even,hate,the,late,ser,ronald,as,much,as,he,might,have
the,fault,was,his
he,had,lost,it,all,at,stoney,sept,in,his,arrogance
robert,baratheon,had,been,hiding,somewhere,in,the,town,wounded,and,alone
jon,connington,had,known,that,and,he,had,also,known,that,robert’s,head,upon,a,spear,would,have,put,an,end,to,the,rebellion,then,and,there
he,was,young,and,full,of,pride
how,not
king,aerys,had,named,him,hand,and,given,him,an,army,and,he,meant,to,prove,himself,worthy,of,that,trust,of,rhaegar’s,love
he,would,slay,the,rebel,lord,himself,and,carve,a,place,out,for,himself,in,all,the,histories,of,the,seven,kingdoms
and,so,he,swept,down,on,stoney,sept,closed,off,the,town,and,began,a,search
his,knights,went,house,to,house,smashed,in,every,door,peered,into,every,cellar
he,had,even,sent,men,crawling,through,the,sewers,yet,somehow,robert,still,eluded,him
the,townsfolk,were,hiding,him
they,moved,him,from,one,secret,bolt-hole,to,the,next,always,one,step,ahead,of,the,king’s,men
the,whole,town,was,a,nest,of,traitors
at,the,end,they,had,the,usurper,hidden,in,a,brothel
what,sort,of,king,was,that,who,would,hide,behind,the,skirts,of,women
yet,whilst,the,search,dragged,on,eddard,stark,and,hoster,tully,came,down,upon,the,town,with,a,rebel,army
bells,and,battle,followed,and,robert,emerged,from,his,brothel,with,a,blade,in,hand,and,almost,slew,jon,on,the,steps,of,the,old,sept,that,gave,the,town,its,name
for,years,afterward,jon,connington,told,himself,that,he,was,not,to,blame,that,he,had,done,all,that,any,man,could,do
his,soldiers,searched,every,hole,and,hovel,he,offered,pardons,and,rewards,he,took,hostages,and,hung,them,in,crow,cages,and,swore,that,they,would,have,neither,food,nor,drink,until,robert,was,delivered,to,him
all,to,no,avail
tywin,lannister,himself,could,have,done,no,more,he,had,insisted,one,night,to,blackheart,during,his,first,year,of,exile
there,is,where,you’re,wrong,myles,toyne,had,replied
lord,tywin,would,not,have,bothered,with,a,search
he,would,have,burned,that,town,and,every,living,creature,in,it
men,and,boys,babes,at,the,breast,noble,knights,and,holy,septons,pigs,and,whores,rats,and,rebels,he,would,have,burned,them,all
when,the,fires,guttered,out,and,only,ash,and,cinders,remained,he,would,have,sent,his,men,in,to,find,the,bones,of,robert,baratheon
later,when,stark,and,tully,turned,up,with,their,host,he,would,have,offered,pardons,to,the,both,of,them,and,they,would,have,accepted,and,turned,for,home,with,their,tails,between,their,legs
he,was,not,wrong,jon,connington,reflected,leaning,on,the,battlements,of,his,forebears
i,wanted,the,glory,of,slaying,robert,in,single,combat,and,i,did,not,want,the,name,of,butcher
so,robert,escaped,me,and,cut,down,rhaegar,on,the,trident
i,failed,the,father,he,said,but,i,will,not,fail,the,son
by,the,time,connington,made,his,descent,his,men,had,gathered,the,castle,garrison,and,surviving,smallfolk,together,in,the,yard
though,ser,ronnet,was,indeed,off,north,somewhere,with,jaime,lannister,griffin’s,roost,was,not,quite,bereft,of,griffins
amongst,the,prisoners,were,ronnet’s,younger,brother,raymund,his,sister,alynne,and,his,natural,son,a,fierce,red-haired,boy,they,called,ronald,storm
all,would,make,for,useful,hostages,if,and,when,red,ronnet,should,return,to,try,and,take,back,the,castle,that,his,father,had,stolen
connington,ordered,them,confined,to,the,west,tower,under,guard

no,harm,will,come,to,any,of,you,unless,red,ronnet,proves,an,utter,fool

clad,in,a,long,red-and-white,tunic,embroidered,with,the,twin,griffins,of,his,house,counterchanged,and,combatant,he,looked,an,older,sterner,version,of,the,young,lord,who,had,been,prince,rhaegar’s,friend,and,companion,but,the,men,and,women,of,griffin’s,roost,still,looked,at,him,with,strangers’,eyes
some,of,you,will,know,me,he,told,them
the,rest,will,learn

he,brought,them,forward,one,by,one,asked,each,man,his,name,then,bid,them,kneel,and,swear,him,their,allegiance
it,all,went,swiftly
the,soldiers,of,the,garrison,only,four,had,survived,the,attack,the,old,serjeant,and,three,boys,laid,their,swords,at,his,feet

the,children,were,of,his,blood,and,he,felt,that,he,should,know,them,but,when,the,bastard,boy,announced,my,father’s,going,to,kill,you,he,decided,that,his,knowledge,was,sufficient,ordered,them,back,to,their,cells,and,excused,himself

but,with,both,robert,and,his,brother,renly,slain,everything,was,changed
stannis,was,too,harsh,and,cold,a,man,to,inspire,much,in,the,way,of,loyalty,even,if,he,had,not,been,half,a,world,away,and,the,stormlands,had,little,reason,to,love,house,lannister
and,jon,connington,was,not,without,his,own,friends,here
some,of,the,older,lords,will,still,remember,me,and,their,sons,will,have,heard,the,stories
and,every,man,of,them,will,know,of,rhaegar,and,his,young,son,whose,head,was,smashed,against,a,cold,stone,wall
fortunately,his,own,ship,had,been,one,of,the,first,to,reach,their,destination
then,it,had,only,been,a,matter,of,establishing,a,campsite,assembling,his,men,as,they,came,ashore,and,moving,quickly,before,the,local,lordlings,had,any,inkling,of,their,peril
and,there,the,golden,company,had,proved,its,mettle
the,chaos,that,would,inevitably,have,delayed,such,a,march,with,a,hastily,assembled,host,of,household,knights,and,local,levies,had,been,nowhere,in,evidence

victarion,the,sea,was,black,and,the,moon,was,silver,as,the,iron,fleet,swept,down,on,the,prey
they,sighted,her,in,the,narrows,between,the,isle,of,cedars,and,the,rugged,hills,of,the,astapori,hinterlands,just,as,the,black,priest,moqorro,had,said,they,would
ghiscari,longwater,pyke,shouted,down,from,the,crow’s,nest
victarion,greyjoy,watched,her,sail,grow,larger,from,the,forecastle
soon,he,could,make,out,her,oars,rising,and,falling,and,the,long,white,wake,behind,her,shining,in,the,moonlight,like,a,scar,across,the,sea
not,a,true,warship,victarion,realized
a,trading,galley,and,a,big,one
she,would,make,a,fine,prize
he,signaled,to,his,captains,to,give,chase
they,would,board,this,ship,and,take,her
the,captain,of,the,galley,had,realized,his,peril,by,then
he,changed,course,for,the,west,making,for,the,isle,of,cedars,perhaps,hoping,to,shelter,in,some,hidden,cove,or,run,his,pursuers,onto,the,jagged,rocks,along,the,island’s,northeast,coast
his,galley,was,heavy,laden,though,and,the,ironborn,had,the,wind
grief,and,iron,victory,cut,across,the,quarry’s,course,whilst,swift,sparrowhawk,and,agile,fingerdancer,swept,behind,her
even,then,the,ghiscari,captain,did,not,strike,his,banners
by,the,time,lamentation,came,alongside,the,prey,raking,her,larboard,side,and,splintering,her,oars,both,ships,were,so,close,to,the,haunted,ruins,of,ghozai,that,they,could,hear,the,monkeys,chattering,as,the,first,dawn,light,washed,over,the,city’s,broken,pyramids
their,prize,was,named,ghiscari,dawn,the,galley’s,captain,said,when,he,was,delivered,to,victarion,in,chains
she,was,out,of,new,ghis,and,returning,there,by,way,of,yunkai,after,trading,at,meereen
the,man,spoke,no,decent,tongue,but,only,a,guttural,ghiscari,full,of,growls,and,hisses,as,ugly,a,language,as,victarion,greyjoy,had,ever,heard
moqorro,translated,the,captain’s,words,into,the,common,tongue,of,westeros
the,war,for,meereen,was,won,the,captain,claimed,the,dragon,queen,was,dead,and,a,ghiscari,by,the,name,of,hizdak,ruled,the,city,now
victarion,had,his,tongue,torn,out,for,lying
daenerys,targaryen,was,not,dead,moqorro,assured,him,his,red,god,r’hllor,had,shown,him,the,queen’s,face,in,his,sacred,fires
the,captain,could,not,abide,lies,so,he,had,the,ghiscari,captain,bound,hand,and,foot,and,thrown,overboard,a,sacrifice,to,the,drowned,god
your,red,god,will,have,his,due,he,promised,moqorro,but,the,seas,are,ruled,by,the,drowned,god
there,are,no,gods,but,r’hllor,and,the,other,whose,name,may,not,be,said
the,sorcerer,priest,was,garbed,in,somber,black,but,for,a,hint,of,golden,thread,at,collar,cuffs,and,hem
there,was,no,red,cloth,aboard,the,iron,victory,but,it,was,not,meet,that,moqorro,go,about,in,the,salt-stained,rags,he,had,been,wearing,when,the,vole,fished,him,from,the,sea,so,victarion,had,commanded,tom,tidewood,to,sew,new,robes,for,him,from,whatever,was,at,hand,and,had,even,donated,some,of,his,own,tunics,to,the,purpose
of,black,and,gold,those,were,for,the,arms,of,house,greyjoy,showed,a,golden,kraken,on,a,black,field,and,the,banners,and,sails,of,their,ships,displayed,the,same
the,crimson-and-scarlet,robes,of,the,red,priests,were,alien,to,the,ironborn,but,victarion,had,hoped,his,men,might,accept,moqorro,more,easily,once,clad,in,greyjoy,colors
he,hoped,in,vain
clad,in,black,from,head,to,heel,with,a,mask,of,red-and-orange,flames,tattooed,across,his,face,the,priest,appeared,more,sinister,than,ever
the,crew,shunned,him,when,he,walked,the,deck,and,men,would,spit,if,his,shadow,chanced,to,fall,upon,them
even,the,vole,who,had,fished,the,red,priest,from,the,sea,had,urged,victarion,to,give,him,to,the,drowned,god
but,moqorro,knew,these,strange,shores,in,ways,the,ironborn,did,not,and,secrets,of,the,dragonkind,as,well
the,crow’s,eye,keeps,wizards,why,shouldn’t,i
his,black,sorcerer,was,more,puissant,than,all,of,euron’s,three,even,if,you,threw,them,in,a,pot,and,boiled,them,down,to,one
the,damphair,might,disapprove,but,aeron,and,his,pieties,were,far,away
so,victarion,closed,his,burned,hand,into,a,mighty,fist,and,said,ghiscari,dawn,is,no,fit,name,for,a,ship,of,the,iron,fleet
for,you,wizard,i,shall,rename,her,red,god’s,wroth
his,wizard,bowed,his,head
as,the,captain,says
and,the,ships,of,the,iron,fleet,numbered,four-and-fifty,once,again
the,next,day,a,sudden,squall,descended,on,them
moqorro,had,predicted,that,as,well
when,the,rains,moved,on,three,ships,were,found,to,have,vanished
victarion,had,no,way,to,know,whether,they,had,foundered,run,aground,or,been,blown,off,course
they,know,where,we,are,going,he,told,his,crew
if,they,are,still,afloat,we,will,meet,again
the,iron,captain,had,no,time,to,wait,for,laggards
not,with,his,bride,encircled,by,her,enemies
the,most,beautiful,woman,in,the,world,has,urgent,need,of,my,axe
besides,moqorro,assured,him,that,the,three,ships,were,not,lost
each,night,the,sorcerer,priest,would,kindle,a,fire,on,the,forecastle,of,the,iron,victory,and,stalk,around,the,flames,chanting,prayers
the,firelight,made,his,black,skin,shine,like,polished,onyx,and,sometimes,victarion,could,swear,that,the,flames,tattooed,on,his,face,were,dancing,too,twisting,and,bending,melting,into,one,another,their,colors,changing,with,every,turn,of,the,priest’s,head
the,black,priest,is,calling,demons,down,on,us,one,oarsman,was,heard,to,say
when,that,was,reported,to,victarion,he,had,the,man,scourged,until,his,back,was,blood,from,shoulders,to,buttocks
so,when,moqorro,said,your,lost,lambs,will,return,to,the,flock,off,the,isle,called,yaros,the,captain,said,pray,that,they,do,priest
or,you,may,be,the,next,to,taste,the,whip
the,sea,was,blue,and,green,and,the,sun,blazing,down,from,an,empty,blue,sky,when,the,iron,fleet,took,its,second,prize,in,the,waters,north,and,west,of,astapor
this,time,it,was,a,myrish,cog,named,dove,on,her,way,to,yunkai,by,way,of,new,ghis,with,a,cargo,of,carpets,sweet,green,wines,and,myrish,lace
her,captain,owned,a,myrish,eye,that,made,far-off,things,look,close,two,glass,lenses,in,a,series,of,brass,tubes,cunningly,wrought,so,that,each,section,slid,into,the,next,until,the,eye,was,no,longer,than,a,dirk
victarion,claimed,that,treasure,for,himself
the,cog,he,renamed,shrike
her,crew,would,be,kept,for,ransom,the,captain,decreed
they,were,neither,slaves,nor,slavers,but,free,myrmen,and,seasoned,sailors
such,men,were,worth,good,coin
sailing,out,of,myr,the,dove,brought,them,no,fresh,news,of,meereen,or,daenerys,only,stale,reports,of,dothraki,horsemen,along,the,rhoyne,the,golden,company,upon,the,march,and,others,things,victarion,already,knew
what,do,you,see
the,captain,asked,his,black,priest,that,night,as,moqorro,stood,before,his,nightfire
what,awaits,us,on,the,morrow
more,rain
it,smelled,like,rain,to,him
grey,skies,and,strong,winds,moqorro,said
no,rain
behind,come,the,tigers
ahead,awaits,your,dragon
your,dragon
victarion,liked,the,sound,of,that
tell,me,something,that,i,do,not,know,priest
the,captain,commands,and,i,obey,said,moqorro
the,crew,had,taken,to,calling,him,the,black,flame,a,name,fastened,on,him,by,steffar,stammerer,who,could,not,say,moqorro
by,any,name,the,priest,had,powers
the,coastline,here,runs,west,to,east,he,told,victarion
where,it,turns,north,you,will,come,on,two,more,hares
swift,ones,with,many,legs
and,so,it,came,to,pass
this,time,the,prey,proved,to,be,a,pair,of,galleys,long,and,sleek,and,fast
ralf,the,limper,was,the,first,to,sight,them,but,they,soon,outdistanced,woe,and,forlorn,hope,so,victarion,sent,iron,wing,sparrowhawk,and,kraken’s,kiss,to,run,them,down
he,had,no,swifter,ships,than,those,three
the,pursuit,lasted,the,best,part,of,the,day,but,in,the,end,both,galleys,were,boarded,and,taken,after,brief,but,brutal,fights
they,had,been,running,empty,victarion,learned,making,for,new,ghis,to,load,supplies,and,weapons,for,the,ghiscari,legions,encamped,before,meereen,and,to,bring,fresh,legionaries,to,the,war,to,replace,all,the,men,who’d,died
men,slain,in,battle
asked,victarion
the,crews,of,the,galleys,denied,it,the,deaths,were,from,a,bloody,flux
the,pale,mare,they,called,it
and,like,the,captain,of,the,ghiscari,dawn,the,captains,of,the,galleys,repeated,the,lie,that,daenerys,targaryen,was,dead
give,her,a,kiss,for,me,in,whatever,hell,you,find,her,victarion,said
he,called,for,his,axe,and,took,their,heads,off,there,and,then
afterward,he,put,their,crews,to,death,as,well,saving,only,the,slaves,chained,to,the,oars
he,broke,their,chains,himself,and,told,them,they,were,now,free,men,and,would,have,the,privilege,of,rowing,for,the,iron,fleet,an,honor,that,every,boy,in,the,iron,islands,dreamed,of,growing,up
the,dragon,queen,frees,slaves,and,so,do,i,he,proclaimed
the,galleys,he,renamed,ghost,and,shade
for,i,mean,them,to,return,and,haunt,these,yunkishmen,he,told,the,dusky,woman,that,night,after,he,had,taken,his,pleasure,of,her
they,were,close,now,and,growing,closer,every,day
we,will,fall,upon,them,like,a,thunderbolt,he,said,as,he,squeezed,the,woman’s,breast
he,wondered,if,this,was,how,his,brother,aeron,felt,when,the,drowned,god,spoke,to,him
he,could,almost,hear,the,god’s,voice,welling,up,from,the,depths,of,the,sea
you,shall,serve,me,well,my,captain,the,waves,seemed,to,say
it,was,for,this,i,made,you
but,he,would,feed,the,red,god,too,moqorro’s,fire,god
the,arm,the,priest,had,healed,was,hideous,to,look,upon,pork,crackling,from,elbow,to,fingertips
sometimes,when,victarion,closed,his,hand,the,skin,would,split,and,smoke,yet,the,arm,was,stronger,than,it,had,ever,been
two,gods,are,with,me,now,he,told,the,dusky,woman
no,foe,can,stand,before,two,gods
then,he,rolled,her,on,her,back,and,took,her,once,again
when,the,cliffs,of,yaros,appeared,off,their,larboard,bows,he,found,his,three,lost,ships,waiting,for,him,just,as,moqorro,had,promised
victarion,gave,the,priest,a,golden,torque,as,a,reward
now,he,had,a,choice,to,make,should,he,risk,the,straits,or,take,the,iron,fleet,around,the,island
the,memory,of,fair,isle,still,rankled,in,the,iron,captain’s,memory
stannis,baratheon,had,descended,on,the,iron,fleet,from,both,north,and,south,whilst,they,were,trapped,in,the,channel,between,the,island,and,the,mainland,dealing,victarion,his,most,crushing,defeat
but,sailing,around,yaros,would,cost,him,precious,days
with,yunkai,so,near,shipping,in,the,straits,was,like,to,be,heavy,but,he,did,not,expect,to,encounter,yunkish,warships,until,they,were,closer,to,meereen
what,would,the,crow’s,eye,do
he,brooded,on,that,for,a,time,then,signaled,to,his,captains
we,sail,the,straits
three,more,prizes,were,taken,before,yaros,dwindled,off,their,sterns
a,fat,galleas,fell,to,the,vole,and,grief,and,a,trading,galley,to,manfryd,merlyn,of,kite
their,holds,were,packed,with,trade,goods,wines,and,silks,and,spices,rare,woods,and,rarer,scents,but,the,ships,themselves,were,the,true,prize
later,that,same,day,a,fishing,ketch,was,taken,by,seven,skulls,and,thrall’s,bane
she,was,a,small,slow,dingy,thing,hardly,worth,the,effort,of,boarding
victarion,was,displeased,to,hear,that,it,had,taken,two,of,his,own,ships,to,bring,the,fishermen,to,heel
yet,it,was,from,their,lips,that,he,heard,of,the,black,dragon’s,return
the,silver,queen,is,gone,the,ketch’s,master,told,him
she,flew,away,upon,her,dragon,beyond,the,dothraki,sea
where,is,this,dothraki,sea
he,demanded
i,will,sail,the,iron,fleet,across,it,and,find,the,queen,wherever,she,may,be
the,fisherman,laughed,aloud
that,would,be,a,sight,worth,seeing
the,dothraki,sea,is,made,of,grass,fool
he,should,not,have,said,that
victarion,took,him,around,the,throat,with,his,burned,hand,and,lifted,him,bodily,into,the,air
slamming,him,back,against,the,mast,he,squeezed,till,the,yunkishman’s,face,turned,as,black,as,the,fingers,digging,into,his,flesh
the,man,kicked,and,writhed,for,a,while,trying,fruitlessly,to,pry,loose,the,captain’s,grip
no,man,calls,victarion,greyjoy,a,fool,and,lives,to,boast,of,it
when,he,opened,his,hand,the,man’s,limp,body,flopped,to,the,deck
longwater,pyke,and,tom,tidewood,chucked,it,over,the,rail,another,offering,to,the,drowned,god
your,drowned,god,is,a,demon,the,black,priest,moqorro,said,afterward
he,is,no,more,than,a,thrall,of,the,other,the,dark,god,whose,name,must,not,be,spoken
take,care,priest,victarion,warned,him
there,are,godly,men,aboard,this,ship,who,would,tear,out,your,tongue,for,speaking,such,blasphemies
your,red,god,will,have,his,due,i,swear,it
my,word,is,iron
ask,any,of,my,men
the,black,priest,bowed,his,head
there,is,no,need
the,lord,of,light,has,shown,me,your,worth,lord,captain
every,night,in,my,fires,i,glimpse,the,glory,that,awaits,you
those,words,pleased,victarion,greyjoy,mightily,as,he,told,the,dusky,woman,that,night
my,brother,balon,was,a,great,man,he,said,but,i,shall,do,what,he,could,not
the,iron,islands,shall,be,free,again,and,the,old,way,will,return
even,dagon,could,not,do,that
almost,a,hundred,years,had,passed,since,dagon,greyjoy,sat,the,seastone,chair,but,the,ironborn,still,told,tales,of,his,raids,and,battles
in,dagon’s,day,a,weak,king,sat,the,iron,throne,his,rheumy,eyes,fixed,across,the,narrow,sea,where,bastards,and,exiles,plotted,rebellion
so,forth,from,pyke,lord,dagon,sailed,to,make,the,sunset,sea,his,own
he,bearded,the,lion,in,his,den,and,tied,the,direwolf’s,tail,in,knots,but,even,dagon,could,not,defeat,the,dragons
but,i,shall,make,the,dragon,queen,mine,own
she,will,share,my,bed,and,bear,me,many,mighty,sons
that,night,the,ships,of,the,iron,fleet,numbered,sixty
strange,sails,grew,more,common,north,of,yaros
they,were,very,near,to,yunkai,and,the,coast,between,the,yellow,city,and,meereen,would,be,teeming,with,merchantmen,and,supply,ships,coming,and,going,so,victarion,took,the,iron,fleet,out,into,the,deeper,waters,beyond,the,sight,of,land
even,there,they,would,encounter,other,vessels
let,none,escape,to,give,warning,to,our,foes,the,iron,captain,commanded
none,did
the,sea,was,green,and,the,sky,was,grey,the,morning,grief,and,warrior,wench,and,victarion’s,own,iron,victory,captured,the,slaver,galley,from,yunkai,in,the,waters,due,north,of,the,yellow,city
in,her,holds,were,twenty,perfumed,boys,and,four,score,girls,destined,for,the,pleasure,houses,of,lys
her,crew,never,thought,to,find,peril,so,close,to,their,home,waters,and,the,ironborn,had,little,trouble,taking,her
she,was,named,the,willing,maiden
victarion,put,the,slavers,to,the,sword,then,sent,his,men,below,to,unchain,the,rowers
you,row,for,me,now
row,hard,and,you,shall,prosper
the,girls,he,divided,amongst,his,captains
the,lyseni,would,have,made,whores,of,you,he,told,them,but,we,have,saved,you
now,you,need,only,serve,one,man,instead,of,many
those,who,please,their,captains,may,be,taken,as,salt,wives,an,honorable,station
the,perfumed,boys,he,wrapped,in,chains,and,threw,into,the,sea
they,were,unnatural,creatures,and,the,ship,smelled,better,once,cleansed,of,their,presence
for,himself,victarion,claimed,the,seven,choicest,girls
one,had,red-gold,hair,and,freckles,on,her,teats
one,shaved,herself,all,over
one,was,brown-haired,and,brown-eyed,shy,as,a,mouse
one,had,the,biggest,breasts,he,had,ever,seen
the,fifth,was,a,little,thing,with,straight,black,hair,and,golden,skin
her,eyes,were,the,color,of,amber
the,sixth,was,white,as,milk,with,golden,rings,through,her,nipples,and,her,nether,lips,the,seventh,black,as,a,squid’s,ink
the,slavers,of,yunkai,had,trained,them,in,the,way,of,the,seven,sighs,but,that,was,not,why,victarion,wanted,them
his,dusky,woman,was,enough,to,satisfy,his,appetites,until,he,could,reach,meereen,and,claim,his,queen
no,man,had,need,of,candles,when,the,sun,awaited,him
the,galley,he,renamed,the,slaver’s,scream
with,her,the,ships,of,the,iron,fleet,numbered,one-and-sixty
every,ship,we,capture,makes,us,stronger,victarion,told,his,ironborn,but,from,here,it,will,grow,harder
on,the,morrow,or,the,day,after,we,are,like,to,meet,with,warships
we,are,entering,the,home,waters,of,meereen,where,the,fleets,of,our,foes,await,us
we,will,meet,with,ships,from,all,three,slaver,cities,ships,from,tolos,and,elyria,and,new,ghis,even,ships,from,qarth
he,took,care,not,to,mention,the,green,galleys,of,old,volantis,that,surely,must,be,sailing,up,through,the,gulf,of,grief,even,as,he,spoke
these,slavers,are,feeble,things
you,have,seen,how,they,run,before,us,heard,how,they,squeal,when,we,put,them,to,the,sword
every,man,of,you,is,worth,twenty,of,them,for,only,we,are,made,of,iron
remember,this,when,first,we,next,spy,some,slaver’s,sails
give,no,quarter,and,expect,none

valar,morghulis,cat,said,by,way,of,greeting
valar,dohaeris,brusco,replied
after,that,it,was,as,if,she,had,never,been,away
she,got,her,first,look,at,the,man,she,must,kill,later,that,morning,as,she,wheeled,her,barrow,through,the,cobbled,streets,that,fronted,on,the,purple,harbor
he,was,an,old,man,well,past,fifty
he,has,lived,too,long,she,tried,to,tell,herself
why,should,he,have,so,many,years,when,my,father,had,so,few
but,cat,of,the,canals,had,no,father,so,she,kept,that,thought,to,herself
cockles,and,mussels,and,clams,cat,cried,as,he,went,past,oysters,and,prawns,and,fat,green,mussels
she,even,smiled,at,him
sometimes,a,smile,was,all,you,needed,to,make,them,stop,and,buy
the,old,man,did,not,smile,back
he,scowled,at,her,and,went,on,past,sloshing,through,a,puddle
the,splash,wet,her,feet
he,has,no,courtesy,she,thought,watching,him,go
his,face,is,hard,and,mean
the,old,man’s,nose,was,pinched,and,sharp,his,lips,thin,his,eyes,small,and,close-set
his,hair,had,gone,to,grey,but,the,little,pointed,beard,at,the,end,of,his,chin,was,still,black
cat,thought,it,must,be,dyed,and,wondered,why,he,had,not,dyed,his,hair,as,well
one,of,his,shoulders,was,higher,than,the,other,giving,him,a,crooked,cast
he,is,an,evil,man,she,announced,that,evening,when,she,returned,to,the,house,of,black,and,white
his,lips,are,cruel,his,eyes,are,mean,and,he,has,a,villain’s,beard
the,kindly,man,chuckled
he,is,a,man,like,any,other,with,light,in,him,and,darkness
it,is,not,for,you,to,judge,him
that,gave,her,pause
have,the,gods,judged,him
some,gods,mayhaps
what,are,gods,for,if,not,to,sit,in,judgment,over,men
the,many-faced,god,does,not,weigh,men’s,souls,however
he,gives,his,gift,to,the,best,of,men,as,he,gives,it,to,the,worst
elsewise,the,good,would,live,forever
the,old,man’s,hands,were,the,worst,thing,about,him,cat,decided,the,next,day,as,she,watched,him,from,behind,her,barrow
his,fingers,were,long,and,bony,always,moving,scratching,at,his,beard,tugging,at,an,ear,drumming,on,a,table,twitching,twitching,twitching
he,has,hands,like,two,white,spiders
the,more,she,watched,his,hands,the,more,she,came,to,hate,them
he,moves,his,hands,too,much,she,told,them,at,the,temple
he,must,be,full,of,fear
the,gift,will,bring,him,peace
the,gift,brings,all,men,peace
when,i,kill,him,he,will,look,in,my,eyes,and,thank,me
if,he,does,you,will,have,failed
it,would,be,best,if,he,takes,no,note,of,you,at,all
the,old,man,was,some,sort,of,merchant,cat,concluded,after,watching,him,for,a,few,days
his,trade,had,to,do,with,the,sea,though,she,never,saw,him,set,foot,upon,a,ship
he,spent,his,days,sitting,in,a,soup,shop,near,the,purple,harbor,a,cup,of,onion,broth,cooling,at,his,elbow,as,he,shuffled,papers,and,sealing,wax,and,spoke,in,sharp,tones,to,a,parade,of,captains,shipowners,and,other,merchants,none,of,whom,seemed,to,like,him,very,much
yet,they,brought,him,money,leather,purses,plump,with,gold,and,silver,and,the,square,iron,coins,of,braavos
the,old,man,would,count,it,out,carefully,sorting,the,coins,and,stacking,them,up,neatly,like,with,like
he,never,looked,at,the,coins
instead,he,bit,them,always,on,the,left,side,of,his,mouth,where,he,still,had,all,his,teeth
from,time,to,time,he’d,spin,one,on,the,table,and,listen,to,the,sound,it,made,when,it,came,clattering,to,a,stop
and,when,all,the,coins,had,been,counted,and,tasted,the,old,man,would,scrawl,upon,a,parchment,stamp,it,with,his,seal,and,give,it,to,the,captain
else,he’d,shake,his,head,and,shove,the,coins,back,across,the,table
whenever,he,did,that,the,other,man,would,get,redfaced,and,angry,or,pale,and,scared-looking
cat,did,not,understand
they,pay,him,gold,and,silver,but,he,only,gives,them,writing
are,they,stupid
a,few,mayhaps
most,are,simply,cautious
some,think,to,cozen,him
he,is,not,a,man,easily,cozened,however
but,what,is,he,selling,them
he,is,writing,each,a,binder
if,their,ships,are,lost,in,a,storm,or,taken,by,pirates,he,promises,to,pay,them,for,the,value,of,the,vessel,and,all,its,contents
is,it,some,kind,of,wager
of,a,sort
a,wager,every,captain,hopes,to,lose
yes,but,if,they,win,they,lose,their,ships,oftimes,their,very,lives
the,seas,are,dangerous,and,never,more,so,than,in,autumn
no,doubt,many,a,captain,sinking,in,a,storm,has,taken,some,small,solace,in,his,binder,back,in,braavos,knowing,that,his,widow,and,children,will,not,want
a,sad,smile,touched,his,lips
it,is,one,thing,to,write,such,a,binder,though,and,another,to,make,good,on,it
cat,understood
one,of,them,must,hate,him
one,of,them,came,to,the,house,of,black,and,white,and,prayed,for,the,god,to,take,him
she,wondered,who,it,had,been,but,the,kindly,man,would,not,tell,her
it,is,not,for,you,to,pry,into,such,matters,he,said
who,are,you
no,one
no,one,asks,no,questions
he,took,her,hands
if,you,cannot,do,this,thing,you,need,only,say,so
there,is,no,shame,in,that
some,are,made,to,serve,the,many-faced,god,and,some,are,not
say,the,word,and,i,shall,lift,this,task,from,you
i,will,do,it
i,said,i,would
i,will
how,though
that,was,harder
he,had,guards
two,of,them,a,tall,thin,man,and,a,short,thick,one
they,went,with,him,everywhere,from,when,he,left,his,house,in,the,morning,till,he,returned,at,night
they,made,certain,no,one,got,close,to,the,old,man,without,his,leave
once,a,drunk,almost,staggered,into,him,as,he,was,coming,home,from,the,soup,shop,but,the,tall,one,stepped,between,them,and,gave,the,man,a,sharp,shove,that,knocked,him,to,the,ground
at,the,soup,shop,the,short,one,always,tasted,the,onion,broth,first
the,old,man,waited,until,the,broth,had,cooled,before,he,took,a,sip,long,enough,to,be,sure,his,guardsman,had,suffered,no,ill,effects
he’s,afraid,she,realized,or,else,he,knows,that,someone,wants,to,kill,him
he,does,not,know,said,the,kindly,man,but,he,suspects
the,guards,go,with,him,even,when,he,slips,out,to,make,water,she,said,but,he,doesn’t,go,when,they,do
the,tall,one,is,the,quicker
i’ll,wait,till,he,is,making,water,walk,into,the,soup,shop,and,stab,the,old,man,through,the,eye
and,the,other,guard
he’s,slow,and,stupid
i,can,kill,him,too
are,you,some,butcher,of,the,battlefield,hacking,down,every,man,who,stands,in,your,way
no
i,would,hope,not
you,are,a,servant,of,the,many-faced,god,and,we,who,serve,him,of,many,faces,give,his,gift,only,to,those,who,have,been,marked,and,chosen
she,understood
kill,him
kill,only,him
it,took,her,three,more,days,of,watching,before,she,found,the,way,and,another,day,of,practicing,with,her,finger,knife
red,roggo,had,taught,her,how,to,use,it,but,she,had,not,slit,a,purse,since,back,before,they,took,away,her,eyes
she,wanted,to,make,certain,that,she,still,knew,how
smooth,and,quick,that’s,the,way,no,fumbling,she,told,herself,and,she,slipped,the,little,blade,out,of,her,sleeve,again,and,again,and,again
when,she,was,satisfied,that,she,still,remembered,how,to,do,it,she,sharpened,the,steel,on,a,whetstone,until,its,edge,glimmered,silver-blue,in,the,candlelight
the,other,part,was,trickier,but,the,waif,was,there,to,help,her
i,will,give,the,man,the,gift,on,the,morrow,she,announced,as,she,was,breaking,her,fast
him,of,many,faces,will,be,pleased
the,kindly,man,rose
cat,of,the,canals,is,known,to,many
if,she,is,seen,to,have,done,this,deed,it,might,bring,down,trouble,on,brusco,and,his,daughters
it,is,time,you,had,another,face
the,girl,did,not,smile,but,inside,she,was,pleased
she,had,lost,cat,once,and,mourned,her
she,did,not,want,to,lose,her,again
what,will,i,look,like
ugly
women,will,look,away,when,they,see,you

strong,men,will,pity,you,and,some,may,shed,a,tear
no,one,who,sees,you,will,soon,forget,you
come
the,kindly,man,took,the,iron,lantern,off,its,hook,and,led,her,past,the,still,black,pool,and,the,rows,of,dark,and,silent,gods,to,the,steps,at,the,rear,of,the,temple
the,waif,fell,in,behind,them,as,they,were,making,their,descent
no,one,spoke
the,soft,scuff,of,slippered,feet,on,the,steps,was,the,only,sound
eighteen,steps,brought,them,to,the,vaults,where,five,arched,passageways,spread,out,like,the,fingers,of,a,man’s,hand
down,here,the,steps,grew,narrower,and,steeper,but,the,girl,had,run,up,and,down,them,a,thousand,times,and,they,held,no,terrors,for,her
twenty-two,more,steps,and,they,were,at,the,subcellar
the,tunnels,here,were,cramped,and,crooked,black,wormholes,twisting,through,the,heart,of,the,great,rock
one,passage,was,closed,off,by,a,heavy,iron,door
the,priest,hung,the,lantern,from,a,hook,slipped,a,hand,inside,his,robe,and,produced,an,ornate,key
gooseprickles,rose,along,her,arms
the,sanctum
they,were,going,lower,still,down,to,the,third,level,to,the,secret,chambers,where,only,the,priests,were,permitted
the,key,clicked,three,times,very,softly,as,the,kindly,man,turned,it,in,a,lock
the,door,swung,open,on,oiled,iron,hinges,making,not,a,sound
beyond,were,still,more,steps,hewn,out,of,solid,rock
the,priest,took,down,the,lantern,once,again,and,led,the,way
the,girl,followed,the,light,counting,the,steps,as,she,went,down
four,five,six,seven

they,have,no,eyes,but,they,can,see,me
she,saw,her,father’s,face,upon,the,wall
beside,him,hung,her,lady,mother,and,below,them,her,three,brothers,all,in,a,row

the,tickler,hung,on,the,wall,as,well,the,black,holes,that,were,his,eyes,swimming,with,malice
the,sight,of,him,brought,back,the,feel,of,the,dagger,in,her,hand,as,she,had,plunged,it,into,his,back,again,and,again,and,again
when,at,last,day,came,to,braavos,it,came,grey,and,dark,and,overcast
the,girl,had,hoped,for,fog,but,the,gods,ignored,her,prayers,as,gods,so,often,did
the,air,was,clear,and,cold,and,the,wind,had,a,nasty,bite,to,it
a,good,day,for,a,death,she,thought

everything,from,beggar’s,rags,to,rich,silks,and,velvets,could,be,found,there
an,ugly,girl,should,dress,in,ugly,clothing,she,decided,so,she,chose,a,stained,brown,cloak,fraying,at,the,hem,a,musty,green,tunic,smelling,of,fish,and,a,pair,of,heavy,boots
last,of,all,she,palmed,her,finger,knife
there,was,no,haste,so,she,decided,to,take,the,long,way,round,to,the,purple,harbor
across,the,bridge,she,went,to,the,isle,of,the,gods
cat,of,the,canals,had,sold,cockles,and,mussels,amongst,the,temples,here,whenever,brusco’s,daughter,talea,had,her,moon,blood,flowing,and,took,to,her,bed
she,half-expected,to,see,talea,selling,there,today,perhaps,outside,the,warren,where,all,the,forgotten,godlings,had,their,forlorn,little,shrines,but,that,was,silly
the,day,was,too,cold,and,talea,never,liked,to,wake,this,early
the,statue,outside,the,shrine,of,the,weeping,lady,of,lys,was,crying,silver,tears,as,the,ugly,girl,walked,by
in,the,gardens,of,gelenei,stood,a,gilded,tree,a,hundred,feet,high,with,leaves,of,hammered,silver
torchlight,glimmered,behind,windows,of,leaded,glass,in,the,lord,of,harmony’s,wooden,hall,showing,half,a,hundred,kinds,of,butterflies,in,all,their,bright,colors
one,time,the,girl,remembered,the,sailor’s,wife,had,walked,her,rounds,with,her,and,told,her,tales,of,the,city’s,stranger,gods
that,is,the,house,of,the,great,shepherd
threeheaded,trios,has,that,tower,with,three,turrets
the,first,head,devours,the,dying,and,the,reborn,emerge,from,the,third
i,don’t,know,what,the,middle,head’s,supposed,to,do
those,are,the,stones,of,the,silent,god,and,there,the,entrance,to,the,patternmaker’s,maze
only,those,who,learn,to,walk,it,properly,will,ever,find,their,way,to,wisdom,the,priests,of,the,pattern,say
beyond,it,by,the,canal,that’s,the,temple,of,aquan,the,red,bull
every,thirteenth,day,his,priests,slit,the,throat,of,a,pure,white,calf,and,offer,bowls,of,blood,to,beggars
today,was,not,the,thirteenth,day,it,seemed,the,red,bull’s,steps,were,empty
the,brother,gods,semosh,and,selloso,dreamed,in,twin,temples,on,opposite,sides,of,the,black,canal,linked,by,a,carved,stone,bridge
the,girl,crossed,there,and,made,her,way,down,to,the,docks,then,through,the,ragman’s,harbor,and,past,the,half-sunken,spires,and,domes,of,the,drowned,town
a,group,of,lysene,sailors,were,staggering,from,the,happy,port,as,she,went,by,but,the,girl,did,not,see,any,of,the,whores
the,ship,was,closed,up,and,forlorn,its,troupe,of,mummers,no,doubt,still,abed
but,farther,on,on,the,wharf,beside,an,ibbenese,whaler,she,spied,cat’s,old,friend,tagganaro,tossing,a,ball,back,and,forth,with,casso,king,of,seals,whilst,his,latest,cutpurse,worked,the,crowd,of,onlookers
when,she,stopped,to,watch,and,listen,for,a,moment,tagganaro,glanced,at,her,without,recognition,but,casso,barked,and,clapped,his,flippers
he,knows,me,the,girl,thought,or,else,he,smells,the,fish
she,hurried,on,her,way
by,the,time,she,reached,the,purple,harbor,the,old,man,was,ensconced,inside,the,soup,shop,at,his,usual,table,counting,a,purse,of,coins,as,he,haggled,with,a,ship’s,captain
the,tall,thin,guard,was,hovering,over,him
the,short,thick,one,was,seated,near,the,door,where,he,would,have,a,good,view,of,anyone,who,entered
that,made,no,matter
she,did,not,intend,to,enter
instead,she,perched,atop,a,wooden,piling,twenty,yards,away,as,the,blustery,wind,tugged,at,her,cloak,with,ghostly,fingers
even,on,a,cold,grey,day,like,this,the,harbor,was,a,busy,place
she,saw,sailors,on,the,prowl,for,whores,and,whores,on,the,prowl,for,sailors
a,pair,of,bravos,passed,in,rumpled,finery,leaning,on,each,other,as,they,staggered,drunkenly,past,the,docks,their,blades,rattling,at,their,sides
a,red,priest,swept,past,his,scarlet,and,crimson,robes,snapping,in,the,wind
it,was,almost,noon,before,she,saw,the,man,she,wanted,a,prosperous,shipowner,she,had,seen,doing,business,with,the,old,man,three,times,before
big,and,bald,and,burly,he,wore,a,heavy,cloak,of,plush,brown,velvet,trimmed,with,fur,and,a,brown,leather,belt,ornamented,with,silver,moons,and,stars
some,mishap,had,left,one,leg,stiff
he,walked,slowly,leaning,on,a,cane
he,would,do,as,well,as,any,and,better,than,most,the,ugly,girl,decided
she,hopped,off,the,piling,and,fell,in,after,him
a,dozen,strides,put,her,right,behind,him,her,finger,knife,poised
his,purse,was,on,his,right,side,at,his,belt,but,his,cloak,was,in,her,way
her,blade,flashed,out,smooth,and,quick,one,deep,slash,through,the,velvet,and,he,never,felt,a,thing
red,roggo,would,have,smiled,to,see,it
she,slipped,her,hand,through,the,gap,slit,the,purse,open,with,the,finger,knife,filled,her,fist,with,gold,the,big,man,turned
what,the,movement,tangled,her,arm,in,the,folds,of,his,cloak,as,she,was,pulling,out,her,hand
coins,rained,around,their,feet
thief
the,big,man,raised,his,stick,to,strike,at,her
she,kicked,his,bad,leg,out,from,under,him,danced,away,and,bolted,as,he,fell,darting,past,a,mother,with,a,child

shouts,of,thief,thief,rang,out,behind,her
a,potbellied,innkeep,passing,by,made,a,clumsy,grab,for,her,arm,but,she,spun,around,him,flashed,past,a,laughing,whore,raced,headlong,for,the,nearest,alley
cat,of,the,canals,had,known,these,alleys,and,the,ugly,girl,remembered
she,darted,left,vaulted,a,low,wall,leapt,across,a,small,canal,and,slipped,through,an,unlocked,door,into,some,dusty,storeroom
all,sounds,of,pursuit,had,faded,by,then,but,it,was,best,to,be,sure
she,hunkered,down,behind,some,crates,and,waited,arms,wrapped,around,her,knees
she,waited,for,the,best,part,of,an,hour,then,decided,it,was,safe,to,go,climbed,straight,up,the,side,of,the,building,and,made,her,way,across,the,rooftops,almost,as,far,as,the,canal,of,heroes
by,now,the,shipowner,would,have,gathered,up,coins,and,cane,and,limped,on,to,the,soup,shop
he,might,be,drinking,a,bowl,of,hot,broth,and,complaining,to,the,old,man,about,the,ugly,girl,who,had,tried,to,rob,his,purse
the,kindly,man,was,waiting,for,her,at,the,house,of,black,and,white,seated,on,the,edge,of,the,temple,pool
the,ugly,girl,sat,next,to,him,and,put,a,coin,on,the,lip,of,the,pool,between,them
it,was,gold,with,a,dragon,on,one,face,and,a,king,on,the,other
the,golden,dragon,of,westeros,said,the,kindly,man

and,with,that,coin,and,the,others,in,his,purse,he,paid,a,certain,man
soon,after,that,man’s,heart,gave,out
is,that,the,way,of,it

that,night,they,gave,her,back,the,face,of,arya,stark

she,and,jaime,used,to,dare,each,other,to,climb,into,their,cage,and,once,she,worked,up,enough,courage,to,slip,her,hand,between,two,bars,and,touch,one,of,the,great,tawny,beasts
she,was,always,bolder,than,her,brother
the,lion,had,turned,his,head,to,stare,at,her,with,huge,golden,eyes
then,he,licked,her,fingers
his,tongue,was,as,rough,as,a,rasp,but,even,so,she,would,not,pull,her,hand,back,not,until,jaime,took,her,by,the,shoulders,and,yanked,her,away,from,the,cage
