prologue,the,day,was,grey,and,bitter,cold,and,the,dogs,would,not,take,the,scent
the,big,black,bitch,had,taken,one,sniff,at,the,bear,tracks,backed,off,and,skulked,back,to,the,pack,with,her,tail,between,her,legs
the,dogs,huddled,together,miserably,on,the,riverbank,as,the,wind,snapped,at,them
chett,felt,it,too,biting,through,his,layers,of,black,wool,and,boiled,leather
it,was,too,bloody,cold,for,man,or,beast,but,here,they,were
his,mouth,twisted,and,he,could,almost,feel,the,boils,that,covered,his,cheeks,and,neck,growing,red,and,angry
i,should,be,safe,back,at,the,wall,tending,the,bloody,ravens,and,making,fires,for,old,maester,aemon
it,was,the,bastard,jon,snow,who,had,taken,that,from,him,him,and,his,fat,friend,sam,tarly
it,was,their,fault,he,was,here,freezing,his,bloody,balls,off,with,a,pack,of,hounds,deep,in,the,haunted,forest
seven,hells
he,gave,the,leashes,a,hard,yank,to,get,the,dogs’,attention
track,you,bastards
that’s,a,bear,print
you,want,some,meat,or,no
find
but,the,hounds,only,huddled,closer,whining
chett,snapped,his,short,lash,above,their,heads,and,the,black,bitch,snarled,at,him
dog,meat,would,taste,as,good,as,bear,he,warned,her,his,breath,frosting,with,every,word
lark,the,sisterman,stood,with,his,arms,crossed,over,his,chest,and,his,hands,tucked,up,into,his,armpits
he,wore,black,wool,gloves,but,he,was,always,complaining,how,his,fingers,were,frozen
it’s,too,bloody,cold,to,hunt,he,said
bugger,this,bear,he’s,not,worth,freezing,over
we,can’t,go,back,emptyhand,lark,rumbled,small,paul,through,the,brown,whiskers,that,covered,most,of,his,face
the,lord,commander,wouldn’t,like,that
there,was,ice,under,the,big,man’s,squashed,pug,nose,where,his,snot,had,frozen
a,huge,hand,in,a,thick,fur,glove,clenched,tight,around,the,shaft,of,a,spear
bugger,that,old,bear,too,said,the,sisterman,a,thin,man,with,sharp,features,and,nervous,eyes
mormont,will,be,dead,before,daybreak,remember
who,cares,what,he,likes
small,paul,blinked,his,black,little,eyes
maybe,he,had,forgotten,chett,thought,he,was,stupid,enough,to,forget,most,anything
why,do,we,have,to,kill,the,old,bear
why,don’t,we,just,go,off,and,let,him,be
you,think,he’ll,let,us,be
said,lark
he’ll,hunt,us,down
you,want,to,be,hunted,you,great,muttonhead
no,said,small,paul
i,don’t,want,that
i,don’t
so,you’ll,kill,him
said,lark
yes
the,huge,man,stamped,the,butt,of,his,spear,on,the,frozen,riverbank
i,will
he,shouldn’t,hunt,us
the,sisterman,took,his,hands,from,his,armpits,and,turned,to,chett
we,need,to,kill,all,the,officers,i,say
chett,was,sick,of,hearing,it
we,been,over,this
the,old,bear,dies,and,blane,from,the,shadow,tower
grubbs,and,aethan,as,well,their,ill,luck,for,drawing,the,watch,dywen,and,barmen,for,their,tracking,and,ser,piggy,for,the,ravens
that’s,all
we,kill,them,quiet,while,they,sleep
one,scream,and,we’re,wormfood,every,one,of,us
his,boils,were,red,with,rage
just,do,your,bit,and,see,that,your,cousins,do,theirs
and,paul,try,and,remember,it’s,third,watch,not,second
third,watch,the,big,man,said,through,hair,and,frozen,snot
me,and,softfoot
i,remember,chett
the,moon,would,be,black,tonight,and,they,had,jiggered,the,watches,so,as,to,have,eight,of,their,own,standing,sentry,with,two,more,guarding,the,horses
it,wasn’t,going,to,get,much,riper,than,that
besides,the,wildlings,could,be,upon,them,any,day,now
chett,meant,to,be,well,away,from,here,before,that,happened
he,meant,to,live
three,hundred,sworn,brothers,of,the,night’s,watch,had,ridden,north,two,hundred,from,castle,black,and,another,hundred,from,the,shadow,tower
it,was,the,biggest,ranging,in,living,memory,near,a,third,of,the,watch’s,strength
they,meant,to,find,ben,stark,ser,waymar,royce,and,the,other,rangers,who’d,gone,missing,and,discover,why,the,wildlings,were,leaving,their,villages
well,they,were,no,closer,to,stark,and,royce,than,when,they’d,left,the,wall,but,they’d,learned,where,all,the,wildlings,had,gone,up,into,the,icy,heights,of,the,godsforsaken,frostfangs
they,could,squat,up,there,till,the,end,of,time,and,it,wouldn’t,prick,chett’s,boils,none
but,no
they,were,coming,down
down,the,milkwater
chett,raised,his,eyes,and,there,it,was
the,river’s,stony,banks,were,bearded,by,ice,its,pale,milky,waters,flowing,endlessly,down,out,of,the,frostfangs
and,now,mance,rayder,and,his,wildlings,were,flowing,down,the,same,way
thoren,smallwood,had,returned,in,a,lather,three,days,past
while,he,was,telling,the,old,bear,what,his,scouts,had,seen,his,man,kedge,whiteye,told,the,rest,of,them
they’re,still,well,up,the,foothills,but,they’re,coming,kedge,said,warming,his,hands,over,the,fire
harma,the,dogshead,has,the,van,the,poxy,bitch
goady,crept,up,on,her,camp,and,saw,her,plain,by,the,fire
that,fool,tumberjon,wanted,to,pick,her,off,with,an,arrow,but,smallwood,had,better,sense
chett,spat
how,many,were,there,could,you,tell
many,and,more
twenty,thirty,thousand,we,didn’t,stay,to,count
harma,had,five,hundred,in,the,van,every,one,ahorse
the,men,around,the,fire,exchanged,uneasy,looks
it,was,a,rare,thing,to,find,even,a,dozen,mounted,wildlings,and,five,hundred
smallwood,sent,bannen,and,me,wide,around,the,van,to,catch,a,peek,at,the,main,body,kedge,went,on
there,was,no,end,of,them
they’re,moving,slow,as,a,frozen,river,four,five,miles,a,day,but,they,don’t,look,like,they,mean,to,go,back,to,their,villages,neither
more’n,half,were,women,and,children,and,they,were,driving,their,animals,before,them,goats,sheep,even,aurochs,dragging,sledges
they’d,loaded,up,with,bales,of,fur,and,sides,of,meat,cages,of,chickens,butter,churns,and,spinning,wheels,every,damn,thing,they,own
the,mules,and,garrons,was,so,heavy,laden,you’d,think,their,backs,would,break
the,women,as,well
and,they,follow,the,milkwater
lark,the,sisterman,asked
i,said,so,didn’t,i
the,milkwater,would,take,them,past,the,fist,of,the,first,men,the,ancient,ringfort,where,the,night’s,watch,had,made,its,camp
any,man,with,a,thimble,of,sense,could,see,that,it,was,time,to,pull,up,stakes,and,fall,back,on,the,wall
the,old,bear,had,strengthened,the,fist,with,spikes,and,pits,and,caltrops,but,against,such,a,host,all,that,was,pointless
if,they,stayed,here,they,would,be,engulfed,and,overwhelmed
and,thoren,smallwood,wanted,to,attack
sweet,donnel,hill,was,squire,to,ser,mallador,locke,and,the,night,before,last,smallwood,had,come,to,locke’s,tent
ser,mallador,had,been,of,the,same,mind,as,old,ser,ottyn,wythers,urging,a,retreat,on,the,wall,but,smallwood,wanted,to,convince,him,otherwise
this,king-beyond-the-wall,will,never,look,for,us,so,far,north,sweet,donnel,reported,him,saying
and,this,great,host,of,his,is,a,shambling,horde,full,of,useless,mouths,who,won’t,know,what,end,of,a,sword,to,hold
one,blow,will,take,all,the,fight,out,of,them,and,send,them,howling,back,to,their,hovels,for,another,fifty,years
three,hundred,against,thirty,thousand
chett,called,that,rank,madness,and,what,was,madder,still,was,that,ser,mallador,had,been,persuaded,and,the,two,of,them,together,were,on,the,point,of,persuading,the,old,bear
if,we,wait,too,long,this,chance,may,be,lost,never,to,come,again,smallwood,was,saying,to,anyone,who,would,listen
against,that,ser,ottyn,wythers,said,we,are,the,shield,that,guards,the,realms,of,men
you,do,not,throw,away,your,shield,for,no,good,purpose,but,to,that,thoren,smallwood,said,in,a,swordfight,a,man’s,surest,defense,is,the,swift,stroke,that,slays,his,foe,not,cringing,behind,a,shield
neither,smallwood,nor,wythers,had,the,command,though
lord,mormont,did,and,mormont,was,waiting,for,his,other,scouts,for,jarman,buckwell,and,the,men,who’d,climbed,the,giant’s,stair,and,for,qhorin,halfhand,and,jon,snow,who’d,gone,to,probe,the,skirling,pass
buckwell,and,the,halfhand,were,late,in,returning,though
dead,most,like
chett,pictured,jon,snow,lying,blue,and,frozen,on,some,bleak,mountaintop,with,a,wildling,spear,up,his,bastard’s,arse
the,thought,made,him,smile
i,hope,they,killed,his,bloody,wolf,as,well
there’s,no,bear,here,he,decided,abruptly
just,an,old,print,that’s,all
back,to,the,fist
the,dogs,almost,yanked,him,off,his,feet,as,eager,to,get,back,as,he,was
maybe,they,thought,they,were,going,to,get,fed
chett,had,to,laugh
he,hadn’t,fed,them,for,three,days,now,to,turn,them,mean,and,hungry
tonight,before,slipping,off,into,the,dark,he’d,turn,them,loose,among,the,horse,lines,after,sweet,donnel,hill,and,clubfoot,karl,cut,the,tethers
they’ll,have,snarling,hounds,and,panicked,horses,all,over,the,fist,running,through,fires,jumping,the,ringwall,and,trampling,down,tents
with,all,the,confusion,it,might,be,hours,before,anyone,noticed,that,fourteen,brothers,were,missing
lark,had,wanted,to,bring,in,twice,that,number,but,what,could,you,expect,from,some,stupid,fishbreath,sisterman
whisper,a,word,in,the,wrong,ear,and,before,you,knew,it,you’d,be,short,a,head
no,fourteen,was,a,good,number,enough,to,do,what,needed,doing,but,not,so,many,that,they,couldn’t,keep,the,secret
chett,had,recruited,most,of,them,himself
small,paul,was,one,of,his,the,strongest,man,on,the,wall,even,if,he,was,slower,than,a,dead,snail
he’d,once,broken,a,wildling’s,back,with,a,hug
they,had,dirk,as,well,named,for,his,favorite,weapon,and,the,little,grey,man,the,brothers,called,softfoot,who’d,raped,a,hundred,women,in,his,youth,and,liked,to,boast,how,none,had,never,seen,nor,heard,him,until,he,shoved,it,up,inside,them
the,plan,was,chett’s
he,was,the,clever,one,he’d,been,steward,to,old,maester,aemon,for,four,good,years,before,that,bastard,jon,snow,had,done,him,out,so,his,job,could,be,handed,to,his,fat,pig,of,a,friend
when,he,killed,sam,tarly,tonight,he,planned,to,whisper,give,my,love,to,lord,snow,right,in,his,ear,before,he,sliced,ser,piggy’s,throat,open,to,let,the,blood,come,bubbling,out,through,all,those,layers,of,suet
chett,knew,the,ravens,so,he,wouldn’t,have,no,trouble,there,no,more,than,he,would,with,tarly
one,touch,of,the,knife,and,that,craven,would,piss,his,pants,and,start,blubbering,for,his,life
let,him,beg,it,won’t,do,him,no,good
after,he,opened,his,throat,he’d,open,the,cages,and,shoo,the,birds,away,so,no,messages,reached,the,wall
softfoot,and,small,paul,would,kill,the,old,bear,dirk,would,do,blane,and,lark,and,his,cousins,would,silence,bannen,and,old,dywen,to,keep,them,from,sniffing,after,their,trail
they’d,been,caching,food,for,a,fortnight,and,sweet,donnel,and,clubfoot,karl,would,have,the,horses,ready
with,mormont,dead,command,would,pass,to,ser,ottyn,wythers,an,old,done,man,and,failing
he’ll,be,running,for,the,wall,before,sundown,and,he,won’t,waste,no,men,sending,them,after,us,neither
the,dogs,pulled,at,him,as,they,made,their,way,through,the,trees
chett,could,see,the,fist,punching,its,way,up,through,the,green
the,day,was,so,dark,that,the,old,bear,had,the,torches,lit,a,great,circle,of,them,burning,all,along,the,ringwall,that,crowned,the,top,of,the,steep,stony,hill
the,three,of,them,waded,across,a,brook
the,water,was,icy,cold,and,patches,of,ice,were,spreading,across,its,surface
i’m,going,to,make,for,the,coast,lark,the,sisterman,confided
me,and,my,cousins
we’ll,build,us,a,boat,sail,back,home,to,the,sisters
and,at,home,they’ll,know,you,for,deserters,and,lop,off,your,fool,heads,thought,chett
there,was,no,leaving,the,night’s,watch,once,you,said,your,words
anywhere,in,the,seven,kingdoms,they’d,take,you,and,kill,you
ollo,lophand,now,he,was,talking,about,sailing,back,to,tyrosh,where,he,claimed,men,didn’t,lose,their,hands,for,a,bit,of,honest,thievery,nor,get,sent,off,to,freeze,their,life,away,for,being,found,in,bed,with,some,knight’s,wife
chett,had,weighed,going,with,him,but,he,didn’t,speak,their,wet,girly,tongue
and,what,could,he,do,in,tyrosh
he,had,no,trade,to,speak,of,growing,up,in,hag’s,mire
his,father,had,spent,his,life,grubbing,in,other,men’s,fields,and,collecting,leeches
he’d,strip,down,bare,but,for,a,thick,leather,clout,and,go,wading,in,the,murky,waters
when,he,climbed,out,he’d,be,covered,from,nipple,to,ankle
sometimes,he,made,chett,help,pull,the,leeches,off
one,had,attached,itself,to,his,palm,once,and,he’d,smashed,it,against,a,wall,in,revulsion
his,father,beat,him,bloody,for,that
the,maesters,bought,the,leeches,at,twelve-for-a-penny
lark,could,go,home,if,he,liked,and,the,damn,tyroshi,too,but,not,chett
if,he,never,saw,hag’s,mire,again,it,would,be,too,bloody,soon
he,had,liked,the,look,of,craster’s,keep,himself
craster,lived,high,as,a,lord,there,so,why,shouldn’t,he,do,the,same
that,would,be,a,laugh
chett,the,leechman’s,son,a,lord,with,a,keep
his,banner,could,be,a,dozen,leeches,on,a,field,of,pink
but,why,stop,at,lord
maybe,he,should,be,a,king
mance,rayder,started,out,a,crow
i,could,be,a,king,same,as,him,and,have,me,some,wives
craster,had,nineteen,not,even,counting,the,young,ones,the,daughters,he,hadn’t,gotten,around,to,bedding,yet
half,them,wives,were,as,old,and,ugly,as,craster,but,that,didn’t,matter
the,old,ones,chett,could,put,to,work,cooking,and,cleaning,for,him,pulling,carrots,and,slopping,pigs,while,the,young,ones,warmed,his,bed,and,bore,his,children
craster,wouldn’t,object,not,once,small,paul,gave,him,a,hug
the,only,women,chett,had,ever,known,were,the,whores,he’d,bought,in,mole’s,town
when,he’d,been,younger,the,village,girls,took,one,look,at,his,face,with,its,boils,and,its,wen,and,turned,away,sickened
the,worst,was,that,slattern,bessa
she’d,spread,her,legs,for,every,boy,in,hag’s,mire,so,he’d,figured,why,not,him,too
he,even,spent,a,morning,picking,wildflowers,when,he,heard,she,liked,them,but,she’d,just,laughed,in,his,face,and,told,him,she’d,crawl,in,a,bed,with,his,father’s,leeches,before,she’d,crawl,in,one,with,him
she,stopped,laughing,when,he,put,his,knife,in,her
that,was,sweet,the,look,on,her,face,so,he,pulled,the,knife,out,and,put,it,in,her,again
when,they,caught,him,down,near,sevenstreams,old,lord,walder,frey,hadn’t,even,bothered,to,come,himself,to,do,the,judging
he’d,sent,one,of,his,bastards,that,walder,rivers,and,the,next,thing,chett,had,known,he,was,walking,to,the,wall,with,that,foul-smelling,black,devil,yoren
to,pay,for,his,one,sweet,moment,they,took,his,whole,life
but,now,he,meant,to,take,it,back,and,craster’s,women,too
that,twisted,old,wildling,has,the,right,of,it
if,you,want,a,woman,to,wife,you,take,her,and,none,of,this,giving,her,flowers,so,that,maybe,she,don’t,notice,your,bloody,boils
chett,didn’t,mean,to,make,that,mistake,again
it,would,work,he,promised,himself,for,the,hundredth,time
so,long,as,we,get,away,clean
ser,ottyn,would,strike,south,for,the,shadow,tower,the,shortest,way,to,the,wall
he,won’t,bother,with,us,not,wythers,all,he’ll,want,is,to,get,back,whole
thoren,smallwood,now,he’d,want,to,press,on,with,the,attack,but,ser,ottyn’s,caution,ran,too,deep,and,he,was,senior
it,won’t,matter,anyhow
once,we’re,gone,smallwood,can,attack,anyone,he,likes
what,do,we,care
if,none,of,them,ever,returns,to,the,wall,no,one,will,ever,come,looking,for,us,they’ll,think,we,died,with,the,rest
that,was,a,new,thought,and,for,a,moment,it,tempted,him
but,they,would,need,to,kill,ser,ottyn,and,ser,mallador,locke,as,well,to,give,smallwood,the,command,and,both,of,them,were,well-attended,day,and,night
no,the,risk,was,too,great
chett,said,small,paul,as,they,trudged,along,a,stony,game,trail,through,sentinels,and,soldier,pines,what,about,the,bird
what,bloody,bird
the,last,thing,he,needed,now,was,some,muttonhead,going,on,about,a,bird
the,old,bear’s,raven,small,paul,said
if,we,kill,him,who’s,going,to,feed,his,bird
who,bloody,well,cares
kill,the,bird,too,if,you,like
i,don’t,want,to,hurt,no,bird,the,big,man,said
but,that’s,a,talking,bird
what,if,it,tells,what,we,did
lark,the,sisterman,laughed
small,paul,thick,as,a,castle,wall,he,mocked
you,shut,up,with,that,said,small,paul,dangerously
paul,said,chett,before,the,big,man,got,too,angry,when,they,find,the,old,man,lying,in,a,pool,of,blood,with,his,throat,slit,they,won’t,need,no,bird,to,tell,them,someone,killed,him
small,paul,chewed,on,that,a,moment
that’s,true,he,allowed
can,i,keep,the,bird,then
i,like,that,bird
he’s,yours,said,chett,just,to,shut,him,up
we,can,always,eat,him,if,we,get,hungry,offered,lark
small,paul,clouded,up,again
best,not,try,and,eat,my,bird,lark
best,not
chett,could,hear,voices,drifting,through,the,trees
close,your,bloody,mouths,both,of,you
we’re,almost,to,the,fist
they,emerged,near,the,west,face,of,the,hill,and,walked,around,south,where,the,slope,was,gentler
near,the,edge,of,the,forest,a,dozen,men,were,taking,archery,practice
they,had,carved,outlines,on,the,trunks,of,trees,and,were,loosing,shafts,at,them
look,said,lark
a,pig,with,a,bow
sure,enough,the,nearest,bowman,was,ser,piggy,himself,the,fat,boy,who,had,stolen,his,place,with,maester,aemon
just,the,sight,of,samwell,tarly,filled,him,with,anger
stewarding,for,maester,aemon,had,been,as,good,a,life,as,he’d,ever,known
the,old,blind,man,was,undemanding,and,clydas,had,taken,care,of,most,of,his,wants,anyway
chett’s,duties,were,easy,cleaning,the,rookery,a,few,fires,to,build,a,few,meals,to,fetch
and,aemon,never,once,hit,him
thinks,he,can,just,walk,in,and,shove,me,out,on,account,of,being,highborn,and,knowing,how,to,read
might,be,i’ll,ask,him,to,read,my,knife,before,i,open,his,throat,with,it
you,go,on,he,told,the,others,i,want,to,watch,this
the,dogs,were,pulling,anxious,to,go,with,them,to,the,food,they,thought,would,be,waiting,at,the,top
chett,kicked,the,bitch,with,the,toe,of,his,boot,and,that,settled,them,down,some
he,watched,from,the,trees,as,the,fat,boy,wrestled,with,a,longbow,as,tall,as,he,was,his,red,moon,face,screwed,up,with,concentration
three,arrows,stood,in,the,ground,before,him
tarly,nocked,and,drew,held,the,draw,a,long,moment,as,he,tried,to,aim,and,let,fly
the,shaft,vanished,into,the,greenery
chett,laughed,loudly,a,snort,of,sweet,disgust
we’ll,never,find,that,one,and,i’ll,be,blamed,announced,edd,tollett,the,dour,grey-haired,squire,everyone,called,dolorous,edd
nothing,ever,goes,missing,that,they,don’t,look,at,me,ever,since,that,time,i,lost,my,horse

aye,and,made,a,few
ser,piggy,was,beaming
to,look,at,him,you’d,think,he’d,actually,done,something
but,when,he,saw,chett,and,the,dogs,his,smile,curled,up,and,died,squeaking
you,hit,a,tree,chett,said
let’s,see,how,you,shoot,when,it’s,mance,rayder’s,lads
they,won’t,stand,there,with,their,arms,out,and,their,leaves,rustling,oh,no
they’ll,come,right,at,you,screaming,in,your,face,and,i,bet,you’ll,piss,those,breeches

the,last,thing,you’ll,hear,will,be,the,thunk,it,makes,when,it,bites,into,your,skull
the,fat,boy,was,shaking
dolorous,edd,put,a,hand,on,his,shoulder

what,are,you,talking,about,tollett
the,axe,that,split,your,skull
is,it,true,that,half,your,wits,leaked,out,on,the,ground,and,your,dogs,ate,them
the,big,lout,grenn,laughed,and,even,samwell,tarly,managed,a,weak,little,smile
chett,kicked,the,nearest,dog,yanked,on,their,leashes,and,started,up,the,hill
smile,all,you,want,ser,piggy
we’ll,see,who,laughs,tonight
he,only,wished,he,had,time,to,kill,tollett,as,well
gloomy,horsefaced,fool,that’s,what,he,is
the,climb,was,steep,even,on,this,side,of,the,fist,which,had,the,gentlest,slope
partway,up,the,dogs,started,barking,and,pulling,at,him,figuring,that,they’d,get,fed,soon
he,gave,them,a,taste,of,his,boot,instead,and,a,crack,of,the,whip,for,the,big,ugly,one,that,snapped,at,him
once,they,were,tied,up,he,went,to,report
the,prints,were,there,like,giant,said,but,the,dogs,wouldn’t,track,he,told,mormont,in,front,of,his,big,black,tent
down,by,the,river,like,that,could,be,old,prints
a,pity
lord,commander,mormont,had,a,bald,head,and,a,great,shaggy,grey,beard,and,sounded,as,tired,as,he,looked
we,might,all,have,been,better,for,a,bit,of,fresh,meat
the,raven,on,his,shoulder,bobbed,its,head,and,echoed,meat
meat
meat
we,could,cook,the,bloody,dogs,chett,thought,but,he,kept,his,mouth,shut,until,the,old,bear,sent,him,on,his,way
and,that’s,the,last,time,i’ll,need,to,bow,my,head,to,that,one,he,thought,to,himself,with,satisfaction
it,seemed,to,him,that,it,was,growing,even,colder,which,he,would,have,swom
wasn’t,possible
the,dogs,huddled,together,miserably,in,the,hard,frozen,mud,and,chett,was,half,tempted,to,crawl,in,with,them
instead,he,wrapped,a,black,wool,scarf,round,the,lower,part,of,his,face,leaving,a,slit,for,his,mouth,between,the,winds
it,was,warmer,if,he,kept,moving,he,found,so,he,made,a,slow,circuit,of,the,perimeter,with,a,wad,of,sourleaf,sharing,a,chew,or,two,with,the,black,brothers,on,guard,and,hearing,what,they,had,to,say
none,of,the,men,on,the,day,watch,were,part,of,his,scheme,even,so,he,figured,it,was,good,to,have,some,sense,of,what,they,were,thinking
mostly,what,they,were,thinking,was,that,it,was,bloody,cold
the,wind,was,rising,as,the,shadows,lengthened
it,made,a,high,thin,sound,as,it,shivered,through,the,stones,of,the,ringwall
i,hate,that,sound,little,giant,said
it,sounds,like,a,babe,in,the,brush,wailing,away,for,milk
when,he,finished,the,circuit,and,returned,to,the,dogs,he,found,lark,waiting,for,him
the,officers,are,in,the,old,bear’s,tent,again,talking,something,fierce
that’s,what,they,do,said,chett
they’re,highborn,all,but,blane,they,get,drunk,on,words,instead,of,wine
lark,sidled,closer
cheese-for-wits,keeps,going,on,about,the,bird,he,warned,glancing,about,to,make,certain,no,one,was,close
now,he’s,asking,if,we,cached,any,seed,for,the,damn,thing
it’s,a,raven,said,chett
it,eats,corpses
lark,grinned
his,might,be
or,yours
it,seemed,to,chett,that,they,needed,the,big,man,more,than,they,needed,lark
stop,fretting,about,small,paul
you,do,your,part,he’ll,do,his
twilight,was,creeping,through,the,woods,by,the,time,he,rid,himself,of,the,sisterman,and,sat,down,to,edge,his,sword
it,was,bloody,hard,work,with,his,gloves,on,but,he,wasn’t,about,to,take,them,off
cold,as,it,was,any,fool,that,touched,steel,with,a,bare,hand,was,going,to,lose,a,patch,of,skin
the,dogs,whimpered,when,the,sun,went,down
he,gave,them,water,and,curses
half,a,night,more,and,you,can,find,your,own,feast
by,then,he,could,smell,supper
dywen,was,holding,forth,at,the,cookfire,as,chett,got,his,heel,of,hardbread,and,a,bowl,of,bean,and,bacon,soup,from,hake,the,cook
the,wood’s,too,silent,the,old,forester,was,saying
no,frogs,near,that,river,no,owls,in,the,dark
i,never,heard,no,deader,wood,than,this
them,teeth,of,yours,sound,pretty,dead,said,hake
dywen,clacked,his,wooden,teeth
no,wolves,neither
there,was,before,but,no,more
where’d,they,go,you,figure
someplace,warm,said,chett
of,the,dozen,odd,brothers,who,sat,by,the,fire,four,were,his
he,gave,each,one,a,hard,squinty,look,as,he,ate,to,see,if,any,showed,signs,of,breaking
dirk,seemed,calm,enough,sitting,silent,and,sharpening,his,blade,the,way,he,did,every,night
and,sweet,donnel,hill,was,all,easy,japes
he,had,white,teeth,and,fat,red,lips,and,yellow,locks,that,he,wore,in,an,artful,tumble,about,his,shoulders,and,he,claimed,to,be,the,bastard,of,some,lannister
maybe,he,was,at,that
chett,had,no,use,for,pretty,boys,nor,for,bastards,neither,but,sweet,donnel,seemed,like,to,hold,his,own
he,was,less,certain,about,the,forester,the,brothers,called,sawwood,more,for,his,snoring,than,for,anything,to,do,with,trees
just,now,he,looked,so,restless,he,might,never,snore,again
and,maslyn,was,worse
chett,could,see,sweat,trickling,down,his,face,despite,the,frigid,wind
the,beads,of,moisture,sparkled,in,the,firelight,like,so,many,little,wet,jewels
maslyn,wasn’t,eating,neither,only,staring,at,his,soup,as,if,the,smell,of,it,was,about,to,make,him,sick
i’ll,need,to,watch,that,one,chett,thought

that,was,good
no,sense,to,draw,attention,when,their,hour,was,so,close
when,the,shouting,died,away,once,more,he,heard,the,sound,of,the,wind,picking,at,the,ringwall

chett,crawled,under,his,furs,near,the,dogs,his,head,full,of,things,that,could,go,wrong
what,if,that,bloody,oath,gave,one,of,his,a,change,of,heart
or,small,paul,forgot,and,tried,to,kill,mormont,during,the,second,watch,in,place,of,the,third
or,maslyn,lost,his,courage,or,someone,turned,informer,or
he,found,himself,listening,to,the,night
the,wind,did,sound,like,a,wailing,child,and,from,time,to,time,he,could,hear,men’s,voices,a,horse’s,whinny,a,log,spitting,in,the,fire
but,nothing,else
so,quiet
he,could,see,bessa’s,face,floating,before,him

where,did,that,come,from,with,bessa
whenever,he’d,thought,of,her,before,it,had,only,been,to,remember,the,way,she’d,looked,dying
what,was,wrong,with,him
he,could,hardly,breathe

it,was,a,heavy,fall,thick,white,flakes,coming,down,all,about,him
how,would,they,find,their,food,caches,in,the,snow,or,the,game,trail,they,meant,to,follow,east
they,won’t,need,dywen,nor,bannen,to,hunt,us,down,neither,not,if,we’re,tracking,through,fresh,snow
and,snow,hid,the,shape,of,the,ground,especially,by,night

only,a,wildling’s,sword,in,his,belly,and,then,an,unmarked,grave
the,snow’s,taken,it,all,from,me
the,bloody,snow
snow,had,ruined,him,once,before
snow,and,his,pet,pig
chett,got,to,his,feet
his,legs,were,stiff,and,the,falling,snowflakes,turned,the,distant,torches,to,vague,orange,glows
he,felt,as,though,he,were,being,attacked,by,a,cloud,of,pale,cold,bugs
they,settled,on,his,shoulders,on,his,head,they,flew,at,his,nose,and,his,eyes
cursing,he,brushed,them,off
samwell,tarly,he,remembered
i,can,still,deal,with,ser,piggy
he,wrapped,his,scarf,around,his,face,pulled,up,his,hood,and,went,striding,through,the,camp,to,where,the,coward,slept
the,snow,was,falling,so,heavily,that,he,got,lost,among,the,tents,but,finally,he,spotted,the,snug,little,windbreak,the,fat,boy,had,made,for,himself,between,a,rock,and,the,raven,cages
tarly,was,buried,beneath,a,mound,of,black,wool,blankets,and,shaggy,furs
the,snow,was,drifting,in,to,cover,him
he,looked,like,some,kind,of,soft,round,mountain
steel,whispered,on,leather,faint,as,hope,as,chett,eased,his,dagger,from,its,sheath
one,of,the,ravens,quorked

the,first,added,a,snow,of,its,own
he,edged,past,them,placing,each,foot,carefully
he,would,clap,his,left,hand,down,over,the,fat,boy’s,mouth,to,muffle,his,cries,and,then
uuuuuuuhoooooooooo
he,stopped,midstep,swallowing,his,curse,as,the,sound,of,the,horn,shuddered,through,the,camp,faint,and,far,yet,unmistakable
not,now,gods,be,damned,not,now
the,old,bear,had,hidden,far-eyes,in,a,ring,of,trees,around,the,fist,to,give,warning,of,any,approach
jarman,buckwell’s,back,from,the,giant’s,stair,chett,figured,or,qhorin,halfhand,from,the,skirling,pass
a,single,blast,of,the,horn,meant,brothers,returning
if,it,was,the,halfhand,jon,snow,might,be,with,him,alive
sam,tarly,sat,up,puffy-eyed,and,stared,at,the,snow,in,confusion
the,ravens,were,cawing,noisily,and,chett,could,hear,his,dogs,baying
half,the,bloody,camp’s,awake
his,gloved,fingers,clenched,around,the,dagger’s,hilt,as,he,waited,for,the,sound,to,die,away
but,no,sooner,had,it,gone,than,it,came,again,louder,and,longer
uuuuuuuuuuuuhooooooooooooooo
gods,he,heard,sam,tarly,whimper
the,fat,boy,lurched,to,his,knees,his,feet,tangled,in,his,cloak,and,blankets
he,kicked,them,away,and,reached,for,a,chainmail,hauberk,he’d,hung,on,the,rock,nearby
as,he,slipped,the,huge,tent,of,a,garment,down,over,his,head,and,wriggled,into,it,he,spied,chett,standing,there
was,it,two
he,asked
i,dreamed,i,heard,two,blasts
no,dream,said,chett
two,blasts,to,call,the,watch,to,arms
two,blasts,for,foes,approaching
there’s,an,axe,out,there,with,piggy,writ,on,it,fat,boy
two,blasts,means,wildlings
the,fear,on,that,big,moon,face,made,him,want,to,laugh
bugger,them,all,to,seven,hells
bloody,harma
bloody,mance,rayder
bloody,smallwood,he,said,they,wouldn’t,be,on,us,for,another,uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhooooooooooooooooooooooooo
the,sound,went,on,and,on,and,on,until,it,seemed,it,would,never,die
the,ravens,were,flapping,and,screaming,flying,about,their,cages,and,banging,off,the,bars,and,all,about,the,camp,the,brothers,of,the,night’s,watch,were,rising,donning,their,armor,buckling,on,swordbelts,reaching,for,battleaxes,and,bows
samwell,tarly,stood,shaking,his,face,the,same,color,as,the,snow,that,swirled,down,all,around,them
three,he,squeaked,to,chett,that,was,three,i,heard,three
they,never,blow,three
not,for,hundreds,and,thousands,of,years
three,means,others
chett,made,a,sound,that,was,half,a,laugh,and,half,a,sob,and,suddenly,his,smallclothes,were,wet,and,he,could,feel,the,piss,running,down,his,leg,see,steam,rising,off,the,front,of,his,breeches
jaime,an,east,wind,blew,through,his,tangled,hair,as,soft,and,fragrant,as,cersei’s,fingers
he,could,hear,birds,singing,and,feel,the,river,moving,beneath,the,boat,as,the,sweep,of,the,oars,sent,them,toward,the,pale,pink,dawn
after,so,long,in,darkness,the,world,was,so,sweet,that,jaime,lannister,felt,dizzy
i,am,alive,and,drunk,on,sunlight
a,laugh,burst,from,his,lips,sudden,as,a,quail,flushed,from,cover
quiet,the,wench,grumbled,scowling
scowls,suited,her,broad,homely,face,better,than,a,smile
not,that,jaime,had,ever,seen,her,smiling
he,amused,himself,by,picturing,her,in,one,of,cersei’s,silken,gowns,in,place,of,her,studded,leather,jerkin
as,well,dress,a,cow,in,silk,as,this,one
but,the,cow,could,row
beneath,her,roughspun,brown,breeches,were,calves,like,cords,of,wood,and,the,long,muscles,of,her,arms,stretched,and,tightened,with,each,stroke,of,the,oars
even,after,rowing,half,the,night,she,showed,no,signs,of,tiring,which,was,more,than,could,be,said,for,his,cousin,ser,cleos,laboring,on,the,other,oar
a,big,strong,peasant,wench,to,look,at,her,yet,she,speaks,like,one,highborn,and,wears,longsword,and,dagger
ah,but,can,she,use,them
jaime,meant,to,find,out,as,soon,as,he,rid,himself,of,these,fetters
he,wore,iron,manacles,on,his,wrists,and,a,matching,pair,about,his,ankles,joined,by,a,length,of,heavy,chain,no,more,than,a,foot,long
you’d,think,my,word,as,a,lannister,was,not,good,enough,he’d,japed,as,they,bound,him
he’d,been,very,drunk,by,then,thanks,to,catelyn,stark
of,their,escape,from,riverrun,he,recalled,only,bits,and,pieces

for,the,moment,the,surface,of,the,waters,was,empty

catelyn,could,not,blame,ser,desmond,she,had,given,him,small,reason,to,trust,her,and,no,doubt,he,feared,that,she,might,use,the,loyalty,that,many,of,the,folk,of,riverrun,would,still,feel,toward,their,lord’s,daughter,to,work,some,further,mischief
i,am,free,of,the,war,at,least,she,told,herself,if,only,for,a,little,while

the,milk,of,the,poppy,had,done,its,work,and,lord,hoster,was,sunk,in,heavy,sleep
a,thin,line,of,spittle,ran,down,from,one,corner,of,his,open,mouth,to,dampen,his,pillow

that,night,catelyn,slept,fitfully,haunted,by,formless,dreams,of,her,children,the,lost,and,the,dead
well,before,the,break,of,day,she,woke,with,her,father’s,words,echoing,in,her,ears
sweet,babes,and,trueborn
why,would,he,say,that,unless

she,could,not,believe,it
her,brother,edmure,yes,it,would,not,have,surprised,her,to,learn,that,edmure,had,a,dozen,natural,children

never,unless
unless,she,was,with,child,that,first,time
she,and,her,sister,had,been,married,on,the,same,day,and,left,in,their,father’s,care,when,their,new,husbands,had,ridden,off,to,rejoin,robert’s,rebellion
afterward,when,their,moon,blood,did,not,come,at,the,accustomed,time,lysa,had,gushed,happily,of,the,sons,she,was,certain,they,carried
your,son,will,be,heir,to,winterfell,and,mine,to,the,eyrie
oh,they’ll,be,the,best,of,friends,like,your,ned,and,lord,robert
they’ll,be,more,brothers,than,cousins,truly,i,just,know,it
she,was,so,happy
but,lysa’s,blood,had,come,not,long,after,and,all,the,joy,had,gone,out,of,her
catelyn,had,always,thought,that,lysa,had,simply,been,a,little,late,but,if,she,had,been,with,child
she,remembered,the,first,time,she,gave,her,sister,robb,to,hold,small,red-faced,and,squalling,but,strong,even,then,full,of,life
no,sooner,had,catelyn,placed,the,babe,in,her,sister’s,arms,than,lysa’s,face,dissolved,into,tears
hurriedly,she,had,thrust,the,baby,back,at,catelyn,and,fled
if,she,had,lost,a,child,before,that,might,explain,father’s,words,and,much,else,besides
lysa’s,match,with,lord,arryn,had,been,hastily,arranged,and,jon,was,an,old,man,even,then,older,than,their,father
an,old,man,without,an,heir

a,young,wife,known,to,be,fertile
catelyn,rose,threw,on,a,robe,and,descended,the,steps,to,the,darkened,solar,to,stand,over,her,father
a,sense,of,helpless,dread,filled,her
father,she,said,father,i,know,what,you,did
she,was,no,longer,an,innocent,bride,with,a,head,full,of,dreams
she,was,a,widow,a,traitor,a,grieving,mother,and,wise,wise,in,the,ways,of,the,world
you,made,him,take,her,she,whispered
lysa,was,the,price,jon,arryn,had,to,pay,for,the,swords,and,spears,of,house,tully
small,wonder,her,sister’s,marriage,had,been,so,loveless
the,arryns,were,proud,and,prickly,of,their,honor
lord,jon,might,wed,lysa,to,bind,the,tullys,to,the,cause,of,the,rebellion,and,in,hopes,of,a,son,but,it,would,have,been,hard,for,him,to,love,a,woman,who,came,to,his,bed,soiled,and,unwilling
he,would,have,been,kind,no,doubt,dutiful,yes,but,lysa,needed,warmth
the,next,day,as,she,broke,her,fast,catelyn,asked,for,quill,and,paper,and,began,a,letter,to,her,sister,in,the,vale,of,arryn
she,told,lysa,of,bran,and,rickon,struggling,with,the,words,but,mostly,she,wrote,of,their,father
his,thoughts,are,all,of,the,wrong,he,did,you,now,that,his,time,grows,short
maester,vyman,says,he,dare,not,make,the,milk,of,the,poppy,any,stronger
it,is,time,for,father,to,lay,down,his,sword,and,shield
it,is,time,for,him,to,rest
yet,he,fights,on,grimly,will,not,yield
it,is,for,your,sake,i,think
he,needs,your,forgiveness
the,war,has,made,the,road,from,the,eyrie,to,riverrun,dangerous,to,travel,i,know,but,surely,a,strong,force,of,knights,could,see,you,safely,through,the,mountains,of,the,moon
a,hundred,men,or,a,thousand
and,if,you,cannot,come,will,you,not,write,him,at,least
a,few,words,of,love,so,he,might,die,in,peace
write,what,you,will,and,i,shall,read,it,to,him,and,ease,his,way
even,as,she,set,the,quill,aside,and,asked,for,sealing,wax,catelyn,sensed,that,the,letter,was,like,to,be,too,little,and,too,late
maester,vyman,did,not,believe,lord,hoster,would,linger,long,enough,for,a,raven,to,reach,the,eyrie,and,return
though,he,has,said,much,the,same,before
tully,men,did,not,surrender,easily,no,matter,the,odds
after,she,entrusted,the,parchment,to,the,maester’s,care,catelyn,went,to,the,sept,and,lit,a,candle,to,the,father,above,for,her,own,father’s,sake,a,second,to,the,crone,who,had,let,the,first,raven,into,the,world,when,she,peered,through,the,door,of,death,and,a,third,to,the,mother,for,lysa,and,all,the,children,they,had,both,lost
later,that,day,as,she,sat,at,lord,hoster’s,bedside,with,a,book,reading,the,same,passage,over,and,over,she,heard,the,sound,of,loud,voices,and,a,trumpet’s,blare
ser,robin,she,thought,at,once,flinching
she,went,to,the,balcony,but,there,was,nothing,to,be,seen,out,on,the,rivers,but,she,could,hear,the,voices,more,clearly,from,outside,the,sound,of,many,horses,the,clink,of,armor,and,here,and,there,a,cheer
catelyn,made,her,way,up,the,winding,stairs,to,the,roof,of,the,keep
ser,desmond,did,not,forbid,me,the,roof,she,told,herself,as,she,climbed
the,sounds,were,coming,from,the,far,side,of,the,castle,by,the,main,gate
a,knot,of,men,stood,before,the,portcullis,as,it,rose,in,jerks,and,starts,and,in,the,fields,beyond,outside,the,castle,were,several,hundred,riders
when,the,wind,blew,it,lifted,their,banners,and,she,trembled,in,relief,at,the,sight,of,the,leaping,trout,of,riverrun
edmure
it,was,two,hours,before,he,saw,fit,to,come,to,her
by,then,the,castle,rang,to,the,sound,of,noisy,reunions,as,men,embraced,the,women,and,children,they,had,left,behind
three,ravens,had,risen,from,the,rookery,black,wings,beating,at,the,air,as,they,took,flight
catelyn,watched,them,from,her,father’s,balcony
she,had,washed,her,hair,changed,her,clothing,and,prepared,herself,for,her,brother’s,reproaches
but,even,so,the,waiting,was,hard
when,at,last,she,heard,sounds,outside,her,door,she,sat,and,folded,her,hands,in,her,lap
dried,red,mud,spattered,edmure’s,boots,greaves,and,surcoat
to,look,at,him,you,would,never,know,he,had,won,his,battle
he,was,thin,and,drawn,with,pale,cheeks,unkempt,beard,and,too-bright,eyes

she,still,had,nightmares,about,the,shadow,she,had,seen,slide,across,renly’s,tent,and,the,way,the,blood,had,come,flowing,out,through,the,steel,of,his,gorget

no,right,edmure,repeated
he,was,robb’s,captive,your,king’s,captive,and,robb,charged,me,to,keep,him,safe

by,river,or,road,the,way,from,riverrun,to,king’s,landing,must,needs,take,them,close,by,harrenhal
harrenhal
the,very,word,seemed,to,darken,the,room

have,no,fear,i,left,your,part,out
i,wrote,that,jaime,had,escaped,and,offered,a,thousand,dragons,for,his,recapture

my,brother,is,a,fool
unbidden,unwanted,tears,filled,her,eyes
if,this,was,an,escape,she,said,softly,and,not,an,exchange,of,hostages,why,should,the,lannisters,give,my,daughters,to,brienne
it,will,never,come,to,that
the,kingslayer,will,be,returned,to,us,i,have,made,certain,of,it
all,you,have,made,certain,is,that,i,shall,never,see,my,daughters,again
brienne,might,have,gotten,him,to,king’s,landing,safely
so,long,as,no,one,was,hunting,for,them
but,now
catelyn,could,not,go,on
leave,me,edmure

go
all,she,wanted,was,to,lie,down,to,close,her,eyes,and,sleep,and,pray,no,dreams,would,come
arya,the,sky,was,as,black,as,the,walls,of,harrenhal,behind,them,and,the,rain,fell,soft,and,steady,muffling,the,sound,of,their,horses’,hooves,and,running,down,their,faces

someone,would,find,him,lying,dead,in,his,own,blood,and,then,the,hue,and,cry,would,go,up
they,would,wake,lord,bolton,and,search,harrenhal,from,crenel,to,cellar,and,when,they,did,they,would,find,the,map,and,the,dagger,missing,along,with,some,swords,from,the,armory,bread,and,cheese,from,the,kitchens,a,baker,boy,a,’prentice,smith,and,a,cupbearer,called,nan

others,called,them,bloody,mummers,though,never,to,their,faces,and,sometimes,the,footmen,for,lord,vargo’s,habit,of,cutting,off,the,hands,and,feet,of,men,who,displeased,him

every,time,she,looked,back,she,half,expected,to,see,a,blaze,of,torches,pouring,out,the,distant,gates,of,harrenhal,or,rushing,along,the,tops,of,its,huge,high,walls,but,there,was,nothing
harrenhal,slept,on,until,it,was,lost,in,darkness,and,hidden,behind,the,trees
when,they,crossed,the,first,stream,arya,turned,her,horse,aside,and,led,them,off,the,road,following,the,twisting,course,of,the,water,for,a,quarter-mile,before,finally,scrambling,out,and,up,a,stony,bank
if,the,hunters,brought,dogs,that,might,throw,them,off,the,scent,she,hoped

there,is,death,on,the,road,she,told,herself,death,on,all,the,roads
gendry,and,hot,pie,did,not,question,her,choice
she,had,the,map,after,all,and,hot,pie,seemed,almost,as,terrified,of,her,as,of,the,men,who,might,be,coming,after,them
he,had,seen,the,guard,she’d,killed
it’s,better,if,he’s,scared,of,me,she,told,herself
that,way,he’ll,do,like,i,say,instead,of,something,stupid
she,should,be,more,frightened,herself,she,knew
she,was,only,ten,a,skinny,girl,on,a,stolen,horse,with,a,dark,forest,ahead,of,her,and,men,behind,who,would,gladly,cut,off,her,feet
yet,somehow,she,felt,calmer,than,she,ever,had,in,harrenhal
the,rain,had,washed,the,guard’s,blood,off,her,fingers,she,wore,a,sword,across,her,back,wolves,were,prowling,through,the,dark,like,lean,grey,shadows,and,arya,stark,was,unafraid

it,was,too,black,beneath,the,trees,to,ride,any,faster,the,boys,were,no,horsemen,neither,one,and,the,soft,broken,ground,was,treacherous,with,half-buried,roots,and,hidden,stones
they,crossed,another,road,its,deep,ruts,filled,with,runoff,but,arya,shunned,it
up,and,down,the,rolling,hills,she,took,them,through,brambles,and,briars,and,tangles,of,underbrush,along,the,bottoms,of,narrow,gullies,where,branches,heavy,with,wet,leaves,slapped,at,their,faces,as,they,passed
gendry’s,mare,lost,her,footing,in,the,mud,once,going,down,hard,on,her,hindquarters,and,spilling,him,from,the,saddle,but,neither,horse,nor,rider,was,hurt,and,gendry,got,that,stubborn,look,on,his,face,and,mounted,right,up,again
not,long,after,they,came,upon,three,wolves,devouring,the,corpse,of,a,fawn
when,hot,pie’s,horse,caught,the,scent,he,shied,and,bolted
two,of,the,wolves,fled,as,well,but,the,third,raised,his,head,and,bared,his,teeth,prepared,to,defend,his,kill
back,off,arya,told,gendry
slow,so,you,don’t,spook,him
they,edged,their,mounts,away,until,the,wolf,and,his,feast,were,no,longer,in,sight
only,then,did,she,swing,about,to,ride,after,hot,pie,who,was,clinging,desperately,to,the,saddle,as,he,crashed,through,the,trees
later,they,passed,through,a,burned,village,threading,their,way,carefully,between,the,shells,of,blackened,hovels,and,past,the,bones,of,a,dozen,dead,men,hanging,from,a,row,of,apple,trees
when,hot,pie,saw,them,he,began,to,pray,a,thin,whispered,plea,for,the,mother’s,mercy,repeated,over,and,over
arya,looked,up,at,the,fleshless,dead,in,their,wet,rotting,clothes,and,said,her,own,prayer

it,was,mushy,and,overripe,but,she,ate,it,worms,and,all
that,was,the,day,without,a,dawn
slowly,the,sky,lightened,around,them,but,they,never,saw,the,sun
black,turned,to,grey,and,colors,crept,timidly,back,into,the,world
the,soldier,pines,were,dressed,in,somber,greens,the,broadleafs,in,russets,and,faded,golds,already,beginning,to,brown
they,stopped,long,enough,to,water,the,horses,and,eat,a,cold,quick,breakfast,ripping,apart,a,loaf,of,the,bread,that,hot,pie,had,stolen,from,the,kitchens,and,passing,chunks,of,hard,yellow,cheese,from,hand,to,hand

we,will
why
because,riverrun,is,my,grandfather’s,castle,and,my,brother,robb,will,be,there,she,wanted,to,say
she,bit,her,lip,and,rolled,up,the,map
we,just,will
but,only,if,we,get,there
she,was,the,first,one,back,in,the,saddle
it,made,her,feel,bad,to,hide,the,truth,from,hot,pie,but,she,did,not,trust,him,with,her,secret
gendry,knew,but,that,was,different
gendry,had,his,own,secret,though,even,he,didn’t,seem,to,know,what,it,was
that,day,arya,quickened,their,pace,keeping,the,horses,to,a,trot,as,long,as,she,dared,and,sometimes,spurring,to,a,gallop,when,she,spied,a,flat,stretch,of,fleld,before,them
that,was,seldom,enough,though,the,ground,was,growing,hillier,as,they,went
the,hills,were,not,high,nor,especially,steep,but,there,seemed,to,be,no,end,of,them,and,they,soon,grew,tired,of,climbing,up,one,and,down,the,other,and,found,themselves,following,the,lay,of,the,land,along,streambeds,and,through,a,maze,of,shallow,wooded,valleys,where,the,trees,made,a,solid,canopy,overhead
from,time,to,time,she,sent,hot,pie,and,gendry,on,while,she,doubled,back,to,try,to,confuse,their,trail,listening,all,the,while,for,the,first,sign,of,pursuit
too,slow,she,thought,to,herself,chewing,her,lip,we’re,going,too,slow,they’ll,catch,us,for,certain
once,from,the,crest,of,a,ridge,she,spied,dark,shapes,crossing,a,stream,in,the,valley,behind,them,and,for,half,a,heartbeat,she,feared,that,roose,bolton’s,riders,were,on,them,but,when,she,looked,again,she,realized,they,were,only,a,pack,of,wolves
she,cupped,her,hands,around,her,mouth,and,howled,down,at,them,ahooooooooo,ahooooooooo
when,the,largest,of,the,wolves,lifted,its,head,and,howled,back,the,sound,made,arya,shiver
by,midday,hot,pie,had,begun,to,complain
his,arse,was,sore,he,told,them,and,the,saddle,was,rubbing,him,raw,inside,his,legs,and,besides,he,had,to,get,some,sleep
i’m,so,tired,i’m,going,to,fall,off,the,horse
arya,looked,at,gendry
if,he,falls,off,who,do,you,think,will,find,him,first,the,wolves,or,the,mummers
the,wolves,said,gendry
better,noses
hot,pie,opened,his,mouth,and,closed,it
he,did,not,fall,off,his,horse
the,rain,began,again,a,short,time,later
they,still,had,not,seen,so,much,as,a,glimpse,of,the,sun
it,was,growing,colder,and,pale,white,mists,were,threading,between,the,pines,and,blowing,across,the,bare,burned,flelds
gendry,was,having,almost,as,bad,a,time,of,it,as,hot,pie,though,he,was,too,stubborn,to,complain
he,sat,awkwardly,in,the,saddle,a,determined,look,on,his,face,beneath,his,shaggy,black,hair,but,arya,could,tell,he,was,no,horseman
i,should,have,remembered,she,thought,to,herself
she,had,been,riding,as,long,as,she,could,remember,ponies,when,she,was,little,and,later,horses,but,gendry,and,hot,pie,were,city-born,and,in,the,city,smallfolk,walked
yoren,had,given,them,mounts,when,he,took,them,from,king’s,landing,but,sitting,on,a,donkey,and,plodding,up,the,kingsroad,behind,a,wagon,was,one,thing
guiding,a,hunting,horse,through,wild,woods,and,burned,fields,was,something,else
she,would,make,much,better,time,on,her,own,arya,knew,but,she,could,not,leave,them
they,were,her,pack,her,friends,the,only,living,friends,that,remained,to,her,and,if,not,for,her,they,would,still,be,safe,at,harrenhal,gendry,sweating,at,his,forge,and,hot,pie,in,the,kitchens
if,the,mummers,catch,us,i’ll,tell,them,that,i’m,ned,stark’s,daughter,and,sister,to,the,king,in,the,north
i’ll,command,them,to,take,me,to,my,brother,and,to,do,no,harm,to,hot,pie,and,gendry
they,might,not,believe,her,though,and,even,if,they,did
lord,bolton,was,her,brother’s,bannerman,but,he,frightened,her,all,the,same
i,won’t,let,them,take,us,she,vowed,silently,reaching,back,over,her,shoulder,to,touch,the,hilt,of,the,sword,that,gendry,had,stolen,for,her
i,won’t
late,that,afternoon,they,emerged,from,beneath,the,trees,and,found,themselves,on,the,banks,of,a,river
hot,pie,gave,a,whoop,of,delight
the,trident
now,all,we,have,to,do,is,go,upstream,like,you,said
we’re,almost,there
arya,chewed,her,lip
i,don’t,think,this,is,the,trident
the,river,was,swollen,by,the,rain,but,even,so,it,couldn’t,be,much,more,than,thirty,feet,across
she,remembered,the,trident,as,being,much,wider
it’s,too,little,to,be,the,trident,she,told,them,and,we,didn’t,come,far,enough
yes,we,did,hot,pie,insisted
we,rode,all,day,and,hardly,stopped,at,all
we,must,have,come,a,long,way
let’s,have,a,look,at,that,map,again,said,gendry
arya,dismounted,took,out,the,map,unrolled,it
the,rain,pattered,against,the,sheepskin,and,ran,off,in,rivulets
we’re,someplace,here,i,think,she,said,pointing,as,the,boys,peered,over,her,shoulders
but,said,hot,pie,that’s,hardly,any,ways,at,all
see,harrenhal’s,there,by,your,finger,you’re,almost,touching,it
and,we,rode,all,day
there’s,miles,and,miles,before,we,reach,the,trident,she,said
we,won’t,be,there,for,days
this,must,be,some,different,river,one,of,these,see
she,showed,him,some,of,the,thinner,blue,lines,the,mapmaker,had,painted,in,each,with,a,name,painted,in,flne,script,beneath,it
the,darry,the,greenapple,the,maiden
here,this,one,the,little,willow,it,might,be,that
hot,pie,looked,from,the,line,to,the,river
it,doesn’t,look,so,little,to,me
gendry,was,frowning,as,well
the,one,you’re,pointing,at,runs,into,that,other,one,see
the,big,willow,she,read
the,big,willow,then
see,and,the,big,willow,runs,into,the,trident,so,we,could,follow,the,one,to,the,other,but,we’d,need,to,go,downstream,not,up
only,if,this,river,isn’t,the,little,willow,if,it’s,this,other,one,here
rippledown,rill,arya,read
see,it,loops,around,and,flows,down,toward,the,lake,back,to,harrenhal
he,traced,the,line,with,a,finger
hot,pie’s,eyes,grew,wide
no
they’ll,kill,us,for,sure
we,have,to,know,which,river,this,is,declared,gendry,in,his,stubbornest,voice
we,have,to,know
well,we,don’t
the,map,might,have,names,written,beside,the,blue,lines,but,no,one,had,written,a,name,on,the,riverbank
we,won’t,go,up,or,downstream,she,decided,rolling,up,the,map
we’ll,cross,and,keep,going,north,like,we,were
can,horses,swim
asked,hot,pie
it,looks,deep,arry
what,if,there,are,snakes
are,you,sure,we’re,going,north
asked,gendry
all,these,hills
if,we,got,turned,around
the,moss,on,the,trees,he,pointed,to,a,nearby,tree
that,tree’s,got,moss,on,three,sides,and,that,next,one,has,no,moss,at,all
we,could,be,lost,just,riding,around,in,a,circle
we,could,be,said,arya,but,i’m,going,to,cross,the,river,anyway
you,can,come,or,you,can,stay,here
she,climbed,back,into,the,saddle,ignoring,the,both,of,them
if,they,didn’t,want,to,follow,they,could,find,riverrun,on,their,own,though,more,likely,the,mummers,would,just,find,them
she,had,to,ride,a,good,half,mile,along,the,bank,before,she,finally,found,a,place,where,it,looked,as,though,it,might,be,safe,to,cross,and,even,then,her,mare,was,reluctant,to,enter,the,water
the,river,whatever,its,name,was,running,brown,and,fast,and,the,deep,part,in,the,middle,came,up,past,the,horse’s,belly
water,filled,her,boots,but,she,pressed,in,her,heels,all,the,same,and,climbed,out,on,the,far,bank
from,behind,she,heard,splashing,and,a,mare’s,nervous,whinny
they,followed,then
good
she,turned,to,watch,as,the,boys,struggled,across,and,emerged,dripping,beside,her
it,wasn’t,the,trident,she,told,them
it,wasn’t
the,next,river,was,shallower,and,easier,to,ford
that,one,wasn’t,the,trident,either,and,no,one,argued,with,her,when,she,told,them,they,would,cross,it
dusk,was,settling,as,they,stopped,to,rest,the,horses,once,more,and,share,another,meal,of,bread,and,cheese
i’m,cold,and,wet,hot,pie,complained
we’re,a,long,way,from,harrenhal,now,for,sure
we,could,have,us,a,fire,no
arya,and,gendry,both,said,at,the,exact,same,instant
hot,pie,quailed,a,little
arya,gave,gendry,a,sideways,look
he,said,it,with,me,like,jon,used,to,do,back,in,winterfell
she,missed,jon,snow,the,most,of,all,her,brothers
could,we,sleep,at,least
hot,pie,asked
i’m,so,tired,arry,and,my,arse,is,sore
i,think,i’ve,got,blisters
you’ll,have,more,than,that,if,you’re,caught,she,said
we’ve,got,to,keep,going
we’ve,got,to
but,it’s,almost,dark,and,you,can’t,even,see,the,moon
get,back,on,your,horse
plodding,along,at,a,slow,walking,pace,as,the,light,faded,around,them,arya,found,her,own,exhaustion,weighing,heavy,on,her
she,needed,sleep,as,much,as,hot,pie,but,they,dare,not
if,they,slept,they,might,open,their,eyes,to,find,vargo,hoat,standing,over,them,with,shagwell,the,fool,and,faithful,urswyck,and,rorge,and,biter,and,septon,utt,and,all,his,other,monsters
yet,after,a,while,the,motion,of,her,horse,became,as,soothing,as,the,rocking,of,a,cradle,and,arya,found,her,eyes,growing,heavy
she,let,them,close,just,for,an,instant,then,snapped,them,wide,again
i,can’t,go,to,sleep,she,screamed,at,herself,silently,i,can’t,i,can’t
she,knuckled,at,her,eye,and,rubbed,it,hard,to,keep,it,open,clutching,the,reins,tightly,and,kicking,her,mount,to,a,canter
but,neither,she,nor,the,horse,could,sustain,the,pace,and,it,was,only,a,few,moments,before,they,fell,back,to,a,walk,again,and,a,few,more,until,her,eyes,closed,a,second,time
this,time,they,did,not,open,quite,so,quickly
when,they,did,she,found,that,her,horse,had,come,to,a,stop,and,was,nibbling,at,a,tuft,of,grass,while,gendry,was,shaking,her,arm
you,fell,asleep,he,told,her
i,was,just,resting,my,eyes
you,were,resting,them,a,long,while,then
your,horse,was,wandering,in,a,circle,but,it,wasn’t,till,she,stopped,that,i,realized,you,were,sleeping
hot,pie’s,just,as,bad,he,rode,into,a,tree,limb,and,got,knocked,off,you,should,have,heard,him,yell
even,that,didn’t,wake,you,up
you,need,to,stop,and,sleep
i,can,keep,going,as,long,as,you,can
she,yawned
liar,he,said
you,keep,going,if,you,want,to,be,stupid,but,i’m,stopping
i’ll,take,the,first,watch
you,sleep
what,about,hot,pie
gendry,pointed
hot,pie,was,already,on,the,ground,curled,up,beneath,his,cloak,on,a,bed,of,damp,leaves,and,snoring,softly
he,had,a,big,wedge,of,cheese,in,one,fist,but,it,looked,as,though,he,had,fallen,asleep,between,bites
it,was,no,good,arguing,arya,realized,gendry,had,the,right,of,it
the,mummers,will,need,to,sleep,too,she,told,herself,hoping,it,was,true
she,was,so,weary,it,was,a,struggle,even,to,get,down,from,the,saddle,but,she,remembered,to,hobble,her,horse,before,finding,a,place,beneath,a,beech,tree
the,ground,was,hard,and,damp
she,wondered,how,long,it,would,be,before,she,slept,in,a,bed,again,with,hot,food,and,a,fire,to,warm,her
the,last,thing,she,did,before,closing,her,eyes,was,unsheathe,her,sword,and,lay,it,down,beside,her
ser,gregor,she,whispered,yawning
dunsen,polliver,raff,the,sweetling
the,tickler,and
the,tickler
the,hound
her,dreams,were,red,and,savage
the,mummers,were,in,them,four,at,least,a,pale,lyseni,and,a,dark,brutal,axeman,from,ib,the,scarred,dothraki,horse,lord,called,iggo,and,a,dornishman,whose,name,she,never,knew
on,and,on,they,came,riding,through,the,rain,in,rusting,mail,and,wet,leather,swords,and,axe,clanking,against,their,saddles
they,thought,they,were,hunting,her,she,knew,with,all,the,strange,sharp,certainty,of,dreams,but,they,were,wrong
she,was,hunting,them
she,was,no,little,girl,in,the,dream,she,was,a,wolf,huge,and,powerful,and,when,she,emerged,from,beneath,the,trees,in,front,of,them,and,bared,her,teeth,in,a,low,rumbling,growl,she,could,smell,the,rank,stench,of,fear,from,horse,and,man,alike
the,lyseni’s,mount,reared,and,screamed,in,terror,and,the,others,shouted,at,one,another,in,mantalk,but,before,they,could,act,the,other,wolves,came,hurtling,from,the,darkness,and,the,rain,a,great,pack,of,them,gaunt,and,wet,and,silent
the,fight,was,short,but,bloody
the,hairy,man,went,down,as,he,unslung,his,axe,the,dark,one,died,stringing,an,arrow,and,the,pale,man,from,lys,tried,to,bolt
her,brothers,and,sisters,ran,him,down,turning,him,again,and,again,coming,at,him,from,all,sides,snapping,at,the,legs,of,his,horse,and,tearing,the,throat,from,the,rider,when,he,came,crashing,to,the,earth
only,the,belled,man,stood,his,ground
his,horse,kicked,in,the,head,of,one,of,her,sisters,and,he,cut,another,almost,in,half,with,his,curved,silvery,claw,as,his,hair,tinkled,softly
filled,with,rage,she,leapt,onto,his,back,knocking,him,head-first,from,his,saddle
her,jaws,locked,on,his,arm,as,they,fell,her,teeth,sinking,through,the,leather,and,wool,and,soft,flesh
when,they,landed,she,gave,a,savage,jerk,with,her,head,and,ripped,the,limb,loose,from,his,shoulder
exulting,she,shook,it,back,and,forth,in,her,mouth,scattering,the,warm,red,droplets,amidst,the,cold,black,rain
tyrion,he,woke,to,the,creak,of,old,iron,hinges
who
he,croaked
at,least,he,had,his,voice,back,raw,and,hoarse,though,it,was
the,fever,was,still,on,him,and,tyrion,had,no,notion,of,the,hour
how,long,had,he,slept,this,time
he,was,so,weak,so,damnably,weak
who
he,called,again,more,loudly
torchlight,spilled,through,the,open,door,but,within,the,chamber,the,only,light,came,from,the,stub,of,a,candle,beside,his,bed
when,he,saw,a,shape,moving,toward,him,tyrion,shivered
here,in,maegor’s,holdfast,every,servant,was,in,the,queen’s,pay,so,any,visitor,might,be,another,of,cersei’s,catspaws,sent,to,finish,the,work,ser,mandon,had,begun
then,the,man,stepped,into,the,candlelight,got,a,good,look,at,the,dwarf’s,pale,face,and,chortled
cut,yourself,shaving,did,you
tyrion’s,fingers,went,to,the,great,gash,that,ran,from,above,one,eye,down,to,his,jaw,across,what,remained,of,his,nose
the,proud,flesh,was,still,raw,and,warm,to,the,touch
with,a,fearful,big,razor,yes
bronn’s,coal-black,hair,was,freshly,washed,and,brushed,straight,back,from,the,hard,lines,of,his,face,and,he,was,dressed,in,high,boots,of,soft,tooled,leather,a,wide,belt,studded,with,nuggets,of,silver,and,a,cloak,of,pale,green,silk
across,the,dark,grey,wool,of,his,doublet,a,burning,chain,was,embroidered,diagonally,in,bright,green,thread

four,days,ago,more,like,the,sellsword,said,and,i’ve,been,here,twice,and,found,you,dead,to,the,world
not,dead
though,my,sweet,sister,did,try
perhaps,he,should,not,have,said,that,aloud,but,tyrion,was,past,caring
cersei,was,behind,ser,mandon’s,attempt,to,kill,him,he,knew,that,in,his,gut
what’s,that,ugly,thing,on,your,chest

who,else,was,lost
the,hound,said,bronn
not,dead,only,gone
the,gold,cloaks,say,he,turned,craven,and,you,led,a,sortie,in,his,place
not,one,of,my,better,notions

they,say,bywater,was,blistering,them,good,and,almost,had,’em,ready,to,turn,when,someone,put,an,arrow,through,his,neck
he,didn’t,seem,so,fearsome,then,so,they,dragged,him,off,his,horse,and,killed,him
another,debt,to,lay,at,cersei’s,door
my,nephew,he,said,joffrey

your,lord,father’s,given,them,to,one,of,his,westermen,some,knight,named,addam,marbrand
in,most,cases,the,gold,cloaks,would,have,resented,having,an,outsider,placed,over,them,but,ser,addam,marbrand,was,a,shrewd,choice

eight,nine,days,ago,after,the,whipping
tyrion,shoved,himself,up,higher,ignoring,the,sudden,stab,of,pain,through,his,shoulder
whipping
they,tied,her,to,a,post,in,the,yard,and,scourged,her,then,shoved,her,out,the,gate,naked,and,bloody
she,was,learning,to,read,tyrion,thought,absurdly
across,his,face,the,scar,stretched,tight,and,for,a,moment,it,felt,as,though,his,head,would,burst,with,rage
alayaya,was,a,whore,true,enough,but,a,sweeter,braver,more,innocent,girl,he,had,seldom,met
tyrion,had,never,touched,her,she,had,been,no,more,than,a,veil,to,hide,shae
in,his,carelessness,he,had,never,thought,what,the,role,might,cost,her

what,madness,possessed,you
the,foe,was,at,the,gates,with,a,battering,ram

but,without,proof,lord,tywin,would,never,listen,to,such,a,charge
why,are,you,here,in,the,city,father

and,the,sooner,the,better
until,lord,redwyne,brings,his,fleet,up,we,lack,the,ships,to,assail,dragonstone
it,makes,no,matter
stannis,baratheon’s,sun,set,on,the,blackwater
as,for,stark,the,boy,is,still,in,the,west,but,a,large,force,of,northmen,under,helman,tallhart,and,robett,glover,are,descending,toward,duskendale
i’ve,sent,lord,tarly,to,meet,them,while,ser,gregor,drives,up,the,kingsroad,to,cut,off,their,retreat

an,empty,title,so,long,as,roose,bolton,holds,the,castle,for,robb,stark,yet,lord,baelish,was,desirous,of,the,honor
he,did,us,good,service,in,the,matter,of,the,tyrell,marriage
a,lannister,pays,his,debts
the,tyrell,marriage,had,been,tyrion’s,notion,in,point,of,fact,but,it,would,seem,churlish,to,try,to,claim,that,now
that,title,may,not,be,as,empty,as,you,think,he,warned
littlefinger,does,nothing,without,good,reason
but,be,that,as,it,may
you,said,something,about,paying,debts,i,believe
and,you,want,your,own,reward,is,that,it
very,well
what,is,it,you,would,have,of,me

so,did,aerys,for,that,matter
you,did,as,you,were,commanded,and,i,am,sure,it,was,to,the,best,of,your,ability
no,one,denies,the,part,you,played
the,part,i,played
what,nostrils,tyrion,had,left,must,surely,have,flared

dying,would,be,easier,he,knew
all,he,had,to,do,was,crawl,inside,his,cave,and,let,the,ship,pass,by,and,death,would,find,him
for,days,now,the,fever,had,been,burning,through,him,turning,his,bowels,to,brown,water,and,making,him,shiver,in,his,restless,sleep
each,morning,found,him,weaker
it,will,not,be,much,longer,he,had,taken,to,telling,himself
if,the,fever,did,not,kill,him,thirst,surely,would
he,had,no,fresh,water,here,but,for,the,occasional,rainfall,that,pooled,in,hollows,on,the,rock
only,three,days,past,or,had,it,been,four
on,his,rock,it,was,hard,to,tell,the,days,apart,his,pools,had,been,dry,as,old,bone,and,the,sight,of,the,bay,rippling,green,and,grey,all,around,him,had,been,almost,more,than,he,could,bear
once,he,began,to,drink,seawater,the,end,would,come,swiftly,he,knew,but,all,the,same,he,had,almost,taken,that,first,swallow,so,parched,was,his,throat
a,sudden,squall,had,saved,him
he,had,grown,so,feeble,by,then,that,it,was,all,he,could,do,to,lie,in,the,rain,with,his,eyes,closed,and,his,mouth,open,and,let,the,water,splash,down,on,his,cracked,lips,and,swollen,tongue
but,afterward,he,felt,a,little,stronger,and,the,island’s,pools,and,cracks,and,crevices,once,more,had,brimmed,with,life
but,that,had,been,three,days,ago,or,maybe,four,and,most,of,the,water,was,gone,now
some,had,evaporated,and,he,had,sucked,up,the,rest
by,the,morrow,he,would,be,tasting,the,mud,again,and,licking,the,damp,cold,stones,at,the,bottom,of,the,depressions
and,if,not,thirst,or,fever,starvation,would,kill,him
his,island,was,no,more,than,a,barren,spire,jutting,up,out,of,the,immensity,of,blackwater,bay
when,the,tide,was,low,he,could,sometimes,find,tiny,crabs,along,the,stony,strand,where,he,had,washed,ashore,after,the,battle
they,nipped,his,fingers,painfully,before,he,smashed,them,apart,on,the,rocks,to,suck,the,meat,from,their,claws,and,the,guts,from,their,shells
but,the,strand,vanished,whenever,the,tide,came,rushing,in,and,davos,had,to,scramble,up,the,rock,to,keep,from,being,swept,out,into,the,bay,once,more
the,point,of,the,spire,was,fifteen,feet,above,the,water,at,high,tide,but,when,the,bay,grew,rough,the,spray,went,even,higher,so,there,was,no,way,to,keep,dry,even,in,his,cave,which,was,really,no,more,than,a,hollow,in,the,rock,beneath,an,overhang
nothing,grew,on,the,rock,but,lichen,and,even,the,seabirds,shunned,the,place
now,and,again,some,gulls,would,land,atop,the,spire,and,davos,would,try,to,catch,one,but,they,were,too,quick,for,him,to,get,close
he,took,to,flinging,stones,at,them,but,he,was,too,weak,to,throw,with,much,force,so,even,when,his,stones,hit,the,gulls,would,only,scream,at,him,in,annoyance,and,then,take,to,the,air
there,were,other,rocks,visible,from,his,refuge,distant,stony,spires,taller,than,his,own
the,nearest,stood,a,good,forty,feet,above,the,water,he,guessed,though,it,was,hard,to,be,sure,at,this,distance
a,cloud,of,gulls,swirled,about,it,constantly,and,often,davos,thought,of,crossing,over,to,raid,their,nests
but,the,water,was,cold,here,the,currents,strong,and,treacherous,and,he,knew,he,did,not,have,the,strength,for,such,a,swim
that,would,kill,him,as,sure,as,drinking,seawater
autumn,in,the,narrow,sea,could,often,be,wet,and,rainy,he,remembered,from,years,past
the,days,were,not,bad,so,long,as,the,sun,was,shining,but,the,nights,were,growing,colder,and,sometimes,the,wind,would,come,gusting,across,the,bay,driving,a,line,of,whitecaps,before,it,and,before,long,davos,would,be,soaked,and,shivering
fever,and,chills,assaulted,him,in,turn,and,of,late,he,had,developed,a,persistent,racking,cough
his,cave,was,all,the,shelter,he,had,and,that,was,little,enough
driftwood,and,bits,of,charred,debris,would,wash,up,on,the,strand,during,low,tide,but,he,had,no,way,to,strike,a,spark,or,start,a,fire
once,in,desperation,he,had,tried,rubbing,two,pieces,of,driftwood,against,each,other,but,the,wood,was,rotted,and,his,efforts,earned,him,only,blisters
his,clothes,were,sodden,as,well,and,he,had,lost,one,of,his,boots,somewhere,in,the,bay,before,he,washed,up,here
thirst,hunger,exposure
they,were,his,companions,with,him,every,hour,of,every,day,and,in,time,he,had,come,to,think,of,them,as,his,friends
soon,enough,one,or,the,other,of,his,friends,would,take,pity,on,him,and,free,him,from,this,endless,misery
or,perhaps,he,would,simply,walk,into,the,water,one,day,and,strike,out,for,the,shore,that,he,knew,lay,somewhere,to,the,north,beyond,his,sight
it,was,too,far,to,swim,as,weak,as,he,was,but,that,did,not,matter
davos,had,always,been,a,sailor,he,was,meant,to,die,at,sea
the,gods,beneath,the,waters,have,been,waiting,for,me,he,told,himself
it’s,past,time,i,went,to,them
but,now,there,was,a,sail,only,a,speck,on,the,horizon,but,growing,larger
a,ship,where,no,ship,should,be
he,knew,where,his,rock,lay,more,or,less,it,was,one,of,a,series,of,sea,monts,that,rose,from,the,floor,of,blackwater,bay
the,tallest,of,them,jutted,a,hundred,feet,above,the,tide,and,a,dozen,lesser,monts,stood,thirty,to,sixty,feet,high
sailors,called,them,spears,of,the,merling,king,and,knew,that,for,every,one,that,broke,the,surface,a,dozen,lurked,treacherously,just,below,it
any,captain,with,sense,kept,his,course,well,away,from,them
davos,watched,the,sail,swell,through,pale,red-rimmed,eyes,and,tried,to,hear,the,sound,of,the,wind,caught,in,the,canvas
she,is,coming,this,way
unless,she,changed,course,soon,she,would,pass,within,hailing,distance,of,his,meager,refuge
it,might,mean,life
if,he,wanted,it
he,was,not,sure,he,did
why,should,i,live
he,thought,as,tears,blurred,his,vision

my,sons,are,dead,dale,and,allard,maric,and,matthos,perhaps,devan,as,well
how,can,a,father,outlive,so,many,strong,young,sons

they,had,sailed,up,the,blackwater,rush,flying,the,fiery,heart,of,the,lord,of,light
davos,and,black,betha,had,been,in,the,second,line,of,battle,between,dale’s,wraith,and,allard,on,lady,marya
maric,his,thirdborn,was,oarmaster,on,fury,at,the,center,of,the,first,line,while,matthos,served,as,his,father’s,second
beneath,the,walls,of,the,red,keep,stannis,baratheon’s,galleys,had,joined,in,battle,with,the,boy,king,joffrey’s,smaller,fleet,and,for,a,few,moments,the,river,had,rung,to,the,thrum,of,bowstrings,and,the,crash,of,iron,rams,shattering,oars,and,hulls,alike
and,then,some,vast,beast,had,let,out,a,roar,and,green,flames,were,all,around,them,wildfire,pyromancer’s,piss,the,jade,demon
matthos,had,been,standing,at,his,elbow,on,the,deck,of,black,betha,when,the,ship,seemed,to,lift,from,the,water
davos,found,himself,in,the,river,flailing,as,the,current,took,him,and,spun,him,around,and,around
upstream,the,flames,had,ripped,at,the,sky,fifty,feet,high
he,had,seen,black,betha,afire,and,fury,and,a,dozen,other,ships,had,seen,burning,men,leaping,into,the,water,to,drown
wraith,and,lady,marya,were,gone,sunk,or,shattered,or,vanished,behind,a,veil,of,wildfire,and,there,was,no,time,to,look,for,them,because,the,mouth,of,the,river,was,almost,upon,him,and,across,the,mouth,of,the,river,the,lannisters,had,raised,a,great,iron,chain
from,bank,to,bank,there,was,nothing,but,burning,ships,and,wildfire
the,sight,of,it,seemed,to,stop,his,heart,for,a,moment,and,he,could,still,remember,the,sound,of,it,the,crackle,of,flames,the,hiss,of,steam,the,shrieks,of,dying,men,and,the,beat,of,that,terrible,heat,against,his,face,as,the,current,swept,him,down,toward,hell
all,he,needed,to,do,was,nothing
a,few,moments,more,and,he,would,be,with,his,sons,now,resting,in,the,cool,green,mud,on,the,bottom,of,the,bay,with,fish,nibbling,at,his,face
instead,he,sucked,in,a,great,gulp,of,air,and,dove,kicking,for,the,bottom,of,the,river
his,only,hope,was,to,pass,under,the,chain,and,the,burning,ships,and,the,wildfire,that,floated,on,the,surface,of,the,water,to,swim,hard,for,the,safety,of,the,bay,beyond
davos,had,always,been,a,strong,swimmer,and,he’d,worn,no,steel,that,day,but,for,the,helm,he’d,lost,when,he’d,lost,black,betha
as,he,knifed,through,the,green,murk,he,saw,other,men,struggling,beneath,the,water,pulled,down,to,drown,beneath,the,weight,of,plate,and,mail
davos,swam,past,them,kicking,with,all,the,strength,left,in,his,legs,giving,himself,up,to,the,current,the,water,filling,his,eyes
deeper,he,went,and,deeper,and,deeper,still
with,every,stroke,it,grew,harder,to,hold,his,breath
he,remembered,seeing,the,bottom,soft,and,dim,as,a,stream,of,bubbles,burst,from,his,lips
something,touched,his,leg
a,snag,or,a,fish,or,a,drowning,man,he,could,not,tell
he,needed,air,by,then,but,he,was,afraid
was,he,past,the,chain,yet,was,he,out,in,the,bay
if,he,came,up,under,a,ship,he,would,drown,and,if,he,surfaced,amidst,the,floating,patches,of,wildfire,his,first,breath,would,sear,his,lungs,to,ash
he,twisted,in,the,water,to,look,up,but,there,was,nothing,to,see,but,green,darkness,and,then,he,spun,too,far,and,suddenly,he,could,no,longer,tell,up,from,down
panic,took,hold,of,him
his,hands,flailed,against,the,bottom,of,the,river,and,sent,up,a,cloud,of,mud,that,blinded,him
his,chest,was,growing,tighter,by,the,instant
he,clawed,at,the,water,kicking,pushing,himself,turning,his,lungs,screaming,for,air,kicking,kicking,lost,now,in,the,river,murk,kicking,kicking,kicking,until,he,could,kick,no,longer
when,he,opened,his,mouth,to,scream,the,water,came,rushing,in,tasting,of,salt,and,davos,seaworth,knew,that,he,was,drowning
the,next,he,knew,the,sun,was,up,and,he,lay,upon,a,stony,strand,beneath,a,spire,of,naked,stone,with,the,empty,bay,all,around,and,a,broken,mast,a,burned,sail,and,a,swollen,corpse,beside,him
the,mast,the,sail,and,the,dead,man,vanished,with,the,next,high,tide,leaving,davos,alone,on,his,rock,amidst,the,spears,of,the,merling,king
his,long,years,as,a,smuggler,had,made,the,waters,around,king’s,landing,more,familiar,to,him,than,any,home,he’d,ever,had,and,he,knew,his,refuge,was,no,more,than,a,speck,on,the,charts,in,a,place,that,honest,sailors,steered,away,from,not,toward
though,davos,himself,had,come,by,it,once,or,twice,in,his,smuggling,days,the,better,to,stay,unseen
when,they,find,me,dead,here,if,ever,they,do,perhaps,they,will,name,the,rock,for,me,he,thought
onion,rock,they’ll,call,it,it,will,be,my,tombstone,and,my,legacy
he,deserved,no,more
the,father,protects,his,children,the,septons,taught,but,davos,had,led,his,boys,into,the,fire
dale,would,never,give,his,wife,the,child,they,had,prayed,for,and,allard,with,his,girl,in,oldtown,and,his,girl,in,king’s,landing,and,his,girl,in,braavos,they,would,all,be,weeping,soon
matthos,would,never,captain,his,own,ship,as,he’d,dreamed
maric,would,never,have,his,knighthood
how,can,i,live,when,they,are,dead
so,many,brave,knights,and,mighty,lords,have,died,better,men,than,me,and,highborn
crawl,inside,your,cave,davos
crawl,inside,and,shrink,up,small,and,the,ship,will,go,away,and,no,one,will,trouble,you,ever,again

the,sail,was,almost,on,him
a,few,moments,more,and,the,ship,would,be,safely,past,and,he,could,die,in,peace
his,hand,reached,for,his,throat,fumbling,for,the,small,leather,pouch,he,always,wore,about,his,neck
inside,he,kept,the,bones,of,the,four,fingers,his,king,had,shortened,for,him,on,the,day,he,made,davos,a,knight
my,luck
his,shortened,fingers,patted,at,his,chest,groping,finding,nothing

to,remind,me,of,my,king’s,justice,he,whispered,through,cracked,lips

the,fire,took,my,luck,as,well,as,my,sons

the,fire
perhaps,it,was,only,wind,blowing,against,the,rock,or,the,sound,of,the,sea,on,the,shore,but,for,an,instant,davos,seaworth,heard,her,answer
you,called,the,fire,she,whispered,her,voice,as,faint,as,the,sound,of,waves,in,a,seashell,sad,and,soft
you,burned,us

she,had,come,from,asshai,in,the,east,she,had,come,to,dragonstone,and,won,selyse,and,her,queen’s,men,for,her,alien,god,and,then,the,king,stannis,baratheon,himself

at,melisandre’s,urging,he,had,dragged,the,seven,from,their,sept,at,dragonstone,and,burned,them,before,the,castle,gates,and,later,he,had,burned,the,godswood,at,storm’s,end,as,well,even,the,heart,tree,a,huge,white,weirwood,with,a,solemn,face
it,was,her,work,davos,said,again,more,weakly

the,sail,was,a,hundred,yards,away,and,moving,fast,across,the,bay
in,a,few,more,moments,it,would,be,past,him,and,dwindling

for,a,little,while,more,at,least
there,was,something,he,had,to,do

a,short,while,later,the,galley’s,sail,came,down,her,oars,slid,out,and,she,swept,around,toward,his,refuge
she,was,too,big,to,approach,the,rock,closely,but,thirty,yards,away,she,launched,a,small,boat

she’s,to,be,queen,now,she’s,beautiful,and,rich,and,everyone,loves,her,why,would,she,want,to,sup,with,a,traitor’s,daughter
it,could,be,curiosity,she,supposed,perhaps,margaery,tyrell,wanted,to,get,the,measure,of,the,rival,she’d,displaced

sansa,had,watched,from,the,castle,walls,as,margaery,tyrell,and,her,escort,made,their,way,up,aegon’s,high,hill
joffrey,had,met,his,new,bride-to-be,at,the,king’s,gate,to,welcome,her,to,the,city,and,they,rode,side,by,side,through,cheering,crowds,joff,glittering,in,gilded,armor,and,the,tyrell,girl,splendid,in,green,with,a,cloak,of,autumn,flowers,blowing,from,her,shoulders
she,was,sixteen,brown-haired,and,brown-eyed,slender,and,beautiful
the,people,called,out,her,name,as,she,passed,held,up,their,children,for,her,blessing,and,scattered,flowers,under,the,hooves,of,her,horse
her,mother,and,grandmother,followed,close,behind,riding,in,a,tall,wheelhouse,whose,sides,were,carved,into,the,shape,of,a,hundred,twining,roses,every,one,gilded,and,shining
the,smallfolk,cheered,them,as,well
the,same,smallfolk,who,pulled,me,from,my,horse,and,would,have,killed,me,if,not,for,the,hound
sansa,had,done,nothing,to,make,the,commons,hate,her,no,more,than,margaery,tyrell,had,done,to,win,their,love
does,she,want,me,to,love,her,too
she,studied,the,invitation,which,looked,to,be,written,in,margaery’s,own,hand
does,she,want,my,blessing
sansa,wondered,if,joffrey,knew,of,this,supper
for,all,she,knew,it,might,be,his,doing
that,thought,made,her,fearful
if,joff,was,behind,the,invitation,he,would,have,some,cruel,jape,planned,to,shame,her,in,the,older,girl’s,eyes
would,he,command,his,kingsguard,to,strip,her,naked,once,again
the,last,time,he,had,done,that,his,uncle,tyrion,had,stopped,him,but,the,imp,could,not,save,her,now
no,one,can,save,me,but,my,florian
ser,dontos,had,promised,he,would,help,her,escape,but,not,until,the,night,of,joffrey’s,wedding
the,plans,had,been,well,laid,her,dear,devoted,knight-turned-fool,assured,her,there,was,nothing,to,do,until,then,but,endure,and,count,the,days
and,sup,with,my,replacement
perhaps,she,was,doing,margaery,tyrell,an,injustice
perhaps,the,invitation,was,no,more,than,a,simple,kindness,an,act,of,courtesy
it,might,be,just,a,supper
but,this,was,the,red,keep,this,was,king’s,landing,this,was,the,court,of,king,joffrey,baratheon,the,first,of,his,name,and,if,there,was,one,thing,that,sansa,stark,had,learned,here,it,was,mistrust
even,so,she,must,accept
she,was,nothing,now,the,discarded,daughter,of,a,traitor,and,disgraced,sister,of,a,rebel,lord
she,could,scarcely,refuse,joffrey’s,queen-to-be
i,wish,the,hound,were,here
the,night,of,the,battle,sandor,clegane,had,come,to,her,chambers,to,take,her,from,the,city,but,sansa,had,refused
sometimes,she,lay,awake,at,night,wondering,if,she’d,been,wise
she,had,his,stained,white,cloak,hidden,in,a,cedar,chest,beneath,her,summer,silks
she,could,not,say,why,she’d,kept,it
the,hound,had,turned,craven,she,heard,it,said,at,the,height,of,the,battle,he,got,so,drunk,the,imp,had,to,take,his,men
but,sansa,understood
she,knew,the,secret,of,his,burned,face
it,was,only,the,fire,he,feared
that,night,the,wildfire,had,set,the,river,itself,ablaze,and,filled,the,very,air,with,green,flame
even,in,the,castle,sansa,had,been,afraid
outside
she,could,scarcely,imagine,it
sighing,she,got,out,quill,and,ink,and,wrote,margaery,tyrell,a,gracious,note,of,acceptance
when,the,appointed,night,arrived,another,of,the,kingsguard,came,for,her,a,man,as,different,from,sandor,clegane,as
well,as,a,flower,from,a,dog
the,sight,of,ser,loras,tyrell,standing,on,her,threshold,made,sansa’s,heart,beat,a,little,faster
this,was,the,first,time,she,had,been,so,close,to,him,since,he,had,returned,to,king’s,landing,leading,the,vanguard,of,his,father’s,host
for,a,moment,she,did,not,know,what,to,say
ser,loras,she,finally,managed,you
you,look,so,lovely
he,gave,her,a,puzzled,smile
my,lady,is,too,kind
and,beautiful,besides
my,sister,awaits,you,eagerly
i,have,so,looked,forward,to,our,supper
as,has,margaery,and,my,lady,grandmother,as,well
he,took,her,arm,and,led,her,toward,the,steps
your,grandmother
sansa,was,finding,it,hard,to,walk,and,talk,and,think,all,at,the,same,time,with,ser,loras,touching,her,arm
she,could,feel,the,warmth,of,his,hand,through,the,silk
lady,olenna
she,is,to,sup,with,you,as,well
oh,said,sansa
i,am,talking,to,him,and,he’s,touching,me,he’s,holding,my,arm,and,touching,me
the,queen,of,thorns,she’s,called
isn’t,that,right
it,is
ser,loras,laughed
he,has,the,warmest,laugh,she,thought,as,he,went,on,you’d,best,not,use,that,name,in,her,presence,though,or,you’re,like,to,get,pricked
sansa,reddened
any,fool,would,have,realized,that,no,woman,would,be,happy,about,being,called,the,queen,of,thorns
maybe,i,truly,am,as,stupid,as,cersei,lannister,says
desperately,she,tried,to,think,of,something,clever,and,charming,to,say,to,him,but,her,wits,had,deserted,her
she,almost,told,him,how,beautiful,he,was,until,she,remembered,that,she’d,already,done,that
he,was,beautiful,though
he,seemed,taller,than,he’d,been,when,she’d,first,met,him,but,still,so,lithe,and,graceful,and,sansa,had,never,seen,another,boy,with,such,wonderful,eyes
he’s,no,boy,though,he’s,a,man,grown,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard
she,thought,he,looked,even,finer,in,white,than,in,the,greens,and,golds,of,house,tyrell
the,only,spot,of,color,on,him,now,was,the,brooch,that,clasped,his,cloak,the,rose,of,highgarden,wrought,in,soft,yellow,gold,nestled,in,a,bed,of,delicate,green,jade,leaves
ser,balon,swann,held,the,door,of,maegor’s,for,them,to,pass
he,was,all,in,white,as,well,though,he,did,not,wear,it,half,so,well,as,ser,loras
beyond,the,spiked,moat,two,dozen,men,were,taking,their,practice,with,sword,and,shield
with,the,castle,so,crowded,the,outer,ward,had,been,given,over,to,guests,to,raise,their,tents,and,pavilions,leaving,only,the,smaller,inner,yards,for,training
one,of,the,redwyne,twins,was,being,driven,backward,by,ser,tallad,with,the,eyes,on,his,shield
chunky,ser,kennos,of,kayce,who,chuffed,and,puffed,every,time,he,raised,his,longsword,seemed,to,be,holding,his,own,against,osney,kettleblack,but,osney’s,brother,ser,osfryd,was,savagely,punishing,the,frog-faced,squire,morros,slynt
blunted,swords,or,no,slynt,would,have,a,rich,crop,of,bruises,by,the,morrow
it,made,sansa,wince,just,to,watch
they,have,scarcely,finished,burying,the,dead,from,the,last,battle,and,already,they,are,practicing,for,the,next,one
on,the,edge,of,the,yard,a,lone,knight,with,a,pair,of,golden,roses,on,his,shield,was,holding,off,three,foes

to,be,sure

some,power,qhorin,had,named,it,to,the,old,bear,but,he,had,died,before,learning,what,it,was,or,whether,mance,rayder,had,found,it,with,his,digging
there,were,cookfires,all,along,the,river,amongst,wayns,and,carts,and,sleds
many,of,the,wildlings,had,thrown,up,tents,of,hide,and,skin,and,felted,wool
others,sheltered,behind,rocks,in,crude,lean-tos,or,slept,beneath,their,wagons
at,one,fire,jon,saw,a,man,hardening,the,points,of,long,wooden,spears,and,tossing,them,in,a,pile

jon,had,never,seen,so,many,wildlings
he,wondered,if,anyone,ever,had
the,camp,goes,on,forever,he,reflected,but,it’s,more,a,hundred,camps,than,one,and,each,more,vulnerable,than,the,last
stretched,out,over,long,leagues,the,wildlings,had,no,defenses,to,speak,of,no,pits,nor,sharpened,stakes,only,small,groups,of,outriders,patrolling,their,perimeters

there,was,no,doubting,which,tent,was,the,king’s
it,was,thrice,the,size,of,the,next,largest,he’d,seen,and,he,could,hear,music,drifting,from,within
like,many,of,the,lesser,tents,it,was,made,of,sewn,hides,with,the,fur,still,on,but,mance,rayder’s,hides,were,the,shaggy,white,pelts,of,snow,bears
the,peaked,roof,was,crowned,with,a,huge,set,of,antlers,from,one,of,the,giant,elks,that,had,once,roamed,freely,throughout,the,seven,kingdoms,in,the,times,of,the,first,men
here,at,least,they,found,defenders,two,guards,at,the,flap,of,the,tent,leaning,on,tall,spears,with,round,leather,shields,strapped,to,their,arms
when,they,caught,sight,of,ghost,one,of,them,lowered,his,spearpoint,and,said,that,beast,stays,here

jon,felt,utterly,alone,as,he,stood,there,in,his,blacks,awaiting,the,pleasure,of,the,turncloak,who,called,himself,king-beyond-the-wall
when,his,eyes,had,adjusted,to,the,smoky,red,gloom,he,saw,six,people,none,of,whom,paid,him,any,mind
a,dark,young,man,and,a,pretty,blonde,woman,were,sharing,a,horn,of,mead
a,pregnant,woman,stood,over,a,brazier,cooking,a,brace,of,hens,while,a,grey-haired,man,in,a,tattered,cloak,of,black,and,red,sat,crosslegged,on,a,pillow,playing,a,lute,and,singing,the,dornishman’s,wife,was,as,fair,as,the,sun,and,her,kisses,were,warmer,than,spring
but,the,dornishman’s,blade,was,made,of,black,steel,and,its,kiss,was,a,terrible,thing
jon,knew,the,song,though,it,was,strange,to,hear,it,here,in,a,shaggy,hide,tent,beyond,the,wall,ten,thousand,leagues,from,the,red,mountains,and,warm,winds,of,dorne
rattleshirt,took,off,his,yellowed,helm,as,he,waited,for,the,song,to,end
beneath,his,bone-and-leather,armor,he,was,a,small,man,and,the,face,under,the,giant’s,skull,was,ordinary,with,a,knobby,chin,thin,mustache,and,sallow,pinched,cheeks
his,eyes,were,close-set,one,eyebrow,creeping,all,the,way,across,his,forehead,dark,hair,thinning,back,from,a,sharp,widow’s,peak
the,dornishman’s,wife,would,sing,as,she,bathed,in,a,voice,that,was,sweet,as,a,peach,but,the,dornishman’s,blade,had,a,song,of,its,own,and,a,bite,sharp,and,cold,as,a,leech
beside,the,brazier,a,short,but,immensely,broad,man,sat,on,a,stool,eating,a,hen,off,a,skewer
hot,grease,was,running,down,his,chin,and,into,his,snow-white,beard,but,he,smiled,happily,all,the,same
thick,gold,bands,graven,with,runes,bound,his,massive,arms,and,he,wore,a,heavy,shirt,of,black,ringmail,that,could,only,have,come,from,a,dead,ranger
a,few,feet,away,a,taller,leaner,man,in,a,leather,shirt,sewn,with,bronze,scales,stood,frowning,over,a,map,a,two-handed,greatsword,slung,across,his,back,in,a,leather,sheath
he,was,straight,as,a,spear,all,long,wiry,muscle,clean-shaved,bald,with,a,strong,straight,nose,and,deepset,grey,eyes
he,might,even,have,been,comely,if,he’d,had,ears,but,he,had,lost,both,along,the,way,whether,to,frostbite,or,some,enemy’s,knife,jon,could,not,tell
their,lack,made,the,man’s,head,seem,narrow,and,pointed
both,the,white-bearded,man,and,the,bald,one,were,warriors,that,was,plain,to,jon,at,a,glance
these,two,are,more,dangerous,than,rattleshirt,by,far

when,your,father,learned,the,king,was,coming,he,sent,word,to,his,brother,benjen,on,the,wall,so,he,might,come,down,for,the,feast
there,is,more,commerce,between,the,black,brothers,and,the,free,folk,than,you,know,and,soon,enough,word,came,to,my,ears,as,well
it,was,too,choice,a,chance,to,resist
your,uncle,did,not,know,me,by,sight,so,i,had,no,fear,from,that,quarter,and,i,did,not,think,your,father,was,like,to,remember,a,young,crow,he’d,met,briefly,years,before

i,took,a,lute,and,a,bag,of,silver,scaled,the,ice,near,long,barrow,walked,a,few,leagues,south,of,the,new,gift,and,bought,a,horse
all,in,all,i,made,much,better,time,than,robert,who,was,traveling,with,a,ponderous,great,wheelhouse,to,keep,his,queen,in,comfort

it,was,the,greatest,treasure,she,had,and,her,gift,to,me

daenerys,across,the,still,blue,water,came,the,slow,steady,beat,of,drums,and,the,soft,swish,of,oars,from,the,galleys
the,great,cog,groaned,in,their,wake,the,heavy,lines,stretched,taut,between
balerion’s,sails,hung,limp,drooping,forlorn,from,the,masts
yet,even,so,as,she,stood,upon,the,forecastle,watching,her,dragons,chase,each,other,across,a,cloudless,blue,sky,daenerys,targaryen,was,as,happy,as,she,could,ever,remember,being
her,dothraki,called,the,sea,the,poison,water,distrusting,any,liquid,that,their,horses,could,not,drink
on,the,day,the,three,ships,had,lifted,anchor,at,qarth,you,would,have,thought,they,were,sailing,to,hell,instead,of,pentos
her,brave,young,bloodriders,had,stared,off,at,the,dwindling,coastline,with,huge,white,eyes,each,of,the,three,determined,to,show,no,fear,before,the,other,two,while,her,handmaids,irri,and,jhiqui,clutched,the,rail,desperately,and,retched,over,the,side,at,every,little,swell
the,rest,of,dany’s,tiny,khalasar,remained,below,decks,preferring,the,company,of,their,nervous,horses,to,the,terrifying,landless,world,about,the,ships
when,a,sudden,squall,had,enveloped,them,six,days,into,the,voyage,she,heard,them,through,the,hatches,the,horses,kicking,and,screaming,the,riders,praying,in,thin,quavery,voices,each,time,balerion,heaved,or,swayed
no,squall,could,frighten,dany,though
daenerys,stormborn,she,was,called,for,she,had,come,howling,into,the,world,on,distant,dragonstone,as,the,greatest,storm,in,the,memory,of,westeros,howled,outside,a,storm,so,fierce,that,it,ripped,gargoyles,from,the,castle,walls,and,smashed,her,father’s,fleet,to,kindling
the,narrow,sea,was,often,stormy,and,dany,had,crossed,it,half,a,hundred,times,as,a,girl,running,from,one,free,city,to,the,next,half,a,step,ahead,of,the,usurper’s,hired,knives
she,loved,the,sea
she,liked,the,sharp,salty,smell,of,the,air,and,the,vastness,of,horizons,bounded,only,by,a,vault,of,azure,sky,above
it,made,her,feel,small,but,free,as,well
she,liked,the,dolphins,that,sometimes,swam,along,beside,balerion,slicing,through,the,waves,like,silvery,spears,and,the,flying,fish,they,glimpsed,now,and,again
she,even,liked,the,sailors,with,all,their,songs,and,stories
once,on,a,voyage,to,braavos,as,she’d,watched,the,crew,wrestle,down,a,great,green,sail,in,a,rising,gale,she,had,even,thought,how,fine,it,would,be,to,be,a,sailor
but,when,she,told,her,brother,viserys,had,twisted,her,hair,until,she,cried
you,are,blood,of,the,dragon,he,had,screamed,at,her
a,dragon,not,some,smelly,fish
he,was,a,fool,about,that,and,so,much,else,dany,thought
if,he,had,been,wiser,and,more,patient,it,would,be,him,sailing,west,to,take,the,throne,that,was,his,by,rights
viserys,had,been,stupid,and,vicious,she,had,come,to,realize,yet,sometimes,she,missed,him,all,the,same
not,the,cruel,weak,man,he,had,become,by,the,end,but,the,brother,who,had,sometimes,let,her,creep,into,his,bed,the,boy,who,told,her,tales,of,the,seven,kingdoms,and,talked,of,how,much,better,their,lives,would,be,once,he,claimed,his,crown
the,captain,appeared,at,her,elbow
would,that,this,balerion,could,soar,as,her,namesake,did,your,grace,he,said,in,bastard,valyrian,heavily,flavored,with,accents,of,pentos
then,we,should,not,need,to,row,nor,tow,nor,pray,for,wind
just,so,captain,she,answered,with,a,smile,pleased,to,have,won,the,man,over
captain,groleo,was,an,old,pentoshi,like,his,master,illyrio,mopatis,and,he,had,been,nervous,as,a,maiden,about,carrying,three,dragons,on,his,ship
half,a,hundred,buckets,of,seawater,still,hung,from,the,gunwales,in,case,of,fires
at,first,groleo,had,wanted,the,dragons,caged,and,dany,had,consented,to,put,his,fears,at,ease,but,their,misery,was,so,palpable,that,she,soon,changed,her,mind,and,insisted,they,be,freed
even,captain,groleo,was,glad,of,that,now
there,had,been,one,small,fire,easily,extinguished,against,that,balerion,suddenly,seemed,to,have,far,fewer,rats,than,she’d,had,before,when,she,sailed,under,the,name,saduleon
and,her,crew,once,as,fearful,as,they,were,curious,had,begun,to,take,a,queer,fierce,pride,in,their,dragons
every,man,of,them,from,captain,to,cook’s,boy,loved,to,watch,the,three,fly
though,none,so,much,as,dany
they,are,my,children,she,told,herself,and,if,the,maegi,spoke,truly,they,are,the,only,children,i,am,ever,like,to,have
viserion’s,scales,were,the,color,of,fresh,cream,his,horns,wing,bones,and,spinal,crest,a,dark,gold,that,flashed,bright,as,metal,in,the,sun
rhaegal,was,made,of,the,green,of,summer,and,the,bronze,of,fall
they,soared,above,the,ships,in,wide,circles,higher,and,higher,each,trying,to,climb,above,the,other
dragons,always,preferred,to,attack,from,above,dany,had,learned
should,either,get,between,the,other,and,the,sun,he,would,fold,his,wings,and,dive,screaming,and,they,would,tumble,from,the,sky,locked,together,in,a,tangled,scaly,ball,jaws,snapping,and,tails,lashing
the,first,time,they,had,done,it,she,feared,that,they,meant,to,kill,each,other,but,it,was,only,sport
no,sooner,would,they,splash,into,the,sea,than,they,would,break,apart,and,rise,again,shrieking,and,hissing,the,salt,water,steaming,off,them,as,their,wings,clawed,at,the,air
drogon,was,aloft,as,well,though,not,in,sight,he,would,be,miles,ahead,or,miles,behind,hunting
he,was,always,hungry,her,drogon
hungry,and,growing,fast
another,year,or,perhaps,two,and,he,may,be,large,enough,to,ride
then,i,shall,have,no,need,of,ships,to,cross,the,great,salt,sea
but,that,time,was,not,yet,come
rhaegal,and,viserion,were,the,size,of,small,dogs,drogon,only,a,little,larger,and,any,dog,would,have,outweighed,them,they,were,all,wings,and,neck,and,tail,lighter,than,they,looked
and,so,daenerys,targaryen,must,rely,on,wood,and,wind,and,canvas,to,bear,her,home
the,wood,and,the,canvas,had,served,her,well,enough,so,far,but,the,fickle,wind,had,turned,traitor
for,six,days,and,six,nights,they,had,been,becalmed,and,now,a,seventh,day,had,come,and,still,no,breath,of,air,to,fill,their,sails
fortunately,two,of,the,ships,that,magister,illyrio,had,sent,after,her,were,trading,galleys,with,two,hundred,oars,apiece,and,crews,of,strong-armed,oarsmen,to,row,them
but,the,great,cog,balerion,was,a,song,of,a,different,key,a,ponderous,broad-beamed,sow,of,a,ship,with,immense,holds,and,huge,sails,but,helpless,in,a,calm
vhagar,and,meraxes,had,let,out,lines,to,tow,her,but,it,made,for,painfully,slow,going
all,three,ships,were,crowded,and,heavily,laden
i,cannot,see,drogon,said,ser,jorah,mormont,as,he,joined,her,on,the,forecastle
is,he,lost,again
we,are,the,ones,who,are,lost,ser
drogon,has,no,taste,for,this,wet,creeping,no,more,than,i,do
bolder,than,the,other,two,her,black,dragon,had,been,the,first,to,try,his,wings,above,the,water,the,first,to,flutter,from,ship,to,ship,the,first,to,lose,himself,in,a,passing,cloud
and,the,first,to,kill
the,flying,fish,no,sooner,broke,the,surface,of,the,water,than,they,were,enveloped,in,a,lance,of,flame,snatched,up,and,swallowed
how,big,will,he,grow
dany,asked,curiously
do,you,know
in,the,seven,kingdoms,there,are,tales,of,dragons,who,grew,so,huge,that,they,could,pluck,giant,krakens,from,the,seas
dany,laughed
that,would,be,a,wondrous,sight,to,see
it,is,only,a,tale,khaleesi,said,her,exile,knight
they,talk,of,wise,old,dragons,living,a,thousand,years,as,well
well,how,long,does,a,dragon,live
she,looked,up,as,viserion,swooped,low,over,the,ship,his,wings,beating,slowly,and,stirring,the,limp,sails
ser,jorah,shrugged
a,dragon’s,natural,span,of,days,is,many,times,as,long,as,a,man’s,or,so,the,songs,would,have,us,believe
but,the,dragons,the,seven,kingdoms,knew,best,were,those,of,house,targaryen
they,were,bred,for,war,and,in,war,they,died
it,is,no,easy,thing,to,slay,a,dragon,but,it,can,be,done
the,squire,whitebeard,standing,by,the,figurehead,with,one,lean,hand,curled,about,his,tall,hardwood,staff,turned,toward,them,and,said,balerion,the,black,dread,was,two,hundred,years,old,when,he,died,during,the,reign,of,jaehaerys,the,conciliator
he,was,so,large,he,could,swallow,an,aurochs,whole
a,dragon,never,stops,growing,your,grace,so,long,as,he,has,food,and,freedom
his,name,was,arstan,but,strong,belwas,had,named,him,whitebeard,for,his,pale,whiskers,and,most,everyone,called,him,that,now
he,was,taller,than,ser,jorah,though,not,so,muscular,his,eyes,were,a,pale,blue,his,long,beard,as,white,as,snow,and,as,flne,as,silk
freedom
asked,dany,curious
what,do,you,mean
in,king’s,landing,your,ancestors,raised,an,immense,domed,castle,for,their,dragons
the,dragonpit,it,is,called
it,still,stands,atop,the,hill,of,rhaenys,though,all,in,ruins,now
that,was,where,the,royal,dragons,dwelt,in,days,of,yore,and,a,cavernous,dwelling,it,was,with,iron,doors,so,wide,that,thirty,knights,could,ride,through,them,abreast
yet,even,so,it,was,noted,that,none,of,the,pit,dragons,ever,reached,the,size,of,their,ancestors
the,maesters,say,it,was,because,of,the,walls,around,them,and,the,great,dome,above,their,heads
if,walls,could,keep,us,small,peasants,would,all,be,tiny,and,kings,as,large,as,giants,said,ser,jorah
i’ve,seen,huge,men,born,in,hovels,and,dwarfs,who,dwelt,in,castles

ser,jorah,snorted,his,disdain
how,profound
the,exile,knight,had,no,love,for,the,old,man,he’d,made,that,plain,from,the,first
what,do,you,know,of,dragons,anyway
little,enough,that’s,true
yet,i,served,for,a,time,in,king’s,landing,in,the,days,when,king,aerys,sat,the,iron,throne,and,walked,beneath,the,dragonskulls,that,looked,down,from,the,walls,of,his,throne,room
viserys,talked,of,those,skulls,said,dany
the,usurper,took,them,down,and,hid,them,away
he,could,not,bear,them,looking,down,on,him,upon,his,stolen,throne
she,beckoned,whitebeard,closer
did,you,ever,meet,my,royal,father

i,had,that,great,honor,your,grace
did,you,find,him,good,and,gentle
whitebeard,did,his,best,to,hide,his,feelings,but,they,were,there,plain,on,his,face
his,grace,was
often,pleasant
often
dany,smiled
but,not,always
he,could,be,very,harsh,to,those,he,thought,his,enemies
a,wise,man,never,makes,an,enemy,of,a,king,said,dany
did,you,know,my,brother,rhaegar,as,well
it,was,said,that,no,man,ever,knew,prince,rhaegar,truly
i,had,the,privilege,of,seeing,him,in,tourney,though,and,often,heard,him,play,his,harp,with,its,silver,strings

when,they,won,their,spurs,he,knighted,them,himself,and,they,remained,his,close,companions
young,lord,connington,was,dear,to,the,prince,as,well,but,his,oldest,friend,was,arthur,dayne
the,sword,of,the,morning
said,dany,delighted
viserys,used,to,talk,about,his,wondrous,white,blade
he,said,ser,arthur,was,the,only,knight,in,the,realm,who,was,our,brother’s,peer
whitebeard,bowed,his,head
it,is,not,my,place,to,question,the,words,of,prince,viserys
king,dany,corrected
he,was,a,king,though,he,never,reigned
viserys,the,third,of,his,name
but,what,do,you,mean
his,answer,had,not,been,one,that,she’d,expected
ser,jorah,named,rhaegar,the,last,dragon,once
he,had,to,have,been,a,peerless,warrior,to,be,called,that,surely
your,grace,said,whitebeard,the,prince,of,dragonstone,was,a,most,puissant,warrior,but

you,may,speak,freely,to,me
as,you,command
the,old,man,leaned,upon,his,hardwood,staff,his,brow,furrowed

a,man,will,win,one,tourney,and,fall,quickly,in,the,next
a,slick,spot,in,the,grass,may,mean,defeat,or,what,you,ate,for,supper,the,night,before

that,above,all

i,would,hear,it,from,you
as,you,wish,said,whitebeard
as,a,young,boy,the,prince,of,dragonstone,was,bookish,to,a,fault
he,was,reading,so,early,that,men,said,queen,rhaella,must,have,swallowed,some,books,and,a,candle,whilst,he,was,in,her,womb
rhaegar,took,no,interest,in,the,play,of,other,children

until,one,day,prince,rhaegar,found,something,in,his,scrolls,that,changed,him
no,one,knows,what,it,might,have,been,only,that,the,boy,suddenly,appeared,early,one,morning,in,the,yard,as,the,knights,were,donning,their,steel
he,walked,up,to,ser,willem,darry,the,master-at-arms,and,said,i,will,require,sword,and,armor

just,now,though,they,brought,her,more,danger,than,protection
in,all,the,world,there,were,but,three,living,dragons,and,those,were,hers,they,were,a,wonder,and,a,terror,and,beyond,price

no
the,coverlet,slipped,off,dany’s,shoulder,and,she,tugged,it,back,into,place
it,was,four,hundred,years,ago,or,more,when,the,dothraki,first,rode,out,of,the,east,sacking,and,burning,every,town,and,city,in,their,path
the,khal,who,led,them,was,named,temmo
his,khalasar,was,not,so,big,as,drogo’s,but,it,was,big,enough
fifty,thousand,at,the,least
half,of,them,braided,warriors,with,bells,ringing,in,their,hair
the,qohorik,knew,he,was,coming
they,strengthened,their,walls,doubled,the,size,of,their,own,guard,and,hired,two,free,companies,besides,the,bright,banners,and,the,second,sons
and,almost,as,an,afterthought,they,sent,a,man,to,astapor,to,buy,three,thousand,unsullied
it,was,a,long,march,back,to,qohor,however,and,as,they,approached,they,saw,the,smoke,and,dust,and,heard,the,distant,din,of,battle
by,the,time,the,unsullied,reached,the,city,the,sun,had,set
crows,and,wolves,were,feasting,beneath,the,walls,on,what,remained,of,the,qohorik,heavy,horse
the,bright,banners,and,second,sons,had,fled,as,sellswords,are,wont,to,do,in,the,face,of,hopeless,odds
with,dark,falling,the,dothraki,had,retired,to,their,own,camps,to,drink,and,dance,and,feast,but,none,doubted,that,they,would,return,on,the,morrow,to,smash,the,city,gates,storm,the,walls,and,rape,loot,and,slave,as,they,pleased
but,when,dawn,broke,and,temmo,and,his,bloodriders,led,their,khalasar,out,of,camp,they,found,three,thousand,unsullied,drawn,up,before,the,gates,with,the,black,goat,standard,flying,over,their,heads
so,small,a,force,could,easily,have,been,flanked,but,you,know,dothraki
these,were,men,on,foot,and,men,on,foot,are,fit,only,to,be,ridden,down
the,dothraki,charged
the,unsullied,locked,their,shields,lowered,their,spears,and,stood,firm
against,twenty,thousand,screamers,with,bells,in,their,hair,they,stood,firm
eighteen,times,the,dothraki,charged,and,broke,themselves,on,those,shields,and,spears,like,waves,on,a,rocky,shore
thrice,temmo,sent,his,archers,wheeling,past,and,arrows,fell,like,rain,upon,the,three,thousand,but,the,unsullied,merely,lifted,their,shields,above,their,heads,until,the,squall,had,passed
in,the,end,only,six,hundred,of,them,remained
but,more,than,twelve,thousand,dothraki,lay,dead,upon,that,field,including,khal,temmo,his,bloodriders,his,kos,and,all,his,sons
on,the,morning,of,the,fourth,day,the,new,khal,led,the,survivors,past,the,city,gates,in,a,stately,procession
one,by,one,each,man,cut,off,his,braid,and,threw,it,down,before,the,feet,of,the,three,thousand
since,that,day,the,city,guard,of,qohor,has,been,made,up,solely,of,unsullied,every,one,of,whom,carries,a,tall,spear,from,which,hangs,a,braid,of,human,hair

far,below,at,the,base,of,the,woods,something,moved,amongst,the,trees
a,flash,of,grey,quick-glimpsed,and,gone,again,but,it,was,enough,to,make,his,ears,prick,up
down,there,beside,a,swift,green,brook,another,form,slipped,by,running
wolves,he,knew
his,little,cousins,chasing,down,some,prey

a,pack
he,had,a,pack,as,well,once
five,they,had,been,and,a,sixth,who,stood,aside
somewhere,down,inside,him,were,the,sounds,the,men,had,given,them,to,tell,one,from,the,other,but,it,was,not,by,their,sounds,he,knew,them
he,remembered,their,scents,his,brothers,and,his,sisters
they,all,had,smelled,alike,had,smelled,of,pack,but,each,was,different,too
his,angry,brother,with,the,hot,green,eyes,was,near,the,prince,felt,though,he,had,not,seen,him,for,many,hunts
yet,with,every,sun,that,set,he,grew,more,distant,and,he,had,been,the,last
the,others,were,far,scattered,like,leaves,blown,by,the,wild,wind
sometimes,he,could,sense,them,though,as,if,they,were,still,with,him,only,hidden,from,his,sight,by,a,boulder,or,a,stand,of,trees
he,could,not,smell,them,nor,hear,their,howls,by,night,yet,he,felt,their,presence,at,his,back

but,his,sister,had,left,the,wilds,to,walk,in,the,halls,of,man-rock,where,other,hunters,ruled,and,once,within,those,halls,it,was,hard,to,find,the,path,back,out
the,wolf,prince,remembered
the,wind,shifted,suddenly
deer,and,fear,and,blood
the,scent,of,prey,woke,the,hunger,in,him
the,prince,sniffed,the,air,again,turning,and,then,he,was,off,bounding,along,the,ridgetop,with,jaws,half-parted
the,far,side,of,the,ridge,was,steeper,than,the,one,he’d,come,up,but,he,flew,surefoot,over,stones,and,roots,and,rotting,leaves,down,the,slope,and,through,the,trees,long,strides,eating,up,the,ground
the,scent,pulled,him,onward,ever,faster
the,deer,was,down,and,dying,when,he,reached,her,ringed,by,eight,of,his,small,grey,cousins
the,heads,of,the,pack,had,begun,to,feed,the,male,first,and,then,his,female,taking,turns,tearing,flesh,from,the,red,underbelly,of,their,prey
the,others,waited,patiently,all,but,the,tail,who,paced,in,a,wary,circle,a,few,strides,from,the,rest,his,own,tail,tucked,low
he,would,eat,the,last,of,all,whatever,his,brothers,left,him
the,prince,was,downwind,so,they,did,not,sense,him,until,he,leapt,up,upon,a,fallen,log,six,strides,from,where,they,fed
the,tail,saw,him,first,gave,a,piteous,whine,and,slunk,away
his,pack,brothers,turned,at,the,sound,and,bared,their,teeth,snarling,all,but,the,head,male,and,female
the,direwolf,answered,the,snarls,with,a,low,warning,growl,and,showed,them,his,own,teeth
he,was,bigger,than,his,cousins,twice,the,size,of,the,scrawny,tail,half,again,as,large,as,the,two,pack,heads
he,leapt,down,into,their,midst,and,three,of,them,broke,melting,away,into,the,brush
another,came,at,him,teeth,snapping
he,met,the,attack,head,on,caught,the,wolf’s,leg,in,his,jaws,when,they,met,and,flung,him,aside,yelping,and,limping
and,then,there,was,only,the,head,wolf,to,face,the,great,grey,male,with,his,bloody,muzzle,fresh,from,the,prey’s,soft,belly
there,was,white,on,his,muzzle,as,well,to,mark,him,as,an,old,wolf,but,when,his,mouth,opened,red,slaver,ran,from,his,teeth
he,has,no,fear,the,prince,thought,no,more,than,me
it,would,be,a,good,fight
they,went,for,each,other
long,they,fought,rolling,together,over,roots,and,stones,and,fallen,leaves,and,the,scattered,entrails,of,the,prey,tearing,at,each,other,with,tooth,and,claw,breaking,apart,circling,each,round,the,other,and,bolting,in,to,fight,again
the,prince,was,larger,and,much,the,stronger,but,his,cousin,had,a,pack
the,female,prowled,around,them,closely,snuffing,and,snarling,and,would,interpose,herself,whenever,her,mate,broke,off,bloodied
from,time,to,time,the,other,wolves,would,dart,in,as,well,to,snap,at,a,leg,or,an,ear,when,the,prince,was,turned,the,other,way
one,angered,him,so,much,that,he,whirled,in,a,black,fury,and,tore,out,the,attacker’s,throat
after,that,the,others,kept,their,distance
and,as,the,last,red,light,was,filtering,through,green,boughs,and,golden,the,old,wolf,lay,down,weary,in,the,dirt,and,rolled,over,to,expose,his,throat,and,belly
it,was,submission
the,prince,sniffed,at,him,and,licked,the,blood,from,fur,and,torn,flesh
when,the,old,wolf,gave,a,soft,whimper,the,direwolf,turned,away
he,was,very,hungry,now,and,the,prey,was,his
hodor
the,sudden,sound,made,him,stop,and,snarl
the,wolves,regarded,him,with,green,and,yellow,eyes,bright,with,the,last,light,of,day
none,of,them,had,heard,it
it,was,a,queer,wind,that,blew,only,in,his,ears
he,buried,his,jaws,in,the,deer’s,belly,and,tore,off,a,mouthful,of,flesh
hodor,hodor
no,he,thought
no,i,won’t
it,was,a,boy’s,thought,not,a,direwolf’s
the,woods,were,darkening,all,about,him,until,only,the,shadows,of,the,trees,remained,and,the,glow,of,his,cousins’,eyes
and,through,those,and,behind,those,eyes,he,saw,a,big,man’s,grinning,face,and,a,stone,vault,whose,walls,were,spotted,with,niter
the,rich,warm,taste,of,blood,faded,on,his,tongue
no,don’t,don’t,i,want,to,eat,i,want,to,i,want

stupid,things
i,forgot,he,said
you,always,forget

he,meant,to,do,the,things,that,jojen,asked,but,once,he,was,a,wolf,they,never,seemed,important
there,were,always,things,to,see,and,things,to,smell,a,whole,green,world,to,hunt
and,he,could,run
there,was,nothing,better,than,running,unless,it,was,running,after,prey

hodor,hodor,the,huge,stableboy,said,grinning
meera,reed,was,sixteen,a,woman,grown,but,she,stood,no,higher,than,her,brother
all,the,crannogmen,were,small,she,told,bran,once,when,he,asked,why,she,wasn’t,taller
brown-haired,green-eyed,and,flat,as,a,boy,she,walked,with,a,supple,grace,that,bran,could,only,watch,and,envy
meera,wore,a,long,sharp,dagger,but,her,favorite,way,to,fight,was,with,a,slender,three-pronged,frog,spear,in,one,hand,and,a,woven,net,in,the,other
who’s,hungry
she,asked,holding,up,her,catch,two,small,silvery,trout,and,six,fat,green,frogs
i,am,said,bran
but,not,for,frogs
back,at,winterfell,before,all,the,bad,things,had,happened,the,walders,used,to,say,that,eating,frogs,would,turn,your,teeth,green,and,make,moss,grow,under,your,arms
he,wondered,if,the,walders,were,dead
he,hadn’t,seen,their,corpses,at,winterfell
but,there,had,been,a,lot,of,corpses,and,they,hadn’t,looked,inside,the,buildings
we’ll,just,have,to,feed,you,then
will,you,help,me,clean,the,catch,bran
he,nodded
it,was,hard,to,sulk,with,meera
she,was,much,more,cheerful,than,her,brother,and,always,seemed,to,know,how,to,make,him,smile
nothing,ever,scared,her,or,made,her,angry
well,except,jojen,sometimes
jojen,reed,could,scare,most,anyone
he,dressed,all,in,green,his,eyes,were,murky,as,moss,and,he,had,green,dreams
what,jojen,dreamed,came,true
except,he,dreamed,me,dead,and,i’m,not

jojen,sent,hodor,out,for,wood,and,built,them,a,small,fire,while,bran,and,meera,were,cleaning,the,fish,and,frogs
they,used,meera’s,helm,for,a,cooking,pot,chopping,up,the,catch,into,little,cubes,and,tossing,in,some,water,and,some,wild,onions,hodor,had,found,to,make,a,froggy,stew
it,wasn’t,as,good,as,deer,but,it,wasn’t,bad,either,bran,decided,as,he,ate
thank,you,meera,he,said
my,lady
you,are,most,welcome,your,grace
come,the,morrow,jojen,announced,we,had,best,move,on
bran,could,see,meera,tense
have,you,had,a,green,dream

why,leave,then
his,sister,demanded
tumbledown,tower’s,a,good,place,for,us
no,villages,near,the,woods,are,full,of,game,there’s,fish,and,frogs,in,the,streams,and,lakes
and,who,is,ever,going,to,find,us,here
this,is,not,the,place,we,are,meant,to,be
it,is,safe,though
it,seems,safe,i,know,said,jojen,but,for,how,long
there,was,a,battle,at,winterfell,we,saw,the,dead
battles,mean,wars
if,some,army,should,take,us,unawares
it,might,be,robb’s,army,said,bran
robb,will,come,back,from,the,south,soon,i,know,he,will
he’ll,come,back,with,all,his,banners,and,chase,the,ironmen,away
your,maester,said,naught,of,robb,when,he,lay,dying,jojen,reminded,him
ironmen,on,the,stony,shore,he,said,and,east,the,bastard,of,bolton
moat,cailin,and,deepwood,motte,fallen,the,heir,to,cerwyn,dead,and,the,castellan,of,torrhen’s,square
war,everywhere,he,said,each,man,against,his,neighbor
we,have,plowed,this,field,before,his,sister,said
you,want,to,make,for,the,wall,and,your,three-eyed,crow
that’s,well,and,good,but,the,wall,is,a,very,long,way,and,bran,has,no,legs,but,hodor
if,we,were,mounted
if,we,were,eagles,we,might,fly,said,jojen,sharply,but,we,have,no,wings,no,more,than,we,have,horses
there,are,horses,to,be,had,said,meera
even,in,the,deep,of,the,wolfswood,there,are,foresters,crofters,hunters
some,will,have,horses
and,if,they,do,should,we,steal,them
are,we,thieves
the,last,thing,we,need,is,men,hunting,us
we,could,buy,them,she,said
trade,for,them
look,at,us,meera
a,crippled,boy,with,a,direwolf,a,simpleminded,giant,and,two,crannogmen,a,thousand,leagues,from,the,neck
we,will,be,known
and,word,will,spread
so,long,as,bran,remains,dead,he,is,safe
alive,he,becomes,prey,for,those,who,want,him,dead,for,good,and,true
jojen,went,to,the,fire,to,prod,the,embers,with,a,stick
somewhere,to,the,north,the,three-eyed,crow,awaits,us
bran,has,need,of,a,teacher,wiser,than,me
how,jojen
his,sister,asked
how
afoot,he,answered
a,step,at,a,time
the,road,from,greywater,to,winterfell,went,on,forever,and,we,were,mounted,then
you,want,us,to,travel,a,longer,road,on,foot,without,even,knowing,where,it,ends
beyond,the,wall,you,say
i,haven’t,been,there,no,more,than,you,but,i,know,that,beyond,the,wall’s,a,big,place,jojen
are,there,many,three-eyed,crows,or,only,one
how,do,we,find,him
perhaps,he,will,find,us
before,meera,could,find,a,reply,to,that,they,heard,the,sound,the,distant,howl,of,a,wolf,drifting,through,the,night
summer
asked,jojen,listening
no
bran,knew,the,voice,of,his,direwolf
are,you,certain
said,the,little,grandfather
certain
summer,had,wandered,far,afield,today,and,would,not,be,back,till,dawn
maybe,jojen,dreams,green,but,he,can’t,tell,a,wolf,from,a,direwolf
he,wondered,why,they,all,listened,to,jojen,so,much
he,was,not,a,prince,like,bran,nor,big,and,strong,like,hodor,nor,as,good,a,hunter,as,meera,yet,somehow,it,was,always,jojen,telling,them,what,to,do
we,should,steal,horses,like,meera,wants,bran,said,and,ride,to,the,umbers,up,at,last,hearth
he,thought,a,moment
or,we,could,steal,a,boat,and,sail,down,the,white,knife,to,white,harbor,town
that,fat,lord,manderly,rules,there,he,was,friendly,at,the,harvest,feast
he,wanted,to,build,ships
maybe,he,built,some,and,we,could,sail,to,riverrun,and,bring,robb,home,with,all,his,army
then,it,wouldn’t,matter,who,knew,i,was,alive
robb,wouldn’t,let,anyone,hurt,us

davos,when,he,came,up,on,deck,the,long,point,of,driftmark,was,dwindling,behind,them,while,dragonstone,rose,from,the,sea,ahead
a,pale,grey,wisp,of,smoke,blew,from,the,top,of,the,mountain,to,mark,where,the,island,lay
dragonmont,is,restless,this,morning,davos,thought,or,else,melisandre,is,burning,someone,else
melisandre,had,been,much,in,his,thoughts,as,shayala’s,dance,made,her,way,across,blackwater,bay,and,through,the,gullet,tacking,against,perverse,contrary,winds
the,great,fire,that,burned,atop,the,sharp,point,watchtower,at,the,end,of,massey’s,hook,reminded,him,of,the,ruby,she,wore,at,her,throat,and,when,the,world,turned,red,at,dawn,and,sunset,the,drifting,clouds,turned,the,same,color,as,the,silks,and,satins,of,her,rustling,gowns
she,would,be,waiting,on,dragonstone,as,well,waiting,in,all,her,beauty,and,all,her,power,with,her,god,and,her,shadows,and,his,king
the,red,priestess,had,always,seemed,loyal,to,stannis,until,now
she,has,broken,him,as,a,man,breaks,a,horse
she,would,ride,him,to,power,if,she,could,and,for,that,she,gave,my,sons,to,the,fire
i,will,cut,the,living,heart,from,her,breast,and,see,how,it,burns
he,touched,the,hilt,of,the,fine,long,lysene,dirk,that,the,captain,had,given,him
the,captain,had,been,very,kind,to,him
his,name,was,khorane,sathmantes,a,lyseni,like,salladhor,saan,whose,ship,this,was
he,had,the,pale,blue,eyes,you,often,saw,on,lys,set,in,a,bony,weatherworn,face,but,he,had,spent,many,years,trading,in,the,seven,kingdoms
when,he,learned,that,the,man,he,had,plucked,from,the,sea,was,the,celebrated,onion,knight,he,gave,him,the,use,of,his,own,cabin,and,his,own,clothes,and,a,pair,of,new,boots,that,almost,fit
he,insisted,that,davos,share,his,provisions,as,well,though,that,turned,out,badly
his,stomach,could,not,tolerate,the,snails,and,lampreys,and,other,rich,food,captain,khorane,so,relished,and,after,his,first,meal,at,the,captain’s,table,he,spent,the,rest,of,the,day,with,one,end,or,the,other,dangling,over,the,rail
dragonstone,loomed,larger,with,every,stroke,of,the,oars
davos,could,see,the,shape,of,the,mountain,now,and,on,its,side,the,great,black,citadel,with,its,gargoyles,and,dragon,towers
the,bronze,figurehead,at,the,bow,of,shayala’s,dance,sent,up,wings,of,salt,spray,as,it,cut,the,waves
he,leaned,his,weight,against,the,rail,grateful,for,its,support
his,ordeal,had,weakened,him
if,he,stood,too,long,his,legs,shook,and,sometimes,he,fell,prey,to,uncontrollable,fits,of,coughing,and,brought,up,gobs,of,bloody,phlegm
it,is,nothing,he,told,himself
surely,the,gods,did,not,bring,me,safe,through,flre,and,sea,only,to,kill,me,with,a,flux
as,he,listened,to,the,pounding,of,the,oarmaster’s,drum,the,thrum,of,the,sail,and,the,rhythmic,swish,and,creak,of,the,oars,he,thought,back,to,his,younger,days,when,these,same,sounds,woke,dread,in,his,heart,on,many,a,misty,morn
they,heralded,the,approach,of,old,ser,tristimun’s,sea,watch,and,the,sea,watch,was,death,to,smugglers,when,aerys,targaryen,sat,the,iron,throne
but,that,was,another,lifetime,he,thought
that,was,before,the,onion,ship,before,storm’s,end,before,stannis,shortened,my,fingers
that,was,before,the,war,or,the,red,comet,before,i,was,a,seaworth,or,a,knight
i,was,a,different,man,in,those,days,before,lord,stannis,raised,me,high
captain,khorane,had,told,him,of,the,end,of,stannis’s,hopes,on,the,night,the,river,burned
the,lannisters,had,taken,him,from,the,flank,and,his,fickle,bannermen,had,abandoned,him,by,the,hundreds,in,the,hour,of,his,greatest,need
king,renly’s,shade,was,seen,as,well,the,captain,said,slaying,right,and,left,as,he,led,the,lion,lord’s,van
it’s,said,his,green,armor,took,a,ghostly,glow,from,the,wildfire,and,his,antlers,ran,with,golden,flames
renly’s,shade
davos,wondered,if,his,sons,would,return,as,shades,as,well
he,had,seen,too,many,queer,things,on,the,sea,to,say,that,ghosts,did,not,exist
did,none,keep,faith
he,asked
some,few,the,captain,said
the,queen’s,kin,them,in,chief
we,took,off,many,who,wore,the,fox-and-flowers,though,many,more,were,left,ashore,with,all,manner,of,badges

the,mountain,grew,taller,crowned,all,in,pale,smoke
the,sail,sang,the,drum,beat,the,oars,pulled,smoothly,and,before,very,long,the,mouth,of,the,harbor,opened,before,them
so,empty,davos,thought,remembering,how,it,had,been,before,with,the,ships,crowding,every,quay,and,rocking,at,anchor,off,the,breakwater
he,could,see,salladhor,saan’s,flagship,valyrian,moored,at,the,quay,where,fury,and,her,sisters,had,once,tied,up
the,ships,on,either,side,of,her,had,striped,lysene,hulls,as,well
in,vain,he,looked,for,any,sign,of,lady,marya,or,wraith
they,pulled,down,the,sail,as,they,entered,the,harbor,to,dock,on,oars,alone
the,captain,came,to,davos,as,they,were,tying,up
my,prince,will,wish,to,see,you,at,once
a,fit,of,coughing,seized,davos,as,he,tried,to,answer
he,clutched,the,rail,for,support,and,spat,over,the,side
the,king,he,wheezed
i,must,go,to,the,king
for,where,the,king,is,i,will,find,melisandre
no,one,goes,to,the,king,khorane,sathmantes,replied,firmly
salladhor,saan,will,tell,you
him,first
davos,was,too,weak,to,defy,him
he,could,only,nod
salladhor,saan,was,not,aboard,his,valyrian
they,found,him,at,another,quay,a,quarter,mile,distant,down,in,the,hold,of,a,big-bellied,pentoshi,cog,named,bountiful,harvest,counting,cargo,with,two,eunuchs
one,held,a,lantern,the,other,a,wax,tablet,and,stylus
thirty-seven,thirty-eight,thirty-nine,the,old,rogue,was,saying,when,davos,and,the,captain,came,down,the,hatch
today,he,wore,a,wine-colored,tunic,and,high,boots,of,bleached,white,leather,inlaid,with,silver,scrollwork
pulling,the,stopper,from,a,jar,he,sniffed,sneezed,and,said,a,coarse,grind,and,of,the,second,quality,my,nose,declares

my,onion,knight,was,never,so,thin,or,so,pale,as,you
salladhor,saan,threaded,his,way,between,the,jars,of,spice,and,bolts,of,cloth,that,filled,the,hold,of,the,merchanter,wrapped,davos,in,a,fierce,embrace,then,kissed,him,once,on,each,cheek,and,a,third,time,on,his,forehead

the,carpets,were,deep,the,windows,stained,glass,and,any,of,the,great,leather,chairs,would,have,seated,three,of,davos,quite,comfortably
the,cheese,and,olives,arrived,shortly,and,a,cup,of,steaming,hot,red,wine

they,say,he,has,a,hundred,thousand,men,and,a,magic,sword
jaime’s,hands,wrapped,around,the,chain,that,bound,his,wrists,and,he,twisted,it,taut,wishing,for,the,strength,to,snap,it,in,two
then,i’d,show,stannis,where,to,sheathe,his,magic,sword
i’d,stay,well,clear,of,that,kingsroad,if,i,were,you,the,man,went,on

such,would,never,dare,to,trouble,armed,men
begging,your,pardon,ser,but,i,see,one,armed,man,traveling,with,a,woman,and,a,prisoner,in,chains
brienne,gave,the,cook,a,dark,look
the,wench,does,hate,being,reminded,that,she’s,a,wench,jaime,reflected,twisting,at,the,chains,again
the,links,were,cold,and,hard,against,his,flesh,the,iron,implacable
the,manacles,had,chafed,his,wrists,raw

there’s,a,nest,of,outlaws,there,preying,on,anyone,tries,to,come,by,and,more,of,the,same,downriver,around,the,skipping,stones,and,red,deer,island
and,the,lightning,lord’s,been,seen,in,these,parts,as,well
he,crosses,the,river,wherever,he,likes,riding,this,way,and,that,way,never,still
and,who,is,this,lightning,lord
demanded,ser,cleos,frey
lord,beric,as,it,please,you,ser
they,call,him,that,’cause,he,strikes,so,sudden,like,lightning,from,a,clear,sky
it’s,said,he,cannot,die

well,he,had,the,power,to,match,robert,baratheon,drink,for,drink,and,there,were,few,enough,who,could,say,that
jaime,had,once,heard,thoros,tell,the,king,that,he,became,a,red,priest,because,the,robes,hid,the,winestains,so,well
robert,had,laughed,so,hard,he’d,spit,ale,all,over,cersei’s,silken,mantle
far,be,it,from,me,to,make,objection,he,said,but,perhaps,the,trident,is,not,our,safest,course
i’d,say,that’s,so,their,cook,agreed
even,if,you,get,past,red,deer,island,and,don’t,meet,up,with,lord,beric,and,the,red,wizard,there’s,still,the,ruby,ford,before,you
last,i,heard,it,was,the,leech,lord’s,wolves,held,the,ford,but,that,was,some,time,past
by,now,it,could,be,lions,again,or,lord,beric,or,anyone
or,no,one,brienne,suggested
if,m’lady,cares,to,wager,her,skin,on,that,i,won’t,stop,her
but,if,i,was,you,i’d,leave,this,here,river,cut,overland
if,you,stay,off,the,main,roads,and,shelter,under,the,trees,of,a,night,hidden,as,it,were
well,i,still,wouldn’t,want,to,go,with,you,but,you,might,stand,a,mummer’s,chance
the,big,wench,was,looking,doubtful
we,would,need,horses
there,are,horses,here,jaime,pointed,out
i,heard,one,in,the,stable
aye,there,are,said,the,innkeep,who,wasn’t,an,innkeep
three,of,them,as,it,happens,but,they’re,not,for,sale
jaime,had,to,laugh
of,course,not
but,you’ll,show,them,to,us,anyway
brienne,scowled,but,the,man,who,wasn’t,an,innkeep,met,her,eyes,without,blinking,and,after,a,moment,reluctantly,she,said,show,me,and,they,all,rose,from,the,table
the,stables,had,not,been,mucked,out,in,a,long,while,from,the,smell,of,them
hundreds,of,fat,black,flies,swarmed,amongst,the,straw,buzzing,from,stall,to,stall,and,crawling,over,the,mounds,of,horse,dung,that,lay,everywhere,but,there,were,only,the,three,horses,to,be,seen
they,made,an,unlikely,trio,a,lumbering,brown,plow,horse,an,ancient,white,gelding,blind,in,one,eye,and,a,knight’s,palfrey,dapple,grey,and,spirited
they’re,not,for,sale,at,any,price,their,alleged,owner,announced
how,did,you,come,by,these,horses
brienne,wanted,to,know
the,dray,was,stabled,here,when,the,wife,and,me,come,on,the,inn,the,man,said,along,with,the,one,you,just,ate
the,gelding,come,wandering,up,one,night,and,the,boy,caught,the,palfrey,running,free,still,saddled,and,bridled
here,i’ll,show,you
the,saddle,he,showed,them,was,decorated,with,silver,inlay
the,saddlecloth,had,originally,been,checkered,pink,and,black,but,now,it,was,mostly,brown
jaime,did,not,recognize,the,original,colors,but,he,recognized,bloodstains,easily,enough
well,her,owner,won’t,be,coming,to,claim,her,anytime,soon
he,examined,the,palfrey’s,legs,counted,the,gelding’s,teeth
give,him,a,gold,piece,for,the,grey,if,he’ll,include,the,saddle,he,advised,brienne
a,silver,for,the,plow,horse
he,ought,to,pay,us,for,taking,the,white,off,his,hands
don’t,speak,discourteously,of,your,horse,ser
the,wench,opened,the,purse,lady,catelyn,had,given,her,and,took,out,three,golden,coins
i,will,pay,you,a,dragon,for,each
he,blinked,and,reached,for,the,gold,then,hesitated,and,drew,his,hand,back
i,don’t,know
i,can’t,ride,no,golden,dragon,if,i,need,to,get,away
nor,eat,one,if,i’m,hungry
you,can,have,our,skiff,as,well,she,said
sail,up,the,river,or,down,as,you,like
let,me,have,a,taste,o’,that,gold
the,man,took,one,of,the,coins,from,her,palm,and,bit,it
hm
real,enough,i’d,say
three,dragons,and,the,skiff
he’s,robbing,you,blind,wench,jaime,said,amiably
i’ll,want,provisions,too,brienne,told,their,host,ignoring,jaime
whatever,you,have,that,you,can,spare
there’s,more,oatcakes
the,man,scooped,the,other,two,dragons,from,her,palm,and,jingled,them,in,his,fist,smiling,at,the,sound,they,made
aye,and,smoked,salt,fish,but,that,will,cost,you,silver
my,beds,will,be,costing,as,well
you’ll,be,wanting,to,stay,the,night
no,brienne,said,at,once
the,man,frowned,at,her
woman,you,don’t,want,to,go,riding,at,night,through,strange,country,on,horses,you,don’t,know
you’re,like,to,blunder,into,some,bog,or,break,your,horse’s,leg
the,moon,will,be,bright,tonight,brienne,said
we’ll,have,no,trouble,finding,our,way
their,host,chewed,on,that
if,you,don’t,have,the,silver,might,be,some,coppers,would,buy,you,them,beds,and,a,coverlet,or,two,to,keep,you,warm
it’s,not,like,i’m,turning,travelers,away,if,you,get,my,meaning
that,sounds,more,than,fair,said,ser,cleos
the,coverlets,is,fresh,washed,too
my,wife,saw,to,that,before,she,had,to,go,off
not,a,flea,to,be,found,neither,you,have,my,word,on,that
he,jingled,the,coins,again,smiling
ser,cleos,was,plainly,tempted
a,proper,bed,would,do,us,all,good,my,lady,he,said,to,brienne
we’d,make,better,time,on,the,morrow,once,refreshed
he,looked,to,his,cousin,for,support
no,coz,the,wench,is,right
we,have,promises,to,keep,and,long,leagues,before,us
we,ought,ride,on
but,said,cleos,you,said,yourself,then
when,i,thought,the,inn,deserted
now,i,have,a,full,belly,and,a,moonlight,ride,will,be,just,the,thing
he,smiled,for,the,wench
but,unless,you,mean,to,throw,me,over,the,back,of,that,plow,horse,like,a,sack,of,flour,someone,had,best,do,something,about,these,irons
it’s,difficult,to,ride,with,your,ankles,chained,together
brienne,frowned,at,the,chain
the,man,who,wasn’t,an,innkeep,rubbed,his,jaw
there’s,a,smithy,round,back,of,the,stable
show,me,brienne,said
yes,said,jaime,and,the,sooner,the,better
there’s,far,too,much,horse,shit,about,here,for,my,taste
i,would,hate,to,step,in,it
he,gave,the,wench,a,sharp,look,wondering,if,she,was,bright,enough,to,take,his,meaning
he,hoped,she,might,strike,the,irons,off,his,wrists,as,well,but,brienne,was,still,suspicious
she,split,the,ankle,chain,in,the,center,with,a,half-dozen,sharp,blows,from,the,smith’s,hammer,delivered,to,the,blunt,end,of,a,steel,chisel
when,he,suggested,that,she,break,the,wrist,chain,as,well,she,ignored,him
six,miles,downriver,you’ll,see,a,burned,village,their,host,said,as,he,was,helping,them,saddle,the,horses,and,load,their,packs
this,time,he,directed,his,counsel,at,brienne
the,road,splits,there
if,you,turn,south,you’ll,come,on,ser,warren’s,stone,towerhouse
ser,warren,went,off,and,died,so,i,couldn’t,say,who,holds,it,now,but,it’s,a,place,best,shunned
you’d,do,better,to,follow,the,track,through,the,woods,south,by,east
we,shall,she,answered
you,have,my,thanks
more,to,the,point,he,has,your,gold
jaime,kept,the,thought,to,himself
he,was,tired,of,being,disregarded,by,this,huge,ugly,cow,of,a,woman
she,took,the,plow,horse,for,herself,and,assigned,the,palfrey,to,ser,cleos
as,threatened,jaime,drew,the,one-eyed,gelding,which,put,an,end,to,any,thoughts,he,might,have,had,of,giving,his,horse,a,kick,and,leaving,the,wench,in,his,dust
the,man,and,the,boy,came,out,to,watch,them,leave
the,man,wished,them,luck,and,told,them,to,come,back,in,better,times,while,the,lad,stood,silent,his,crossbow,under,his,arm
take,up,the,spear,or,maul,jaime,told,him,they’ll,serve,you,better
the,boy,stared,at,him,distrustfully
so,much,for,friendly,advice
he,shrugged,turned,his,horse,and,never,looked,back
ser,cleos,was,all,complaints,as,they,rode,out,still,in,mourning,for,his,lost,featherbed
they,rode,east,along,the,bank,of,the,moonlit,river
the,red,fork,was,very,broad,here,but,shallow,its,banks,all,mud,and,reeds
jaime’s,mount,plodded,along,placidly,though,the,poor,old,thing,had,a,tendency,to,want,to,drift,off,to,the,side,of,his,good,eye
it,felt,good,to,be,mounted,once,more
he,had,not,been,on,a,horse,since,robb,stark’s,archers,had,killed,his,destrier,under,him,in,the,whispering,wood
when,they,reached,the,burned,village,a,choice,of,equally,unpromising,roads,confronted,them,narrow,tracks,deeply,rutted,by,the,carts,of,farmers,hauling,their,grain,to,the,river
one,wandered,off,toward,the,southeast,and,soon,vanished,amidst,the,trees,they,could,see,in,the,distance,while,the,other,straighter,and,stonier,arrowed,due,south
brienne,considered,them,briefly,and,then,swung,her,horse,onto,the,southern,road
jaime,was,pleasantly,surprised,it,was,the,same,choice,he,would,have,made
but,this,is,the,road,the,innkeep,warned,us,against,ser,cleos,objected
he,was,no,innkeep
she,hunched,gracelessly,in,the,saddle,but,seemed,to,have,a,sure,seat,nonetheless
the,man,took,too,great,an,interest,in,our,choice,of,route,and,those,woods
such,places,are,notorious,haunts,of,outlaws
he,may,have,been,urging,us,into,a,trap
clever,wench
jaime,smiled,at,his,cousin
our,host,has,friends,down,that,road,i,would,venture
the,ones,whose,mounts,gave,that,stable,such,a,memorable,aroma
he,may,have,been,lying,about,the,river,as,well,to,put,us,on,these,horses,the,wench,said,but,i,could,not,take,the,risk
there,will,be,soldiers,at,the,ruby,ford,and,the,crossroads
well,she,may,be,ugly,but,she’s,not,entirely,stupid
jaime,gave,her,a,grudging,smile
the,ruddy,light,from,the,upper,windows,of,the,stone,towerhouse,gave,them,warning,of,its,presence,a,long,way,off,and,brienne,led,them,off,into,the,fields
only,when,the,stronghold,was,well,to,the,rear,did,they,angle,back,and,find,the,road,again
half,the,night,passed,before,the,wench,allowed,that,it,might,be,safe,to,stop
by,then,all,three,of,them,were,drooping,in,their,saddles
they,sheltered,in,a,small,grove,of,oak,and,ash,beside,a,sluggish,stream
the,wench,would,allow,no,fire,so,they,shared,a,midnight,supper,of,stale,oatcakes,and,salt,fish
the,night,was,strangely,peaceful
the,half-moon,sat,overhead,in,a,black,felt,sky,surrounded,by,stars
off,in,the,distance,some,wolves,were,howling
one,of,their,horses,whickered,nervously
there,was,no,other,sound
the,war,has,not,touched,this,place,jaime,thought
he,was,glad,to,be,here,glad,to,be,alive,glad,to,be,on,his,way,back,to,cersei
i’ll,take,the,first,watch,brienne,told,ser,cleos,and,frey,was,soon,snoring,softly
jaime,sat,against,the,bole,of,an,oak,and,wondered,what,cersei,and,tyrion,were,doing,just,now
do,you,have,any,siblings,my,lady
he,asked
brienne,squinted,at,him,suspiciously
no
i,was,my,father’s,only,s,child
jaime,chuckled
son,you,meant,to,say
does,he,think,of,you,as,a,son
you,make,a,queer,sort,of,daughter,to,be,sure
wordless,she,turned,away,from,him,her,knuckles,tight,on,her,sword,hilt
what,a,wretched,creature,this,one,is
she,reminded,him,of,tyrion,in,some,queer,way,though,at,first,blush,two,people,could,scarcely,be,any,more,dissimilar
perhaps,it,was,that,thought,of,his,brother,that,made,him,say,i,did,not,intend,to,give,offense,brienne
forgive,me
your,crimes,are,past,forgiving,kingslayer
that,name,again
jaime,twisted,idly,at,his,chains
why,do,i,enrage,you,so
i’ve,never,done,you,harm,that,i,know,of
you’ve,harmed,others
those,you,were,sworn,to,protect
the,weak,the,innocent

the,king
it,always,came,back,to,aerys
don’t,presume,to,judge,what,you,do,not,understand,wench
my,name,is,brienne,yes
has,anyone,ever,told,you,that,you’re,as,tedious,as,you,are,ugly
you,will,not,provoke,me,to,anger,kingslayer
oh,i,might,if,i,cared,enough,to,try
why,did,you,take,the,oath
she,demanded
why,don,the,white,cloak,if,you,meant,to,betray,all,it,stood,for
why
what,could,he,say,that,she,might,possibly,understand
i,was,a,boy
fifteen
it,was,a,great,honor,for,one,so,young
that,is,no,answer,she,said,scornfully
you,would,not,like,the,truth
he,had,joined,the,kingsguard,for,love,of,course
their,father,had,summoned,cersei,to,court,when,she,was,twelve,hoping,to,make,her,a,royal,marriage
he,refused,every,offer,for,her,hand,preferring,to,keep,her,with,him,in,the,tower,of,the,hand,while,she,grew,older,and,more,womanly,and,ever,more,beautiful
no,doubt,he,was,waiting,for,prince,viserys,to,mature,or,perhaps,for,rhaegar’s,wife,to,die,in,childbed
elia,of,dorne,was,never,the,healthiest,of,women
jaime,meantime,had,spent,four,years,as,squire,to,ser,sumner,crakehall,and,earned,his,spurs,against,the,kingswood,brotherhood
but,when,he,made,a,brief,call,at,king’s,landing,on,his,way,back,to,casterly,rock,chiefly,to,see,his,sister,cersei,took,him,aside,and,whispered,that,lord,tywin,meant,to,marry,him,to,lysa,tully,had,gone,so,far,as,to,invite,lord,hoster,to,the,city,to,discuss,dower
but,if,jaime,took,the,white,he,could,be,near,her,always
old,ser,harlan,grandison,had,died,in,his,sleep,as,was,only,appropriate,for,one,whose,sigil,was,a,sleeping,lion
aerys,would,want,a,young,man,to,take,his,place,so,why,not,a,roaring,lion,in,place,of,a,sleepy,one
father,will,never,consent,jaime,objected
the,king,won’t,ask,him
and,once,it’s,done,father,can’t,object,not,openly
aerys,had,ser,ilyn,payne’s,tongue,torn,out,just,for,boasting,that,it,was,the,hand,who,truly,ruled,the,seven,kingdoms
the,captain,of,the,hand’s,guard,and,yet,father,dared,not,try,and,stop,it
he,won’t,stop,this,either
but,jaime,said,there’s,casterly,rock
is,it,a,rock,you,want
or,me
he,remembered,that,night,as,if,it,were,yesterday
they,spent,it,in,an,old,inn,on,eel,alley,well,away,from,watchful,eyes
cersei,had,come,to,him,dressed,as,a,simple,serving,wench,which,somehow,excited,him,all,the,more
jaime,had,never,seen,her,more,passionate
every,time,he,went,to,sleep,she,woke,him,again
by,morning,casterly,rock,seemed,a,small,price,to,pay,to,be,near,her,always
he,gave,his,consent,and,cersei,promised,to,do,the,rest
a,moon’s,turn,later,a,royal,raven,arrived,at,casterly,rock,to,inform,him,that,he,had,been,chosen,for,the,kingsguard
he,was,commanded,to,present,himself,to,the,king,during,the,great,tourney,at,harrenhal,to,say,his,vows,and,don,his,cloak
jaime’s,investiture,freed,him,from,lysa,tully
elsewise,nothing,went,as,planned
his,father,had,never,been,more,furious
he,could,not,object,openly,cersei,had,judged,that,correctly,but,he,resigned,the,handship,on,some,thin,pretext,and,returned,to,casterly,rock,taking,his,daughter,with,him
instead,of,being,together,cersei,and,jaime,just,changed,places,and,he,found,himself,alone,at,court,guarding,a,mad,king,while,four,lesser,men,took,their,turns,dancing,on,knives,in,his,father’s,ill-fitting,shoes
so,swiftly,did,the,hands,rise,and,fall,that,jaime,remembered,their,heraldry,better,than,their,faces
the,horn-of-plenty,hand,and,the,dancing,griffins,hand,had,both,been,exiled,the,mace-and-dagger,hand,dipped,in,wildfire,and,burned,alive
lord,rossart,had,been,the,last
his,sigil,had,been,a,burning,torch,an,unfortunate,choice,given,the,fate,of,his,predecessor,but,the,alchemist,had,been,elevated,largely,because,he,shared,the,king’s,passion,for,fire
i,ought,to,have,drowned,rossart,instead,of,gutting,him
brienne,was,still,awaiting,his,answer
jaime,said,you,are,not,old,enough,to,have,known,aerys,targaryen
she,would,not,hear,it
aerys,was,mad,and,cruel,no,one,has,ever,denied,that
he,was,still,king,crowned,and,anointed
and,you,had,swom,to,protect,him
i,know,what,i,swore
and,what,you,did
she,loomed,above,him,six,feet,of,freckled,frowning,horse-toothed,disapproval
yes,and,what,you,did,as,well
we’re,both,kingslayers,here,if,what,i’ve,heard,is,true
i,never,harmed,renly
i’ll,kill,the,man,who,says,i,did
best,start,with,cleos,then
and,you’ll,have,a,deal,of,killing,to,do,after,that,the,way,he,tells,the,tale
lies
lady,catelyn,was,there,when,his,grace,was,murdered,she,saw
there,was,a,shadow
the,candles,guttered,and,the,air,grew,cold,and,there,was,blood,oh,very,good
jaime,laughed
your,wits,are,quicker,than,mine,i,confess,it
when,they,found,me,standing,over,my,dead,king,i,never,thought,to,say,no,no,it,wasn’t,me,it,was,a,shadow,a,terrible,cold,shadow,’,he,laughed,again
tell,me,true,one,kingslayer,to,another,did,the,starks,pay,you,to,slit,his,throat,or,was,it,stannis
had,renly,spurned,you,was,that,the,way,of,it
or,perhaps,your,moon’s,blood,was,on,you
never,give,a,wench,a,sword,when,she’s,bleeding
for,a,moment,jaime,thought,brienne,might,strike,him
a,step,closer,and,i’ll,snatch,that,dagger,from,her,sheath,and,bury,it,up,her,womb
he,gathered,a,leg,under,him,ready,to,spring,but,the,wench,did,not,move
it,is,a,rare,and,precious,gift,to,be,a,knight,she,said,and,even,more,so,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard
it,is,a,gift,given,to,few,a,gift,you,scorned,and,soiled
a,gift,you,want,desperately,wench,and,can,never,have
i,earned,my,knighthood
nothing,was,given,to,me
i,won,a,tourney,mêlée,at,thirteen,when,i,was,yet,a,squire
at,fifteen,i,rode,with,ser,arthur,dayne,against,the,kingswood,brotherhood,and,he,knighted,me,on,the,battlefield
it,was,that,white,cloak,that,soiled,me,not,the,other,way,around
so,spare,me,your,envy
it,was,the,gods,who,neglected,to,give,you,a,cock,not,me
the,look,brienne,gave,him,then,was,full,of,loathing
she,would,gladly,hack,me,to,pieces,but,for,her,precious,vow,he,reflected
good
i’ve,had,enough,of,feeble,pieties,and,maidens’,judgments
the,wench,stalked,off,without,saying,a,word
jaime,curled,up,beneath,his,cloak,hoping,to,dream,of,cersei
but,when,he,closed,his,eyes,it,was,aerys,targaryen,he,saw,pacing,alone,in,his,throne,room,picking,at,his,scabbed,and,bleeding,hands
the,fool,was,always,cutting,himself,on,the,blades,and,barbs,of,the,iron,throne
jaime,had,slipped,in,through,the,king’s,door,clad,in,his,golden,armor,sword,in,hand
the,golden,armor,not,the,white,but,no,one,ever,remembers,that
would,that,i,had,taken,off,that,damned,cloak,as,well
when,aerys,saw,the,blood,on,his,blade,he,demanded,to,know,if,it,was,lord,tywin’s
i,want,him,dead,the,traitor
i,want,his,head,you’ll,bring,me,his,head,or,you’ll,burn,with,all,the,rest
all,the,traitors
rossart,says,they,are,inside,the,walls
he’s,gone,to,make,them,a,warm,welcome
whose,blood
whose
rossart’s,answered,jaime
those,purple,eyes,grew,huge,then,and,the,royal,mouth,drooped,open,in,shock
he,lost,control,of,his,bowels,turned,and,ran,for,the,iron,throne
beneath,the,empty,eyes,of,the,skulls,on,the,walls,jaime,hauled,the,last,dragonking,bodily,off,the,steps,squealing,like,a,pig,and,smelling,like,a,privy
a,single,slash,across,his,throat,was,all,it,took,to,end,it
so,easy,he,remembered,thinking
a,king,should,die,harder,than,this
rossart,at,least,had,tried,to,make,a,fight,of,it,though,if,truth,be,told,he,fought,like,an,alchemist
queer,that,they,never,ask,who,killed,rossart
but,of,course,he,was,no,one,lowborn,hand,for,a,fortnight,just,another,mad,fancy,of,the,mad,king
ser,elys,westerling,and,lord,crakehall,and,others,of,his,father’s,knights,burst,into,the,hall,in,time,to,see,the,last,of,it,so,there,was,no,way,for,jaime,to,vanish,and,let,some,braggart,steal,the,praise,or,blame
it,would,be,blame,he,knew,at,once,when,he,saw,the,way,they,looked,at,him
though,perhaps,that,was,fear
lannister,or,no,he,was,one,of,aerys’s,seven
the,castle,is,ours,ser,and,the,city,roland,crakehall,told,him,which,was,half,true
targaryen,loyalists,were,still,dying,on,the,serpentine,steps,and,in,the,armory,gregor,clegane,and,amory,lorch,were,scaling,the,walls,of,maegor’s,holdfast,and,ned,stark,was,leading,his,northmen,through,the,king’s,gate,even,then,but,crakehall,could,not,have,known,that
he,had,not,seemed,surprised,to,find,aerys,slain,jaime,had,been,lord,tywin’s,son,long,before,he,had,been,named,to,the,kingsguard
tell,them,the,mad,king,is,dead,he,commanded
spare,all,those,who,yield,and,hold,them,captive
shall,i,proclaim,a,new,king,as,well
crakehall,asked,and,jaime,read,the,question,plain,shall,it,be,your,father,or,robert,baratheon,or,do,you,mean,to,try,to,make,a,new,dragonking
he,thought,for,a,moment,of,the,boy,viserys,fled,to,dragonstone,and,of,rhaegar’s,infant,son,aegon,still,in,maegor’s,with,his,mother
a,new,targaryen,king,and,my,father,as,hand
how,the,wolves,will,howl,and,the,storm,lord,choke,with,rage
for,a,moment,he,was,tempted,until,he,glanced,down,again,at,the,body,on,the,floor,in,its,spreading,pool,of,blood
his,blood,is,in,both,of,them,he,thought
proclaim,who,you,bloody,well,like,he,told,crakehall
then,he,climbed,the,iron,throne,and,seated,himself,with,his,sword,across,his,knees,to,see,who,would,come,to,claim,the,kingdom
as,it,happened,it,had,been,eddard,stark
you,had,no,right,to,judge,me,either,stark
in,his,dreams,the,dead,came,burning,gowned,in,swirling,green,flames
jaime,danced,around,them,with,a,golden,sword,but,for,every,one,he,struck,down,two,more,arose,to,take,his,place
brienne,woke,him,with,a,boot,in,the,ribs
the,world,was,still,black,and,it,had,begun,to,rain
they,broke,their,fast,on,oatcakes,salt,fish,and,some,blackberries,that,ser,cleos,had,found,and,were,back,in,the,saddle,before,the,sun,came,up
tyrion,the,eunuch,was,humming,tunelessly,to,himself,as,he,came,through,the,door,dressed,in,flowing,robes,of,peach-colored,silk,and,smelling,of,lemons
when,he,saw,tyrion,seated,by,the,hearth,he,stopped,and,grew,very,still
my,lord,tyrion,came,out,in,a,squeak,punctuated,by,a,nervous,giggle
so,you,do,remember,me
i,had,begun,to,wonder
it,is,so,very,good,to,see,you,looking,so,strong,and,well
varys,smiled,his,slimiest,smile
though,i,confess,i,had,not,thought,to,find,you,in,mine,own,humble,chambers
they,are,humble
excessively,so,in,truth
tyrion,had,waited,until,varys,was,summoned,by,his,father,before,slipping,in,to,pay,him,a,visit
the,eunuch’s,apartments,were,sparse,and,small,three,snug,windowless,chambers,under,the,north,wall
i’d,hoped,to,discover,bushel,baskets,of,juicy,secrets,to,while,away,the,waiting,but,there’s,not,a,paper,to,be,found
he’d,searched,for,hidden,passages,too,knowing,the,spider,must,have,ways,of,coming,and,going,unseen,but,those,had,proved,equally,elusive
there,was,water,in,your,flagon,gods,have,mercy,he,went,on,your,sleeping,cell,is,no,wider,than,a,coffin,and,that,bed
is,it,actually,made,of,stone,or,does,it,only,feel,that,way
varys,closed,the,door,and,barred,it
i,am,plagued,with,backaches,my,lord,and,prefer,to,sleep,upon,a,hard,surface
i,would,have,taken,you,for,a,featherbed,man
i,am,full,of,surprises
are,you,cross,with,me,for,abandoning,you,after,the,battle
it,made,me,think,of,you,as,one,of,my,family
it,was,not,for,want,of,love,my,good,lord
i,have,such,a,delicate,disposition,and,your,scar,is,so,dreadful,to,look,upon
he,gave,an,exaggerated,shudder
your,poor,nose
tyrion,rubbed,irritably,at,the,scab
perhaps,i,should,have,a,new,one,made,of,gold
what,sort,of,nose,would,you,suggest,varys
one,like,yours,to,smell,out,secrets
or,should,i,tell,the,goldsmith,that,i,want,my,father’s,nose
he,smiled
my,noble,father,labors,so,diligently,that,i,scarce,see,him,anymore
tell,me,is,it,true,that,he’s,restoring,grand,maester,pycelle,to,the,small,council
it,is,my,lord
do,i,have,my,sweet,sister,to,thank,for,that
pycelle,had,been,his,sister’s,creature,tyrion,had,stripped,the,man,of,office,beard,and,dignity,and,flung,him,down,into,a,black,cell
not,at,all,my,lord
thank,the,archmaesters,of,oldtown,those,who,wished,to,insist,on,pycelle’s,restoration,on,the,grounds,that,only,the,conclave,may,make,or,unmake,a,grand,maester
bloody,fools,thought,tyrion
i,seem,to,recall,that,maegor,the,cruel’s,headsman,unmade,three,with,his,axe
quite,true,varys,said
and,the,second,aegon,fed,grand,maester,gerardys,to,his,dragon
alas,i,am,quite,dragonless
i,suppose,i,could,have,dipped,pycelle,in,wildfire,and,set,him,ablaze
would,the,citadel,have,preferred,that
well,it,would,have,been,more,in,keeping,with,tradition
the,eunuch,tittered
thankfully,wiser,heads,prevailed,and,the,conclave,accepted,the,fact,of,pycelle’s,dismissal,and,set,about,choosing,his,successor
after,giving,due,consideration,to,maester,turquin,the,cordwainer’s,son,and,maester,erreck,the,hedge,knight’s,bastard,and,thereby,demonstrating,to,their,own,satisfaction,that,ability,counts,for,more,than,birth,in,their,order,the,conclave,was,on,the,verge,of,sending,us,maester,gormon,a,tyrell,of,highgarden
when,i,told,your,lord,father,he,acted,at,once
the,conclave,met,in,oldtown,behind,closed,doors,tyrion,knew,its,deliberations,were,supposedly,a,secret
so,varys,has,little,birds,in,the,citadel,too
i,see
so,my,father,decided,to,nip,the,rose,before,it,bloomed
he,had,to,chuckle
pycelle,is,a,toad
but,better,a,lannister,toad,than,a,tyrell,toad,no
grand,maester,pycelle,has,always,been,a,good,friend,to,your,house,varys,said,sweetly
perhaps,it,will,console,you,to,learn,that,ser,boros,blount,is,also,being,restored
cersei,had,stripped,ser,boros,of,his,white,cloak,for,failing,to,die,in,the,defense,of,prince,tommen,when,bronn,had,seized,the,boy,on,the,rosby,road
the,man,was,no,friend,of,tyrion’s,but,after,that,he,likely,hated,cersei,almost,as,much
i,suppose,that’s,something
blount,is,a,blustering,coward,he,said,amiably
is,he
oh,dear
still,the,knights,of,the,kingsguard,do,serve,for,life,traditionally
perhaps,ser,boros,will,prove,braver,in,future
he,will,no,doubt,remain,very,loyal
to,my,father,said,tyrion,pointedly
while,we,are,on,the,subject,of,the,kingsguard
i,wonder,could,this,delightfully,unexpected,visit,of,yours,happen,to,concern,ser,boros’s,fallen,brother,the,gallant,ser,mandon,moore
the,eunuch,stroked,a,powdered,cheek
your,man,bronn,seems,most,interested,in,him,of,late
bronn,had,turned,up,all,he,could,on,ser,mandon,but,no,doubt,varys,knew,a,deal,more
should,he,choose,to,share,it
the,man,seems,to,have,been,quite,friendless,tyrion,said,carefully
sadly,said,varys,oh,sadly
you,might,find,some,kin,if,you,turned,over,enough,stones,back,in,the,vale,but,here
lord,arryn,brought,him,to,king’s,landing,and,robert,gave,him,his,white,cloak,but,neither,loved,him,much,i,fear
nor,was,he,the,sort,the,smallfolk,cheer,in,tourneys,despite,his,undoubted,prowess
why,even,his,brothers,of,the,kingsguard,never,warmed,to,him
ser,barristan,was,once,heard,to,say,that,the,man,had,no,friend,but,his,sword,and,no,life,but,duty
but,you,know,i,do,not,think,selmy,meant,it,altogether,as,praise
which,is,queer,when,you,consider,it,is,it,not
those,are,the,very,qualities,we,seek,in,our,kingsguard,it,could,be,said,men,who,live,not,for,themselves,but,for,their,king
by,those,lights,our,brave,ser,mandon,was,the,perfect,white,knight
and,he,died,as,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,ought,with,sword,in,hand,defending,one,of,the,king’s,own,blood
the,eunuch,gave,him,a,slimy,smile,and,watched,him,sharply
trying,to,murder,one,of,the,king’s,own,blood,you,mean
tyrion,wondered,if,varys,knew,rather,more,than,he,was,saying
nothing,he’d,just,heard,was,new,to,him,bronn,had,brought,back,much,the,same,reports
he,needed,a,link,to,cersei,some,sign,that,ser,mandon,had,been,his,sister’s,catspaw
what,we,want,is,not,always,what,we,get,he,reflected,bitterly,which,reminded,him
it,is,not,ser,mandon,who,brings,me,here
to,be,sure
the,eunuch,crossed,the,room,to,his,flagon,of,water
may,i,serve,you,my,lord
he,asked,as,he,filled,a,cup
yes
but,not,with,water
he,folded,his,hands,together
i,want,you,to,bring,me,shae
varys,took,a,drink
is,that,wise,my,lord
the,dear,sweet,child
it,would,be,such,a,shame,if,your,father,hanged,her
it,did,not,surprise,him,that,varys,knew
no,it’s,not,wise,it’s,bloody,madness
i,want,to,see,her,one,last,time,before,i,send,her,away
i,cannot,abide,having,her,so,close
i,understand
how,could,you
tyrion,had,seen,her,only,yesterday,climbing,the,serpentine,steps,with,a,pail,of,water
he,had,watched,as,a,young,knight,had,offered,to,carry,the,heavy,pail
the,way,she,had,touched,his,arm,and,smiled,for,him,had,tied,tyrion’s,guts,into,knots
they,passed,within,inches,of,each,other,him,descending,and,her,climbing,so,close,that,he,could,smell,the,clean,fresh,scent,of,her,hair
m’lord,she’d,said,to,him,with,a,little,curtsy,and,he,wanted,to,reach,out,and,grab,her,and,kiss,her,right,there,but,all,he,could,do,was,nod,stiffly,and,waddle,on,past
i,have,seen,her,several,times,he,told,varys,but,i,dare,not,speak,to,her
i,suspect,that,all,my,movements,are,being,watched
you,are,wise,to,suspect,so,my,good,lord
who
he,cocked,his,head
the,kettleblacks,report,frequently,to,your,sweet,sister
when,i,think,of,how,much,coin,i,paid,those,wretched
do,you,think,there’s,any,chance,that,more,gold,might,win,them,away,from,cersei
there,is,always,a,chance,but,i,should,not,care,to,wager,on,the,likelihood
they,are,knights,now,all,three,and,your,sister,has,promised,them,further,advancement
a,wicked,little,titter,burst,from,the,eunuch’s,lips
and,the,eldest,ser,osmund,of,the,kingsguard,dreams,of,certain,other
favors
as,well
you,can,match,the,queen,coin,for,coin,i,have,no,doubt,but,she,has,a,second,purse,that,is,quite,inexhaustible
seven,hells,thought,tyrion
are,you,suggesting,that,cersei’s,fucking,osmund,kettleblack
oh,dear,me,no,that,would,be,dreadfully,dangerous,don’t,you,think
no,the,queen,only,hints
perhaps,on,the,morrow,or,when,the,wedding’s,done
and,then,a,smile,a,whisper,a,ribald,jest
a,breast,brushing,lightly,against,his,sleeve,as,they,pass
and,yet,it,seems,to,serve
but,what,would,a,eunuch,know,of,such,things
the,tip,of,his,tongue,ran,across,his,lower,lip,like,a,shy,pink,animal
if,i,could,somehow,push,them,beyond,sly,fondling,arrange,for,father,to,catch,them,abed,together
tyrion,fingered,the,scab,on,his,nose
he,did,not,see,how,it,could,be,done,but,perhaps,some,plan,would,come,to,him,later
are,the,kettleblacks,the,only,ones
would,that,were,true,my,lord
i,fear,there,are,many,eyes,upon,you
you,are
how,shall,we,say
conspicuous
and,not,well,loved,it,grieves,me,to,tell,you
janos,slynt’s,sons,would,gladly,inform,on,you,to,avenge,their,father,and,our,sweet,lord,petyr,has,friends,in,half,the,brothels,of,king’s,landing
should,you,be,so,unwise,as,to,visit,any,of,them,he,will,know,at,once,and,your,lord,father,soon,thereafter
it’s,even,worse,than,i,feared
and,my,father
who,does,he,have,spying,on,me
this,time,the,eunuch,laughed,aloud
why,me,my,lord
tyrion,laughed,as,well
he,was,not,so,great,a,fool,as,to,trust,varys,any,further,than,he,had,to,but,the,eunuch,already,knew,enough,about,shae,to,get,her,well,and,thoroughly,hanged
you,will,bring,shae,to,me,through,the,walls,hidden,from,all,these,eyes
as,you,have,done,before
varys,wrung,his,hands
oh,my,lord,nothing,would,please,me,more,but
king,maegor,wanted,no,rats,in,his,own,walls,if,you,take,my,meaning
he,did,require,a,means,of,secret,egress,should,he,ever,be,trapped,by,his,enemies,but,that,door,does,not,connect,with,any,other,passages
i,can,steal,your,shae,away,from,lady,lollys,for,a,time,to,be,sure,but,i,have,no,way,to,bring,her,to,your,bedchamber,without,us,being,seen
then,bring,her,somewhere,else
but,where
there,is,no,safe,place
there,is
tyrion,grinned
here
it’s,time,to,put,that,rock-hard,bed,of,yours,to,better,use,i,think
the,eunuch’s,mouth,opened
then,he,giggled
lollys,tires,easily,these,days
she,is,great,with,child
i,imagine,she,will,be,safely,asleep,by,moonrise
tyrion,hopped,down,from,the,chair
moonrise,then
see,that,you,lay,in,some,wine
and,two,clean,cups
varys,bowed
it,shall,be,as,my,lord,commands
the,rest,of,the,day,seemed,to,creep,by,as,slow,as,a,worm,in,molasses
tyrion,climbed,to,the,castle,library,and,tried,to,distract,himself,with,beldecar’s,history,of,the,rhoynish,wars,but,he,could,hardly,see,the,elephants,for,imagining,shae’s,smile
come,the,afternoon,he,put,the,book,aside,and,called,for,a,bath
he,scrubbed,himself,until,the,water,grew,cool,and,then,had,pod,even,out,his,whiskers
his,beard,was,a,trial,to,him,a,tangle,of,yellow,white,and,black,hairs,patchy,and,coarse,it,was,seldom,less,than,unsightly,but,it,did,serve,to,conceal,some,of,his,face,and,that,was,all,to,the,good
when,he,was,as,clean,and,pink,and,trimmed,as,he,was,like,to,get,tyrion,looked,over,his,wardrobe,and,chose,a,pair,of,tight,satin,breeches,in,lannister,crimson,and,his,best,doublet,the,heavy,black,velvet,with,the,lion’s,head,studs
he,would,have,donned,his,chain,of,golden,hands,as,well,if,his,father,hadn’t,stolen,it,while,he,lay,dying
it,was,not,until,he,was,dressed,that,he,realized,the,depths,of,his,folly
seven,hells,dwarf,did,you,lose,all,your,sense,along,with,your,nose
anyone,who,sees,you,is,going,to,wonder,why,you’ve,put,on,your,court,clothes,to,visit,the,eunuch
cursing,tyrion,stripped,and,dressed,again,in,simpler,garb,black,woolen,breeches,an,old,white,tunic,and,a,faded,brown,leather,jerkin
it,doesn’t,matter,he,told,himself,as,he,waited,for,moonrise
whatever,you,wear,you’re,still,a,dwarf
you’ll,never,be,as,tall,as,that,knight,on,the,steps,him,with,his,long,straight,legs,and,hard,stomach,and,wide,manly,shoulders
the,moon,was,peeping,over,the,castle,wall,when,he,told,podrick,payne,that,he,was,going,to,pay,a,call,on,varys
will,you,be,long,my,lord
the,boy,asked
oh,i,hope,so
with,the,red,keep,so,crowded,tyrion,could,not,hope,to,go,unnoticed
ser,balon,swann,stood,guard,on,the,door,and,ser,loras,tyrell,on,the,drawbridge
he,stopped,to,exchange,pleasantries,with,both,of,them
it,was,strange,to,see,the,knight,of,flowers,all,in,white,when,before,he,had,always,been,as,colorful,as,a,rainbow
how,old,are,you,ser,loras
tyrion,asked,him
seventeen,my,lord
seventeen,and,beautiful,and,already,a,legend
half,the,girls,in,the,seven,kingdoms,want,to,bed,him,and,all,the,boys,want,to,be,him
if,you,will,pardon,my,asking,ser,why,would,anyone,choose,to,join,the,kingsguard,at,seventeen
prince,aemon,the,dragonknight,took,his,vows,at,seventeen,ser,loras,said,and,your,brother,jaime,was,younger,still
i,know,their,reasons
what,are,yours
the,honor,of,serving,beside,such,paragons,as,meryn,trant,and,boros,blount
he,gave,the,boy,a,mocking,grin
to,guard,the,king’s,life,you,surrender,your,own
you,give,up,your,lands,and,titles,give,up,hope,of,marriage,children
house,tyrell,continues,through,my,brothers,ser,loras,said
it,is,not,necessary,for,a,third,son,to,wed,or,breed
not,necessary,but,some,find,it,pleasant
what,of,love
when,the,sun,has,set,no,candle,can,replace,it
is,that,from,a,song
tyrion,cocked,his,head,smiling
yes,you,are,seventeen,i,see,that,now
ser,loras,tensed
do,you,mock,me
a,prickly,lad
no
if,i’ve,given,offense,forgive,me
i,had,my,own,love,once,and,we,had,a,song,as,well
i,loved,a,maid,as,fair,as,summer,with,sunlight,in,her,hair
he,bid,ser,loras,a,good,evening,and,went,on,his,way
near,the,kennels,a,group,of,men-at-arms,were,fighting,a,pair,of,dogs
tyrion,stopped,long,enough,to,see,the,smaller,dog,tear,half,the,face,off,the,larger,one,and,earned,a,few,coarse,laughs,by,observing,that,the,loser,now,resembled,sandor,clegane
then,hoping,he,had,disarmed,their,suspicions,he,proceeded,to,the,north,wall,and,down,the,short,flight,of,steps,to,the,eunuch’s,meager,abode
the,door,opened,as,he,was,lifting,his,hand,to,knock
varys
tyrion,slipped,inside
are,you,there
a,single,candle,lit,the,gloom,spicing,the,air,with,the,scent,of,jasmine
my,lord
a,woman,sidled,into,the,light,plump,soft,matronly,with,a,round,pink,moon,of,a,face,and,heavy,dark,curls
tyrion,recoiled
is,something,amiss
she,asked
varys,he,realized,with,annoyance
for,one,horrid,moment,i,thought,you’d,brought,me,lollys,instead,of,shae
where,is,she
here,m’lord
she,put,her,hands,over,his,eyes,from,behind
can,you,guess,what,i’m,wearing
nothing
oh,you’re,so,smart,she,pouted,snatching,her,hands,away
how,did,you,know
you’re,very,beautiful,in,nothing
am,i
she,said
am,i,truly
oh,yes
then,shouldn’t,you,be,fucking,me,instead,of,talking
we,need,to,rid,ourselves,of,lady,varys,first
i,am,not,the,sort,of,dwarf,who,likes,an,audience
he’s,gone,shae,said
tyrion,turned,to,look
it,was,true
the,eunuch,had,vanished,skirts,and,all
the,hidden,doors,are,here,somewhere,they,have,to,be
that,was,as,much,as,he,had,time,to,think,before,shae,turned,his,head,to,kiss,him
her,mouth,was,wet,and,hungry,and,she,did,not,even,seem,to,see,his,scar,or,the,raw,scab,where,his,nose,had,been
her,skin,was,warm,silk,beneath,his,fingers
when,his,thumb,brushed,against,her,left,nipple,it,hardened,at,once
hurry,she,urged,between,kisses,as,his,fingers,went,to,his,laces,oh,hurry,hurry,i,want,you,in,me,in,me,in,me
he,did,not,even,have,time,to,undress,properly
shae,pulled,his,cock,out,of,his,breeches,then,pushed,him,down,onto,the,floor,and,climbed,atop,him
she,screamed,as,he,pushed,past,her,lips,and,rode,him,wildly,moaning,my,giant,my,giant,my,giant,every,time,she,slammed,down,on,him
tyrion,was,so,eager,that,he,exploded,on,the,fifth,stroke,but,shae,did,not,seem,to,mind
she,smiled,wickedly,when,she,felt,him,spurting,and,leaned,forward,to,kiss,the,sweat,from,his,brow
my,giant,of,lannister,she,murmured
stay,inside,me,please
i,like,to,feel,you,there
so,tyrion,did,not,move,except,to,put,his,arms,around,her
it,feels,so,good,to,hold,her,and,to,be,held,he,thought
how,can,something,this,sweet,be,a,crime,worth,hanging,her,for
shae,he,said,sweetling,this,must,be,our,last,time,together
the,danger,is,too,great
if,my,lord,father,should,find,you
i,like,your,scar
she,traced,it,with,her,finger
it,makes,you,look,very,fierce,and,strong
he,laughed
very,ugly,you,mean
m’lord,will,never,be,ugly,in,my,eyes
she,kissed,the,scab,that,covered,the,ragged,stub,of,his,nose
it’s,not,my,face,that,need,concern,you,it’s,my,father,he,does,not,frighten,me
will,m’lord,give,me,back,my,jewels,and,silks,now
i,asked,varys,if,i,could,have,them,when,you,were,hurt,in,the,battle,but,he,wouldn’t,give,them,to,me
what,would,have,become,of,them,if,you’d,died
i,didn’t,die
here,i,am
i,know
shae,wriggled,atop,him,smiling
just,where,you,belong
her,mouth,turned,pouty
but,how,long,must,i,go,on,with,lollys,now,that,you’re,well
have,you,been,listening
tyrion,said
you,can,stay,with,lollys,if,you,like,but,it,would,be,best,if,you,left,the,city
i,don’t,want,to,leave
you,promised,you’d,move,me,into,a,manse,again,after,the,battle
her,cunt,gave,him,a,little,squeeze,and,he,started,to,stiffen,again,inside,her
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts,you,said
shae,gods,be,damned,stop,that
listen,to,me
you,have,to,go,away
the,city’s,full,of,tyrells,just,now,and,i,am,closely,watched
you,don’t,understand,the,dangers
can,i,come,to,the,king’s,wedding,feast
lollys,won’t,go
i,told,her,no,one’s,like,to,rape,her,in,the,king’s,own,throne,room,but,she’s,so,stupid
when,shae,rolled,off,his,cock,slid,out,of,her,with,a,soft,wet,sound
symon,says,there’s,to,be,a,singers’,tourney,and,tumblers,even,a,fools’,joust
tyrion,had,almost,forgotten,about,shae’s,thrice-damned,singer
how,is,it,you,spoke,to,symon
i,told,lady,tanda,about,him,and,she,hired,him,to,play,for,lollys
the,music,calms,her,when,the,baby,starts,to,kick
symon,says,there’s,to,be,a,dancing,bear,at,the,feast,and,wines,from,the,arbor
i’ve,never,seen,a,bear,dance
they,do,it,worse,than,i,do
it,was,the,singer,who,concerned,him,not,the,bear
one,careless,word,in,the,wrong,ear,and,shae,would,hang
symon,says,there’s,to,be,seventy-seven,courses,and,a,hundred,doves,baked,into,a,great,pie,shae,gushed
when,the,crust’s,opened,they’ll,all,burst,out,and,fly
after,which,they,will,roost,in,the,rafters,and,rain,down,birdshit,on,the,guests
tyrion,had,suffered,such,wedding,pies,before
the,doves,liked,to,shit,on,him,especially,or,so,he,had,always,suspected
couldn’t,i,dress,in,my,silks,and,velvets,and,go,as,a,lady,instead,of,a,maidservant
no,one,would,know,i,wasn’t
everyone,would,know,you,weren’t,thought,tyrion
lady,tanda,might,wonder,where,lollys’s,bedmaid,found,so,many,jewels
there’s,to,be,a,thousand,guests,symon,says
she’d,never,even,see,me
i’d,find,a,place,in,some,dark,corner,below,the,salt,but,whenever,you,got,up,to,go,to,the,privy,i,could,slip,out,and,meet,you
she,cupped,his,cock,and,stroked,it,gently
i,won’t,wear,any,smallclothes,under,my,gown,so,m’lord,won’t,even,need,to,unlace,me
her,fingers,teased,him,up,and,down
or,if,he,liked,i,could,do,this,for,him
she,took,him,in,her,mouth
tyrion,was,soon,ready,again
this,time,he,lasted,much,longer
when,he,finished,shae,crawled,back,up,him,and,curled,up,naked,under,his,arm
you’ll,let,me,come,won’t,you
shae,he,groaned,it,is,not,safe
for,a,time,she,said,nothing,at,all
tyrion,tried,to,speak,of,other,things,but,he,met,a,wall,of,sullen,courtesy,as,icy,and,unyielding,as,the,wall,he’d,once,walked,in,the,north
gods,be,good,he,thought,wearily,as,he,watched,the,candle,burn,down,and,begin,to,gutter,how,could,i,let,this,happen,again,after,tysha
am,i,as,great,a,fool,as,my,father,thinks
gladly,would,he,have,given,her,the,promise,she,wanted,and,gladly,walked,her,back,to,his,own,bedchamber,on,his,arm,to,let,her,dress,in,the,silks,and,velvets,she,loved,so,much
had,the,choice,been,his,she,could,have,sat,beside,him,at,joffrey’s,wedding,feast,and,danced,with,all,the,bears,she,liked
but,he,could,not,see,her,hang
when,the,candle,burned,out,tyrion,disentangled,himself,and,lit,another
then,he,made,a,round,of,the,walls,tapping,on,each,in,turn,searching,for,the,hidden,door
shae,sat,with,her,legs,drawn,up,and,her,arms,wrapped,around,them,watching,him
finally,she,said,they’re,under,the,bed
the,secret,steps
he,looked,at,her,incredulous
the,bed
the,bed,is,solid,stone
it,weighs,half,a,ton
there’s,a,place,where,varys,pushes,and,it,floats,right,up
i,asked,him,how,and,he,said,it,was,magic
yes
tyrion,had,to,grin
a,counterweight,spell
shae,stood
i,should,go,back
sometimes,the,baby,kicks,and,lollys,wakes,and,calls,for,me
varys,should,return,shortly
he’s,probably,listening,to,every,word,we,say
tyrion,set,the,candle,down
there,was,a,wet,spot,on,the,front,of,his,breeches,but,in,the,darkness,it,ought,to,go,unnoticed
he,told,shae,to,dress,and,wait,for,the,eunuch
i,will,she,promised
you,are,my,lion,aren’t,you
my,giant,of,lannister
i,am,he,said
and,you’re,your,whore
she,laid,a,finger,to,his,lips
i,know
i’d,be,your,lady,but,i,never,can
else,you’d,take,me,to,the,feast
it,doesn’t,matter
i,like,being,a,whore,for,you,tyrion
just,keep,me,my,lion,and,keep,me,safe
i,shall,he,promised
fool,fool,the,voice,inside,him,screamed
why,did,you,say,that
you,came,here,to,send,her,away
instead,he,kissed,her,once,more
the,walk,back,seemed,long,and,lonely
podrick,payne,was,asleep,in,his,trundle,bed,at,the,foot,of,tyrion’s,but,he,woke,the,boy
bronn,he,said
ser,bronn
pod,rubbed,the,sleep,from,his,eyes
oh
should,i,get,him
my,lord
why,no,i,woke,you,up,so,we,could,have,a,little,chat,about,the,way,he,dresses,said,tyrion,but,his,sarcasm,was,wasted
pod,only,gaped,at,him,in,confusion,until,he,threw,up,his,hands,and,said,yes,get,him
bring,him
now
the,lad,dressed,hurriedly,and,all,but,ran,from,the,room
am,i,really,so,terrifying
tyrion,wondered,as,he,changed,into,a,bedrobe,and,poured,himself,some,wine
he,was,on,his,third,cup,and,half,the,night,was,gone,before,pod,finally,returned,with,the,sellsword,knight,in,tow
i,hope,the,boy,had,a,damn,good,reason,dragging,me,out,of,chataya’s,bronn,said,as,he,seated,himself
chataya’s
tyrion,said,annoyed
it’s,good,to,be,a,knight
no,more,looking,for,the,cheaper,brothels,down,the,street
bronn,grinned
now,it’s,alayaya,and,marei,in,the,same,featherbed,with,ser,bronn,in,the,middle
tyrion,had,to,bite,back,his,annoyance
bronn,had,as,much,right,to,bed,alayaya,as,any,other,man,but,still
i,never,touched,her,much,as,i,wanted,to,but,bronn,could,not,know,that
he,should,have,kept,his,cock,out,of,her
he,dare,not,visit,chataya’s,himself
if,he,did,cersei,would,see,that,his,father,heard,of,it,and,’yaya,would,suffer,more,than,a,whipping
he’d,sent,the,girl,a,necklace,of,silver,and,jade,and,a,pair,of,matching,bracelets,by,way,of,apology,but,other,than,that
this,is,fruitless
there,is,a,singer,who,calls,himself,symon,silver,tongue,tyrion,said,wearily,pushing,his,guilt,aside
he,plays,for,lady,tanda’s,daughter,sometimes
what,of,him
kill,him,he,might,have,said,but,the,man,had,done,nothing,but,sing,a,few,songs
and,fill,shae’s,sweet,head,with,visions,of,doves,and,dancing,bears
find,him,he,said,instead
find,him,before,someone,else,does
arya,she,was,grubbing,for,vegetables,in,a,dead,man’s,garden,when,she,heard,the,singing
arya,stiffened,still,as,stone,listening,the,three,stringy,carrots,in,her,hand,suddenly,forgotten
she,thought,of,the,bloody,mummers,and,roose,bolton’s,men,and,a,shiver,of,fear,went,down,her,back
it’s,not,fair,not,when,we,finally,found,the,trident,not,when,we,thought,we,were,almost,safe
only,why,would,the,mummers,be,singing
the,song,came,drifting,up,the,river,from,somewhere,beyond,the,little,rise,to,the,east
off,to,gulltown,to,see,the,fair,maid,heigh-ho,heigh-ho
arya,rose,carrots,dangling,from,her,hand
it,sounded,like,the,singer,was,coming,up,the,river,road
over,among,the,cabbages,hot,pie,had,heard,it,too,to,judge,by,the,look,on,his,face
gendry,had,gone,to,sleep,in,the,shade,of,the,burned,cottage,and,was,past,hearing,anything
i’ll,steal,a,sweet,kiss,with,the,point,of,my,blade,heigh-ho,heigh-ho
she,thought,she,heard,a,woodharp,too,beneath,the,soft,rush,of,the,river
do,you,hear
hot,pie,asked,in,a,hoarse,whisper,as,he,hugged,an,armful,of,cabbages
someone’s,coming
go,wake,gendry,arya,told,him
just,shake,him,by,the,shoulder,don’t,make,a,lot,of,noise
gendry,was,easy,to,wake,unlike,hot,pie,who,needed,to,be,kicked,and,shouted,at
i’ll,make,her,my,love,and,we’ll,rest,in,the,shade,heigh-ho,heigh-ho
the,song,swelled,louder,with,every,word
hot,pie,opened,his,arms
the,cabbages,fell,to,the,ground,with,soft,thumps
we,have,to,hide
where
the,burned,cottage,and,its,overgrown,garden,stood,hard,beside,the,banks,of,the,trident
there,were,a,few,willows,growing,along,the,river’s,edge,and,reed,beds,in,the,muddy,shallows,beyond,but,most,of,the,ground,hereabouts,was,painfully,open
i,knew,we,should,never,have,left,the,woods,she,thought
they’d,been,so,hungry,though,and,the,garden,had,been,too,much,a,temptation
the,bread,and,cheese,they,had,stolen,from,harrenhal,had,given,out,six,days,ago,back,in,the,thick,of,the,woods
take,gendry,and,the,horses,behind,the,cottage,she,decided
there,was,part,of,one,wall,still,standing,big,enough,maybe,to,conceal,two,boys,and,three,horses
if,the,horses,don’t,whinny,and,that,singer,doesn’t,come,poking,around,the,garden
what,about,you
i’ll,hide,by,the,tree
he’s,probably,alone
if,he,bothers,me,i’ll,kill,him
go
hot,pie,went,and,arya,dropped,her,carrots,and,drew,the,stolen,sword,from,over,her,shoulder
she,had,strapped,the,sheath,across,her,back,the,longsword,was,made,for,a,man,grown,and,it,bumped,against,the,ground,when,she,wore,it,on,her,hip
it’s,too,heavy,besides,she,thought,missing,needle,the,way,she,did,every,time,she,took,this,clumsy,thing,in,her,hand
but,it,was,a,sword,and,she,could,kill,with,it,that,was,enough
lightfoot,she,moved,to,the,big,old,willow,that,grew,beside,the,bend,in,the,road,and,went,to,one,knee,in,the,grass,and,mud,within,the,veil,of,trailing,branches
you,old,gods,she,prayed,as,the,singer’s,voice,grew,louder,you,tree,gods,hide,me,and,make,him,go,past
then,a,horse,whickered,and,the,song,broke,off,suddenly
he’s,heard,she,knew,but,maybe,he’s,alone,or,if,he’s,not,maybe,they’ll,be,as,scared,of,us,as,we,are,of,them
did,you,hear,that
a,man’s,voice,said
there’s,something,behind,that,wall,i,would,say
aye,replied,a,second,voice,deeper
what,do,you,think,it,might,be,archer
two,then
arya,bit,her,lip
she,could,not,see,them,from,where,she,knelt,on,account,of,the,willow
but,she,could,hear
a,bear
a,third,voice,or,the,first,one,again
a,lot,of,meat,on,a,bear,the,deep,voice,said
a,lot,of,fat,as,well,in,fall
good,to,eat,if,it’s,cooked,up,right
could,be,a,wolf
maybe,a,lion
with,four,feet,you,think
or,two
makes,no,matter
does,it
not,so,i,know
archer,what,do,you,mean,to,do,with,all,them,arrows
drop,a,few,shafts,over,the,wall
whatever’s,hiding,back,there,will,come,out,quick,enough,watch,and,see
what,if,it’s,some,honest,man,back,there,though
or,some,poor,woman,with,a,little,babe,at,her,breast
an,honest,man,would,come,out,and,show,us,his,face
only,an,outlaw,would,skulk,and,hide
aye,that’s,so
go,on,and,loose,your,shafts,then
arya,sprang,to,her,feet
don’t
she,showed,them,her,sword
there,were,three,she,saw
only,three
syrio,could,fight,more,than,three,and,she,had,hot,pie,and,gendry,to,stand,with,her,maybe
but,they’re,boys,and,these,are,men
they,were,men,afoot,travel-stained,and,mud-specked
she,knew,the,singer,by,the,woodharp,he,cradled,against,his,jerkin,as,a,mother,might,cradle,a,babe
a,small,man,fifty,from,the,look,of,him,he,had,a,big,mouth,a,sharp,nose,and,thinning,brown,hair
his,faded,greens,were,mended,here,and,there,with,old,leather,patches,and,he,wore,a,brace,of,throwing,knives,on,his,hip,and,a,woodman’s,axe,slung,across,his,back
the,man,beside,him,stood,a,good,foot,taller,and,had,the,look,of,a,soldier
a,longsword,and,dirk,hung,from,his,studded,leather,belt,rows,of,overlapping,steel,rings,were,sewn,onto,his,shirt,and,his,head,was,covered,by,a,black,iron,halfhelm,shaped,like,a,cone
he,had,bad,teeth,and,a,bushy,brown,beard,but,it,was,his,hooded,yellow,cloak,that,drew,the,eye
thick,and,heavy,stained,here,with,grass,and,there,with,blood,frayed,along,the,bottom,and,patched,with,deerskin,on,the,right,shoulder,the,greatcloak,gave,the,big,man,the,look,of,some,huge,yellow,bird
the,last,of,the,three,was,a,youth,as,skinny,as,his,longbow,if,not,quite,as,tall
red-haired,and,freckled,he,wore,a,studded,brigantine,high,boots,fingerless,leather,gloves,and,a,quiver,on,his,back
his,arrows,were,fletched,with,grey,goose,feathers,and,six,of,them,stood,in,the,ground,before,him,like,a,little,fence
the,three,men,looked,at,her,standing,there,in,the,road,with,her,blade,in,hand
then,the,singer,idly,plucked,a,string
boy,he,said,put,up,that,sword,now,unless,you’re,wanting,to,be,hurt
it’s,too,big,for,you,lad,and,besides,anguy,here,could,put,three,shafts,through,you,before,you,could,hope,to,reach,us
he,could,not,arya,said,and,i’m,a,girl

there,are,wolves,in,these,parts,and,lions,and,worse,things
no,place,for,a,little,girl,to,be,wandering,alone

gendry,rode,out,from,behind,the,cottage,wall,and,behind,him,hot,pie,leading,her,horse
in,his,chainmail,shirt,with,a,sword,in,his,hand,gendry,looked,almost,a,man,grown,and,dangerous

we’ll,have,no,more,of,that,now
he,twisted,her,arm,until,her,hand,opened
his,fingers,were,hard,with,callus,and,fearsomely,strong
again
arya,thought
it’s,happening,again,like,it,happened,in,the,village,with,chiswyck,and,raff,and,the,mountain,that,rides
they,were,going,to,steal,her,sword,and,turn,her,back,into,a,mouse
her,free,hand,closed,around,her,tankard,and,she,swung,it,at,lem’s,face
the,ale,sloshed,over,the,rim,and,splashed,into,his,eyes,and,she,heard,his,nose,break,and,saw,the,spurt,of,blood
when,he,roared,his,hands,went,to,his,face,and,she,was,free
run
she,screamed,bolting
but,lem,was,on,her,again,at,once,with,his,long,legs,that,made,one,of,his,steps,equal,to,three,of,hers
she,twisted,and,kicked,but,he,yanked,her,off,her,feet,effortlessly,and,held,her,dangling,while,the,blood,ran,down,his,face
stop,it,you,little,fool,he,shouted,shaking,her,back,and,forth
stop,it,now
gendry,moved,to,help,her,until,tom,sevenstrings,stepped,in,front,of,him,with,a,dagger
by,then,it,was,too,late,to,flee
she,could,hear,horses,outside,and,the,sound,of,men’s,voices
a,moment,later,a,man,came,swaggering,through,the,open,door,a,tyroshi,even,bigger,than,lem,with,a,great,thick,beard,bright,green,at,the,ends,but,growing,out,grey
behind,came,a,pair,of,crossbowmen,helping,a,wounded,man,between,them,and,then,others
a,more,ragged,band,arya,had,never,seen,but,there,was,nothing,ragged,about,the,swords,axes,and,bows,they,carried
one,or,two,gave,her,curious,glances,as,they,entered,but,no,one,said,a,word
a,one-eyed,man,in,a,rusty,pothelm,sniffed,the,air,and,grinned,while,an,archer,with,a,head,of,stiff,yellow,hair,was,shouting,for,ale
after,them,came,a,spearman,in,a,lioncrested,helm,an,older,man,with,a,limp,a,braavosi,sellsword,a
harwin
arya,whispered
it,was
under,the,beard,and,the,tangled,hair,was,the,face,of,hullen’s,son,who,used,to,lead,her,pony,around,the,yard,ride,at,quintain,with,jon,and,robb,and,drink,too,much,on,feast,days
he,was,thinner,harder,somehow,and,at,winterfell,he,had,never,worn,a,beard,but,it,was,him,her,father’s,man
harwin
squirming,she,threw,herself,forward,trying,to,wrench,free,of,lem’s,iron,grip
it’s,me,she,shouted,harwin,it’s,me,don’t,you,know,me,don’t,you
the,tears,came,and,she,found,herself,weeping,like,a,baby,just,like,some,stupid,little,girl
harwin,it’s,me
harwin’s,eyes,went,from,her,face,to,the,flayed,man,on,her,doublet
how,do,you,know,me
he,said,frowning,suspiciously
the,flayed,man
who,are,you,some,serving,boy,to,lord,leech
for,a,moment,she,did,not,know,how,to,answer
she’d,had,so,many,names
had,she,only,dreamed,arya,stark
i’m,a,girl,she,sniffed
i,was,lord,bolton’s,cupbearer,but,he,was,going,to,leave,me,for,the,goat,so,i,ran,off,with,gendry,and,hot,pie
you,have,to,know,me
you,used,to,lead,my,pony,when,i,was,little
his,eyes,went,wide

arya,underfoot
lem,let,go,of,her
she,broke,my,nose
lem,dumped,her,unceremoniously,to,the,floor
who,in,seven,hells,is,she,supposed,to,be
the,hand’s,daughter
harwin,went,to,one,knee,before,her
arya,stark,of,winterfell
catelyn,robb,she,knew,the,moment,she,heard,the,kennels,erupt
her,son,had,returned,to,riverrun,and,grey,wind,with,him
only,the,scent,of,the,great,grey,direwolf,could,send,the,hounds,into,such,a,frenzy,of,baying,and,barking
he,will,come,to,me,she,knew
edmure,had,not,returned,after,his,first,visit,preferring,to,spend,his,days,with,marq,piper,and,patrek,mallister,listening,to,rymund,the,rhymer’s,verses,about,the,battle,at,the,stone,mill
robb,is,not,edmure,though
robb,will,see,me
it,had,been,raining,for,days,now,a,cold,grey,downpour,that,well,suited,catelyn’s,mood
her,father,was,growing,weaker,and,more,delirious,with,every,passing,day,waking,only,to,mutter,tansy,and,beg,forgiveness
edmure,shunned,her,and,ser,desmond,grell,still,denied,her,freedom,of,the,castle,however,unhappy,it,seemed,to,make,him
only,the,return,of,ser,robin,ryger,and,his,men,footweary,and,drenched,to,the,bone,served,to,lighten,her,spirits
they,had,walked,back,it,seemed
somehow,the,kingslayer,had,contrived,to,sink,their,galley,and,escape,maester,vyman,confided
catelyn,asked,if,she,might,speak,with,ser,robin,to,learn,more,of,what,had,happened,but,that,was,refused,her
something,else,was,wrong,as,well
on,the,day,her,brother,returned,a,few,hours,after,their,argument,she,had,heard,angry,voices,from,the,yard,below
when,she,climbed,to,the,roof,to,see,there,were,knots,of,men,gathered,across,the,castle,beside,the,main,gate
horses,were,being,led,from,the,stables,saddled,and,bridled,and,there,was,shouting,though,catelyn,was,too,far,away,to,make,out,the,words
one,of,robb’s,white,banners,lay,on,the,ground,and,one,of,the,knights,turned,his,horse,and,trampled,over,the,direwolf,as,he,spurred,toward,the,gate
several,others,did,the,same
those,are,men,who,fought,with,edmure,on,the,fords,she,thought
what,could,have,made,them,so,angry
has,my,brother,slighted,them,somehow,given,them,some,insult
she,thought,she,recognized,ser,perwyn,frey,who,had,traveled,with,her,to,bitterbridge,and,storm’s,end,and,back,and,his,bastard,half,brother,martyn,rivers,as,well,but,from,this,vantage,it,was,hard,to,be,certain
close,to,forty,men,poured,out,through,the,castle,gates,to,what,end,she,did,not,know
they,did,not,come,back
nor,would,maester,vyman,tell,her,who,they,had,been,where,they,had,gone,or,what,had,made,them,so,angry
i,am,here,to,see,to,your,father,and,only,that,my,lady,he,said
your,brother,will,soon,be,lord,of,riverrun
what,he,wishes,you,to,know,he,must,tell,you
but,now,robb,was,returned,from,the,west,returned,in,triumph
he,will,forgive,me,catelyn,told,herself
he,must,forgive,me,he,is,my,own,son,and,arya,and,sansa,are,as,much,his,blood,as,mine
he,will,free,me,from,these,rooms,and,then,i,will,know,what,has,happened
by,the,time,ser,desmond,came,for,her,she,had,bathed,and,dressed,and,combed,out,her,auburn,hair
king,robb,has,returned,from,the,west,my,lady,the,knight,said,and,commands,that,you,attend,him,in,the,great,hall
it,was,the,moment,she,had,dreamt,of,and,dreaded
have,i,lost,two,sons,or,three
she,would,know,soon,enough
the,hall,was,crowded,when,they,entered
every,eye,was,on,the,dais,but,catelyn,knew,their,backs,lady,mormont’s,patched,ringmail,the,greatjon,and,his,son,looming,above,every,other,head,in,the,hall,lord,jason,mallister,white-haired,with,his,winged,helm,in,the,crook,of,his,arm,tytos,blackwood,in,his,magnificent,raven-feather,cloak
half,of,them,will,want,to,hang,me,now
the,other,half,may,only,turn,their,eyes,away
she,had,the,uneasy,feeling,that,someone,was,missing,too
robb,stood,on,the,dais
he,is,a,boy,no,longer,she,realized,with,a,pang
he,is,sixteen,now,a,man,grown
just,look,at,him
war,had,melted,all,the,softness,from,his,face,and,left,him,hard,and,lean
he,had,shaved,his,beard,away,but,his,auburn,hair,fell,uncut,to,his,shoulders
the,recent,rains,had,rusted,his,mail,and,left,brown,stains,on,the,white,of,his,cloak,and,surcoat
or,perhaps,the,stains,were,blood
on,his,head,was,the,sword,crown,they,had,fashioned,him,of,bronze,and,iron
he,bears,it,more,comfortably,now
he,bears,it,like,a,king
edmure,stood,below,the,crowded,dais,head,bowed,modestly,as,robb,praised,his,victory

fell,at,the,stone,mill,shall,never,be,forgotten
small,wonder,lord,tywin,ran,off,to,fight,stannis
he’d,had,his,fill,of,northmen,and,rivermen,both
that,brought,laughter,and,approving,shouts,but,robb,raised,a,hand,for,quiet
make,no,mistake,though
the,lannisters,will,march,again,and,there,will,be,other,battles,to,win,before,the,kingdom,is,secure
the,greatjon,roared,out,king,in,the,north
and,thrust,a,mailed,fist,into,the,air
the,river,lords,answered,with,a,shout,of,king,of,the,trident
the,hall,grew,thunderous,with,pounding,fists,and,stamping,feet
only,a,few,noted,catelyn,and,ser,desmond,amidst,the,tumult,but,they,elbowed,their,fellows,and,slowly,a,hush,grew,around,her
she,held,her,head,high,and,ignored,the,eyes
let,them,think,what,they,will
it,is,robb’s,judgment,that,matters
the,sight,of,ser,brynden,tully’s,craggy,face,on,the,dais,gave,her,comfort
a,boy,she,did,not,know,seemed,to,be,acting,as,robb’s,squire
behind,him,stood,a,young,knight,in,a,sand-colored,surcoat,blazoned,with,seashells,and,an,older,one,who,wore,three,black,pepperpots,on,a,saffron,bend,across,a,field,of,green,and,silver,stripes
between,them,were,a,handsome,older,lady,and,a,pretty,maid,who,looked,to,be,her,daughter
there,was,another,girl,as,well,near,sansa’s,age
the,seashells,were,the,sigil,of,some,lesser,house,catelyn,knew,the,older,man’s,she,did,not,recognize
prisoners
why,would,robb,bring,captives,onto,the,dais
utherydes,wayn,banged,his,staff,on,the,floor,as,ser,desmond,escorted,her,forward
if,robb,looks,at,me,as,edmure,did,i,do,not,know,what,i,will,do
but,it,seemed,to,her,that,it,was,not,anger,she,saw,in,her,son’s,eyes,but,something,else
apprehension,perhaps
no,that,made,no,sense
what,should,he,fear
he,was,the,young,wolf,king,of,the,trident,and,the,north
her,uncle,was,the,first,to,greet,her
as,black,a,fish,as,ever,ser,brynden,had,no,care,for,what,others,might,think
he,leapt,off,the,dais,and,pulled,catelyn,into,his,arms
when,he,said,it,is,good,to,see,you,home,cat,she,had,to,struggle,to,keep,her,composure
and,you,she,whispered

reproaches,would,not,serve,here,however
all,she,said,was,tell,me,how,this,came,to,be
i,took,her,castle,and,she,took,my,heart,’,robb,smiled
the,crag,was,weakly,garrisoned,so,we,took,it,by,storm,one,night
black,walder,and,the,smalljon,led,scaling,parties,over,the,walls,while,i,broke,the,main,gate,with,a,ram
i,took,an,arrow,in,the,arm,just,before,ser,rolph,yielded,us,the,castle
it,seemed,nothing,at,first,but,it,festered
jeyne,had,me,taken,to,her,own,bed,and,she,nursed,me,until,the,fever,passed
and,she,was,with,me,when,the,greatjon,brought,me,the,news,of
of,winterfell
bran,and,rickon
he,seemed,to,have,trouble,saying,his,brothers’,names
that,night,she
she,comforted,me,mother
catelyn,did,not,need,to,be,told,what,sort,of,comfort,jeyne,westerling,had,offered,her,son
and,you,wed,her,the,next,day
he,looked,her,in,the,eyes,proud,and,miserable,all,at,once
it,was,the,only,honorable,thing,to,do
she’s,gentle,and,sweet,mother,she,will,make,me,a,good,wife
perhaps
that,will,not,appease,lord,frey
i,know,her,son,said,stricken
i’ve,made,a,botch,of,everything,but,the,battles,haven’t,i
i,thought,the,battles,would,be,the,hard,part,but
if,i,had,listened,to,you,and,kept,theon,as,my,hostage,i’d,still,rule,the,north,and,bran,and,rickon,would,be,alive,and,safe,in,winterfell
perhaps
or,not
lord,balon,might,still,have,chanced,war
the,last,time,he,reached,for,a,crown,it,cost,him,two,sons
he,might,have,thought,it,a,bargain,to,lose,only,one,this,time
she,touched,his,arm
what,happened,with,the,freys,after,you,wed
robb,shook,his,head
with,ser,stevron,i,might,have,been,able,to,make,amends,but,ser,ryman,is,dull-witted,as,a,stone,and,black,walder
that,one,was,not,named,for,the,color,of,his,beard,i,promise,you
he,went,so,far,as,to,say,that,his,sisters,would,not,be,loath,to,wed,a,widower
i,would,have,killed,him,for,that,if,jeyne,had,not,begged,me,to,be,merciful
you,have,done,house,frey,a,grievous,insult,robb
i,never,meant,to
ser,stevron,died,for,me,and,olyvar,was,as,loyal,a,squire,as,any,king,could,want
he,asked,to,stay,with,me,but,ser,ryman,took,him,with,the,rest
all,their,strength
the,greatjon,urged,me,to,attack,them
fighting,your,own,in,the,midst,of,your,enemies
she,said
it,would,have,been,the,end,of,you
yes
i,thought,perhaps,we,could,arrange,other,matches,for,lord,walder’s,daughters
ser,wendel,manderly,has,offered,to,take,one,and,the,greatjon,tells,me,his,uncles,wish,to,wed,again
if,lord,walder,will,be,reasonable,he,is,not,reasonable,said,catelyn
he,is,proud,and,prickly,to,a,fault
you,know,that
he,wanted,to,be,grandfather,to,a,king
you,will,not,appease,him,with,the,offer,of,two,hoary,old,brigands,and,the,second,son,of,the,fattest,man,in,the,seven,kingdoms
not,only,have,you,broken,your,oath,but,you’ve,slighted,the,honor,of,the,twins,by,choosing,a,bride,from,a,lesser,house
robb,bristled,at,that
the,westerlings,are,better,blood,than,the,freys
they’re,an,ancient,line,descended,from,the,first,men
the,kings,of,the,rock,sometimes,wed,westerlings,before,the,conquest,and,there,was,another,jeyne,westerling,who,was,queen,to,king,maegor,three,hundred,years,ago
all,of,which,will,only,salt,lord,walder’s,wounds
it,has,always,rankled,him,that,older,houses,look,down,on,the,freys,as,upstarts
this,insult,is,not,the,first,he’s,borne,to,hear,him,tell,it
jon,arryn,was,disinclined,to,foster,his,grandsons,and,my,father,refused,the,offer,of,one,of,his,daughters,for,edmure
she,inclined,her,head,toward,her,brother,as,he,rejoined,them
your,grace,brynden,blackflsh,said,perhaps,we,had,best,continue,this,in,private
yes
robb,sounded,tired
i,would,kill,for,a,cup,of,wine

robb,where,is,grey,wind
in,the,yard,with,a,haunch,of,mutton
i,told,the,kennelmaster,to,see,that,he,was,fed
you,always,kept,him,with,you,before
a,hall,is,no,place,for,a,wolf
he,gets,restless,you’ve,seen
growling,and,snapping
i,should,never,have,taken,him,into,battle,with,me
he’s,killed,too,many,men,to,fear,them,now
jeyne’s,anxious,around,him,and,he,terrifies,her,mother
and,there’s,the,heart,of,it,catelyn,thought
he,is,part,of,you,robb
to,fear,him,is,to,fear,you
i,am,not,a,wolf,no,matter,what,they,call,me
robb,sounded,cross

if,you,had,seen,i,saw,bran’s,wolf,tear,out,a,man’s,throat,at,winterfell,she,said,sharply,and,loved,him,for,it
that’s,different
the,man,at,the,crag,was,a,knight,jeyne,had,known,all,her,life
you,can’t,blame,her,for,being,afraid
grey,wind,doesn’t,like,her,uncle,either
he,bares,his,teeth,every,time,ser,rolph,comes,near,him
a,chill,went,through,her
send,ser,rolph,away
at,once
where
back,to,the,crag,so,the,lannisters,can,mount,his,head,on,a,spike
jeyne,loves,him
he’s,her,uncle,and,a,fair,knight,besides
i,need,more,men,like,rolph,spicer,not,fewer
i,am,not,going,to,banish,him,just,because,my,wolf,doesn’t,seem,to,like,the,way,he,smells
robb
she,stopped,and,held,his,arm
i,told,you,once,to,keep,theon,greyjoy,close,and,you,did,not,listen

there,might,be,others,whose,smell,he,mislikes
any,man,grey,wind,mislikes,is,a,man,i,do,not,want,close,to,you
these,wolves,are,more,than,wolves,robb
you,must,know,that

your,father’s,gods,the,old,gods,of,the,north
five,wolf,pups,robb,five,for,five,stark,children
six,said,robb
there,was,a,wolf,for,jon,as,well
i,found,them,remember
i,know,how,many,there,were,and,where,they,came,from
i,used,to,think,the,same,as,you,that,the,wolves,were,our,guardians,our,protectors,until
until
she,prompted
robb’s,mouth,tightened

until,they,told,me,that,theon,had,murdered,bran,and,rickon

i,am,no,longer,a,boy,mother
i’m,a,king,and,i,can,protect,myself
he,sighed
i,will,find,some,duty,for,ser,rolph,some,pretext,to,send,him,away
not,because,of,his,smell,but,to,ease,your,mind
you,have,suffered,enough
relieved,catelyn,kissed,him,lightly,on,the,cheek,before,the,others,could,come,around,the,turn,of,the,stair,and,for,a,moment,he,was,her,boy,again,and,not,her,king
lord,hoster’s,private,audience,chamber,was,a,small,room,above,the,great,hall,better,suited,to,intimate,discussions
robb,took,the,high,seat,removed,his,crown,and,set,it,on,the,floor,beside,him,as,catelyn,rang,for,wine
edmure,was,filling,his,uncle’s,ear,with,the,whole,story,of,the,fight,at,the,stone,mill
it,was,only,after,the,servants,had,come,and,gone,that,the,blackfish,cleared,his,throat,and,said,i,think,we’ve,all,heard,sufficient,of,your,boasting,nephew
edmure,was,taken,aback
boasting
what,do,you,mean
i,mean,said,the,blackfish,that,you,owe,his,grace,your,thanks,for,his,forbearance
he,played,out,that,mummer’s,farce,in,the,great,hall,so,as,not,to,shame,you,before,your,own,people
had,it,been,me,i,would,have,flayed,you,for,your,stupidity,rather,than,praising,this,folly,of,the,fords
good,men,died,to,defend,those,fords,uncle
edmure,sounded,outraged
what,is,no,one,to,win,victories,but,the,young,wolf
did,i,steal,some,glory,meant,for,you,robb
your,grace,robb,corrected,icy
you,took,me,for,your,king,uncle
or,have,you,forgotten,that,as,well
the,blackfish,said,you,were,commanded,to,hold,riverrun,edmure,no,more
i,held,riverrun,and,i,bloodied,lord,tywin’s,nose,so,you,did,said,robb
but,a,bloody,nose,won’t,win,the,war,will,it
did,you,ever,think,to,ask,yourself,why,we,remained,in,the,west,so,long,after,oxcross
you,knew,i,did,not,have,enough,men,to,threaten,lannisport,or,casterly,rock
why
there,were,other,castles
gold,cattle
you,think,we,stayed,for,plunder
robb,was,incredulous
uncle,i,wanted,lord,tywin,to,come,west
we,were,all,horsed,ser,brynden,said
the,lannister,host,was,mainly,foot
we,planned,to,run,lord,tywin,a,merry,chase,up,and,down,the,coast,then,slip,behind,him,to,take,up,a,strong,defensive,position,athwart,the,gold,road,at,a,place,my,scouts,had,found,where,the,ground,would,have,been,greatly,in,our,favor
if,he,had,come,at,us,there,he,would,have,paid,a,grievous,price
but,if,he,did,not,attack,he,would,have,been,trapped,in,the,west,a,thousand,leagues,from,where,he,needed,to,be
all,the,while,we,would,have,lived,off,his,land,instead,of,him,living,off,ours
lord,stannis,was,about,to,fall,upon,king’s,landing,robb,said
he,might,have,rid,us,of,joffrey,the,queen,and,the,imp,in,one,red,stroke
then,we,might,have,been,able,to,make,a,peace
edmure,looked,from,uncle,to,nephew
you,never,told,me
i,told,you,to,hold,riverrun,said,robb
what,part,of,that,command,did,you,fail,to,comprehend
when,you,stopped,lord,tywin,on,the,red,fork,said,the,blackfish,you,delayed,him,just,long,enough,for,riders,out,of,bitterbridge,to,reach,him,with,word,of,what,was,happening,to,the,east
lord,tywin,turned,his,host,at,once,joined,up,with,matthis,rowan,and,randyll,tarly,near,the,headwaters,of,the,blackwater,and,made,a,forced,march,to,tumbler’s,falls,where,he,found,mace,tyrell,and,two,of,his,sons,waiting,with,a,huge,host,and,a,fleet,of,barges
they,floated,down,the,river,disembarked,half,a,day’s,ride,from,the,city,and,took,stannis,in,the,rear
catelyn,remembered,king,renly’s,court,as,she,had,seen,it,at,bitterbridge
a,thousand,golden,roses,streaming,in,the,wind,queen,margaery’s,shy,smile,and,soft,words,her,brother,the,knight,of,flowers,with,the,bloody,linen,around,his,temples
if,you,had,to,fall,into,a,woman’s,arms,my,son,why,couldn’t,they,have,been,margaery,tyrell’s
the,wealth,and,power,of,highgarden,could,have,made,all,the,difference,in,the,fighting,yet,to,come
and,perhaps,grey,wind,would,have,liked,the,smell,of,her,as,well
edmure,looked,ill,i,never,meant
never,robb,you,must,let,me,make,amends
i,will,lead,the,van,in,the,next,battle
for,amends,brother
or,for,glory
catelyn,wondered
the,next,battle,robb,said
well,that,will,be,soon,enough
once,joffrey,is,wed,the,lannisters,will,take,the,fleld,against,me,once,more,i,don’t,doubt,and,this,time,the,tyrells,will,march,beside,them
and,i,may,need,to,fight,the,freys,as,well,if,black,walder,has,his,way
so,long,as,theon,greyjoy,sits,in,your,father’s,seat,with,your,brothers’,blood,on,his,hands,these,other,foes,must,wait,catelyn,told,her,son
your,first,duty,is,to,defend,your,own,people,win,back,winterfell,and,hang,theon,in,a,crow’s,cage,to,die,slowly
or,else,put,off,that,crown,for,good,robb,for,men,will,know,that,you,are,no,true,king,at,all
from,the,way,robb,looked,at,her,she,could,tell,that,it,had,been,a,long,while,since,anyone,had,dared,speak,to,him,so,bluntly
when,they,told,me,winterfell,had,fallen,i,wanted,to,go,north,at,once,he,said,with,a,hint,of,defensiveness
i,wanted,to,free,bran,and,rickon,but,i,thought
i,never,dreamed,that,theon,could,harm,them,truly
if,i,had
it,is,too,late,for,ifs,and,too,late,for,rescues,catelyn,said
all,that,remains,is,vengeance
the,last,word,we,had,from,the,north,ser,rodrik,had,defeated,a,force,of,ironmen,near,torrhen’s,square,and,was,assembling,a,host,at,castle,cerwyn,to,retake,winterfell
said,robb
by,now,he,may,have,done,it
there,has,been,no,news,for,a,long,while
and,what,of,the,trident,if,i,turn,north
i,can’t,ask,the,river,lords,to,abandon,their,own,people
no,said,catelyn
leave,them,to,guard,their,own,and,win,back,the,north,with,northmen
how,will,you,get,the,northmen,to,the,north
her,brother,edmure,asked
the,ironmen,control,the,sunset,sea
the,greyjoys,hold,moat,cailin,as,well
no,army,has,ever,taken,moat,cailin,from,the,south
even,to,march,against,it,is,madness
we,could,be,trapped,on,the,causeway,with,the,ironborn,before,us,and,angry,freys,at,our,backs
we,must,win,back,the,freys,said,robb
with,them,we,still,have,some,chance,of,success,however,small
without,them,i,see,no,hope
i,am,willing,to,give,lord,walder,whatever,he,requires
apologies,honors,lands,gold
there,must,be,something,that,would,soothe,his,pride
not,something,said,catelyn
someone
jon,big,enough,for,you
snowflakes,speckled,tormund’s,broad,face,melting,in,his,hair,and,beard
the,giants,swayed,slowly,atop,the,mammoths,as,they,rode,past,two,by,two
jon’s,garron,shied,frightened,by,such,strangeness,but,whether,it,was,the,mammoths,or,their,riders,that,scared,him,it,was,hard,to,say
even,ghost,backed,off,a,step,baring,his,teeth,in,a,silent,snarl
the,direwolf,was,big,but,the,mammoths,were,a,deal,bigger,and,there,were,many,and,more,of,them
jon,took,the,horse,in,hand,and,held,him,still,so,he,could,count,the,giants,emerging,from,the,blowing,snow,and,pale,mists,that,swirled,along,the,milkwater
he,was,well,beyond,fifty,when,tormund,said,something,and,he,lost,the,count
there,must,be,hundreds
no,matter,how,many,went,past,they,just,seemed,to,keep,coming
in,old,nan’s,stories,giants,were,outsized,men,who,lived,in,colossal,castles,fought,with,huge,swords,and,walked,about,in,boots,a,boy,could,hide,in
these,were,something,else,more,bearlike,than,human,and,as,wooly,as,the,mammoths,they,rode
seated,it,was,hard,to,say,how,big,they,truly,were
ten,feet,tall,maybe,or,twelve,jon,thought
maybe,fourteen,but,no,taller
their,sloping,chests,might,have,passed,for,those,of,men,but,their,arms,hung,down,too,far,and,their,lower,torsos,looked,half,again,as,wide,as,their,upper
their,legs,were,shorter,than,their,arms,but,very,thick,and,they,wore,no,boots,at,all,their,feet,were,broad,splayed,things,hard,and,horny,and,black
neckless,their,huge,heavy,heads,thrust,forward,from,between,their,shoulder,blades,and,their,faces,were,squashed,and,brutal
rats’,eyes,no,larger,than,beads,were,almost,lost,within,folds,of,horny,flesh,but,they,snuffled,constantly,smelling,as,much,as,they,saw
they’re,not,wearing,skins,jon,realized
that’s,hair
shaggy,pelts,covered,their,bodies,thick,below,the,waist,sparser,above
the,stink,that,came,off,them,was,choking,but,perhaps,that,was,the,mammoths
and,joramun,blew,the,horn,of,winter,and,woke,giants,from,the,earth
he,looked,for,great,swords,ten,feet,long,but,saw,only,clubs
most,were,just,the,limbs,of,dead,trees,some,still,trailing,shattered,branches
a,few,had,stone,balls,lashed,to,the,ends,to,make,colossal,mauls
the,song,never,says,if,the,horn,can,put,them,back,to,sleep
one,of,the,giants,coming,up,on,them,looked,older,than,the,rest
his,pelt,was,grey,and,streaked,with,white,and,the,mammoth,he,rode,larger,than,any,of,the,others,was,grey,and,white,as,well
tormund,shouted,something,up,to,him,as,he,passed,harsh,clanging,words,in,a,tongue,that,jon,did,not,comprehend
the,giant’s,lips,split,apart,to,reveal,a,mouth,full,of,huge,square,teeth,and,he,made,a,sound,half,belch,and,half,rumble
after,a,moment,jon,realized,he,was,laughing
the,mammoth,turned,its,massive,head,to,regard,the,two,of,them,briefly,one,huge,tusk,passing,over,the,top,of,jon’s,head,as,the,beast,lumbered,by,leaving,huge,footprints,in,the,soft,mud,and,fresh,snow,along,the,river
the,giant,shouted,down,something,in,the,same,coarse,tongue,that,tormund,had,used
was,that,their,king
asked,jon
giants,have,no,kings,no,more’n,mammoths,do,nor,snow,bears,nor,the,great,whales,o’,the,grey,sea
that,was,mag,mar,tun,doh,weg
mag,the,mighty
you,can,kneel,to,him,if,you,like,he,won’t,mind
i,know,your,kneeler’s,knees,must,be,itching,for,want,of,some,king,to,bend,to
watch,out,he,don’t,step,on,you,though
giants,have,bad,eyes,and,might,be,he,wouldn’t,see,some,little,crow,all,the,way,down,there,by,his,feet
what,did,you,say,to,him
was,that,the,old,tongue
aye
i,asked,him,if,that,was,his,father,he,was,forking,they,looked,so,much,alike,except,his,father,had,a,better,smell
and,what,did,he,say,to,you
tormund,thunderfist,cracked,a,gap-toothed,smile
he,asked,me,if,that,was,my,daughter,riding,there,beside,me,with,her,smooth,pink,cheeks
the,wildling,shook,snow,from,his,arm,and,turned,his,horse,about
it,may,be,he,never,saw,a,man,without,a,beard,before
come,we,start,back
mance,grows,sore,wroth,when,i’m,not,found,in,my,accustomed,place
jon,wheeled,and,followed,tormund,back,toward,the,head,of,the,column,his,new,cloak,hanging,heavy,from,his,shoulders
it,was,made,of,unwashed,sheepskins,worn,fleece,side,in,as,the,wildlings,suggested
it,kept,the,snow,off,well,enough,and,at,night,it,was,good,and,warm,but,he,kept,his,black,cloak,as,well,folded,up,beneath,his,saddle
is,it,true,you,killed,a,giant,once
he,asked,tormund,as,they,rode
ghost,loped,silently,beside,them,leaving,paw,prints,in,the,new-fallen,snow
now,why,would,you,doubt,a,mighty,man,like,me
it,was,winter,and,i,was,half,a,boy,and,stupid,the,way,boys,are
i,went,too,far,and,my,horse,died,and,then,a,storm,caught,me
a,true,storm,not,no,little,dusting,such,as,this
har
i,knew,i’d,freeze,to,death,before,it,broke
so,i,found,me,a,sleeping,giant,cut,open,her,belly,and,crawled,up,right,inside,her
kept,me,warm,enough,she,did,but,the,stink,near,did,for,me
the,worst,thing,was,she,woke,up,when,the,spring,come,and,took,me,for,her,babe
suckled,me,for,three,whole,moons,before,i,could,get,away
har
there’s,times,i,miss,the,taste,o’,giant’s,milk,though
if,she,nursed,you,you,couldn’t,have,killed,her
i,never,did,but,see,you,don’t,go,spreading,that,about
tormund,giantsbane,has,a,better,ring,to,it,than,tormund,giantsbabe,and,that’s,the,honest,truth,o’,it
so,how,did,you,come,by,your,other,names
jon,asked
mance,called,you,the,horn-blower,didn’t,he
mead-king,of,ruddy,hall,husband,to,bears,father,to,hosts
it,was,the,horn,blowing,he,particularly,wanted,to,hear,about,but,he,dared,not,ask,too,plainly
and,joramun,blew,the,horn,of,winter,and,woke,giants,from,the,earth
is,that,where,they,had,come,from,them,and,their,mammoths
had,mance,rayder,found,the,horn,of,joramun,and,given,it,to,tormund,thunderfist,to,blow
are,all,crows,so,curious
asked,tormund
well,here’s,a,tale,for,you
it,were,another,winter,colder,even,than,the,one,i,spent,inside,that,giant,and,snowing,day,and,night,snowflakes,as,big,as,your,head,not,these,little,things
it,snowed,so,hard,the,whole,village,was,half,buried
i,was,in,me,ruddy,hall,with,only,a,cask,o’,mead,to,keep,me,company,and,nothing,to,do,but,drink,it
the,more,i,drank,the,more,i,got,to,thinking,about,this,woman,lived,close,by,a,fine,strong,woman,with,the,biggest,pair,of,teats,you,ever,saw
she,had,a,temper,on,her,that,one,but,oh,she,could,be,warm,too,and,in,the,deep,of,winter,a,man,needs,his,warmth
the,more,i,drank,the,more,i,thought,about,her,and,the,more,i,thought,the,harder,me,member,got,till,i,couldn’t,suffer,it,no,more
fool,that,i,was,i,bundled,meself,up,in,furs,from,head,to,heels,wrapped,a,winding,wool,around,me,face,and,set,off,to,find,her
the,snow,was,coming,down,so,hard,i,got,turned,around,once,or,twice,and,the,wind,blew,right,through,me,and,froze,me,bones,but,finally,i,come,on,her,all,bundled,up,like,i,was
the,woman,had,a,terrible,temper,and,she,put,up,quite,the,fight,when,i,laid,hands,on,her
it,was,all,i,could,do,to,carry,her,home,and,get,her,out,o’,them,furs,but,when,i,did,oh,she,was,hotter,even,than,i,remembered,and,we,had,a,fine,old,time,and,then,i,went,to,sleep
next,morning,when,i,woke,the,snow,had,stopped,and,the,sun,was,shining,but,i,was,in,no,fit,state,to,enjoy,it
all,ripped,and,torn,i,was,and,half,me,member,bit,right,off,and,there,on,me,floor,was,a,she-bear’s,pelt
and,soon,enough,the,free,folk,were,telling,tales,o’,this,bald,bear,seen,in,the,woods,with,the,queerest,pair,o’,cubs,behind,her
har
he,slapped,a,meaty,thigh
would,that,i,could,find,her,again
she,was,fine,to,lay,with,that,bear
never,was,a,woman,gave,me,such,a,fight,nor,such,strong,sons,neither
’what,could,you,do,if,you,did,find,her
jon,asked,smiling
you,said,she,bit,your,member,off
only,half
and,half,me,member,is,twice,as,long,as,any,other,man’s
tormund,snorted
now,as,to,you
is,it,true,they,cut,your,members,off,when,they,take,you,for,the,wall
no,jon,said,affronted
i,think,it,must,be,true
else,why,refuse,ygritte
she’d,hardly,give,you,any,fight,at,all,seems,to,me
the,girl,wants,you,in,her,that’s,plain,enough,to,see
too,bloody,plain,thought,jon,and,it,seems,that,half,the,column,has,seen,it
he,studied,the,falling,snow,so,tormund,might,not,see,him,redden
i,am,a,man,of,the,night’s,watch,he,reminded,himself
so,why,did,he,feel,like,some,blushing,maid
he,spent,most,of,his,days,in,ygritte’s,company,and,most,nights,as,well
mance,rayder,had,not,been,blind,to,rattleshirt’s,mistrust,of,the,crow-come-over,so,after,he,had,given,jon,his,new,sheepskin,cloak,he,had,suggested,that,he,might,want,to,ride,with,tormund,giantsbane,instead
jon,had,happily,agreed,and,the,very,next,day,ygritte,and,longspear,ryk,left,rattleshirt’s,band,for,tormund’s,as,well
free,folk,ride,with,who,they,want,the,girl,told,him,and,we,had,a,bellyful,of,bag,o’,bones
every,night,when,they,made,camp,ygritte,threw,her,sleeping,skins,down,beside,his,own,no,matter,if,he,was,near,the,fire,or,well,away,from,it
once,he,woke,to,find,her,nestled,against,him,her,arm,across,his,chest
he,lay,listening,to,her,breathe,for,a,long,time,trying,to,ignore,the,tension,in,his,groin
rangers,often,shared,skins,for,warmth,but,warmth,was,not,all,ygritte,wanted,he,suspected
after,that,he,had,taken,to,using,ghost,to,keep,her,away
old,nan,used,to,tell,stories,about,knights,and,their,ladies,who,would,sleep,in,a,single,bed,with,a,blade,between,them,for,honor’s,sake,but,he,thought,this,must,be,the,first,time,where,a,direwolf,took,the,place,of,the,sword
even,then,ygritte,persisted
the,day,before,last,jon,had,made,the,mistake,of,wishing,he,had,hot,water,for,a,bath
cold,is,better,she,had,said,at,once,if,you’ve,got,someone,to,warm,you,up,after
the,river’s,only,part,ice,yet,go,on
jon,laughed
you’d,freeze,me,to,death
are,all,crows,afraid,of,gooseprickles
a,little,ice,won’t,kill,you
i’ll,jump,in,with,you,t’prove,it,so
and,ride,the,rest,of,the,day,with,wet,clothes,frozen,to,our,skins
he,objected
jon,snow,you,know,nothing
you,don’t,go,in,with,clothes
i,don’t,go,in,at,all,he,said,firmly,just,before,he,heard,tormund,thunderfist,bellowing,for,him,he,hadn’t,but,never,mind
the,wildlings,seemed,to,think,ygritte,a,great,beauty,because,of,her,hair,red,hair,was,rare,among,the,free,folk,and,those,who,had,it,were,said,to,be,kissed,by,fire,which,was,supposed,to,be,lucky
lucky,it,might,be,and,red,it,certainly,was,but,ygritte’s,hair,was,such,a,tangle,that,jon,was,tempted,to,ask,her,if,she,only,brushed,it,at,the,changing,of,the,seasons
at,a,lord’s,court,the,girl,would,never,have,been,considered,anything,but,common,he,knew
she,had,a,round,peasant,face,a,pug,nose,and,slightly,crooked,teeth,and,her,eyes,were,too,far,apart
jon,had,noticed,all,that,the,first,time,he’d,seen,her,when,his,dirk,had,been,at,her,throat
lately,though,he,was,noticing,some,other,things
when,she,grinned,the,crooked,teeth,didn’t,seem,to,matter
and,maybe,her,eyes,were,too,far,apart,but,they,were,a,pretty,blue-grey,color,and,lively,as,any,eyes,he,knew
sometimes,she,sang,in,a,low,husky,voice,that,stirred,him
and,sometimes,by,the,cookfire,when,she,sat,hugging,her,knees,with,the,flames,waking,echoes,in,her,red,hair,and,looked,at,him,just,smiling
well,that,stirred,some,things,as,well
but,he,was,a,man,of,the,night’s,watch,he,had,taken,a,vow
i,shall,take,no,wife,hold,no,lands,father,no,children
he,had,said,the,words,before,the,weirwood,before,his,father’s,gods
he,could,not,unsay,them
no,more,than,he,could,admit,the,reason,for,his,reluctance,to,tormund,thunderfist,father,to,bears
do,you,mislike,the,girl
tormund,asked,him,as,they,passed,another,twenty,mammoths,these,bearing,wildlings,in,tall,wooden,towers,instead,of,giants
no,but,i
what,can,i,say,that,he,will,believe
i,am,still,too,young,to,wed,wed
tormund,laughed
who,spoke,of,wedding
in,the,south,must,a,man,wed,every,girl,he,beds
jon,could,feel,himself,turning,red,again
she,spoke,for,me,when,rattleshirt,would,have,killed,me
i,would,not,dishonor,her
you,are,a,free,man,now,and,ygritte,is,a,free,woman
what,dishonor,if,you,lay,together
i,might,get,her,with,child
aye,i’d,hope,so
a,strong,son,or,a,lively,laughing,girl,kissed,by,fire,and,where’s,the,harm,in,that
words,failed,him,for,a,moment
the,boy
the,child,would,be,a,bastard
are,bastards,weaker,than,other,children
more,sickly,more,like,to,fail
no,but,you’re,bastard-born,yourself
and,if,ygritte,does,not,want,a,child,she,will,go,to,some,woods,witch,and,drink,a,cup,o’,moon,tea
you,do,not,come,into,it,once,the,seed,is,planted
i,will,not,father,a,bastard
tormund,shook,his,shaggy,head
what,fools,you,kneelers,be
why,did,you,steal,the,girl,if,you,don’t,want,her
steal
i,never
you,did,said,tormund
you,slew,the,two,she,was,with,and,carried,her,off,what,do,you,call,it
i,took,her,prisoner
you,made,her,yield,to,you
yes,but
tormund,i,swear,i’ve,never,touched,her
are,you,certain,they,never,cut,your,member,off
tormund,gave,a,shrug,as,if,to,say,he,would,never,understand,such,madness
well,you,are,a,free,man,now,but,if,you,will,not,have,the,girl,best,find,yourself,a,she-bear
if,a,man,does,not,use,his,member,it,grows,smaller,and,smaller,until,one,day,he,wants,to,piss,and,cannot,find,it
jon,had,no,answer,for,that
small,wonder,that,the,seven,kingdoms,thought,the,free,folk,scarcely,human
they,have,no,laws,no,honor,not,even,simple,decency
they,steal,endlessly,from,each,other,breed,like,beasts,prefer,rape,to,marriage,and,fill,the,world,with,baseborn,children
yet,he,was,growing,fond,of,tormund,giantsbane,great,bag,of,wind,and,lies,though,he,was
longspear,as,well
and,ygritte
no,i,will,not,think,about,ygritte
along,with,the,tormunds,and,the,longspears,rode,other,sorts,of,wildlings,though,men,like,rattleshirt,and,the,weeper,who,would,as,soon,slit,you,as,spit,on,you
there,was,harma,dogshead,a,squat,keg,of,a,woman,with,cheeks,like,slabs,of,white,meat,who,hated,dogs,and,killed,one,every,fortnight,to,make,a,fresh,head,for,her,banner,earless,styr,magnar,of,thenn,whose,own,people,thought,him,more,god,than,lord,varamyr,sixskins,a,small,mouse,of,a,man,whose,steed,was,a,savage,white,snow,bear,that,stood,thirteen,feet,tall,on,its,hind,legs
and,wherever,the,bear,and,varamyr,went,three,wolves,and,a,shadowcat,came,following
jon,had,been,in,his,presence,only,once,and,once,had,been,enough,the,mere,sight,of,the,man,had,made,him,bristle,even,as,the,fur,on,the,back,of,ghost’s,neck,had,bristled,at,the,sight,of,the,bear,and,that,long,black-and-white,’cat
and,there,were,folks,fiercer,even,than,varamyr,from,the,northernmost,reaches,of,the,haunted,forest,the,hidden,valleys,of,the,frostfangs,and,even,queerer,places,the,men,of,the,frozen,shore,who,rode,in,chariots,made,of,walrus,bones,pulled,along,by,packs,of,savage,dogs,the,terrible,ice-river,clans,who,were,said,to,feast,on,human,flesh,the,cave,dwellers,with,their,faces,dyed,blue,and,purple,and,green
with,his,own,eyes,jon,had,beheld,the,hornfoot,men,trotting,along,in,column,on,bare,soles,as,hard,as,boiled,leather
he,had,not,seen,any,snarks,or,grumpkins,but,for,all,he,knew,tormund,would,be,having,some,to,supper
half,the,wildling,host,had,lived,all,their,lives,without,so,much,as,a,glimpse,of,the,wall,jon,judged,and,most,of,those,spoke,no,word,of,the,common,tongue
it,did,not,matter
mance,rayder,spoke,the,old,tongue,even,sang,in,it,fingering,his,lute,and,filling,the,night,with,strange,wild,music
mance,had,spent,years,assembling,this,vast,plodding,host,talking,to,this,clan,mother,and,that,magnar,winning,one,village,with,sweet,words,and,another,with,a,song,and,a,third,with,the,edge,of,his,sword,making,peace,between,harma,dogshead,and,the,lord,o’,bones,between,the,hornfoots,and,the,nightrunners,between,the,walrus,men,of,the,frozen,shore,and,the,cannibal,clans,of,the,great,ice,rivers,hammering,a,hundred,different,daggers,into,one,great,spear,aimed,at,the,heart,of,the,seven,kingdoms
he,had,no,crown,nor,scepter,no,robes,of,silk,and,velvet,but,it,was,plain,to,jon,that,mance,rayder,was,a,king,in,more,than,name
jon,had,joined,the,wildlings,at,qhorin,halfhand’s,command
ride,with,them,eat,with,them,fight,with,them,the,ranger,had,told,him,the,night,before,he,died
and,watch
but,all,his,watching,had,learned,him,little
the,halfhand,had,suspected,that,the,wildlings,had,gone,up,into,the,bleak,and,barren,frostfangs,in,search,of,some,weapon,some,power,some,fell,sorcery,with,which,to,break,the,wall
but,if,they,had,found,any,such,no,one,was,boasting,of,it,openly,or,showing,it,to,jon
nor,had,mance,rayder,confided,any,of,his,plans,or,strategies
since,that,first,night,he,had,hardly,seen,the,man,save,at,a,distance
i,will,kill,him,if,i,must
the,prospect,gave,jon,no,joy,there,would,be,no,honor,in,such,a,killing,and,it,would,mean,his,own,death,as,well
yet,he,could,not,let,the,wildlings,breach,the,wall,to,threaten,winterfell,and,the,north,the,barrowlands,and,the,rills,white,harbor,and,the,stony,shore,even,the,neck
for,eight,thousand,years,the,men,of,house,stark,had,lived,and,died,to,protect,their,people,against,such,ravagers,and,reavers
and,bastard-born,or,no,the,same,blood,ran,in,his,veins
bran,and,rickon,are,still,at,winterfell,besides
maester,luwin,ser,rodrik,old,nan,farlen,the,kennelmaster,mikken,at,his,forge,and,gage,by,his,ovens
everyone,i,ever,knew,everyone,i,ever,loved
if,jon,must,slay,a,man,he,half,admired,and,almost,liked,to,save,them,from,the,mercies,of,rattleshirt,and,harma,dogshead,and,the,earless,magnar,of,thenn,that,was,what,he,meant,to,do
still,he,prayed,his,father’s,gods,might,spare,him,that,bleak,task
the,host,moved,but,slowly,burdened,as,it,was,by,all,the,wildlings’,herds,and,children,and,mean,little,treasures,and,the,snows,had,slowed,its,progress,even,more
most,of,the,column,was,out,of,the,foothills,now,oozing,down,along,the,west,bank,of,the,milkwater,like,honey,on,a,cold,winter’s,morning,following,the,course,of,the,river,into,the,heart,of,the,haunted,forest
and,somewhere,close,ahead,jon,knew,the,fist,of,the,first,men,loomed,above,the,trees,home,to,three,hundred,black,brothers,of,the,night’s,watch,armed,mounted,and,waiting
the,old,bear,had,sent,out,other,scouts,besides,the,halfhand,and,surely,jarman,buckwell,or,thoren,smallwood,would,have,returned,by,now,with,word,of,what,was,coming,down,out,of,the,mountains
mormont,will,not,run,jon,thought
he,is,too,old,and,he,has,come,too,far
he,will,strike,and,damn,the,numbers
one,day,soon,he,would,hear,the,sound,of,warhorns,and,see,a,column,of,riders,pounding,down,on,them,with,black,cloaks,flapping,and,cold,steel,in,their,hands
three,hundred,men,could,not,hope,to,kill,a,hundred,times,their,number,of,course,but,jon,did,not,think,they,would,need,to
he,need,not,slay,a,thousand,only,one
mance,is,all,that,keeps,them,together
the,king-beyond-the-wall,was,doing,all,he,could,yet,the,wildlings,remained,hopelessly,undisciplined,and,that,made,them,vulnerable
here,and,there,within,the,leagues-long,snake,that,was,their,line,of,march,were,warriors,as,fierce,as,any,in,the,watch,but,a,good,third,of,them,were,grouped,at,either,end,of,the,column,in,harma,dogshead’s,van,and,the,savage,rearguard,with,its,giants,aurochs,and,fire,flingers
another,third,rode,with,mance,himself,near,the,center,guarding,the,wayns,and,sledges,and,dog,carts,that,held,the,great,bulk,of,the,host’s,provisions,and,supplies,all,that,remained,of,the,last,summer,harvest
the,rest,divided,into,small,bands,under,the,likes,of,rattleshirt,jarl,tormund,giantsbane,and,the,weeper,served,as,outriders,foragers,and,whips,galloping,up,and,down,the,column,endlessly,to,keep,it,moving,in,a,more,or,less,orderly,fashion
and,even,more,telling,only,one,in,a,hundred,wildlings,was,mounted
the,old,bear,will,go,through,them,like,an,axe,through,porridge
and,when,that,happened,mance,must,give,chase,with,his,center,to,try,and,blunt,the,threat
if,he,should,fall,in,the,fight,that,must,follow,the,wall,would,be,safe,for,another,hundred,years,jon,judged
and,if,not
he,flexed,the,burned,fingers,of,his,sword,hand
longclaw,was,slung,to,his,saddle,the,carved,stone,wolf’s-head,pommel,and,soft,leather,grip,of,the,great,bastard,sword,within,easy,reach
the,snow,was,falling,heavily,by,the,time,they,caught,tormund’s,band,several,hours,later
ghost,departed,along,the,way,melting,into,the,forest,at,the,scent,of,prey
the,direwolf,would,return,when,they,made,camp,for,the,night,by,dawn,at,the,latest
however,far,he,prowled,ghost,always,came,back
and,so,it,seemed,did,ygritte
so,the,girl,called,when,she,saw,him,d’you,believe,us,now,jon,snow

she,wasn’t,wed,and,her,weapon,of,choice,was,a,short,curved,bow,of,horn,and,weirwood,but,spearwife,fit,her,all,the,same
she,reminded,him,a,little,of,his,sister,arya,though,arya,was,younger,and,probably,skinnier
it,was,hard,to,tell,how,plump,or,thin,ygritte,might,be,with,all,the,furs,and,skins,she,wore
do,you,know,the,last,of,the,giants’
without,waiting,for,an,answer,ygritte,said,you,need,a,deeper,voice,than,mine,to,do,it,proper
then,she,sang,ooooooh,i,am,the,last,of,the,giants,my,people,are,gone,from,the,earth
tormund,giantsbane,heard,the,words,and,grinned
the,last,of,the,great,mountain,giants,who,ruled,all,the,world,at,my,birth,he,bellowed,back,through,the,snow
longspear,ryk,joined,in,singing,oh,the,smallfolk,have,stolen,my,forests,they’ve,stolen,my,rivers,and,hills
and,they’ve,built,a,great,wall,through,my,valleys,and,fished,all,the,fish,from,my,rills,ygritte,and,tormund,sang,back,at,him,in,turn,in,suitably,gigantic,voices
tormund’s,sons,toregg,and,dormund,added,their,deep,voices,as,well,then,his,daughter,munda,and,all,the,rest
others,began,to,bang,their,spears,on,leathern,shields,to,keep,rough,time,until,the,whole,war,band,was,singing,as,they,rode
in,stone,halls,they,burn,their,great,fires,in,stone,halls,they,forge,their,sharp,spears
whilst,i,walk,alone,in,the,mountains,with,no,true,companion,but,tears

oooooooh,i,am,the,last,of,the,giants,so,learn,well,the,words,of,my,song
for,when,i,am,gone,the,singing,will,fade,and,the,silence,shall,last,long,and,long
there,were,tears,on,ygritte’s,cheeks,when,the,song,ended
why,are,you,weeping

jon,turned,at,the,sudden,sound,of,wings
blue-grey,feathers,filled,his,eyes,as,sharp,talons,buried,themselves,in,his,face
red,pain,lanced,through,him,sudden,and,fierce,as,pinions,beat,round,his,head
he,saw,the,beak,but,there,was,no,time,to,get,a,hand,up,or,reach,for,a,weapon
jon,reeled,backward,his,foot,lost,the,stirrup,his,garron,broke,in,panic,and,then,he,was,falling
and,still,the,eagle,clung,to,his,face,its,talons,tearing,at,him,as,it,flapped,and,shrieked,and,pecked
the,world,turned,upside,down,in,a,chaos,of,feathers,and,horseflesh,and,blood,and,then,the,ground,came,up,to,smash,him
the,next,he,knew,he,was,on,his,face,with,the,taste,of,mud,and,blood,in,his,mouth,and,ygritte,kneeling,over,him,protectively,a,bone,dagger,in,her,hand
he,could,still,hear,wings,though,the,eagle,was,not,in,sight

it’s,brave,of,you,to,warn,me,but,you,need,not,fear
joff’s,spoiled,and,vain,and,i,don’t,doubt,that,he’s,as,cruel,as,you,say,but,father,forced,him,to,name,loras,to,his,kingsguard,before,he,would,agree,to,the,match
i,shall,have,the,finest,knight,in,the,seven,kingdoms,protecting,me,night,and,day,as,prince,aemon,protected,naerys
so,our,little,lion,had,best,behave,hadn’t,he
she,laughed,and,said,come,sweet,sister,let’s,race,back,to,the,river
it,will,drive,our,guards,quite,mad
and,without,waiting,for,an,answer,she,put,her,heels,into,her,horse,and,flew
she,is,so,brave,sansa,thought,galloping,after,her
and,yet,her,doubts,still,gnawed,at,her
ser,loras,was,a,great,knight,all,agreed
but,joffrey,had,other,kingsguard,and,gold,cloaks,and,red,cloaks,besides,and,when,he,was,older,he,would,command,armies,of,his,own
aegon,the,unworthy,had,never,harmed,queen,naerys,perhaps,for,fear,of,their,brother,the,dragonknight
but,when,another,of,his,kingsguard,fell,in,love,with,one,of,his,mistresses,the,king,had,taken,both,their,heads
ser,loras,is,a,tyrell,sansa,reminded,herself
that,other,knight,was,only,a,toyne
his,brothers,had,no,armies,no,way,to,avenge,him,but,with,swords
yet,the,more,she,thought,about,it,all,the,more,she,wondered
joff,might,restrain,himself,for,a,few,turns,perhaps,as,long,as,a,year,but,soon,or,late,he,will,show,his,claws,and,when,he,does
the,realm,might,have,a,second,kingslayer,and,there,would,be,war,inside,the,city,as,the,men,of,the,lion,and,the,men,of,the,rose,made,the,gutters,run,red
sansa,was,surprised,that,margaery,did,not,see,it,too
she,is,older,than,me,she,must,be,wiser
and,her,father,lord,tyrell,he,knows,what,he,is,doing,surely
i,am,just,being,silly
when,she,told,ser,dontos,that,she,was,going,to,highgarden,to,marry,willas,tyrell,she,thought,he,would,be,relieved,and,pleased,for,her
instead,he,had,grabbed,her,arm,and,said,you,cannot
in,a,voice,as,thick,with,horror,as,with,wine
i,tell,you,these,tyrells,are,only,lannisters,with,flowers
i,beg,of,you,forget,this,folly,give,your,florian,a,kiss,and,promise,you’ll,go,ahead,as,we,have,planned
the,night,of,joffrey’s,wedding,that’s,not,so,long,wear,the,silver,hair,net,and,do,as,i,told,you,and,afterward,we,make,our,escape
he,tried,to,plant,a,kiss,on,her,cheek
sansa,slipped,from,his,grasp,and,stepped,away,from,him
i,won’t
i,can’t
something,would,go,wrong
when,i,wanted,to,escape,you,wouldn’t,take,me,and,now,i,don’t,need,to
dontos,stared,at,her,stupidly
but,the,arrangements,are,made,sweetling
the,ship,to,take,you,home,the,boat,to,take,you,to,the,ship,your,florian,did,it,all,for,his,sweet,jonquil
i,am,sorry,for,all,the,trouble,i,put,you,to,she,said,but,i,have,no,need,of,boats,and,ships,now
but,it’s,all,to,see,you,safe
i,will,be,safe,in,highgarden
willas,will,keep,me,safe
but,he,does,not,know,you,dontos,insisted,and,he,will,not,love,you
jonquil,jonquil,open,your,sweet,eyes,these,tyrells,care,nothing,for,you
it’s,your,claim,they,mean,to,wed,my,claim
she,was,lost,for,a,moment
sweetling,he,told,her,you,are,heir,to,winterfell
he,grabbed,her,again,pleading,that,she,must,not,do,this,thing,and,sansa,wrenched,free,and,left,him,swaying,beneath,the,heart,tree
she,had,not,visited,the,godswood,since
but,she,had,not,forgotten,his,words,either
the,heir,to,winterfell,she,would,think,as,she,lay,abed,at,night
it’s,your,claim,they,mean,to,wed,sansa,had,grown,up,with,three,brothers
she,never,thought,to,have,a,claim,but,with,bran,and,rickon,dead
it,doesn’t,matter,there’s,still,robb,he’s,a,man,grown,now,and,soon,he’ll,wed,and,have,a,son
anyway,willas,tyrell,will,have,highgarden,what,would,he,want,with,winterfell
sometimes,she,would,whisper,his,name,into,her,pillow,just,to,hear,the,sound,of,it
willas,willas,willas
willas,was,as,good,a,name,as,loras,she,supposed
they,even,sounded,the,same,a,little
what,did,it,matter,about,his,leg
willas,would,be,lord,of,highgarden,and,she,would,be,his,lady
she,pictured,the,two,of,them,sitting,together,in,a,garden,with,puppies,in,their,laps,or,listening,to,a,singer,strum,upon,a,lute,while,they,floated,down,the,mander,on,a,pleasure,barge
if,i,give,him,sons,he,may,come,to,love,me
she,would,name,them,eddard,and,brandon,and,rickon,and,raise,them,all,to,be,as,valiant,as,ser,loras
and,to,hate,lannisters,too
in,sansa’s,dreams,her,children,looked,just,like,the,brothers,she,had,lost
sometimes,there,was,even,a,girl,who,looked,like,arya
she,could,never,hold,a,picture,of,willas,long,in,her,head,though,her,imaginings,kept,turning,him,back,into,ser,loras,young,and,graceful,and,beautiful
you,must,not,think,of,him,like,that,she,told,herself
or,else,he,may,see,the,disappointment,in,your,eyes,when,you,meet,and,how,could,he,marry,you,then,knowing,it,was,his,brother,you,loved
willas,tyrell,was,twice,her,age,she,reminded,herself,constantly,and,lame,as,well,and,perhaps,even,plump,and,red-faced,like,his,father
but,comely,or,no,he,might,be,the,only,champion,she,would,ever,have
once,she,dreamed,it,was,still,her,marrying,joff,not,margaery,and,on,their,wedding,night,he,turned,into,the,headsman,ilyn,payne
she,woke,trembling
she,did,not,want,margaery,to,suffer,as,she,had,but,she,dreaded,the,thought,that,the,tyrells,might,refuse,to,go,ahead,with,the,wedding
i,warned,her,i,did,i,told,her,the,truth,of,him
perhaps,margaery,did,not,believe,her
joff,always,played,the,perfect,knight,with,her,as,once,he,had,with,sansa
she,will,see,his,true,nature,soon,enough
after,the,wedding,if,not,before
sansa,decided,that,she,would,light,a,candle,to,the,mother,above,the,next,time,she,visited,the,sept,and,ask,her,to,protect,margaery,from,joffrey’s,cruelty
and,perhaps,a,candle,to,the,warrior,as,well,for,loras
she,would,wear,her,new,gown,for,the,ceremony,at,the,great,sept,of,baelor,she,decided,as,the,seamstress,took,her,last,measurement
that,must,be,why,cersei,is,having,it,made,for,me,so,i,will,not,look,shabby,at,the,wedding
she,really,ought,to,have,a,different,gown,for,the,feast,afterward,but,she,supposed,one,of,her,old,ones,would,do
she,did,not,want,to,risk,getting,food,or,wine,on,the,new,one
i,must,take,it,with,me,to,highgarden
she,wanted,to,look,beautiful,for,willas,tyrell
even,if,dontos,was,right,and,it,is,winterfell,he,wants,and,not,me,he,still,may,come,to,love,me,for,myself
sansa,hugged,herself,tightly,wondering,how,long,it,would,be,before,the,gown,was,ready
she,could,scarcely,wait,to,wear,it
arya,the,rains,came,and,went,but,there,was,more,grey,sky,than,blue,and,all,the,streams,were,running,high
on,the,morning,of,the,third,day,arya,noticed,that,the,moss,was,growing,mostly,on,the,wrong,side,of,the,trees
we’re,going,the,wrong,way,she,said,to,gendry,as,they,rode,past,an,especially,mossy,elm
we’re,going,south

he,pushed,thick,black,hair,from,eyes,and,said,we’re,following,the,road,that’s,all
the,road,goes,south,here
we’ve,been,going,south,all,day,she,wanted,to,tell,him
and,yesterday,too,when,we,were,riding,along,that,streambed
but,she,hadn’t,been,paying,close,attention,yesterday,so,she,couldn’t,be,certain
i,think,we’re,lost,she,said,in,a,low,voice
we,shouldn’t,have,left,the,river
all,we,had,to,do,was,follow,it

the,way,it’s,raining,we’ll,have,moss,growing,from,our,ears,before,long,gendry,complained
only,from,our,south,ear,arya,declared,stubbornly
there,was,no,use,trying,to,convince,the,bull,of,anything
still,he,was,the,only,true,friend,she,had,now,that,hot,pie,had,left,them
sharna,says,she,needs,me,to,bake,bread,he’d,told,her,the,day,they,rode

when,the,war’s,done

i’m,sorry,i,beat,you,that,time,she,said

the,same,as,she,calls,the,other,boy
it’s,going,to,be,confusing

she,had,told,him,about,his,father,hullen,and,how,she’d,found,him,dying,by,the,stables,in,the,red,keep,the,day,she,fled
he,always,said,he’d,die,in,a,stable,harwin,said,but,we,all,thought,some,bad-tempered,stallion,would,be,his,death,not,a,pack,of,lions
arya,told,of,yoren,and,their,escape,from,king’s,landing,as,well,and,much,that,had,happened,since,but,she,left,out,the,stableboy,she’d,stabbed,with,needle,and,the,guard,whose,throat,she’d,cut,to,get,out,of,harrenhal
telling,harwin,would,be,almost,like,telling,her,father,and,there,were,some,things,that,she,could,not,bear,having,her,father,know
nor,did,she,speak,of,jaqen,h’ghar,and,the,three,deaths,he’d,owed,and,paid
the,iron,coin,he’d,given,her,arya,kept,tucked,away,beneath,her,belt,but,sometimes,at,night,she,would,take,it,out,and,remember,how,his,face,had,melted,and,changed,when,he,ran,his,hand,across,it

it,was,a,trap,milady
lord,tywin,sent,his,mountain,across,the,red,fork,with,fire,and,sword,hoping,to,draw,your,lord,father
he,planned,for,lord,eddard,to,come,west,himself,to,deal,with,gregor,clegane
if,he,had,he,would,have,been,killed,or,taken,prisoner,and,traded,for,the,imp,who,was,your,lady,mother’s,captive,at,the,time
only,the,kingslayer,never,knew,lord,tywin’s,plan,and,when,he,heard,about,his,brother’s,capture,he,attacked,your,father,in,the,streets,of,king’s,landing
i,remember,said,arya
he,killed,jory
jory,had,always,smiled,at,her,when,he,wasn’t,telling,her,to,get,from,underfoot
he,killed,jory,harwin,agreed,and,your,father’s,leg,was,broken,when,his,horse,fell,on,him
so,lord,eddard,couldn’t,go,west
he,sent,lord,beric,instead,with,twenty,of,his,own,men,and,twenty,from,winterfell,me,among,them
there,were,others,besides
thoros,and,ser,raymun,darry,and,their,men,ser,gladden,wylde,a,lord,named,lothar,mallery
but,gregor,was,waiting,for,us,at,the,mummer’s,ford,with,men,concealed,on,both,banks
as,we,crossed,he,fell,upon,us,from,front,and,rear
i,saw,the,mountain,slay,raymun,darry,with,a,single,blow,so,terrible,that,it,took,darry’s,arm,off,at,the,elbow,and,killed,the,horse,beneath,him,too
gladden,wylde,died,there,with,him,and,lord,mallery,was,ridden,down,and,drowned

six,score,we’d,been,that,morning
by,dark,no,more,than,two,score,were,left,and,lord,beric,was,gravely,wounded
thoros,drew,a,foot,of,lance,from,his,chest,that,night,and,poured,boiling,wine,into,the,hole,it,left
every,man,of,us,was,certain,his,lordship,would,be,dead,by,daybreak
but,thoros,prayed,with,him,all,night,beside,the,fire,and,when,dawn,came,he,was,still,alive,and,stronger,than,he’d,been
it,was,a,fortnight,before,he,could,mount,a,horse,but,his,courage,kept,us,strong
he,told,us,that,our,war,had,not,ended,at,the,mummer’s,ford,but,only,begun,there,and,that,every,man,of,ours,who’d,fallen,would,be,avenged,tenfold
by,then,the,fighting,had,passed,by,us
the,mountain’s,men,were,only,the,van,of,lord,tywin’s,host
they,crossed,the,red,fork,in,strength,and,swept,up,into,the,riverlands,burning,everything,in,their,path
we,were,so,few,that,all,we,could,do,was,harry,their,rear,but,we,told,each,other,that,we’d,join,up,with,king,robert,when,he,marched,west,to,crush,lord,tywin’s,rebellion
only,then,we,heard,that,robert,was,dead,and,lord,eddard,as,well,and,cersei,lannister’s,whelp,had,ascended,the,iron,throne
that,turned,the,whole,world,on,its,head
we’d,been,sent,out,by,the,king’s,hand,to,deal,with,outlaws,you,see,but,now,we,were,the,outlaws,and,lord,tywin,was,the,hand,of,the,king
there,was,some,wanted,to,yield,then,but,lord,beric,wouldn’t,hear,of,it
we,were,still,king’s,men,he,said,and,these,were,the,king’s,people,the,lions,were,savaging
if,we,could,not,fight,for,robert,we,would,fight,for,them,until,every,man,of,us,was,dead
and,so,we,did,but,as,we,fought,something,queer,happened
for,every,man,we,lost,two,showed,up,to,take,his,place
a,few,were,knights,or,squires,of,gentle,birth,but,most,were,common,men,fieldhands,and,fiddlers,and,innkeeps,servants,and,shoemakers,even,two,septons

she,wondered
it,rained,again,that,afternoon,and,long,into,the,evening
thankfully,the,outlaws,had,secret,friends,all,over,so,they,did,not,need,to,camp,out,in,the,open,or,seek,shelter,beneath,some,leaky,bower,as,she,and,hot,pie,and,gendry,had,done,so,often
that,night,they,sheltered,in,a,burned,abandoned,village
at,least,it,seemed,to,be,abandoned,until,jack-be-lucky,blew,two,short,blasts,and,two,long,ones,on,his,hunting,horn
then,all,sorts,of,people,came,crawling,out,of,the,ruins,and,up,from,secret,cellars
they,had,ale,and,dried,apples,and,some,stale,barley,bread,and,the,outlaws,had,a,goose,that,anguy,had,brought,down,on,the,ride,so,supper,that,night,was,almost,a,feast
arya,was,sucking,the,last,bit,of,meat,off,a,wing,when,one,of,the,villagers,turned,to,lem,lemoncloak,and,said,there,were,men,through,here,not,two,days,past,looking,for,the,kingslayer

they’d,do,better,looking,in,riverrun
down,in,the,deepest,dungeons,where,it’s,nice,and,damp
his,nose,looked,like,a,squashed,apple,red,and,raw,and,swollen,and,his,mood,was,foul
no,another,villager,said
he’s,escaped

i’ve,had,me,a,taste,o’,them,dungeons
how,could,he,escape
the,villagers,could,only,shrug,at,that
greenbeard,stroked,his,thick,grey-and-green,whiskers,and,said,the,wolves,will,drown,in,blood,if,the,kingslayer’s,loose,again

the,brothers,of,the,kingswood,they,were,an,outlaw,band
the,forest,was,their,castle,but,they,roamed,across,the,land
no,man’s,gold,was,safe,from,them,nor,any,maiden’s,hand
oh,the,brothers,of,the,kingswood,that,fearsome,outlaw,band
warm,and,dry,in,a,corner,between,gendry,and,harwin,arya,listened,to,the,singing,for,a,time,then,closed,her,eyes,and,drifted,off,to,sleep
she,dreamt,of,home,not,riverrun,but,winterfell
it,was,not,a,good,dream,though
she,was,alone,outside,the,castle,up,to,her,knees,in,mud
she,could,see,the,grey,walls,ahead,of,her,but,when,she,tried,to,reach,the,gates,every,step,seemed,harder,than,the,one,before,and,the,castle,faded,before,her,until,it,looked,more,like,smoke,than,granite
and,there,were,wolves,as,well,gaunt,grey,shapes,stalking,through,the,trees,all,around,her,their,eyes,shining
whenever,she,looked,at,them,she,remembered,the,taste,of,blood
the,next,morning,they,left,the,road,to,cut,across,the,fields
the,wind,was,gusting,sending,dry,brown,leaves,swirling,around,the,hooves,of,their,horses,but,for,once,it,did,not,rain
when,the,sun,came,out,from,behind,a,cloud,it,was,so,bright,arya,had,to,pull,her,hood,forward,to,keep,it,out,of,her,eyes

arya,took,a,breath,to,still,her,soul
calm,as,still,water
she,glanced,at,the,outlaws,on,their,horses,and,turned,her,horse’s,head
now,quick,as,a,snake,she,thought,as,she,slammed,her,heels,into,the,courser’s,flank
right,between,greenbeard,and,jack-be-lucky,she,flew,and,caught,one,glimpse,of,gendry’s,startled,face,as,his,mare,moved,out,of,her,way
and,then,she,was,in,the,open,field,and,running
north,or,south,east,or,west,that,made,no,matter,now
she,could,find,the,way,to,riverrun,later,once,she’d,lost,them
arya,leaned,forward,in,the,saddle,and,urged,the,horse,to,a,gallop
behind,her,the,outlaws,were,cursing,and,shouting,at,her,to,come,back
she,shut,her,ears,to,the,calls,but,when,she,glanced,back,over,her,shoulder,four,of,them,were,coming,after,her,anguy,and,harwin,and,greenbeard,racing,side,by,side,with,lem,farther,back,his,big,yellow,cloak,flapping,behind,him,as,he,rode
swift,as,a,deer,she,told,her,mount
run,now,run
arya,dashed,across,brown,weedy,fields,through,waist-high,grass,and,piles,of,dry,leaves,that,flurried,and,flew,when,her,horse,galloped,past
there,were,woods,to,her,left,she,saw
i,can,lose,them,there
a,dry,ditch,ran,along,one,side,of,the,field,but,she,leapt,it,without,breaking,stride,and,plunged,in,among,the,stand,of,elm,and,yew,and,birch,trees
a,quick,peek,back,showed,anguy,and,harwin,still,hard,on,her,heels
greenbeard,had,fallen,behind,though,and,she,could,not,see,lem,at,all
faster,she,told,her,horse,you,can,you,can
between,two,elms,she,rode,and,never,paused,to,see,which,side,the,moss,was,growing,on
she,leapt,a,rotten,log,and,swung,wide,around,a,monstrous,deadfall,jagged,with,broken,branches
then,up,a,gentle,slope,and,down,the,other,side,slowing,and,speeding,up,again,her,horse’s,shoes,striking,sparks,off,the,flintstones,underfoot
at,the,top,of,the,hill,she,glanced,back
harwin,had,pushed,ahead,of,anguy,but,both,were,coming,hard
greenbeard,had,fallen,further,back,and,seemed,to,be,flagging
a,stream,barred,her,way
she,splashed,down,into,it,through,water,choked,with,wet,brown,leaves
some,clung,to,her,horse’s,legs,as,they,climbed,the,other,side
the,undergrowth,was,thicker,here,the,ground,so,full,of,roots,and,rocks,that,she,had,to,slow,but,she,kept,as,good,a,pace,as,she,dared
another,hill,before,her,this,one,steeper
up,she,went,and,down,again
how,big,are,these,woods
she,wondered
she,had,the,faster,horse,she,knew,that,she,had,stolen,one,of,roose,bolton’s,best,from,the,stables,at,harrenhal,but,his,speed,was,wasted,here
i,need,to,find,the,fields,again
i,need,to,find,a,road
instead,she,found,a,game,trail
it,was,narrow,and,uneven,but,it,was,something
she,raced,along,it,branches,whipping,at,her,face
one,snagged,her,hood,and,yanked,it,back,and,for,half,a,heartbeat,she,feared,they,had,caught,her
a,vixen,burst,from,the,brush,as,she,passed,startled,by,the,fury,of,her,flight
the,game,trail,brought,her,to,another,stream
or,was,it,the,same,one
had,she,gotten,turned,around
there,was,no,time,to,puzzle,it,out,she,could,hear,their,horses,crashing,through,the,trees,behind,her
thorns,scratched,at,her,face,like,the,cats,she,used,to,chase,in,king’s,landing
sparrows,exploded,from,the,branches,of,an,alder
but,the,trees,were,thinning,now,and,suddenly,she,was,out,of,them
broad,level,fields,stretched,before,her,all,weeds,and,wild,wheat,sodden,and,trampled
arya,kicked,her,horse,back,to,a,gallop
run,she,thought,run,for,riverrun,run,for,home
had,she,lost,them
she,took,one,quick,look,and,there,was,harwin,six,yards,back,and,gaining
no,she,thought,no,he,can’t,not,him,it,isn’t,fair
both,horses,were,lathered,and,flagging,by,the,time,he,came,up,beside,her,reached,over,and,grabbed,her,bridle
arya,was,breathing,hard,herself,then
she,knew,the,fight,was,done
you,ride,like,a,northman,milady,harwin,said,when,he’d,drawn,them,to,a,halt
your,aunt,was,the,same
lady,lyanna
but,my,father,was,master,of,horse,remember
the,look,she,gave,him,was,full,of,hurt
i,thought,you,were,my,father’s,man
lord,eddard’s,dead,milady
i,belong,to,the,lightning,lord,now,and,to,my,brothers
what,brothers

the,smallfolk,have,only,us
he,gave,her,a,searching,look
can,you,understand,what,i,am,telling,you
yes
that,he,was,not,robb’s,man,she,understood,well,enough
and,that,she,was,his,captive
i,could,have,stayed,with,hot,pie
we,could,have,taken,the,little,boat,and,sailed,it,up,to,riverrun
she,had,been,better,off,as,squab
no,one,would,take,squab,captive,or,nan,or,weasel,or,arry,the,orphan,boy
i,was,a,wolf,she,thought,but,now,i’m,just,some,stupid,little,lady,again

i’ll,ride,peaceful,she,said,sullenly
for,now
samwell,sobbing,sam,took,another,step
this,is,the,last,one,the,very,last,i,can’t,go,on,i,can’t
but,his,feet,moved,again
one,and,then,the,other
they,took,a,step,and,then,another,and,he,thought,they’re,not,my,feet,they’re,someone,else’s,someone,else,is,walking,it,can’t,be,me
when,he,looked,down,he,could,see,them,stumbling,through,the,snow,shapeless,things,and,clumsy
his,boots,had,been,black,he,seemed,to,remember,but,the,snow,had,caked,around,them,and,now,they,were,misshapen,white,balls
like,two,clubfeet,made,of,ice
it,would,not,stop,the,snow
the,drifts,were,up,past,his,knees,and,a,crust,covered,his,lower,legs,like,a,pair,of,white,greaves
his,steps,were,dragging,lurching
the,heavy,pack,he,carried,made,him,look,like,some,monstrous,hunchback
and,he,was,tired,so,tired
i,can’t,go,on
mother,have,mercy,i,can’t
every,fourth,or,fifth,step,he,had,to,reach,down,and,tug,up,his,swordbelt
he,had,lost,the,sword,on,the,fist,but,the,scabbard,still,weighed,down,the,belt
he,did,have,two,knives,the,dragonglass,dagger,jon,had,given,him,and,the,steel,one,he,cut,his,meat,with
all,that,weight,dragged,heavy,and,his,belly,was,so,big,and,round,that,if,he,forgot,to,tug,the,belt,slipped,right,off,and,tangled,round,his,ankles,no,matter,how,tight,he,cinched,it
he,had,tried,belting,it,above,his,belly,once,but,then,it,came,almost,to,his,armpits
grenn,had,laughed,himself,sick,at,the,sight,of,it,and,dolorous,edd,had,said,i,knew,a,man,once,who,wore,his,sword,on,a,chain,around,his,neck,like,that
one,day,he,stumbled,and,the,hilt,went,up,his,nose
sam,was,stumbling,himself
there,were,rocks,beneath,the,snow,and,the,roots,of,trees,and,sometimes,deep,holes,in,the,frozen,ground
black,bernarr,had,stepped,in,one,and,broken,his,ankle,three,days,past,or,maybe,four,or
he,did,not,know,how,long,it,had,been,truly
the,lord,commander,had,put,bernarr,on,a,horse,after,that
sobbing,sam,took,another,step
it,felt,more,like,he,was,falling,down,than,walking,falling,endlessly,but,never,hitting,the,ground,just,falling,forward,and,forward
i,have,to,stop,it,hurts,too,much
i’m,so,cold,and,tired,i,need,to,sleep,just,a,little,sleep,beside,a,fire,and,a,bite,to,eat,that,isn’t,frozen
but,if,he,stopped,he,died
he,knew,that
they,all,knew,that,the,few,who,were,left
they,had,been,fifty,when,they,fled,the,fist,maybe,more,but,some,had,wandered,off,in,the,snow,a,few,wounded,had,bled,to,death
and,sometimes,sam,heard,shouts,behind,him,from,the,rear,guard,and,once,an,awful,scream
when,he,heard,that,he,had,run,twenty,yards,or,thirty,as,fast,and,as,far,as,he,could,his,half-frozen,feet,kicking,up,the,snow,he,would,be,running,still,if,his,legs,were,stronger
they,are,behind,us,they,are,still,behind,us,they,are,taking,us,one,by,one
sobbing,sam,took,another,step
he,had,been,cold,so,long,he,was,forgetting,what,it,was,like,to,feel,warm
he,wore,three,pairs,of,hose,two,layers,of,smallclothes,beneath,a,double,lambswool,tunic,and,over,that,a,thick,quilted,coat,that,padded,him,against,the,cold,steel,of,his,chainmail
over,the,hauberk,he,had,a,loose,surcoat,over,that,a,triple-thick,cloak,with,a,bone,button,that,fastened,tight,under,his,chins
its,hood,flopped,forward,over,his,forehead
heavy,fur,mitts,covered,his,hands,over,thin,wool-and-leather,gloves,a,scarf,was,wrapped,snugly,about,the,lower,half,of,his,face,and,he,had,a,tight-fitting,fleece-lined,cap,to,pull,down,over,his,ears,beneath,the,hood
and,still,the,cold,was,in,him
his,feet,especially
he,couldn’t,even,feel,them,now,but,only,yesterday,they,had,hurt,so,bad,he,could,hardly,bear,to,stand,on,them,let,alone,walk
every,step,made,him,want,to,scream
was,that,yesterday
he,could,not,remember
he,had,not,slept,since,the,fist,not,once,since,the,horn,had,blown
unless,it,was,while,he,was,walking
could,a,man,walk,while,he,was,sleeping
sam,did,not,know,or,else,he,had,forgotten
sobbing,he,took,another,step
the,snow,swirled,down,around,him
sometimes,it,fell,from,a,white,sky,and,sometimes,from,a,black,but,that,was,all,that,remained,of,day,and,night
he,wore,it,on,his,shoulders,like,a,second,cloak,and,it,piled,up,high,atop,the,pack,he,carried,and,made,it,even,heavier,and,harder,to,bear
the,small,of,his,back,hurt,abominably,as,if,someone,had,shoved,a,knife,in,there,and,was,wiggling,it,back,and,forth,with,every,step
his,shoulders,were,in,agony,from,the,weight,of,the,mail
he,would,have,given,most,anything,to,take,it,off,but,he,was,afraid,to
anyway,he,would,have,needed,to,remove,his,cloak,and,surcoat,to,get,at,it,and,then,the,cold,would,have,him
if,only,i,was,stronger
he,wasn’t,though,and,it,was,no,good,wishing
sam,was,weak,and,fat,so,very,fat,he,could,hardly,bear,his,own,weight,the,mail,was,much,too,much,for,him
it,felt,as,though,it,was,rubbing,his,shoulders,raw,despite,the,layers,of,cloth,and,quilt,between,the,steel,and,skin
the,only,thing,he,could,do,was,cry,and,when,he,cried,the,tears,froze,on,his,cheeks
sobbing,he,took,another,step
the,crust,was,broken,where,he,set,his,feet,otherwise,he,did,not,think,he,could,have,moved,at,all
off,to,the,left,and,right,half-seen,through,the,silent,trees,torches,turned,to,vague,orange,haloes,in,the,falling,snow
when,he,turned,his,head,he,could,see,them,slipping,silent,through,the,wood,bobbing,up,and,down,and,back,and,forth
the,old,bear’s,ring,of,fire,he,reminded,himself,and,woe,to,him,who,leaves,it
as,he,walked,it,seemed,as,if,he,were,chasing,the,torches,ahead,of,him,but,they,had,legs,as,well,longer,and,stronger,than,his,so,he,could,never,catch,them
yesterday,he,begged,for,them,to,let,him,be,one,of,the,torchbearers,even,if,it,meant,walking,outside,of,the,column,with,the,darkness,pressing,close
he,wanted,the,fire,dreamed,of,the,fire
if,i,had,the,fire,i,would,not,be,cold
but,someone,reminded,him,that,he’d,had,a,torch,at,the,start,but,he’d,dropped,it,in,the,snow,and,snuffed,the,fire,out
sam,didn’t,remember,dropping,any,torch,but,he,supposed,it,was,true
he,was,too,weak,to,hold,his,arm,up,for,long
was,it,edd,who,reminded,him,about,the,torch,or,grenn
he,couldn’t,remember,that,either
fat,and,weak,and,useless,even,my,wits,are,freezing,now
he,took,another,step
he,had,wrapped,his,scarf,over,his,nose,and,mouth,but,it,was,covered,with,snot,now,and,so,stiff,he,feared,it,must,be,frozen,to,his,face
even,breathing,was,hard,and,the,air,was,so,cold,it,hurt,to,swallow,it
mother,have,mercy,he,muttered,in,a,hushed,husky,voice,beneath,the,frozen,mask
mother,have,mercy,mother,have,mercy,mother,have,mercy
with,each,prayer,he,took,another,step,dragging,his,legs,through,the,snow
mother,have,mercy,mother,have,mercy,mother,have,mercy
his,own,mother,was,a,thousand,leagues,south,safe,with,his,sisters,and,his,little,brother,dickon,in,the,keep,at,horn,hill
she,can’t,hear,me,no,more,than,the,mother,above
the,mother,was,merciful,all,the,septons,agreed,but,the,seven,had,no,power,beyond,the,wall
this,was,where,the,old,gods,ruled,the,nameless,gods,of,the,trees,and,the,wolves,and,the,snows
mercy,he,whispered,then,to,whatever,might,be,listening,old,gods,or,new,or,demons,too,oh,mercy,mercy,me,mercy,me
maslyn,screamed,for,mercy
why,had,he,suddenly,remembered,that
it,was,nothing,he,wanted,to,remember
the,man,had,stumbled,backward,dropping,his,sword,pleading,yielding,even,yanking,off,his,thick,black,glove,and,thrusting,it,up,before,him,as,if,it,were,a,gauntlet
he,was,still,shrieking,for,quarter,as,the,wight,lifted,him,in,the,air,by,the,throat,and,near,ripped,the,head,off,him
the,dead,have,no,mercy,left,in,them,and,the,others
no,i,mustn’t,think,of,that,don’t,think,don’t,remember,just,walk,just,walk,just,walk
sobbing,he,took,another,step
a,root,beneath,the,crust,caught,his,toe,and,sam,tripped,and,fell,heavily,to,one,knee,so,hard,he,bit,his,tongue
he,could,taste,the,blood,in,his,mouth,warmer,than,anything,he,had,tasted,since,the,fist
this,is,the,end,he,thought
now,that,he,had,fallen,he,could,not,seem,to,find,the,strength,to,rise,again
he,groped,for,a,tree,branch,and,clutched,it,tight,trying,to,pull,himself,back,to,his,feet,but,his,stiff,legs,would,not,support,him
the,mail,was,too,heavy,and,he,was,too,fat,besides,and,too,weak,and,too,tired
back,on,your,feet,piggy,someone,growled,as,he,went,past,but,sam,paid,him,no,mind
i’ll,just,lie,down,in,the,snow,and,close,my,eyes
it,wouldn’t,be,so,bad,dying,here
he,couldn’t,possibly,be,any,colder,and,after,a,little,while,he,wouldn’t,be,able,to,feel,the,ache,in,his,lower,back,or,the,terrible,pain,in,his,shoulders,no,more,than,he,could,feel,his,feet
i,won’t,be,the,first,to,die,they,can’t,say,i,was
hundreds,had,died,on,the,fist,they,had,died,all,around,him,and,more,had,died,after,he’d,seen,them
shivering,sam,released,his,grip,on,the,tree,and,eased,himself,down,in,the,snow
it,was,cold,and,wet,he,knew,but,he,could,scarcely,feel,it,through,all,his,clothing
he,stared,upward,at,the,pale,white,sky,as,snowflakes,drifted,down,upon,his,stomach,and,his,chest,and,his,eyelids
the,snow,will,cover,me,like,a,thick,white,blanket
it,will,be,warm,under,the,snow,and,if,they,speak,of,me,they’ll,have,to,say,i,died,a,man,of,the,night’s,watch
i,did
i,did
i,did,my,duty
no,one,can,say,i,forswore,myself
i’m,fat,and,i’m,weak,and,i’m,craven,but,i,did,my,duty
the,ravens,had,been,his,responsibility
that,was,why,they,had,brought,him,along
he,hadn’t,wanted,to,go,he’d,told,them,so,he’d,told,them,all,what,a,big,coward,he,was
but,maester,aemon,was,very,old,and,blind,besides,so,they,had,to,send,sam,to,tend,to,the,ravens
the,lord,commander,had,given,him,his,orders,when,they,made,their,camp,on,the,fist
you’re,no,fighter
we,both,know,that,boy
if,it,happens,that,we’re,attacked,don’t,go,trying,to,prove,otherwise,you’ll,just,get,in,the,way
you’re,to,send,a,message
and,don’t,come,running,to,ask,what,the,letter,should,say
write,it,out,yourself,and,send,one,bird,to,castle,black,and,another,to,the,shadow,tower
the,old,bear,pointed,a,gloved,finger,right,in,sam’s,face
i,don’t,care,if,you’re,so,scared,you,foul,your,breeches,and,i,don’t,care,if,a,thousand,wildlings,are,coming,over,the,walls,howling,for,your,blood,you,get,those,birds,off,or,i,swear,i’ll,hunt,you,through,all,seven,hells,and,make,you,damn,sorry,that,you,didn’t
and,mormont’s,own,raven,had,bobbed,its,head,up,and,down,and,croaked,sorry,sorry,sorry
sam,was,sorry,sorry,he,hadn’t,been,braver,or,stronger,or,good,with,swords,that,he,hadn’t,been,a,better,son,to,his,father,and,a,better,brother,to,dickon,and,the,girls
he,was,sorry,to,die,too,but,better,men,had,died,on,the,fist,good,men,and,true,not,squeaking,fat,boys,like,him
at,least,he,would,not,have,the,old,bear,hunting,him,through,hell,though
i,got,the,birds,off
i,did,that,right,at,least
he,had,written,out,the,messages,ahead,of,time,short,messages,and,simple,telling,of,an,attack,on,the,fist,of,the,first,men,and,then,he,had,tucked,them,away,safe,in,his,parchment,pouch,hoping,he,would,never,need,to,send,them
when,the,horns,blew,sam,had,been,sleeping
he,thought,he,was,dreaming,them,at,first,but,when,he,opened,his,eyes,snow,was,falling,on,the,camp,and,the,black,brothers,were,all,grabbing,bows,and,spears,and,running,toward,the,ringwall
chett,was,the,only,one,nearby,maester,aemon’s,old,steward,with,the,face,full,of,boils,and,the,big,wen,on,his,neck
sam,had,never,seen,so,much,fear,on,a,man’s,face,as,he,saw,on,chett’s,when,that,third,blast,came,moaning,through,the,trees
help,me,get,the,birds,off,he,pleaded,but,the,other,steward,had,turned,and,run,off,dagger,in,hand
he,has,the,dogs,to,care,for,sam,remembered
probably,the,lord,commander,had,given,him,some,orders,as,well
his,fingers,had,been,so,stiff,and,clumsy,in,the,gloves,and,he,was,shaking,from,fear,and,cold,but,he,found,the,parchment,pouch,and,dug,out,the,messages,he’d,written
the,ravens,were,shrieking,furiously,and,when,he,opened,the,castle,black,cage,one,of,them,flew,right,in,his,face
two,more,escaped,before,sam,could,catch,one,and,when,he,did,it,pecked,him,through,his,glove,drawing,blood
yet,somehow,he,held,on,long,enough,to,attach,the,little,roll,of,parchment
the,warhorn,had,fallen,silent,by,then,but,the,fist,rang,with,shouted,commands,and,the,clatter,of,steel
fly
sam,called,as,he,tossed,the,raven,into,the,air
the,birds,in,the,shadow,tower,cage,were,screaming,and,fluttering,about,so,madly,that,he,was,afraid,to,open,the,door,but,he,made,himself,do,it,anyway
this,time,he,caught,the,first,raven,that,tried,to,escape
a,moment,later,it,was,clawing,its,way,up,through,the,falling,snow,bearing,word,of,the,attack
his,duty,done,he,finished,dressing,with,clumsy,frightened,fingers,donning,his,cap,and,surcoat,and,hooded,cloak,and,buckling,on,his,swordbelt,buckling,it,real,tight,so,it,wouldn’t,fall,down
then,he,found,his,pack,and,stuffed,all,his,things,inside,spare,smallclothes,and,dry,socks,the,dragonglass,arrowheads,and,spearhead,jon,had,given,him,and,the,old,horn,too,his,parchments,inks,and,quills,the,maps,he’d,been,drawing,and,a,rock-hard,garlic,sausage,he’d,been,saving,since,the,wall
he,tied,it,all,up,and,shouldered,the,pack,onto,his,back
the,lord,commander,said,i,wasn’t,to,rush,to,the,ringwall,he,recalled,but,he,said,i,shouldn’t,come,running,to,him,either
sam,took,a,deep,breath,and,realized,that,he,did,not,know,what,to,do,next
he,remembered,turning,in,a,circle,lost,the,fear,growing,inside,him,as,it,always,did
there,were,dogs,barking,and,horses,trumpeting,but,the,snow,muffled,the,sounds,and,made,them,seem,far,away
sam,could,see,nothing,beyond,three,yards,not,even,the,torches,burning,along,the,low,stone,wall,that,ringed,the,crown,of,the,hill
could,the,torches,have,gone,out
that,was,too,scary,to,think,about
the,horn,blew,thrice,long,three,long,blasts,means,others
the,white,walkers,of,the,wood,the,cold,shadows,the,monsters,of,the,tales,that,made,him,squeak,and,tremble,as,a,boy,riding,their,giant,ice-spiders,hungry,for,blood
awkwardly,he,drew,his,sword,and,plodded,heavily,through,the,snow,holding,it
a,dog,ran,past,barking,and,he,saw,some,of,the,men,from,the,shadow,tower,big,bearded,men,with,longaxes,and,eight-foot,spears
he,felt,safer,for,their,company,so,he,followed,them,to,the,wall
when,he,saw,the,torches,still,burning,atop,the,ring,of,stones,a,shudder,of,relief,went,through,him
the,black,brothers,stood,with,swords,and,spears,in,hand,watching,the,snow,fall,waiting
ser,mallador,locke,went,by,on,his,horse,wearing,a,snow-speckled,helm
sam,stood,well,back,behind,the,others,looking,for,grenn,or,dolorous,edd
if,i,have,to,die,let,me,die,beside,my,friends,he,remembered,thinking
but,all,the,men,around,him,were,strangers,shadow,tower,men,under,the,command,of,the,ranger,named,blane
here,they,come,he,heard,a,brother,say
notch,said,blane,and,twenty,black,arrows,were,pulled,from,as,many,quivers,and,notched,to,as,many,bowstrings
gods,be,good,there’s,hundreds,a,voice,said,softly
draw,blane,said,and,then,hold
sam,could,not,see,and,did,not,want,to,see
the,men,of,the,night’s,watch,stood,behind,their,torches,waiting,with,arrows,pulled,back,to,their,ears,as,something,came,up,that,dark,slippery,slope,through,the,snow
hold,blane,said,again,hold,hold
and,then,loose
the,arrows,whispered,as,they,flew
a,ragged,cheer,went,up,from,the,men,along,the,ringwall,but,it,died,quickly
they’re,not,stopping,m’lord,a,man,said,to,blane,and,another,shouted,more
look,there,coming,from,the,trees,and,yet,another,said,gods,ha’,mercy,they’s,crawling
they’s,almost,here,they’s,on,us
sam,had,been,backing,away,by,then,shaking,like,the,last,leaf,on,the,tree,when,the,wind,kicks,up,as,much,from,cold,as,from,fear
it,had,been,very,cold,that,night
even,colder,than,now
the,snow,feels,almost,warm
i,feel,better,now
a,little,rest,was,all,i,needed
maybe,in,a,little,while,i’ll,be,strong,enough,to,walk,again
in,a,little,while
a,horse,stepped,past,his,head,a,shaggy,grey,beast,with,snow,in,its,mane,and,hooves,crusted,with,ice
sam,watched,it,come,and,watched,it,go
another,appeared,from,out,of,the,falling,snow,with,a,man,in,black,leading,it
when,he,saw,sam,in,his,path,he,cursed,him,and,led,the,horse,around
i,wish,i,had,a,horse,he,thought
if,i,had,a,horse,i,could,keep,going
i,could,sit,and,even,sleep,some,in,the,saddle
most,of,their,mounts,had,been,lost,at,the,fist,though,and,those,that,remained,carried,their,food,their,torches,and,their,wounded
sam,wasn’t,wounded
only,fat,and,weak,and,the,greatest,craven,in,the,seven,kingdoms
he,was,such,a,coward
lord,randyll,his,father,had,always,said,so,and,he,had,been,right
sam,was,his,heir,but,he,had,never,been,worthy,so,his,father,had,sent,him,away,to,the,wall
his,little,brother,dickon,would,inherit,the,tarly,lands,and,castle,and,the,greatsword,heartsbane,that,the,lords,of,horn,hill,had,borne,so,proudly,for,centuries
he,wondered,whether,dickon,would,shed,a,tear,for,his,brother,who,died,in,the,snow,somewhere,off,beyond,the,edge,of,the,world
why,should,he
a,coward’s,not,worth,weeping,over
he,had,heard,his,father,tell,his,mother,as,much,half,a,hundred,times
the,old,bear,knew,it,too

sam,did,not,need,to,be,told,twice
he,went,back,to,the,birds,as,fast,as,his,fat,legs,could,carry,him

it,took,him,longer,than,it,should,have,to,light,his,little,fire,to,warm,the,frozen,ink

he,turned,his,head
through,the,drifting,snow,all,he,could,see,was,the,huge,fire,at,the,center,of,the,camp,with,mounted,men,moving,restlessly,around,it
the,reserve,he,knew,ready,to,ride,down,anything,that,breached,the,ringwall
they,had,armed,themselves,with,torches,in,place,of,swords,and,were,lighting,them,in,the,flames
wights,all,around,us,he,wrote,when,he,heard,the,shouts,from,the,north,face

he,wrote,faster,note,after,note
dead,wildlings,and,a,giant,or,maybe,a,bear,on,us,all,around
he,heard,the,crash,of,steel,on,wood,which,could,only,mean,one,thing

we’re,cutting,our,way,free,and,retreating,for,the,wall
we’re,trapped,on,the,fist,hard,pressed
one,of,the,shadow,tower,men,came,staggering,out,of,the,darkness,to,fall,at,sam’s,feet

we’re,all,lost
why,must,he,remember,the,fight,at,the,fist

you’ll,freeze,or,the,others,will,get,you
sam,get,up
the,night,before,they,left,the,wall,pyp,had,teased,grenn,the,way,he,did,sam,remembered,smiling,and,saying,how,grenn,was,a,good,choice,for,the,ranging,since,he,was,too,stupid,to,be,terrified
grenn,hotly,denied,it,until,he,realized,what,he,was,saying
he,was,stocky,and,thick-necked,and,strong,ser,alliser,thorne,had,called,him,aurochs,the,same,way,he,called,sam,ser,piggy,and,jon,lord,snow,but,he,had,always,treated,sam,nice,enough
that,was,only,because,of,jon,though
if,it,weren’t,for,jon,none,of,them,would,have,liked,me
and,now,jon,was,gone,lost,in,the,skirling,pass,with,qhorin,halfhand,most,likely,dead
sam,would,have,cried,for,him,but,those,tears,would,only,freeze,as,well,and,he,could,scarcely,keep,his,eyes,open,now
a,tall,brother,with,a,torch,stopped,beside,them,and,for,a,wonderful,moment,sam,felt,the,warmth,on,his,face
leave,him,the,man,said,to,grenn
if,they,can’t,walk,they’re,done
save,your,strength,for,yourself,grenn
he’ll,get,up,grenn,replied
he,only,needs,a,hand
the,man,moved,on,taking,the,blessed,warmth,with,him
grenn,tried,to,pull,sam,to,his,feet
that,hurts,he,complained

grenn,you’re,hurting,my,arm
stop,it
you’re,too,bloody,heavy
grenn,jammed,his,hands,into,sam’s,armpits,gave,a,grunt,and,hauled,him,upright
but,the,moment,he,let,go,the,fat,boy,sat,back,down,in,the,snow
grenn,kicked,him,a,solid,thump,that,cracked,the,crust,of,snow,around,his,boot,and,sent,it,flying,everywhere
get,up
he,kicked,him,again
get,up,and,walk
you,have,to,walk
sam,fell,over,sideways,curling,up,into,a,tight,ball,to,protect,himself,from,the,kicks
he,hardly,felt,them,through,all,his,wool,and,leather,and,mail,but,even,so,they,hurt
i,thought,grenn,was,my,friend
you,shouldn’t,kick,your,friends
why,won’t,they,let,me,be
i,just,need,to,rest,that’s,all,to,rest,and,sleep,some,and,maybe,die,a,little
if,you,take,the,torch,i,can,take,the,fat,boy
suddenly,he,was,jerked,up,into,the,cold,air,away,from,his,sweet,soft,snow,he,was,floating
there,was,an,arm,under,his,knees,and,another,one,under,his,back
sam,raised,his,head,and,blinked
a,face,loomed,close,a,broad,brutal,face,with,a,flat,nose,and,small,dark,eyes,and,a,thicket,of,coarse,brown,beard
he,had,seen,the,face,before,but,it,took,him,a,moment,to,remember

your,favorite,foods

in,your,head
sam,knew,a,hundred,songs,but,when,he,tried,to,think,of,one,he,couldn’t
the,words,had,all,gone,from,his,head
he,sobbed,again,and,said,i,don’t,know,any,songs,grenn
i,did,know,some,but,now,i,don’t
yes,you,do,said,grenn
how,about,the,bear,and,the,maiden,fair’,everybody,knows,that,one
a,bear,there,was,a,bear,a,bear

no,not,that,one,sam,pleaded
the,bear,that,had,come,up,the,fist,had,no,hair,left,on,its,rotted,flesh
he,didn’t,want,to,think,about,bears
no,songs
please,grenn
think,about,your,ravens,then
they,were,never,mine
they,were,the,lord,commander’s,ravens,the,ravens,of,the,night’s,watch
they,belonged,to,castle,black,and,the,shadow,tower
small,paul,frowned
chett,said,i,could,have,the,old,bear’s,raven,the,one,that,talks
i,saved,food,for,it,and,everything
he,shook,his,head
i,forgot,though
i,left,the,food,where,i,hid,it
he,plodded,onward,pale,white,breath,coming,from,his,mouth,with,every,step,then,suddenly,said,could,i,have,one,of,your,ravens
just,the,one
i’d,never,let,lark,eat,it
they’re,gone,said,sam
i’m,sorry
so,sorry
they’re,flying,back,to,the,wall,now
he,had,set,the,birds,free,when,he’d,heard,the,warhorns,sound,once,more,calling,the,watch,to,horse
two,short,blasts,and,a,long,one,that,was,the,call,to,mount,up
but,there,was,no,reason,to,mount,unless,to,abandon,the,fist,and,that,meant,the,battle,was,lost
the,fear,bit,him,so,strong,then,that,it,was,all,sam,could,do,to,open,the,cages
only,as,he,watched,the,last,raven,flap,up,into,the,snowstorm,did,he,realize,that,he,had,forgotten,to,send,any,of,the,messages,he’d,written
no,he’d,squealed,oh,no,oh,no
the,snow,fell,and,the,horns,blew,ahooo,ahooo,ahooooooooooooooooooo,they,cried,to,horse,to,horse,to,horse
sam,saw,two,ravens,perched,on,a,rock,and,ran,after,them,but,the,birds,flapped,off,lazily,through,the,swirling,snow,in,opposite,directions
he,chased,one,his,breath,puffing,out,his,nose,in,thick,white,clouds,stumbled,and,found,himself,ten,feet,from,the,ringwall
after,that
he,remembered,the,dead,coming,over,the,stones,with,arrows,in,their,faces,and,through,their,throats
some,were,all,in,ringmail,and,some,were,almost,naked
wildlings,most,of,them,but,a,few,wore,faded,blacks
he,remembered,one,of,the,shadow,tower,men,shoving,his,spear,through,a,wight’s,pale,soft,belly,and,out,his,back,and,how,the,thing,staggered,right,up,the,shaft,and,reached,out,his,black,hands,and,twisted,the,brother’s,head,around,until,blood,came,out,his,mouth
that,was,when,his,bladder,let,go,the,first,time,he,was,almost,sure
he,did,not,remember,running,but,he,must,have,because,the,next,he,knew,he,was,near,the,fire,half,a,camp,away,with,old,ser,ottyn,wythers,and,some,archers
ser,ottyn,was,on,his,knees,in,the,snow,staring,at,the,chaos,around,them,until,a,riderless,horse,came,by,and,kicked,him,in,the,face
the,archers,paid,him,no,mind
they,were,loosing,fire,arrows,at,shadows,in,the,dark
sam,saw,one,wight,hit,saw,the,flames,engulf,it,but,there,were,a,dozen,more,behind,it,and,a,huge,pale,shape,that,must,have,been,the,bear,and,soon,enough,the,bowmen,had,no,arrows
and,then,sam,found,himself,on,a,horse
it,wasn’t,his,own,horse,and,he,never,recalled,mounting,up,either
maybe,it,was,the,horse,that,had,smashed,ser,ottyn’s,face,in
the,horns,were,still,blowing,so,he,kicked,the,horse,and,turned,him,toward,the,sound
in,the,midst,of,carnage,and,chaos,and,blowing,snow,he,found,dolorous,edd,sitting,on,his,garron,with,a,plain,black,banner,on,a,spear
sam,edd,said,when,he,saw,him,would,you,wake,me,please
i,am,having,this,terrible,nightmare

sam,pissed,himself,all,over,again
i,didn’t,think,i,had,any,more,left,inside,me
the,bear,was,dead,pale,and,rotting,its,fur,and,skin,all,sloughed,off,and,half,its,right,arm,burned,to,bone,yet,still,it,came,on

he,kicked,and,closed,his,eyes,and,whimpered,and,the,garron,took,him,over,somehow,somehow,the,garron,took,him,over
the,rider,to,his,right,came,crashing,down,in,a,tangle,of,steel,and,leather,and,screaming,horseflesh,and,then,the,wights,were,swarming,over,him,and,the,wedge,was,closing,up
they,plunged,down,the,hillside,at,a,run,through,clutching,black,hands,and,burning,blue,eyes,and,blowing,snow
horses,stumbled,and,rolled,men,were,swept,from,their,saddles,torches,spun,through,the,air,axes,and,swords,hacked,at,dead,flesh,and,samwell,tarly,sobbed,clutching,desperately,to,his,horse,with,a,strength,he,never,knew,he,had
he,was,in,the,middle,of,the,flying,spearhead,with,brothers,on,either,side,and,before,and,behind,him,as,well
a,dog,ran,with,them,for,a,ways,bounding,down,the,snowy,slope,and,in,and,out,among,the,horses,but,it,could,not,keep,up

even,as,they,fell,they,clutched,at,swords,and,stirrups,and,the,legs,of,passing,horses
sam,saw,one,claw,open,a,garron’s,belly,with,its,right,hand,while,it,clung,to,the,saddle,with,its,left
suddenly,the,trees,were,all,about,them,and,sam,was,splashing,through,a,frozen,stream,with,the,sounds,of,slaughter,dwindling,behind
he,turned,breathless,with,relief
until,a,man,in,black,leapt,from,the,brush,and,yanked,him,out,of,the,saddle
who,he,was,sam,never,saw,he,was,up,in,an,instant,and,galloping,away,the,next
when,he,tried,to,run,after,the,horse,his,feet,tangled,in,a,root,and,he,fell,hard,on,his,face,and,lay,weeping,like,a,baby,until,dolorous,edd,found,him,there
that,was,his,last,coherent,memory,of,the,fist,of,the,first,men
later,hours,later,he,stood,shivering,among,the,other,survivors,half,mounted,and,half,afoot
they,were,miles,from,the,fist,by,then,though,sam,did,not,remember,how
dywen,had,led,down,five,packhorses,heavy,laden,with,food,and,oil,and,torches,and,three,had,made,it,this,far
the,old,bear,made,them,redistribute,the,loads,so,the,loss,of,any,one,horse,and,its,provisions,would,not,be,such,a,catastrophe
he,took,garrons,from,the,healthy,men,and,gave,them,to,the,wounded,organized,the,walkers,and,set,torches,to,guard,their,flanks,and,rear
all,i,need,do,is,walk,sam,told,himself,as,he,took,that,first,step,toward,home
but,before,an,hour,was,gone,he,had,begun,to,struggle,and,to,lag
they,were,lagging,now,as,well,he,saw
he,remembered,pyp,saying,once,how,small,paul,was,the,strongest,man,in,the,watch
he,must,be,to,carry,me
yet,even,so,the,snow,was,growing,deeper,the,ground,more,treacherous,and,paul’s,strides,had,begun,to,shorten
more,horsemen,passed,wounded,men,who,looked,at,sam,with,dull,incurious,eyes
some,torch,bearers,went,by,as,well
you’re,falling,behind,one,told,them
the,next,agreed
no,one’s,like,to,wait,for,you,paul

i,want,me,a,bird,that,talks,and,eats,corn,from,my,hand
bloody,fool,the,torch,man,said
then,he,was,gone
it,was,a,while,after,when,grenn,stopped,suddenly
we’re,alone,he,said,in,a,hoarse,voice
i,can’t,see,the,other,torches
was,that,the,rear,guard
small,paul,had,no,answer,for,him
the,big,man,gave,a,grunt,and,sank,to,his,knees
his,arms,trembled,as,he,lay,sam,gently,in,the,snow
i,can’t,carry,you,no,more
i,would,but,i,can’t
he,shivered,violently
the,wind,sighed,through,the,trees,driving,a,fine,spray,of,snow,into,their,faces
the,cold,was,so,bitter,that,sam,felt,naked
he,looked,for,the,other,torches,but,they,were,gone,every,one,of,them
there,was,only,the,one,grenn,carried,the,flames,rising,from,it,like,pale,orange,silks
he,could,see,through,them,to,the,black,beyond
that,torch,will,burn,out,soon,he,thought,and,we,are,all,alone,without,food,or,friends,or,fire
but,that,was,wrong
they,weren’t,alone,at,all
the,lower,branches,of,the,great,green,sentinel,shed,their,burden,of,snow,with,a,soft,wet,plop
grenn,spun,thrusting,out,his,torch
who,goes,there
a,horse’s,head,emerged,from,the,darkness
sam,felt,a,moment’s,relief,until,he,saw,the,horse
hoarfrost,covered,it,like,a,sheen,of,frozen,sweat,and,a,nest,of,stiff,black,entrails,dragged,from,its,open,belly
on,its,back,was,a,rider,pale,as,ice
sam,made,a,whimpery,sound,deep,in,his,throat
he,was,so,scared,he,might,have,pissed,himself,all,over,again,but,the,cold,was,in,him,a,cold,so,savage,that,his,bladder,felt,frozen,solid
the,other,slid,gracefully,from,the,saddle,to,stand,upon,the,snow
sword-slim,it,was,and,milky,white
its,armor,rippled,and,shifted,as,it,moved,and,its,feet,did,not,break,the,crust,of,the,new-fallen,snow
small,paul,unslung,the,long-hafted,axe,strapped,across,his,back
why’d,you,hurt,that,horse
that,was,mawney’s,horse
sam,groped,for,the,hilt,of,his,sword,but,the,scabbard,was,empty
he,had,lost,it,on,the,fist,he,remembered,too,late
get,away
grenn,took,a,step,thrusting,the,torch,out,before,him
away,or,you,burn
he,poked,at,it,with,the,flames
the,other’s,sword,gleamed,with,a,faint,blue,glow
it,moved,toward,grenn,lightning,quick,slashing
when,the,ice,blue,blade,brushed,the,flames,a,screech,stabbed,sam’s,ears,sharp,as,a,needle
the,head,of,the,torch,tumbled,sideways,to,vanish,beneath,a,deep,drift,of,snow,the,fire,snuffed,out,at,once
and,all,grenn,held,was,a,short,wooden,stick
he,flung,it,at,the,other,cursing,as,small,paul,charged,in,with,his,axe
the,fear,that,filled,sam,then,was,worse,than,any,fear,he,had,ever,felt,before,and,samwell,tarly,knew,every,kind,of,fear
mother,have,mercy,he,wept,forgetting,the,old,gods,in,his,terror

his,fingers,found,his,dagger,and,he,filled,his,hand,with,that
the,wights,had,been,slow,clumsy,things,but,the,other,was,light,as,snow,on,the,wind
it,slid,away,from,paul’s,axe,armor,rippling,and,its,crystal,sword,twisted,and,spun,and,slipped,between,the,iron,rings,of,paul’s,mail,through,leather,and,wool,and,bone,and,flesh
it,came,out,his,back,with,a,hissssssssssss,and,sam,heard,paul,say,oh,as,he,lost,the,axe
impaled,his,blood,smoking,around,the,sword,the,big,man,tried,to,reach,his,killer,with,his,hands,and,almost,had,before,he,fell

you,can,do,it,you,can,just,do,it
and,then,he,was,stumbling,forward,falling,more,than,running,really,closing,his,eyes,and,shoving,the,dagger,blindly,out,before,him,with,both,hands
he,heard,a,crack,like,the,sound,ice,makes,when,it,breaks,beneath,a,man’s,foot,and,then,a,screech,so,shrill,and,sharp,that,he,went,staggering,backward,with,his,hands,over,his,muffled,ears,and,fell,hard,on,his,arse
when,he,opened,his,eyes,the,other’s,armor,was,running,down,its,legs,in,rivulets,as,pale,blue,blood,hissed,and,steamed,around,the,black,dragonglass,dagger,in,its,throat
it,reached,down,with,two,bone-white,hands,to,pull,out,the,knife,but,where,its,fingers,touched,the,obsidian,they,smoked

in,twenty,heartbeats,its,flesh,was,gone,swirling,away,in,a,fine,white,mist
beneath,were,bones,like,milkglass,pale,and,shiny,and,they,were,melting,too
finally,only,the,dragonglass,dagger,remained,wreathed,in,steam,as,if,it,were,alive,and,sweating

grenn,pulled,sam,to,his,feet,checked,small,paul,for,a,pulse,and,closed,his,eyes,then,snatched,up,the,dagger,again
this,time,he,was,able,to,hold,it
you,keep,it,sam,said

greyjoy’s,longships,will,augment,my,own,fleet,and,give,us,sufficient,strength,at,sea,to,assault,dragonstone,and,end,stannis,baratheon’s,pretensions
king,balon’s,longships,are,occupied,for,the,nonce,lord,tywin,said,politely,as,are,we
greyjoy,demands,half,the,kingdom,as,the,price,of,alliance,but,what,will,he,do,to,earn,it
fight,the,starks
he,is,doing,that,already
why,should,we,pay,for,what,he,has,given,us,for,free
the,best,thing,to,do,about,our,lord,of,pyke,is,nothing,in,my,view
granted,enough,time,a,better,option,may,well,present,itself
one,that,does,not,require,the,king,to,give,up,half,his,kingdom
tyrion,watched,his,father,closely
there’s,something,he’s,not,saying
he,remembered,those,important,letters,lord,tywin,had,been,writing,the,night,tyrion,had,demanded,casterly,rock
what,was,it,he,said
some,battles,are,won,with,swords,and,spears,others,with,quills,and,ravens
he,wondered,who,the,better,option,was,and,what,sort,of,price,he,was,demanding
perhaps,we,ought,move,on,to,the,wedding,ser,kevan,said
the,high,septon,spoke,of,the,preparations,being,made,at,the,great,sept,of,baelor,and,cersei,detailed,the,plans,she,had,been,making,for,the,feast
they,would,feed,a,thousand,in,the,throne,room,but,many,more,outside,in,the,yards
the,outer,and,middle,wards,would,be,tented,in,silk,with,tables,of,food,and,casks,of,ale,for,all,those,who,could,not,be,accommodated,within,the,hall
your,grace,said,grand,maester,pycelle,in,regard,to,the,number,of,guests
we,have,had,a,raven,from,sunspear
three,hundred,dornishmen,are,riding,toward,king’s,landing,as,we,speak,and,hope,to,arrive,before,the,wedding
how,do,they,come

dornishmen,and,highgardeners,had,never,had,great,love,for,one,another,over,the,centuries,they,had,fought,border,wars,beyond,count,and,raided,back,and,forth,across,mountains,and,marches,even,when,at,peace
the,enmity,had,waned,a,bit,after,dorne,had,become,part,of,the,seven,kingdoms
until,the,dornish,prince,they,called,the,red,viper,had,crippled,the,young,heir,of,highgarden,in,a,tourney
this,could,be,ticklish,the,dwarf,thought,waiting,to,see,how,his,father,would,handle,it
prince,doran,comes,at,my,son’s,invitation,lord,tywin,said,calmly,not,only,to,join,in,our,celebration,but,to,claim,his,seat,on,this,council,and,the,justice,robert,denied,him,for,the,murder,of,his,sister,elia,and,her,children
tyrion,watched,the,faces,of,the,lords,tyrell,redwyne,and,rowan,wondering,if,any,of,the,three,would,be,bold,enough,to,say,but,lord,tywin,wasn’t,it,you,who,presented,the,bodies,to,robert,all,wrapped,up,in,lannister,cloaks
none,of,them,did,but,it,was,there,on,their,faces,all,the,same

no,place,for,old,quarrels,surely
i,have,no,quarrel,with,doran,martell,insisted,lord,tyrell,though,his,tone,was,more,than,a,little,grudging
if,he,wishes,to,cross,the,reach,in,peace,he,need,only,ask,my,leave
small,chance,of,that,thought,tyrion
he’ll,climb,the,boneway,turn,east,near,summerhall,and,come,up,the,kingsroad
three,hundred,dornishmen,need,not,trouble,our,plans,said,cersei
we,can,feed,the,men-at-arms,in,the,yard,squeeze,some,extra,benches,into,the,throne,room,for,the,lordlings,and,highborn,knights,and,find,prince,doran,a,place,of,honor,on,the,dais
not,by,me,was,the,message,tyrion,saw,in,mace,tyrell’s,eyes,but,the,lord,of,highgarden,made,no,reply,but,a,curt,nod

your,grace,said,ser,kevan,courteously,you,are,a,young,woman,still,fair,and,fertile
surely,you,cannot,wish,to,spend,the,rest,of,your,days,alone
and,a,new,marriage,would,put,to,rest,this,talk,of,incest,for,good,and,all
so,long,as,you,remain,unwed,you,allow,stannis,to,spread,his,disgusting,slander,lord,tywin,told,his,daughter
you,must,have,a,new,husband,in,your,bed,to,father,children,on,you

balon,greyjoy’s,wife,is,elderly,and,failing,but,such,a,match,would,commit,us,to,an,alliance,with,the,iron,islands,and,i,am,still,uncertain,whether,that,would,be,our,wisest,course
no,cersei,said,from,between,white,lips
no,no,no
tyrion,could,not,quite,suppress,the,grin,that,came,to,his,lips,at,the,thought,of,packing,his,sister,off,to,pyke
just,when,i,was,about,to,give,up,praying,some,sweet,god,gives,me,this

i,object,to,wedding,any,i,have,considered,the,redwyne,twins,theon,greyjoy,quentyn,martell,and,a,number,of,others

it,should,be,tempered,and,made,stronger
ser,loras,has,taken,the,white,and,ser,garlan,is,wed,to,one,of,the,fossoways,but,there,remains,the,eldest,son,the,boy,they,scheme,to,wed,to,sansa,stark
willas,tyrell
tyrion,was,taking,a,wicked,pleasure,in,cersei’s,helpless,fury
that,would,be,the,cripple,he,said
their,father,chilled,him,with,a,look
willas,is,heir,to,highgarden,and,by,all,reports,a,mild,and,courtly,young,man,fond,of,reading,books,and,looking,at,the,stars
he,has,a,passion,for,breeding,animals,as,well,and,owns,the,finest,hounds,hawks,and,horses,in,the,seven,kingdoms
a,perfect,match,mused,tyrion
cersei,also,has,a,passion,for,breeding
he,pitied,poor,willas,tyrell,and,did,not,know,whether,he,wanted,to,laugh,at,his,sister,or,weep,for,her
the,tyrell,heir,would,be,my,choice,lord,tywin,concluded,but,if,you,would,prefer,another,i,will,hear,your,reasons
that,is,so,very,kind,of,you,father,cersei,said,with,icy,courtesy
it,is,such,a,difficult,choice,you,give,me
who,would,i,sooner,take,to,bed,the,old,squid,or,the,crippled,dog,boy
i,shall,need,a,few,days,to,consider
do,i,have,your,leave,to,go
you,are,the,queen,tyrion,wanted,to,tell,her
he,ought,to,be,begging,leave,of,you
go,their,father,said
we,shall,talk,again,after,you,have,composed,yourself
remember,your,duty
cersei,swept,stiffly,from,the,room,her,rage,plain,to,see
yet,in,the,end,she,will,do,as,father,bid
she,had,proved,that,with,robert
though,there,is,jaime,to,consider
their,brother,had,been,much,younger,when,cersei,wed,the,first,time,he,might,not,acquiesce,to,a,second,marriage,quite,so,easily
the,unfortunate,willas,tyrell,was,like,to,contract,a,sudden,fatal,case,of,sword-through-bowels,which,could,rather,sour,the,alliance,between,highgarden,and,casterly,rock
i,should,say,something,but,what
pardon,me,father,but,it’s,our,brother,she,wants,to,marry
tyrion
he,gave,a,resigned,smile
do,i,hear,the,herald,summoning,me,to,the,lists
your,whoring,is,a,weakness,in,you,lord,tywin,said,without,preamble,but,perhaps,some,share,of,the,blame,is,mine
since,you,stand,no,taller,than,a,boy,i,have,found,it,easy,to,forget,that,you,are,in,truth,a,man,grown,with,all,of,a,man’s,baser,needs
it,is,past,time,you,were,wed,i,was,wed,or,have,you,forgotten
tyrion’s,mouth,twisted,and,the,noise,emerged,that,was,half,laugh,and,half,snarl
does,the,prospect,of,marriage,amuse,you
only,imagining,what,a,bugger-all,handsome,bridegroom,i’ll,make
a,wife,might,be,the,very,thing,he,needed
if,she,brought,him,lands,and,a,keep,it,would,give,him,a,place,in,the,world,apart,from,joffrey’s,court
and,away,from,cersei,and,their,father
on,the,other,hand,there,was,shae
she,will,not,like,this,for,all,she,swears,that,she,is,content,to,be,my,whore
that,was,scarcely,a,point,to,sway,his,father,however,so,tyrion,squirmed,higher,in,his,seat,and,said,you,mean,to,wed,me,to,sansa,stark
but,won’t,the,tyrells,take,the,match,as,an,affront,if,they,have,designs,on,the,girl
lord,tyrell,will,not,broach,the,matter,of,the,stark,girl,until,after,joffrey’s,wedding
if,sansa,is,wed,before,that,how,can,he,take,offense,when,he,gave,us,no,hint,of,his,intentions
quite,so,said,ser,kevan,and,any,lingering,resentments,should,be,soothed,by,the,offer,of,cersei,for,his,willas
tyrion,rubbed,at,the,raw,stub,of,his,nose
the,scar,tissue,itched,abominably,sometimes
his,grace,the,royal,pustule,has,made,sansa’s,life,a,misery,since,the,day,her,father,died,and,now,that,she,is,finally,rid,of,joffrey,you,propose,to,marry,her,to,me
that,seems,singularly,cruel
even,for,you,father
why,do,you,plan,to,mistreat,her
his,father,sounded,more,curious,than,concerned
the,girl’s,happiness,is,not,my,purpose,nor,should,it,be,yours
our,alliances,in,the,south,may,be,as,solid,as,casterly,rock,but,there,remains,the,north,to,win,and,the,key,to,the,north,is,sansa,stark
she,is,no,more,than,a,child
your,sister,swears,she’s,flowered
if,so,she,is,a,woman,fit,to,be,wed,you,must,needs,take,her,maidenhead,so,no,man,can,say,the,marriage,was,not,consummated
after,that,if,you,prefer,to,wait,a,year,or,two,before,bedding,her,again,you,would,be,within,your,rights,as,her,husband
shae,is,all,the,woman,i,need,just,now,he,thought,and,sansa’s,a,girl,no,matter,what,you,say
if,your,purpose,here,is,to,keep,her,from,the,tyrells,why,not,return,her,to,her,mother
perhaps,that,would,convince,robb,stark,to,bend,the,knee
lord,tywin’s,look,was,scornful
send,her,to,riverrun,and,her,mother,will,match,her,with,a,blackwood,or,a,mallister,to,shore,up,her,son’s,alliances,along,the,trident
send,her,north,and,she,will,be,wed,to,some,manderly,or,umber,before,the,moon,turns
yet,she,is,no,less,dangerous,here,at,court,as,this,business,with,the,tyrells,should,prove
she,must,marry,a,lannister,and,soon
the,man,who,weds,sansa,stark,can,claim,winterfell,in,her,name,his,uncle,kevan,put,in
had,that,not,occurred,to,you
if,you,will,not,have,the,girl,we,shall,give,her,to,one,of,your,cousins,said,his,father
kevan,is,lancel,strong,enough,to,wed,do,you,think
ser,kevan,hesitated
if,we,bring,the,girl,to,his,bedside,he,could,say,the,words
but,to,consummate,no
i,would,suggest,one,of,the,twins,but,the,starks,hold,them,both,at,riverrun
they,have,genna’s,boy,tion,as,well,else,he,might,serve
tyrion,let,them,have,their,byplay,it,was,all,for,his,benefit,he,knew
sansa,stark,he,mused
soft-spoken,sweet-smelling,sansa,who,loved,silks,songs,chivalry,and,tall,gallant,knights,with,handsome,faces
he,felt,as,though,he,was,back,on,the,bridge,of,boats,the,deck,shifting,beneath,his,feet
you,asked,me,to,reward,you,for,your,efforts,in,the,battle,lord,tywin,reminded,him,forcefully
this,is,a,chance,for,you,tyrion,the,best,you,are,ever,likely,to,have
he,drummed,his,fingers,impatiently,on,the,table
i,once,hoped,to,marry,your,brother,to,lysa,tully,but,aerys,named,jaime,to,his,kingsguard,before,the,arrangements,were,complete
when,i,suggested,to,lord,hoster,that,lysa,might,be,wed,to,you,instead,he,replied,that,he,wanted,a,whole,man,for,his,daughter
so,he,wed,her,to,jon,arryn,who,was,old,enough,to,be,her,grandfather
tyrion,was,more,inclined,to,be,thankful,than,angry,considering,what,lysa,arryn,had,become
when,i,offered,you,to,dorne,i,was,told,that,the,suggestion,was,an,insult,lord,tywin,continued
in,later,years,i,had,similar,answers,from,yohn,royce,and,leyton,hightower
i,finally,stooped,so,low,as,to,suggest,you,might,take,the,florent,girl,robert,deflowered,in,his,brother’s,wedding,bed,but,her,father,preferred,to,give,her,to,one,of,his,own,household,knights
if,you,will,not,have,the,stark,girl,i,shall,find,you,another,wife
somewhere,in,the,realm,there,is,doubtless,some,little,lordling,who’d,gladly,part,with,a,daughter,to,win,the,friendship,of,casterly,rock
lady,tanda,has,offered,lollys
tyrion,gave,a,shudder,of,dismay
i’d,sooner,cut,it,off,and,feed,it,to,the,goats
then,open,your,eyes
the,stark,girl,is,young,nubile,tractable,of,the,highest,birth,and,still,a,maid
she,is,not,uncomely
why,would,you,hesitate
why,indeed
a,quirk,of,mine
strange,to,say,i,would,prefer,a,wife,who,wants,me,in,her,bed
if,you,think,your,whores,want,you,in,their,bed,you,are,an,even,greater,fool,than,i,suspected,said,lord,tywin
you,disappoint,me,tyrion
i,had,hoped,this,match,would,please,you
yes,we,all,know,how,important,my,pleasure,is,to,you,father
but,there’s,more,to,this
the,key,to,the,north,you,say
the,greyjoys,hold,the,north,now,and,king,balon,has,a,daughter
why,sansa,stark,and,not,her
he,looked,into,his,father’s,cool,green,eyes,with,their,bright,flecks,of,gold
lord,tywin,steepled,his,fingers,beneath,his,chin
balon,greyjoy,thinks,in,terms,of,plunder,not,rule
let,him,enjoy,an,autumn,crown,and,suffer,a,northern,winter
he,will,give,his,subjects,no,cause,to,love,him
come,spring,the,northmen,will,have,had,a,bellyful,of,krakens
when,you,bring,eddard,stark’s,grandson,home,to,claim,his,birthright,lords,and,little,folk,alike,will,rise,as,one,to,place,him,on,the,high,seat,of,his,ancestors
you,are,capable,of,getting,a,woman,with,child,i,hope
i,believe,i,am,he,said,bristling
i,confess,i,cannot,prove,it
though,no,one,can,say,i,have,not,tried
why,i,plant,my,little,seeds,just,as,often,as,i,can
in,the,gutters,and,the,ditches,finished,lord,tywin,and,in,common,ground,where,only,bastard,weeds,take,root
it,is,past,time,you,kept,your,own,garden
he,rose,to,his,feet
you,shall,never,have,casterly,rock,i,promise,you
but,wed,sansa,stark,and,it,is,just,possible,that,you,might,win,winterfell
tyrion,lannister,lord,protector,of,winterfell
the,prospect,gave,him,a,queer,chill
very,good,father,he,said,slowly,but,there’s,a,big,ugly,roach,in,your,rushes
robb,stark,is,as,capable,as,i,am,presumably,and,sworn,to,marry,one,of,those,fertile,freys
and,once,the,young,wolf,sires,a,litter,any,pups,that,sansa,births,are,heirs,to,nothing
lord,tywin,was,unconcerned
robb,stark,will,father,no,children,on,his,fertile,frey,you,have,my,word
there,is,a,bit,of,news,i,have,not,yet,seen,fit,to,share,with,the,council,though,no,doubt,the,good,lords,will,hear,it,soon,enough
the,young,wolf,has,taken,gawen,westerling’s,eldest,daughter,to,wife
for,a,moment,tyrion,could,not,believe,he’d,heard,his,father,right
he,broke,his,sworn,word
he,said,incredulous
he,threw,away,the,freys,for
words,failed,him
a,maid,of,sixteen,years,named,jeyne,said,ser,kevan
lord,gawen,once,suggested,her,to,me,for,willem,or,martyn,but,i,had,to,refuse,him
gawen,is,a,good,man,but,his,wife,is,sybell,spicer
he,should,never,have,wed,her
the,westerlings,always,did,have,more,honor,than,sense
lady,sybell’s,grandfather,was,a,trader,in,saffron,and,pepper,almost,as,lowborn,as,that,smuggler,stannis,keeps
and,the,grandmother,was,some,woman,he’d,brought,back,from,the,east
a,frightening,old,crone,supposed,to,be,a,priestess
maegi,they,called,her
no,one,could,pronounce,her,real,name
half,of,lannisport,used,to,go,to,her,for,cures,and,love,potions,and,the,like
he,shrugged
she’s,long,dead,to,be,sure
and,jeyne,seemed,a,sweet,child,i’ll,grant,you,though,i,only,saw,her,once
but,with,such,doubtful,blood
having,once,married,a,whore,tyrion,could,not,entirely,share,his,uncle’s,horror,at,the,thought,of,wedding,a,girl,whose,great,grandfather,sold,cloves
even,so
a,sweet,child,ser,kevan,had,said,but,many,a,poison,was,sweet,as,well
the,westerlings,were,old,blood,but,they,had,more,pride,than,power
it,would,not,surprise,him,to,learn,that,lady,sybell,had,brought,more,wealth,to,the,marriage,than,her,highborn,husband
the,westerling,mines,had,failed,years,ago,their,best,lands,had,been,sold,off,or,lost,and,the,crag,was,more,ruin,than,stronghold
a,romantic,ruin,though,jutting,up,so,brave,above,the,sea
i,am,surprised,tyrion,had,to,confess
i,thought,robb,stark,had,better,sense
he,is,a,boy,of,sixteen,said,lord,tywin
at,that,age,sense,weighs,for,little,against,lust,and,love,and,honor
he,forswore,himself,shamed,an,ally,betrayed,a,solemn,promise
where,is,the,honor,in,that
ser,kevan,answered
he,chose,the,girl’s,honor,over,his,own
once,he,had,deflowered,her,he,had,no,other,course
it,would,have,been,kinder,to,leave,her,with,a,bastard,in,her,belly,said,tyrion,bluntly
the,westerlings,stood,to,lose,everything,here,their,lands,their,castle,their,very,lives
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts
jeyne,westerling,is,her,mother’s,daughter,said,lord,tywin,and,robb,stark,is,his,father’s,son
this,westerling,betrayal,did,not,seem,to,have,enraged,his,father,as,much,as,tyrion,would,have,expected
lord,tywin,did,not,suffer,disloyalty,in,his,vassals
he,had,extinguished,the,proud,reynes,of,castamere,and,the,ancient,tarbecks,of,tarbeck,hall,root,and,branch,when,he,was,still,half,a,boy
the,singers,had,even,made,a,rather,gloomy,song,of,it
some,years,later,when,lord,farman,of,faircastle,grew,truculent,lord,tywin,sent,an,envoy,bearing,a,lute,instead,of,a,letter
but,once,he’d,heard,the,rains,of,castamere,echoing,through,his,hall,lord,farman,gave,no,further,trouble
and,if,the,song,were,not,enough,the,shattered,castles,of,the,reynes,and,tarbecks,still,stood,as,mute,testimony,to,the,fate,that,awaited,those,who,chose,to,scorn,the,power,of,casterly,rock
the,crag,is,not,so,far,from,tarbeck,hall,and,castamere,tyrion,pointed,out
you’d,think,the,westerlings,might,have,ridden,past,and,seen,the,lesson,there
mayhaps,they,have,lord,tywin,said
they,are,well,aware,of,castamere,i,promise,you
could,the,westerlings,and,spicers,be,such,great,fools,as,to,believe,the,wolf,can,defeat,the,lion
every,once,in,a,very,long,while,lord,tywin,lannister,would,actually,threaten,to,smile,he,never,did,but,the,threat,alone,was,terrible,to,behold
the,greatest,fools,are,ofttimes,more,clever,than,the,men,who,laugh,at,them,he,said,and,then,you,will,marry,sansa,stark,tyrion
and,soon
catelyn,they,carried,the,corpses,in,upon,their,shoulders,and,laid,them,beneath,the,dais
a,silence,fell,across,the,torchlit,hall,and,in,the,quiet,catelyn,could,hear,grey,wind,howling,half,a,castle,away

she,stood,at,robb’s,left,hand,beside,the,high,seat,and,for,a,moment,felt,almost,as,if,she,were,looking,down,at,her,own,dead,at,bran,and,rickon
these,boys,had,been,much,older,but,death,had,shrunken,them
naked,and,wet,they,seemed,such,little,things,so,still,it,was,hard,to,remember,them,living
the,blond,boy,had,been,trying,to,grow,a,beard
pale,yellow,peach,fuzz,covered,his,cheeks,and,jaw,above,the,red,ruin,the,knife,had,made,of,his,throat
his,long,golden,hair,was,still,wet,as,if,he,had,been,pulled,from,a,bath
by,the,look,of,him,he,had,died,peacefully,perhaps,in,sleep,but,his,brown-haired,cousin,had,fought,for,life
his,arms,bore,slashes,where,he’d,tried,to,block,the,blades,and,red,still,trickled,slowly,from,the,stab,wounds,that,covered,his,chest,and,belly,and,back,like,so,many,tongueless,mouths,though,the,rain,had,washed,him,almost,clean
robb,had,donned,his,crown,before,coming,to,the,hall,and,the,bronze,shone,darkly,in,the,torchlight
shadows,hid,his,eyes,as,he,looked,upon,the,dead
does,he,see,bran,and,rickon,as,well
she,might,have,wept,but,there,were,no,tears,left,in,her
the,dead,boys,were,pale,from,long,imprisonment,and,both,had,been,fair,against,their,smooth,white,skin,the,blood,was,shockingly,red,unbearable,to,look,upon

it,seemed,a,very,long,time,before,robb,lifted,his,eyes,from,the,bloody,dead

wordless,smalljon,umber,turned,to,obey,his,steps,echoing,in,the,great,stone,hall

the,captors,and,the,captives,looked,much,alike,big,men,every,one,with,thick,beards,and,long,hair
two,of,the,greatjon’s,men,were,wounded,and,three,of,their,prisoners
only,the,fact,that,some,had,spears,and,others,empty,scabbards,served,to,set,them,apart

the,greatjon,snatched,a,spear,from,the,man,beside,him,and,jerked,it,to,his,shoulder

outside,the,thunder,crashed,and,boomed,so,loud,it,sounded,as,if,the,castle,were,coming,down,about,their,ears
is,this,the,sound,of,a,kingdom,falling
catelyn,wondered
it,was,dark,within,the,audience,chamber,but,at,least,the,sound,of,the,thunder,was,muffled,by,another,thickness,of,wall
a,servant,entered,with,an,oil,lamp,to,light,the,fire,but,robb,sent,him,away,and,kept,the,lamp
there,were,tables,and,chairs,but,only,edmure,sat,and,he,rose,again,when,he,realized,that,the,others,had,remainded,standing
robb,took,off,his,crown,and,placed,it,on,the,table,before,him
the,blackfish,shut,the,door
the,karstarks,are,gone
all
was,it,anger,or,despair,that,thickened,robb’s,voice,like,that
even,catelyn,was,not,certain
all,the,fighting,men,ser,brynden,replied
a,few,camp,followers,and,serving,men,were,left,with,their,wounded
we,questioned,as,many,as,we,needed,to,be,certain,of,the,truth
they,started,leaving,at,nightfall,stealing,off,in,ones,and,twos,at,first,and,then,in,larger,groups
the,wounded,men,and,servants,were,told,to,keep,the,campfires,lit,so,no,one,would,know,they’d,gone,but,once,the,rains,began,it,didn’t,matter
will,they,re-form,away,from,riverrun
asked,robb
no
they’ve,scattered,hunting

catelyn,felt,ill,again
near,three,hundred,riders,and,twice,as,many,mounts,melted,away,in,the,night

all,the,mounted,strength,of,karhold,lost
lost,by,me
by,me,may,the,gods,forgive,me
catelyn,did,not,need,to,be,a,soldier,to,grasp,the,trap,robb,was,in
for,the,moment,he,held,the,riverlands,but,his,kingdom,was,surrounded,by,enemies,to,every,side,but,east,where,lysa,sat,aloof,on,her,mountaintop
even,the,trident,was,scarce,secure,so,long,as,the,lord,of,the,crossing,withheld,his,allegiance
and,now,to,lose,the,karstarks,as,well
no,word,of,this,must,leave,riverrun,her,brother,edmure,said

sansa
catelyn’s,nails,dug,into,the,soft,flesh,of,her,palms,so,hard,did,she,close,her,hand
robb,gave,edmure,a,look,that,chilled
would,you,make,me,a,liar,as,well,as,a,murderer,uncle
we,need,speak,no,falsehood

jeyne,she,called,after,there’s,one,more,thing,robb,needs,from,you,though,he,may,not,know,it,yet,himself
a,king,must,have,an,heir

an,eddard,and,a,brandon,she,sighed,softly
and,perhaps,in,time,a,hoster
would,you,like,that
he,did,not,answer,but,she,had,never,expected,that,he,would
as,the,sound,of,the,rain,on,the,roof,mingled,with,her,father’s,breathing,she,thought,about,jeyne

even,as,children,they,would,creep,into,each,other’s,beds,and,sleep,with,their,arms,entwined
even,in,the,womb
long,before,his,sister’s,flowering,or,the,advent,of,his,own,manhood,they,had,seen,mares,and,stallions,in,the,fields,and,dogs,and,bitches,in,the,kennels,and,played,at,doing,the,same

behind,the,wall,jaime,called,fighting,to,turn,his,half-blind,mount,back,toward,the,fight
the,reins,were,tangled,in,his,damned,chains,and,the,air,was,full,of,arrows,again
at,them
he,shouted,kicking,to,show,her,how,it,was,done
the,old,sorry,horse,found,a,burst,of,speed,from,somewhere
suddenly,they,were,racing,across,the,wheatfield,throwing,up,clouds,of,chaff
jaime,had,just,enough,time,to,think,the,wench,had,better,follow,before,they,realize,they’re,being,charged,by,an,unarmed,man,in,chains

by,the,time,jaime,reached,her,they,had,all,melted,into,the,wood,twenty,yards,away

why,did,you,charge
bowmen,are,fearless,so,long,as,they,can,hide,behind,walls,and,shoot,at,you,from,afar,but,if,you,come,at,them,they,run
they,know,what,will,happen,when,you,reach,them
you,have,an,arrow,in,your,back,you,know

they,found,cleos,still,tangled,in,his,stirrup
he,had,an,arrow,through,his,right,arm,and,a,second,in,his,chest,but,it,was,the,ground,that,had,done,for,him
the,top,of,his,head,was,matted,with,blood,and,mushy,to,the,touch,pieces,of,broken,bone,moving,under,the,skin,beneath,the,pressure,of,jaime’s,hand

i,will,not,arm,you
and,my,name,is,brienne,i,know

tired,of,her,suspicions,tired,of,her,insults,tired,of,her,crooked,teeth,and,her,broad,spotty,face,and,that,limp,thin,hair,of,hers
ignoring,her,protests,he,grasped,the,hilt,of,his,cousin’s,longsword,with,both,hands,held,the,corpse,down,with,his,foot,and,pulled
as,the,blade,slid,from,the,scabbard,he,was,already,pivoting,bringing,the,sword,around,and,up,in,a,swift,deadly,arc
steel,met,steel,with,a,ringing,bone-jarring,clang
somehow,brienne,had,gotten,her,own,blade,out,in,time
jaime,laughed
very,good,wench

oh,i,will
he,sprang,to,his,feet,and,drove,at,her,the,longsword,alive,in,his,hands
brienne,jumped,back,parrying,but,he,followed,pressing,the,attack
no,sooner,did,she,turn,one,cut,than,the,next,was,upon,her
the,swords,kissed,and,sprang,apart,and,kissed,again
jaime’s,blood,was,singing
this,was,what,he,was,meant,for,he,never,felt,so,alive,as,when,he,was,fighting,with,death,balanced,on,every,stroke
and,with,my,wrists,chained,together,the,wench,may,even,give,me,a,contest,for,a,time
his,chains,forced,him,to,use,a,two-handed,grip,though,of,course,the,weight,and,reach,were,less,than,if,the,blade,had,been,a,true,two-handed,greatsword,but,what,did,it,matter
his,cousin’s,sword,was,long,enough,to,write,an,end,to,this,brienne,of,tarth
high,low,overhand,he,rained,down,steel,upon,her
left,right,backslash,swinging,so,hard,that,sparks,flew,when,the,swords,came,together,upswing,sideslash,overhand,always,attacking,moving,into,her,step,and,slide,strike,and,step,step,and,strike,hacking,slashing,faster,faster,faster

until,breathless,he,stepped,back,and,let,the,point,of,the,sword,fall,to,the,ground,giving,her,a,moment,of,respite
not,half,bad,he,acknowledged
for,a,wench
she,took,a,slow,deep,breath,her,eyes,watching,him,warily
i,would,not,hurt,you,kingslayer
as,if,you,could
he,whirled,the,blade,back,up,above,his,head,and,flew,at,her,again,chains,rattling
jaime,could,not,have,said,how,long,he,pressed,the,attack
it,might,have,been,minutes,or,it,might,have,been,hours,time,slept,when,swords,woke
he,drove,her,away,from,his,cousin’s,corpse,drove,her,across,the,road,drove,her,into,the,trees
she,stumbled,once,on,a,root,she,never,saw,and,for,a,moment,he,thought,she,was,done,but,she,went,to,one,knee,instead,of,falling,and,never,lost,a,beat
her,sword,leapt,up,to,block,a,downcut,that,would,have,opened,her,from,shoulder,to,groin,and,then,she,cut,at,him,again,and,again,fighting,her,way,back,to,her,feet,stroke,by,stroke
the,dance,went,on
he,pinned,her,against,an,oak,cursed,as,she,slipped,away,followed,her,through,a,shallow,brook,half-choked,with,fallen,leaves
steel,rang,steel,sang,steel,screamed,and,sparked,and,scraped,and,the,woman,started,grunting,like,a,sow,at,every,crash,yet,somehow,he,could,not,reach,her
it,was,as,if,she,had,an,iron,cage,around,her,that,stopped,every,blow
not,bad,at,all,he,said,when,he,paused,for,a,second,to,catch,his,breath,circling,to,her,right
for,a,wench
for,a,squire,say
a,green,one

come,on,come,on,my,sweetling,the,music’s,still,playing
might,i,have,this,dance,my,lady
grunting,she,came,at,him,blade,whirling,and,suddenly,it,was,jaime,struggling,to,keep,steel,from,skin
one,of,her,slashes,raked,across,his,brow,and,blood,ran,down,into,his,right,eye
the,others,take,her,and,riverrun,as,well
his,skills,had,gone,to,rust,and,rot,in,that,bloody,dungeon,and,the,chains,were,no,great,help,either
his,eye,closed,his,shoulders,were,going,numb,from,the,jarring,they’d,taken,and,his,wrists,ached,from,the,weight,of,chains,manacles,and,sword
his,longsword,grew,heavier,with,every,blow,and,jaime,knew,he,was,not,swinging,it,as,quickly,as,he’d,done,earlier,nor,raising,it,as,high
she,is,stronger,than,i,am
the,realization,chilled,him

amongst,the,living,greatjon,umber,was,stronger,strongboar,of,crakehall,most,likely,both,cleganes,for,a,certainty
the,mountain’s,strength,was,like,nothing,human
it,did,not,matter
with,speed,and,skill,jaime,could,beat,them,all
but,this,was,a,woman
a,huge,cow,of,a,woman,to,be,sure,but,even,so
by,rights,she,should,be,the,one,wearing,down
instead,she,forced,him,back,into,the,brook,again,shouting,yield

a,slick,stone,turned,under,jaime’s,foot
as,he,felt,himself,falling,he,twisted,the,mischance,into,a,diving,lunge
his,point,scraped,past,her,parry,and,bit,into,her,upper,thigh
a,red,flower,blossomed,and,jaime,had,an,instant,to,savor,the,sight,of,her,blood,before,his,knee,slammed,into,a,rock

he,managed,to,jerk,her,dagger,from,its,sheath,but,before,he,could,plunge,it,into,her,belly,she,caught,his,wrist,and,slammed,his,hands,back,on,a,rock,so,hard,he,thought,she’d,wrenched,an,arm,from,its,socket
her,other,hand,spread,across,his,face

men,will,be,calling,you,tom,sevensons,before,much,longer
as,it,happens,said,tom,i,passed,seven,many,years,ago

a,pack,of,wolves,came,howling,around,my,gates,thinking,i,might,have,jaime,lannister,in,here
tom,stopped,his,plucking
then,it’s,true,the,kingslayer,is,loose,again

what,did,m’lady,tell,them
asked,jack-be-lucky
why,that,i,had,ser,jaime,naked,in,my,bed,but,i’d,left,him,much,too,exhausted,to,come,down
one,of,them,had,the,effrontery,to,call,me,a,liar,so,we,saw,them,off,with,a,few,quarrels
i,believe,they,made,for,blackbottom,bend
arya,squirmed,restlessly,in,her,seat
what,northmen,was,it,who,came,looking,after,the,kingslayer
lady,smallwood,seemed,surprised,that,she’d,spoken
they,did,not,give,their,names,child,but,they,wore,black,with,the,badge,of,a,white,sun,on,the,breast
a,white,sun,on,black,was,the,sigil,of,lord,karstark,arya,thought
those,were,robb’s,men
she,wondered,if,they,were,still,close
if,she,could,give,the,outlaws,the,slip,and,find,them,maybe,they,would,take,her,to,her,mother,at,riverrun
did,they,say,how,lannister,came,to,escape

that’s,madness
it’s,not,true,thought,arya
it,couldn’t,be,true
i,thought,the,same,said,lady,smallwood
that,was,when,harwin,remembered,arya
such,talk,is,not,for,your,ears,milady

arya,stalked,away,angry,and,would,have,slammed,the,door,if,it,hadn’t,been,so,heavy
darkness,had,settled,over,acorn,hall
a,few,torches,burned,along,the,walls,but,that,was,all
the,gates,of,the,little,castle,were,closed,and,barred
she,had,promised,harwin,that,she,would,not,try,and,run,away,again,she,knew,but,that,was,before,they,started,telling,lies,about,her,mother
arya
gendry,had,followed,her,out
lady,smallwood,said,there’s,a,smithy
want,to,have,a,look
if,you,want
she,had,nothing,else,to,do
this,thoros,gendry,said,as,they,walked,past,the,kennels,is,he,the,same,thoros,who,lived,in,the,castle,at,king’s,landing
a,red,priest,fat,with,a,shaved,head
i,think,so
arya,had,never,spoken,to,thoros,at,king’s,landing,that,she,could,recall,but,she,knew,who,he,was
he,and,jalabhar,xho,had,been,the,most,colorful,figures,at,robert’s,court,and,thoros,was,a,great,friend,of,the,king,as,well
he,won’t,remember,me,but,he,used,to,come,to,our,forge
the,smallwood,forge,had,not,been,used,in,some,time,though,the,smith,had,hung,his,tools,neatly,on,the,wall
gendry,lit,a,candle,and,set,it,on,the,anvil,while,he,took,down,a,pair,of,tongs
my,master,always,scolded,him,about,his,flaming,swords
it,was,no,way,to,treat,good,steel,he’d,say,but,this,thoros,never,used,good,steel
he’d,just,dip,some,cheap,sword,in,wildfire,and,set,it,alight
it,was,only,an,alchemist’s,trick,my,master,said,but,it,scared,the,horses,and,some,of,the,greener,knights
she,screwed,up,her,face,trying,to,remember,if,her,father,had,ever,talked,about,thoros
he,isn’t,very,priestly,is,he
no,gendry,admitted
master,mott,said,thoros,could,outdrink,even,king,robert
they,were,pease,in,a,pod,he,told,me,both,gluttons,and,sots
you,shouldn’t,call,the,king,a,sot
maybe,king,robert,had,drunk,a,lot,but,he’d,been,her,father’s,friend
i,was,talking,about,thoros
gendry,reached,out,with,the,tongs,as,if,to,pinch,her,face,but,arya,swatted,them,away
he,liked,feasts,and,tourneys,that,was,why,king,robert,was,so,fond,of,him
and,this,thoros,was,brave
when,the,walls,of,pyke,crashed,down,he,was,the,first,through,the,breach
he,fought,with,one,of,his,flaming,swords,setting,ironmen,afire,with,every,slash
i,wish,i,had,a,flaming,sword
arya,could,think,of,lots,of,people,she’d,like,to,set,on,fire
it’s,only,a,trick,i,told,you
the,wildfire,ruins,the,steel
my,master,sold,thoros,a,new,sword,after,every,tourney
every,time,they,would,have,a,fight,about,the,price
gendry,hung,the,tongs,back,up,and,took,down,the,heavy,hammer
master,mott,said,it,was,time,i,made,my,first,longsword
he,gave,me,a,sweet,piece,of,steel,and,i,knew,just,how,i,wanted,to,shape,the,blade
only,yoren,came,and,took,me,away,for,the,night’s,watch
you,can,still,make,swords,if,you,want,said,arya
you,can,make,them,for,my,brother,robb,when,we,get,to,riverrun
riverrun
gendry,put,the,hammer,down,and,looked,at,her
you,look,different,now
like,a,proper,little,girl
i,look,like,an,oak,tree,with,all,these,stupid,acorns
nice,though
a,nice,oak,tree
he,stepped,closer,and,sniffed,at,her
you,even,smell,nice,for,a,change
you,don’t
you,stink
arya,shoved,him,back,against,the,anvil,and,made,to,run,but,gendry,caught,her,arm
she,stuck,a,foot,between,his,legs,and,tripped,him,but,he,yanked,her,down,with,him,and,they,rolled,across,the,floor,of,the,smithy
he,was,very,strong,but,she,was,quicker
every,time,he,tried,to,hold,her,still,she,wriggled,free,and,punched,him
gendry,only,laughed,at,the,blows,which,made,her,mad
he,finally,caught,both,her,wrists,in,one,hand,and,started,to,tickle,her,with,the,other,so,arya,slammed,her,knee,between,his,legs,and,wrenched,free
both,of,them,were,covered,in,dirt,and,one,sleeve,was,torn,on,her,stupid,acorn,dress
i,bet,i,don’t,look,so,nice,now,she,shouted
tom,was,singing,when,they,returned,to,the,hall
my,featherbed,is,deep,and,soft,and,there,i’ll,lay,you,down,i’ll,dress,you,all,in,yellow,silk,and,on,your,head,a,crown
for,you,shall,be,my,lady,love,and,i,shall,be,your,lord
i’ll,always,keep,you,warm,and,safe,and,guard,you,with,my,sword
harwin,took,one,look,at,them,and,burst,out,laughing,and,anguy,smiled,one,of,his,stupid,freckly,smiles,and,said,are,we,certain,this,one,is,a,highborn,lady
but,lem,lemoncloak,gave,gendry,a,clout,alongside,the,head
you,want,to,fight,fight,with,me
she’s,a,girl,and,half,your,age
you,keep,your,hands,off,o’,her,you,hear,me
i,started,it,said,arya
gendry,was,just,talking

arya,did,start,it,i,have,no,doubt
she,was,much,the,same,at,winterfell
tom,winked,at,her,as,he,sang,and,how,she,smiled,and,how,she,laughed,the,maiden,of,the,tree
she,spun,away,and,said,to,him,no,featherbed,for,me
i’ll,wear,a,gown,of,golden,leaves,and,bind,my,hair,with,grass,but,you,can,be,my,forest,love,and,me,your,forest,lass
i,have,no,gowns,of,leaves,said,lady,smallwood,with,a,small,fond,smile,but,carellen,left,some,other,dresses,that,might,serve
come,child,let,us,go,upstairs,and,see,what,we,can,find
it,was,even,worse,than,before,lady,smallwood,insisted,that,arya,take,another,bath,and,cut,and,comb,her,hair,besides,the,dress,she,put,her,in,this,time,was,sort,of,lilac-colored,and,decorated,with,little,baby,pearls
the,only,good,thing,about,it,was,that,it,was,so,delicate,that,no,one,could,expect,her,to,ride,in,it
so,the,next,morning,as,they,broke,their,fast,lady,smallwood,gave,her,breeches,belt,and,tunic,to,wear,and,a,brown,doeskin,jerkin,dotted,with,iron,studs
they,were,my,son’s,things,she,said

the,gods,of,ghis,were,dead,and,so,too,its,people,these,astapori,were,mongrels,ser,jorah,said
even,the,ghiscari,tongue,was,largely,forgotten,the,slave,cities,spoke,the,high,valyrian,of,their,conquerors,or,what,they,had,made,of,it
yet,the,symbol,of,the,old,empire,still,endured,here,though,this,bronze,monster,had,a,heavy,chain,dangling,from,her,talons,an,open,manacle,at,either,end

even,the,dim,purple,eyes,of,a,sunset,savage,can,see,how,magnificent,my,creatures,are,surely
kraznys’s,high,valyrian,was,twisted,and,thickened,by,the,characteristic,growl,of,ghis,and,flavored,here,and,there,with,words,of,slaver,argot
dany,understood,him,well,enough,but,she,smiled,and,looked,blankly,at,the,slave,girl,as,if,wondering,what,he,might,have,said
the,good,master,kraznys,asks,are,they,not,magnificent
the,girl,spoke,the,common,tongue,well,for,one,who,had,never,been,to,westeros
no,older,than,ten,she,had,the,round,flat,face,dusky,skin,and,golden,eyes,of,naath
the,peaceful,people,her,folk,were,called
all,agreed,that,they,made,the,best,slaves
they,might,be,adequate,to,my,needs,dany,answered

my,bear,is,more,clever,than,he,looks

the,westerosi,woman,is,pleased,with,them,but,speaks,no,praise,to,keep,the,price,down,the,translator,told,her,master
she,wishes,to,know,how,they,were,trained
kraznys,mo,nakloz,bobbed,his,head
he,smelled,as,if,he’d,bathed,in,raspberries,this,slaver,and,his,jutting,red-black,beard,glistened,with,oil
he,has,larger,breasts,than,i,do,dany,reflected
she,could,see,them,through,the,thin,sea-green,silk,of,the,gold-fringed,tokar,he,wound,about,his,body,and,over,one,shoulder
his,left,hand,held,the,tokar,in,place,as,he,walked,while,his,right,clasped,a,short,leather,whip
are,all,westerosi,pigs,so,ignorant
he,complained
all,the,world,knows,that,the,unsullied,are,masters,of,spear,and,shield,and,shortsword
he,gave,dany,a,broad,smile
tell,her,what,she,would,know,slave,and,be,quick,about,it
the,day,is,hot
that,much,at,least,is,no,lie
a,matched,pair,of,slave,girls,stood,behind,them,holding,a,striped,silk,awning,over,their,heads,but,even,in,the,shade,dany,felt,light-headed,and,kraznys,was,perspiring,freely
the,plaza,of,pride,had,been,baking,in,the,sun,since,dawn
even,through,the,thickness,of,her,sandals,she,could,feel,the,warmth,of,the,red,bricks,underfoot
waves,of,heat,rose,off,them,shimmering,to,make,the,stepped,pyramids,of,astapor,around,the,plaza,seem,half,a,dream
if,the,unsullied,felt,the,heat,however,they,gave,no,hint,of,it
they,could,be,made,of,brick,themselves,the,way,they,stand,there
a,thousand,had,been,marched,out,of,their,barracks,for,her,inspection,drawn,up,in,ten,ranks,of,one,hundred,before,the,fountain,and,its,great,bronze,harpy,they,stood,stiffly,at,attention,their,stony,eyes,fixed,straight,ahead
they,wore,nought,but,white,linen,clouts,knotted,about,their,loins,and,conical,bronze,helms,topped,with,a,sharpened,spike,a,foot,tall
kraznys,had,commanded,them,to,lay,down,their,spears,and,shields,and,doff,their,swordbelts,and,quilted,tunics,so,the,queen,of,westeros,might,better,inspect,the,lean,hardness,of,their,bodies
they,are,chosen,young,for,size,and,speed,and,strength,the,slave,told,her
they,begin,their,training,at,five
every,day,they,train,from,dawn,to,dusk,until,they,have,mastered,the,shortsword,the,shield,and,the,three,spears
the,training,is,most,rigorous,your,grace
only,one,boy,in,three,survives,it
this,is,well,known
among,the,unsullied,it,is,said,that,on,the,day,they,win,their,spiked,cap,the,worst,is,done,with,for,no,duty,that,will,ever,fall,to,them,could,be,as,hard,as,their,training
kraznys,mo,nakloz,supposedly,spoke,no,word,of,the,common,tongue,but,he,bobbed,his,head,as,he,listened,and,from,time,to,time,gave,the,slave,girl,a,poke,with,the,end,of,his,lash
tell,her,that,these,have,been,standing,here,for,a,day,and,a,night,with,no,food,nor,water
tell,her,that,they,will,stand,until,they,drop,if,i,should,command,it,and,when,nine,hundred,and,ninety-nine,have,collapsed,to,die,upon,the,bricks,the,last,will,stand,there,still,and,never,move,until,his,own,death,claims,him
such,is,their,courage
tell,her,that
i,call,that,madness,not,courage,said,arstan,whitebeard,when,the,solemn,little,scribe,was,done
he,tapped,the,end,of,his,hardwood,staff,against,the,bricks,tap,tap,as,if,to,tell,his,displeasure
the,old,man,had,not,wanted,to,sail,to,astapor,nor,did,he,favor,buying,this,slave,army
a,queen,should,hear,all,sides,before,reaching,a,decision
that,was,why,dany,had,brought,him,with,her,to,the,plaza,of,pride,not,to,keep,her,safe
her,bloodriders,would,do,that,well,enough
ser,jorah,mormont,she,had,left,aboard,balerion,to,guard,her,people,and,her,dragons
much,against,her,inclination,she,had,locked,the,dragons,belowdecks
it,was,too,dangerous,to,let,them,fly,freely,over,the,city,the,world,was,all,too,full,of,men,who,would,gladly,kill,them,for,no,better,reason,than,to,name,themselves,dragonslayer
what,did,the,smelly,old,man,say
the,slaver,demanded,of,his,translator
when,she,told,him,he,smiled,and,said,inform,the,savages,that,we,call,this,obedience
others,may,be,stronger,or,quicker,or,larger,than,the,unsullied
some,few,may,even,equal,their,skill,with,sword,and,spear,and,shield
but,nowhere,between,the,seas,will,you,ever,find,any,more,obedient
sheep,are,obedient,said,arstan,when,the,words,had,been,translated
he,had,some,valyrian,as,well,though,not,so,much,as,dany,but,like,her,he,was,feigning,ignorance
kraznys,mo,nakloz,showed,his,big,white,teeth,when,that,was,rendered,back,to,him
a,word,from,me,and,these,sheep,would,spill,his,stinking,old,bowels,on,the,bricks,he,said,but,do,not,say,that
tell,them,that,these,creatures,are,more,dogs,than,sheep
do,they,eat,dogs,or,horse,in,these,seven,kingdoms
they,prefer,pigs,and,cows,your,worship

pfag
food,for,unwashed,savages
ignoring,them,all,dany,walked,slowly,down,the,line,of,slave,soldiers
the,girls,followed,close,behind,with,the,silk,awning,to,keep,her,in,the,shade,but,the,thousand,men,before,her,enjoyed,no,such,protection
more,than,half,had,the,copper,skins,and,almond,eyes,of,dothraki,and,lhazerene,but,she,saw,men,of,the,free,cities,in,the,ranks,as,well,along,with,pale,qartheen,ebon-faced,summer,islanders,and,others,whose,origins,she,could,not,guess
and,some,had,skins,of,the,same,amber,hue,as,kraznys,mo,nakloz,and,the,bristly,red-black,hair,that,marked,the,ancient,folk,of,ghis,who,named,themselves,the,harpy’s,sons
they,sell,even,their,own,kind
it,should,not,have,surprised,her
the,dothraki,did,the,same,when,khalasar,met,khalasar,in,the,sea,of,grass
some,of,the,soldiers,were,tall,and,some,were,short
they,ranged,in,age,from,fourteen,to,twenty,she,judged
their,cheeks,were,smooth,and,their,eyes,all,the,same,be,they,black,or,brown,or,blue,or,grey,or,amber
they,are,like,one,man,dany,thought,until,she,remembered,that,they,were,no,men,at,all
the,unsullied,were,eunuchs,every,one,of,them
why,do,you,cut,them
she,asked,kraznys,through,the,slave,girl
whole,men,are,stronger,than,eunuchs,i,have,always,heard
a,eunuch,who,is,cut,young,will,never,have,the,brute,strength,of,one,of,your,westerosi,knights,this,is,true,said,kraznys,mo,nakloz,when,the,question,was,put,to,him
a,bull,is,strong,as,well,but,bulls,die,every,day,in,the,fighting,pits
a,girl,of,nine,killed,one,not,three,days,past,in,jothiel’s,pit
the,unsullied,have,something,better,than,strength,tell,her
they,have,discipline
we,fight,in,the,fashion,of,the,old,empire,yes
they,are,the,lockstep,legions,of,old,ghis,come,again,absolutely,obedient,absolutely,loyal,and,utterly,without,fear
dany,listened,patiently,to,the,translation
even,the,bravest,men,fear,death,and,maiming,arstan,said,when,the,girl,was,done
kraznys,smiled,again,when,he,heard,that
tell,the,old,man,that,he,smells,of,piss,and,needs,a,stick,to,hold,him,up
truly,your,worship
he,poked,her,with,his,lash
no,not,truly,are,you,a,girl,or,a,goat,to,ask,such,folly
say,that,unsullied,are,not,men
say,that,death,means,nothing,to,them,and,maiming,less,than,nothing
he,stopped,before,a,thickset,man,who,had,the,look,of,lhazar,about,him,and,brought,his,whip,up,sharply,laying,a,line,of,blood,across,one,copper,cheek
the,eunuch,blinked,and,stood,there,bleeding
would,you,like,another
asked,kraznys
if,it,please,your,worship
it,was,hard,to,pretend,not,to,understand

the,brick,pyramids,were,all,glimmery,with,light
but,it,is,dark,below,in,the,streets,and,plazas,and,fighting,pits

say,what,you,will,ser
when,aegon,the,dragon,stepped,ashore,in,westeros,the,kings,of,vale,and,rock,and,reach,did,not,rush,to,hand,him,their,crowns

the,blood,of,innocents,is,another,matter
eight,thousand,unsullied,they,would,offer,me
eight,thousand,dead,babes
eight,thousand,strangled,dogs
your,grace,said,jorah,mormont,i,saw,king’s,landing,after,the,sack
babes,were,butchered,that,day,as,well,and,old,men,and,children,at,play
more,women,were,raped,than,you,can,count
there,is,a,savage,beast,in,every,man,and,when,you,hand,that,man,a,sword,or,spear,and,send,him,forth,to,war,the,beast,stirs
the,scent,of,blood,is,all,it,takes,to,wake,him
yet,i,have,never,heard,of,these,unsullied,raping,nor,putting,a,city,to,the,sword,nor,even,plundering,save,at,the,express,command,of,those,who,lead,them
brick,they,may,be,as,you,say,but,if,you,buy,them,henceforth,the,only,dogs,they’ll,kill,are,those,you,want,dead
and,you,do,have,some,dogs,you,want,dead,as,i,recall
the,usurper’s,dogs
yes
dany,gazed,off,at,the,soft,colored,lights,and,let,the,cool,salt,breeze,caress,her
you,speak,of,sacking,cities
answer,me,this,ser,why,have,the,dothraki,never,sacked,this,city
she,pointed
look,at,the,walls
you,can,see,where,they’ve,begun,to,crumble
there,and,there
do,you,see,any,guards,on,those,towers
i,don’t
are,they,hiding,ser
i,saw,these,sons,of,the,harpy,today,all,their,proud,highborn,warriors
they,dressed,in,linen,skirts,and,the,fiercest,thing,about,them,was,their,hair
even,a,modest,khalasar,could,crack,this,astapor,like,a,nut,and,spill,out,the,rotted,meat,inside
so,tell,me,why,is,that,ugly,harpy,not,sitting,beside,the,godsway,in,vaes,dothrak,among,the,other,stolen,gods
you,have,a,dragon’s,eye,khaleesi,that’s,plain,to,see
i,wanted,an,answer,not,a,compliment
there,are,two,reasons
astapor’s,brave,defenders,are,so,much,chaff,it’s,true
old,names,and,fat,purses,who,dress,up,as,ghiscari,scourges,to,pretend,they,still,rule,a,vast,empire
every,one,is,a,high,officer
on,feastdays,they,fight,mock,wars,in,the,pits,to,demonstrate,what,brilliant,commanders,they,are,but,it’s,the,eunuchs,who,do,the,dying
all,the,same,any,enemy,wanting,to,sack,astapor,would,have,to,know,that,they’d,be,facing,unsullied
the,slavers,would,turn,out,the,whole,garrison,in,the,city’s,defense
the,dothraki,have,not,ridden,against,unsullied,since,they,left,their,braids,at,the,gates,of,qohor
and,the,second,reason
dany,asked
who,would,attack,astapor
ser,jorah,asked
meereen,and,yunkai,are,rivals,but,not,enemies,the,doom,destroyed,valyria,the,folk,of,the,eastern,hinterlands,are,all,ghiscari,and,beyond,the,hills,lies,lhazar
the,lamb,men,as,your,dothraki,call,them,a,notably,unwarlike,people
yes,she,agreed,but,north,of,the,slave,cities,is,the,dothraki,sea,and,two,dozen,mighty,khals,who,like,nothing,more,than,sacking,cities,and,carrying,off,their,people,into,slavery
carrying,them,off,where
what,good,are,slaves,once,you’ve,killed,the,slavers
valyria,is,no,more,qarth,lies,beyond,the,red,waste,and,the,nine,free,cities,are,thousands,of,leagues,to,the,west
and,you,may,be,sure,the,sons,of,the,harpy,give,lavishly,to,every,passing,khal,just,as,the,magisters,do,in,pentos,and,norvos,and,myr
they,know,that,if,they,feast,the,horselords,and,give,them,gifts,they,will,soon,ride,on
it’s,cheaper,than,fighting,and,a,deal,more,certain
cheaper,than,fighting,dany,thought
yes,it,might,be
if,only,it,could,be,that,easy,for,her
how,pleasant,it,would,be,to,sail,to,king’s,landing,with,her,dragons,and,pay,the,boy,joffrey,a,chest,of,gold,to,make,him,go,away
khaleesi
ser,jorah,prompted,when,she,had,been,silent,for,a,long,time
he,touched,her,elbow,lightly
dany,shrugged,him,off
viserys,would,have,bought,as,many,unsullied,as,he,had,the,coin,for
but,you,once,said,i,was,like,rhaegar
i,remember,daenerys
your,grace,she,corrected
prince,rhaegar,led,free,men,into,battle,not,slaves
whitebeard,said,he,dubbed,his,squires,himself,and,made,many,other,knights,as,well
there,was,no,higher,honor,than,to,receive,your,knighthood,from,the,prince,of,dragonstone
tell,me,then,when,he,touched,a,man,on,the,shoulder,with,his,sword,what,did,he,say
go,forth,and,kill,the,weak’
or,go,forth,and,defend,them’
at,the,trident,those,brave,men,viserys,spoke,of,who,died,beneath,our,dragon,banners,did,they,give,their,lives,because,they,believed,in,rhaegar’s,cause,or,because,they,had,been,bought,and,paid,for
dany,turned,to,mormont,crossed,her,arms,and,waited,for,an,answer
my,queen,the,big,man,said,slowly,all,you,say,is,true
but,rhaegar,lost,on,the,trident
he,lost,the,battle,he,lost,the,war,he,lost,the,kingdom,and,he,lost,his,life
his,blood,swirled,downriver,with,the,rubies,from,his,breastplate,and,robert,the,usurper,rode,over,his,corpse,to,steal,the,iron,throne
rhaegar,fought,valiantly,rhaegar,fought,nobly,rhaegar,fought,honorably
and,rhaegar,died
bran,no,roads,ran,through,the,twisted,mountain,valleys,where,they,walked,now
between,the,grey,stone,peaks,lay,still,blue,lakes,long,and,deep,and,narrow,and,the,green,gloom,of,endless,piney,woods
the,russet,and,gold,of,autumn,leaves,grew,less,common,when,they,left,the,wolfswood,to,climb,amongst,the,old,flint,hills,and,vanished,by,the,time,those,hills,had,turned,to,mountains
giant,grey-green,sentinels,loomed,above,them,now,and,spruce,and,fir,and,soldier,pines,in,endless,profusion
the,undergrowth,was,sparse,beneath,them,the,forest,floor,carpeted,in,dark,green,needles
when,they,lost,their,way,as,happened,once,or,twice,they,need,only,wait,for,a,clear,cold,night,when,the,clouds,did,not,intrude,and,look,up,in,the,sky,for,the,ice,dragon
the,blue,star,in,the,dragon’s,eye,pointed,the,way,north,as,osha,told,him,once
thinking,of,osha,made,bran,wonder,where,she,was
he,pictured,her,safe,in,white,harbor,with,rickon,and,shaggydog,eating,eels,and,fish,and,hot,crab,pie,with,fat,lord,manderly
or,maybe,they,were,warming,themselves,at,the,last,hearth,before,the,greatjon’s,fires

up,and,down,meera,would,sigh,sometimes,as,they,walked,then,down,and,up
then,up,and,down,again
i,hate,these,stupid,mountains,of,yours,prince,bran
yesterday,you,said,you,loved,them
oh,i,do
my,lord,father,told,me,about,mountains,but,i,never,saw,one,till,now
i,love,them,more,than,i,can,say
bran,made,a,face,at,her
but,you,just,said,you,hated,them
why,can’t,it,be,both
meera,reached,up,to,pinch,his,nose
because,they’re,different,he,insisted
like,night,and,day,or,ice,and,fire
if,ice,can,burn,said,jojen,in,his,solemn,voice,then,love,and,hate,can,mate
mountain,or,marsh,it,makes,no,matter
the,land,is,one
one,his,sister,agreed,but,over,wrinkled
the,high,glens,seldom,did,them,the,courtesy,of,running,north,and,south,so,often,they,found,themselves,going,long,leagues,in,the,wrong,direction,and,sometimes,they,were,forced,to,double,back,the,way,they’d,come
if,we,took,the,kingsroad,we,could,be,at,the,wall,by,now,bran,would,remind,the,reeds
he,wanted,to,find,the,three-eyed,crow,so,he,could,learn,to,fly
half,a,hundred,times,he,said,it,if,he,said,it,once,until,meera,started,teasing,by,saying,it,along,with,him
if,we,took,the,kingsroad,we,wouldn’t,be,so,hungry,either,he,started,saying,then
down,in,the,hills,they’d,had,no,lack,of,food
meera,was,a,fine,huntress,and,even,better,at,taking,fish,from,streams,with,her,three-pronged,frog,spear
bran,liked,to,watch,her,admiring,her,quickness,the,way,she,sent,the,spear,lancing,down,and,pulled,it,back,with,a,silvery,trout,wriggling,on,the,end,of,it
and,they,had,summer,hunting,for,them,as,well
the,direwolf,vanished,most,every,night,as,the,sun,went,down,but,he,was,always,back,again,before,dawn,most,often,with,something,in,his,jaws,a,squirrel,or,a,hare
but,here,in,the,mountains,the,streams,were,smaller,and,more,icy,and,the,game,scarcer
meera,still,hunted,and,fished,when,she,could,but,it,was,harder,and,some,nights,even,summer,found,no,prey
often,they,went,to,sleep,with,empty,bellies
but,jojen,remained,stubbornly,determined,to,stay,well,away,from,roads
where,you,find,roads,you,find,travelers,he,said,in,that,way,he,had,and,travelers,have,eyes,to,see,and,mouths,to,spread,tales,of,the,crippled,boy,his,giant,and,the,wolf,that,walks,beside,them
no,one,could,get,as,stubborn,as,jojen,so,they,struggled,on,through,the,wild,and,every,day,climbed,a,little,higher,and,moved,a,little,farther,north
some,days,it,rained,some,days,were,windy,and,once,they,were,caught,in,a,sleet,storm,so,fierce,that,even,hodor,bellowed,in,dismay

just,when,bran,began,to,think,that,she,wasn’t,going,to,tell,the,story,after,all,she,began,once,there,was,a,curious,lad,who,lived,in,the,neck
he,was,small,like,all,crannogmen,but,brave,and,smart,and,strong,as,well
he,grew,up,hunting,and,fishing,and,climbing,trees,and,learned,all,the,magics,of,my,people
bran,was,almost,certain,he,had,never,heard,this,story
did,he,have,green,dreams,like,jojen
no,said,meera,but,he,could,breathe,mud,and,run,on,leaves,and,change,earth,to,water,and,water,to,earth,with,no,more,than,a,whispered,word

when,does,he,meet,the,tree,knight
meera,made,a,face,at,him
sooner,if,a,certain,prince,would,be,quiet
i,was,just,asking
the,lad,knew,the,magics,of,the,crannogs,she,continued,but,he,wanted,more
our,people,seldom,travel,far,from,home,you,know
we’re,a,small,folk,and,our,ways,seem,queer,to,some,so,the,big,people,do,not,always,treat,us,kindly
but,this,lad,was,bolder,than,most,and,one,day,when,he,had,grown,to,manhood,he,decided,he,would,leave,the,crannogs,and,visit,the,isle,of,faces
no,one,visits,the,isle,of,faces,objected,bran
that’s,where,the,green,men,live
it,was,the,green,men,he,meant,to,find
so,he,donned,a,shirt,sewn,with,bronze,scales,like,mine,took,up,a,leathern,shield,and,a,three-pronged,spear,like,mine,and,paddled,a,little,skin,boat,down,the,green,fork
bran,closed,his,eyes,to,try,and,see,the,man,in,his,little,skin,boat
in,his,head,the,crannogman,looked,like,jojen,only,older,and,stronger,and,dressed,like,meera
he,passed,beneath,the,twins,by,night,so,the,freys,would,not,attack,him,and,when,he,reached,the,trident,he,climbed,from,the,river,and,put,his,boat,on,his,head,and,began,to,walk
it,took,him,many,a,day,but,finally,he,reached,the,gods,eye,threw,his,boat,in,the,lake,and,paddled,out,to,the,isle,of,faces
did,he,meet,the,green,men
yes,said,meera,but,that’s,another,story,and,not,for,me,to,tell
my,prince,asked,for,knights
green,men,are,good,too
they,are,she,agreed,but,said,no,more,about,them
all,that,winter,the,crannogman,stayed,on,the,isle,but,when,the,spring,broke,he,heard,the,wide,world,calling,and,knew,the,time,had,come,to,leave
his,skin,boat,was,just,where,he’d,left,it,so,he,said,his,farewells,and,paddled,off,toward,shore
he,rowed,and,rowed,and,finally,saw,the,distant,towers,of,a,castle,rising,beside,the,lake
the,towers,reached,ever,higher,as,he,neared,shore,until,he,realized,that,this,must,be,the,greatest,castle,in,all,the,world
harrenhal
bran,knew,at,once
it,was,harrenhal
meera,smiled
was,it
beneath,its,walls,he,saw,tents,of,many,colors,bright,banners,cracking,in,the,wind,and,knights,in,mail,and,plate,on,barded,horses
he,smelled,roasting,meats,and,heard,the,sound,of,laughter,and,the,blare,of,heralds’,trumpets
a,great,tourney,was,about,to,commence,and,champions,from,all,over,the,land,had,come,to,contest,it
the,king,himself,was,there,with,his,son,the,dragon,prince
the,white,swords,had,come,to,welcome,a,new,brother,to,their,ranks
the,storm,lord,was,on,hand,and,the,rose,lord,as,well
the,great,lion,of,the,rock,had,quarreled,with,the,king,and,stayed,away,but,many,of,his,bannermen,and,knights,attended,all,the,same
the,crannogman,had,never,seen,such,pageantry,and,knew,he,might,never,see,the,like,again
part,of,him,wanted,nothing,so,much,as,to,be,part,of,it
bran,knew,that,feeling,well,enough
when,he’d,been,little,all,he,had,ever,dreamed,of,was,being,a,knight
but,that,had,been,before,he,fell,and,lost,his,legs
the,daughter,of,the,great,castle,reigned,as,queen,of,love,and,beauty,when,the,tourney,opened
five,champions,had,sworn,to,defend,her,crown,her,four,brothers,of,harrenhal,and,her,famous,uncle,a,white,knight,of,the,kingsguard
was,she,a,fair,maid
she,was,said,meera,hopping,over,a,stone,but,there,were,others,fairer,still
one,was,the,wife,of,the,dragon,prince,who’d,brought,a,dozen,lady,companions,to,attend,her
the,knights,all,begged,them,for,favors,to,tie,about,their,lances
this,isn’t,going,to,be,one,of,those,love,stories,is,it
bran,asked,suspiciously
hodor,doesn’t,like,those,so,much
hodor,said,hodor,agreeably
he,likes,the,stories,where,the,knights,fight,monsters
sometimes,the,knights,are,the,monsters,bran
the,little,crannogman,was,walking,across,the,field,enjoying,the,warm,spring,day,and,harming,none,when,he,was,set,upon,by,three,squires
they,were,none,older,than,fifteen,yet,even,so,they,were,bigger,than,him,all,three
this,was,their,world,as,they,saw,it,and,he,had,no,right,to,be,there
they,snatched,away,his,spear,and,knocked,him,to,the,ground,cursing,him,for,a,frogeater
were,they,walders
it,sounded,like,something,little,walder,frey,might,have,done
none,offered,a,name,but,he,marked,their,faces,well,so,he,could,revenge,himself,upon,them,later
they,shoved,him,down,every,time,he,tried,to,rise,and,kicked,him,when,he,curled,up,on,the,ground
but,then,they,heard,a,roar
that’s,my,father’s,man,you’re,kicking,’,howled,the,she-wolf
a,wolf,on,four,legs,or,two
two,said,meera
the,she-wolf,laid,into,the,squires,with,a,tourney,sword,scattering,them,all
the,crannogman,was,bruised,and,bloodied,so,she,took,him,back,to,her,lair,to,clean,his,cuts,and,bind,them,up,with,linen
there,he,met,her,pack,brothers,the,wild,wolf,who,led,them,the,quiet,wolf,beside,him,and,the,pup,who,was,youngest,of,the,four
that,evening,there,was,to,be,a,feast,in,harrenhal,to,mark,the,opening,of,the,tourney,and,the,she-wolf,insisted,that,the,lad,attend
he,was,of,high,birth,with,as,much,a,right,to,a,place,on,the,bench,as,any,other,man
she,was,not,easy,to,refuse,this,wolf,maid,so,he,let,the,young,pup,find,him,garb,suitable,to,a,king’s,feast,and,went,up,to,the,great,castle
under,harren’s,roof,he,ate,and,drank,with,the,wolves,and,many,of,their,sworn,swords,besides,barrowdown,men,and,moose,and,bears,and,mermen
the,dragon,prince,sang,a,song,so,sad,it,made,the,wolf,maid,sniffle,but,when,her,pup,brother,teased,her,for,crying,she,poured,wine,over,his,head
a,black,brother,spoke,asking,the,knights,to,join,the,night’s,watch
the,storm,lord,drank,down,the,knight,of,skulls,and,kisses,in,a,wine-cup,war
the,crannogman,saw,a,maid,with,laughing,purple,eyes,dance,with,a,white,sword,a,red,snake,and,the,lord,of,griffins,and,lastly,with,the,quiet,wolf
but,only,after,the,wild,wolf,spoke,to,her,on,behalf,of,a,brother,too,shy,to,leave,his,bench
amidst,all,this,merriment,the,little,crannogman,spied,the,three,squires,who’d,attacked,him
one,served,a,pitchfork,knight,one,a,porcupine,while,the,last,attended,a,knight,with,two,towers,on,his,surcoat,a,sigil,all,crannogmen,know,well
the,freys,said,bran
the,freys,of,the,crossing
then,as,now,she,agreed
the,wolf,maid,saw,them,too,and,pointed,them,out,to,her,brothers
i,could,find,you,a,horse,and,some,armor,that,might,fit,’,the,pup,offered
the,little,crannogman,thanked,him,but,gave,no,answer
his,heart,was,torn
crannogmen,are,smaller,than,most,but,just,as,proud
the,lad,was,no,knight,no,more,than,any,of,his,people
we,sit,a,boat,more,often,than,a,horse,and,our,hands,are,made,for,oars,not,lances
much,as,he,wished,to,have,his,vengeance,he,feared,he,would,only,make,a,fool,of,himself,and,shame,his,people
the,quiet,wolf,had,offered,the,little,crannogman,a,place,in,his,tent,that,night,but,before,he,slept,he,knelt,on,the,lakeshore,looking,across,the,water,to,where,the,isle,of,faces,would,be,and,said,a,prayer,to,the,old,gods,of,north,and,neck

the,daughter,of,the,castle,was,the,queen,of,love,and,beauty,with,four,brothers,and,an,uncle,to,defend,her,but,all,four,sons,of,harrenhal,were,defeated,on,the,first,day
their,conquerors,reigned,briefly,as,champions,until,they,were,vanquished,in,turn
as,it,happened,the,end,of,the,first,day,saw,the,porcupine,knight,win,a,place,among,the,champions,and,on,the,morning,of,the,second,day,the,pitchfork,knight,and,the,knight,of,the,two,towers,were,victorious,as,well
but,late,on,the,afternoon,of,that,second,day,as,the,shadows,grew,long,a,mystery,knight,appeared,in,the,lists
bran,nodded,sagely
mystery,knights,would,oft,appear,at,tourneys,with,helms,concealing,their,faces,and,shields,that,were,either,blank,or,bore,some,strange,device
sometimes,they,were,famous,champions,in,disguise
the,dragonknight,once,won,a,tourney,as,the,knight,of,tears,so,he,could,name,his,sister,the,queen,of,love,and,beauty,in,place,of,the,king’s,mistress
and,barristan,the,bold,twice,donned,a,mystery,knight’s,armor,the,first,time,when,he,was,only,ten
it,was,the,little,crannogman,i,bet
no,one,knew,said,meera,but,the,mystery,knight,was,short,of,stature,and,clad,in,ill-fitting,armor,made,up,of,bits,and,pieces
the,device,upon,his,shield,was,a,heart,tree,of,the,old,gods,a,white,weirwood,with,a,laughing,red,face
maybe,he,came,from,the,isle,of,faces,said,bran
was,he,green
in,old,nan’s,stories,the,guardians,had,dark,green,skin,and,leaves,instead,of,hair
sometimes,they,had,antlers,too,but,bran,didn’t,see,how,the,mystery,knight,could,have,worn,a,helm,if,he,had,antlers
i,bet,the,old,gods,sent,him
perhaps,they,did
the,mystery,knight,dipped,his,lance,before,the,king,and,rode,to,the,end,of,the,lists,where,the,five,champions,had,their,pavilions
you,know,the,three,he,challenged
the,porcupine,knight,the,pitchfork,knight,and,the,knight,of,the,twin,towers

none,were,well,loved,so,the,common,folk,cheered,lustily,for,the,knight,of,the,laughing,tree,as,the,new,champion,soon,was,called
when,his,fallen,foes,sought,to,ransom,horse,and,armor,the,knight,of,the,laughing,tree,spoke,in,a,booming,voice,through,his,helm,saying,teach,your,squire,honor,that,shall,be,ransom,enough,’,once,the,defeated,knights,chastised,their,squires,sharply,their,horses,and,armor,were,returned
and,so,the,little,crannogman’s,prayer,was,answered
by,the,green,men,or,the,old,gods,or,the,children,of,the,forest,who,can,say
it,was,a,good,story,bran,decided,after,thinking,about,it,a,moment,or,two

that,night,at,the,great,castle,the,storm,lord,and,the,knight,of,skulls,and,kisses,each,swore,they,would,unmask,him,and,the,king,himself,urged,men,to,challenge,him,declaring,that,the,face,behind,that,helm,was,no,friend,of,his
but,the,next,morning,when,the,heralds,blew,their,trumpets,and,the,king,took,his,seat,only,two,champions,appeared
the,knight,of,the,laughing,tree,had,vanished
the,king,was,wroth,and,even,sent,his,son,the,dragon,prince,to,seek,the,man,but,all,they,ever,found,was,his,painted,shield,hanging,abandoned,in,a,tree
it,was,the,dragon,prince,who,won,that,tourney,in,the,end
oh
bran,thought,about,the,tale,awhile
that,was,a,good,story
but,it,should,have,been,the,three,bad,knights,who,hurt,him,not,their,squires
then,the,little,crannogman,could,have,killed,them,all
the,part,about,the,ransoms,was,stupid
and,the,mystery,knight,should,win,the,tourney,defeating,every,challenger,and,name,the,wolf,maid,the,queen,of,love,and,beauty
she,was,said,meera,but,that’s,a,sadder,story
are,you,certain,you,never,heard,this,tale,before,bran
asked,jojen
your,lord,father,never,told,it,to,you
bran,shook,his,head
the,day,was,growing,old,by,then,and,long,shadows,were,creeping,down,the,mountainsides,to,send,black,fingers,through,the,pines
if,the,little,crannogman,could,visit,the,isle,of,faces,maybe,i,could,too
all,the,tales,agreed,that,the,green,men,had,strange,magic,powers
maybe,they,could,help,him,walk,again,even,turn,him,into,a,knight
they,turned,the,little,crannogman,into,a,knight,even,if,it,was,only,for,a,day,he,thought
a,day,would,be,enough
davos,the,cell,was,warmer,than,any,cell,had,a,right,to,be
it,was,dark,yes
flickering,orange,light,fell,through,the,ancient,iron,bars,from,the,torch,in,the,sconce,on,the,wall,outside,but,the,back,half,of,the,cell,remained,drenched,in,gloom
it,was,dank,as,well,as,might,be,expected,on,an,isle,such,as,dragonstone,where,the,sea,was,never,far
and,there,were,rats,as,many,as,any,dungeon,could,expect,to,have,and,a,few,more,besides
but,davos,could,not,complain,of,chill
the,smooth,stony,passages,beneath,the,great,mass,of,dragonstone,were,always,warm,and,davos,had,often,heard,it,said,they,grew,warmer,the,farther,down,one,went
he,was,well,below,the,castle,he,judged,and,the,wall,of,his,cell,often,felt,warm,to,his,touch,when,he,pressed,a,palm,against,it
perhaps,the,old,tales,were,true,and,dragonstone,was,built,with,the,stones,of,hell
he,was,sick,when,they,first,brought,him,here
the,cough,that,had,plagued,him,since,the,battle,grew,worse,and,a,fever,took,hold,of,him,as,well
his,lips,broke,with,blood,blisters,and,the,warmth,of,the,cell,did,not,stop,his,shivering
i,will,not,linger,long,he,remembered,thinking
i,will,die,soon,here,in,the,dark
davos,soon,found,that,he,was,wrong,about,that,as,about,so,much,else
dimly,he,remembered,gentle,hands,and,a,firm,voice,and,young,maester,pylos,looking,down,on,him
he,was,given,hot,garlic,broth,to,drink,and,milk,of,the,poppy,to,take,away,his,aches,and,shivers
the,poppy,made,him,sleep,and,while,he,slept,they,leeched,him,to,drain,off,the,bad,blood
or,so,he,surmised,by,the,leech,marks,on,his,arms,when,he,woke
before,very,long,the,coughing,stopped,the,blisters,vanished,and,his,broth,had,chunks,of,whitefish,in,it,and,carrots,and,onions,as,well
and,one,day,he,realized,that,he,felt,stronger,than,he,had,since,black,betha,shattered,beneath,him,and,flung,him,in,the,river
he,had,two,gaolers,to,tend,him
one,was,broad,and,squat,with,thick,shoulders,and,huge,strong,hands
he,wore,a,leather,brigantine,dotted,with,iron,studs,and,once,a,day,brought,davos,a,bowl,of,oaten,porridge
sometimes,he,sweetened,it,with,honey,or,poured,in,a,bit,of,milk
the,other,gaoler,was,older,stooped,and,sallow,with,greasy,unwashed,hair,and,pebbled,skin
he,wore,a,doublet,of,white,velvet,with,a,ring,of,stars,worked,upon,the,breast,in,golden,thread
it,fit,him,badly,being,both,too,short,and,too,loose,and,was,soiled,and,torn,besides
he,would,bring,davos,plates,of,meat,and,mash,or,fish,stew,and,once,even,half,a,lamprey,pie
the,lamprey,was,so,rich,he,could,not,keep,it,down,but,even,so,it,was,a,rare,treat,for,a,prisoner,in,a,dungeon
neither,sun,nor,moon,shone,in,the,dungeons,no,windows,pierced,the,thick,stone,walls
the,only,way,to,tell,day,from,night,was,by,his,gaolers
neither,man,would,speak,to,him,though,he,knew,they,were,no,mutes,sometimes,he,heard,them,exchange,a,few,brusque,words,as,the,watch,was,changing
they,would,not,even,tell,him,their,names,so,he,gave,them,names,of,his,own
the,short,strong,one,he,called,porridge,the,stooped,sallow,one,lamprey,for,the,pie
he,marked,the,passage,of,days,by,the,meals,they,brought,and,by,the,changing,of,the,torches,in,the,sconce,outside,his,cell
a,man,grows,lonely,in,the,dark,and,hungers,for,the,sound,of,a,human,voice
davos,would,talk,to,the,gaolers,whenever,they,came,to,his,cell,whether,to,bring,him,food,or,change,his,slops,pail
he,knew,they,would,be,deaf,to,pleas,for,freedom,or,mercy,instead,he,asked,them,questions,hoping,perhaps,one,day,one,might,answer
what,news,of,the,war
he,asked,and,is,the,king,well
he,asked,after,his,son,devan,and,the,princess,shireen,and,salladhor,saan
what,is,the,weather,like
he,asked,and,have,the,autumn,storms,begun,yet
do,ships,still,sail,the,narrow,sea
it,made,no,matter,what,he,asked,they,never,answered,though,sometimes,porridge,gave,him,a,look,and,for,half,a,heartbeat,davos,would,think,that,he,was,about,to,speak
with,lamprey,there,was,not,even,that,much
i,am,not,a,man,to,him,davos,thought,only,a,stone,that,eats,and,shits,and,speaks
he,decided,after,a,while,that,he,liked,porridge,much,the,better
porridge,at,least,seemed,to,know,he,was,alive,and,there,was,a,queer,sort,of,kindness,to,the,man
davos,suspected,that,he,fed,the,rats,that,was,why,there,were,so,many
once,he,thought,he,heard,the,gaoler,talking,to,them,as,if,they,were,children,but,perhaps,he’d,only,dreamed,that
they,do,not,mean,to,let,me,die,he,realized
they,are,keeping,me,alive,for,some,purpose,of,their,own
he,did,not,like,to,think,what,that,might,be
lord,sunglass,had,been,confined,in,the,cells,beneath,dragonstone,for,a,time,as,had,ser,hubard,rambton’s,sons,all,of,them,had,ended,on,the,pyre
i,should,have,given,myself,to,the,sea,davos,thought,as,he,sat,staring,at,the,torch,beyond,the,bars
or,let,the,sail,pass,me,by,to,perish,on,my,rock
i,would,sooner,feed,crabs,than,flames
then,one,night,as,he,was,finishing,his,supper,davos,felt,a,queer,flush,come,over,him
he,glanced,up,through,the,bars,and,there,she,stood,in,shimmering,scarlet,with,her,great,ruby,at,her,throat,her,red,eyes,gleaming,as,bright,as,the,torch,that,bathed,her
melisandre,he,said,with,a,calm,he,did,not,feel
onion,knight,she,replied,just,as,calmly,as,if,the,two,of,them,had,met,on,a,stair,or,in,the,yard,and,were,exchanging,polite,greetings
are,you,well
better,than,i,was
do,you,lack,for,anything
my,king
my,son
i,lack,for,them
he,pushed,the,bowl,aside,and,stood
have,you,come,to,burn,me
her,strange,red,eyes,studied,him,through,the,bars
this,is,a,bad,place,is,it,not
a,dark,place,and,foul
the,good,sun,does,not,shine,here,nor,the,bright,moon
she,lifted,a,hand,toward,the,torch,in,the,wall,sconce
this,is,all,that,stands,between,you,and,the,darkness,onion,knight
this,little,fire,this,gift,of,r’hllor
shall,i,put,it,out
no
he,moved,toward,the,bars
please
he,did,not,think,he,could,bear,that,to,be,left,alone,in,utter,blackness,with,no,one,but,the,rats,for,company
the,red,woman’s,lips,curved,upward,in,a,smile
so,you,have,come,to,love,the,fire,it,would,seem
i,need,the,torch
his,hands,opened,and,closed
i,will,not,beg,her
i,will,not
i,am,like,this,torch,ser,davos
we,are,both,instruments,of,r’hllor
we,were,made,for,a,single,purpose,to,keep,the,darkness,at,bay
do,you,believe,that
no
perhaps,he,should,have,lied,and,told,her,what,she,wanted,to,hear,but,davos,was,too,accustomed,to,speaking,truth
you,are,the,mother,of,darkness
i,saw,that,under,storm’s,end,when,you,gave,birth,before,my,eyes
is,the,brave,ser,onions,so,frightened,of,a,passing,shadow
take,heart,then
shadows,only,live,when,given,birth,by,light,and,the,king’s,fires,burn,so,low,i,dare,not,draw,off,any,more,to,make,another,son
it,might,well,kill,him
melisandre,moved,closer
with,another,man,though
a,man,whose,flames,still,burn,hot,and,high
if,you,truly,wish,to,serve,your,king’s,cause,come,to,my,chamber,one,night
i,could,give,you,pleasure,such,as,you,have,never,known,and,with,your,life-fire,i,could,make

a,horror
davos,retreated,from,her
i,want,no,part,of,you,my,lady
or,your,god
may,the,seven,protect,me
melisandre,sighed
they,did,not,protect,guncer,sunglass
he,prayed,thrice,each,day,and,bore,seven,seven-pointed,stars,upon,his,shield,but,when,r’hllor,reached,out,his,hand,his,prayers,turned,to,screams,and,he,burned
why,cling,to,these,false,gods
i,have,worshiped,them,all,my,life
all,your,life,davos,seaworth
as,well,say,it,was,so,yesterday
she,shook,her,head,sadly
you,have,never,feared,to,speak,the,truth,to,kings,why,do,you,lie,to,yourself
open,your,eyes,ser,knight
what,is,it,you,would,have,me,see
the,way,the,world,is,made
the,truth,is,all,around,you,plain,to,behold
the,night,is,dark,and,full,of,terrors,the,day,bright,and,beautiful,and,full,of,hope
one,is,black,the,other,white
there,is,ice,and,there,is,fire
hate,and,love
bitter,and,sweet
male,and,female
pain,and,pleasure
winter,and,summer
evil,and,good
she,took,a,step,toward,him
death,and,life
everywhere,opposites
everywhere,the,war
the,war
asked,davos
the,war,she,affirmed
there,are,two,onion,knight
not,seven,not,one,not,a,hundred,or,a,thousand
two
do,you,think,i,crossed,half,the,world,to,put,yet,another,vain,king,on,yet,another,empty,throne
the,war,has,been,waged,since,time,began,and,before,it,is,done,all,men,must,choose,where,they,will,stand
on,one,side,is,r’hllor,the,lord,of,light,the,heart,of,fire,the,god,of,flame,and,shadow
against,him,stands,the,great,other,whose,name,may,not,be,spoken,the,lord,of,darkness,the,soul,of,ice,the,god,of,night,and,terror
ours,is,not,a,choice,between,baratheon,and,lannister,between,greyjoy,and,stark
it,is,death,we,choose,or,life
darkness,or,light
she,clasped,the,bars,of,his,cell,with,her,slender,white,hands
the,great,ruby,at,her,throat,seemed,to,pulse,with,its,own,radiance
so,tell,me,ser,davos,seaworth,and,tell,me,truly,does,your,heart,burn,with,the,shining,light,of,r’hllor
or,is,it,black,and,cold,and,full,of,worms
she,reached,through,the,bars,and,laid,three,fingers,upon,his,breast,as,if,to,feel,the,truth,of,him,through,flesh,and,wool,and,leather
my,heart,davos,said,slowly,is,full,of,doubts
melisandre,sighed
ahhhh,davos
the,good,knight,is,honest,to,the,last,even,in,his,day,of,darkness
it,is,well,you,did,not,lie,to,me
i,would,have,known
the,other’s,servants,oft,hide,black,hearts,in,gaudy,light,so,r’hllor,gives,his,priests,the,power,to,see,through,falsehoods
she,stepped,lightly,away,from,the,cell
why,did,you,mean,to,kill,me
i,will,tell,you,said,davos,if,you,will,tell,me,who,betrayed,me
it,could,only,have,been,salladhor,saan,and,yet,even,now,he,prayed,it,was,not,so
the,red,woman,laughed
no,one,betrayed,you,onion,knight
i,saw,your,purpose,in,my,flames
the,flames
if,you,can,see,the,future,in,these,flames,how,is,it,that,we,burned,upon,the,blackwater
you,gave,my,sons,to,the,fire
my,sons,my,ship,my,men,all,burning
melisandre,shook,her,head
you,wrong,me,onion,knight
those,were,no,fires,of,mine
had,i,been,with,you,your,battle,would,have,had,a,different,ending
but,his,grace,was,surrounded,by,unbelievers,and,his,pride,proved,stronger,than,his,faith
his,punishment,was,grievous,but,he,has,learned,from,his,mistake
were,my,sons,no,more,than,a,lesson,for,a,king,then
davos,felt,his,mouth,tighten
it,is,night,in,your,seven,kingdoms,now,the,red,woman,went,on,but,soon,the,sun,will,rise,again
the,war,continues,davos,seaworth,and,some,will,soon,learn,that,even,an,ember,in,the,ashes,can,still,ignite,a,great,blaze
the,old,maester,looked,at,stannis,and,saw,only,a,man
you,see,a,king
you,are,both,wrong
he,is,the,lord’s,chosen,the,warrior,of,fire
i,have,seen,him,leading,the,fight,against,the,dark,i,have,seen,it,in,the,flames
the,flames,do,not,lie,else,you,would,not,be,here
it,is,written,in,prophecy,as,well
when,the,red,star,bleeds,and,the,darkness,gathers,azor,ahai,shall,be,born,again,amidst,smoke,and,salt,to,wake,dragons,out,of,stone
the,bleeding,star,has,come,and,gone,and,dragonstone,is,the,place,of,smoke,and,salt
stannis,baratheon,is,azor,ahai,reborn
her,red,eyes,blazed,like,twin,fires,and,seemed,to,stare,deep,into,his,soul
you,do,not,believe,me
you,doubt,the,truth,of,r’hllor,even,now
yet,have,served,him,all,the,same,and,will,serve,him,again
i,shall,leave,you,here,to,think,on,all,that,i,have,told,you
and,because,r’hllor,is,the,source,of,all,good,i,shall,leave,the,torch,as,well
with,a,smile,and,swirl,of,scarlet,skirts,she,was,gone
only,her,scent,lingered,after
that,and,the,torch
davos,lowered,himself,to,the,floor,of,the,cell,and,wrapped,his,arms,about,his,knees
the,shifting,torchlight,washed,over,him
once,melisandre’s,footsteps,faded,away,the,only,sound,was,the,scrabbling,of,rats
ice,and,fire,he,thought
black,and,white
dark,and,light
davos,could,not,deny,the,power,of,her,god
he,had,seen,the,shadow,crawling,from,melisandre’s,womb,and,the,priestess,knew,things,she,had,no,way,of,knowing
she,saw,my,purpose,in,her,flames
it,was,good,to,learn,that,salla,had,not,sold,him,but,the,thought,of,the,red,woman,spying,out,his,secrets,with,her,fires,disquieted,him,more,than,he,could,say
and,what,did,she,mean,when,she,said,that,i,had,served,her,god,and,would,serve,him,again
he,did,not,like,that,either
he,lifted,his,eyes,to,stare,up,at,the,torch
he,looked,for,a,long,time,never,blinking,watching,the,flames,shift,and,shimmer
he,tried,to,see,beyond,them,to,peer,through,the,fiery,curtain,and,glimpse,whatever,lived,back,there
but,there,was,nothing,only,fire,and,after,a,time,his,eyes,began,to,water
god-blind,and,tired,davos,curled,up,on,the,straw,and,gave,himself,to,sleep
three,days,later,well,porridge,had,come,thrice,and,lamprey,twice,davos,heard,voices,outside,his,cell
he,sat,up,at,once,his,back,to,the,stone,wall,listening,to,the,sounds,of,struggle
this,was,new,a,change,in,his,unchanging,world
the,noise,was,coming,from,the,left,where,the,steps,led,up,to,daylight
he,could,hear,a,man’s,voice,pleading,and,shouting

madness
the,man,was,saying,as,he,came,into,view,dragged,along,between,two,guardsmen,with,fiery,hearts,on,their,breasts
porridge,went,before,them,jangling,a,ring,of,keys,and,ser,axell,florent,walked,behind
axell,the,prisoner,said,desperately,for,the,love,you,bear,me,unhand,me
you,cannot,do,this,i’m,no,traitor
he,was,an,older,man,tall,and,slender,with,silvery,grey,hair,a,pointed,beard,and,a,long,elegant,face,twisted,in,fear
where,is,selyse,where,is,the,queen
i,demand,to,see,her
the,others,take,you,all
release,me
the,guards,paid,no,mind,to,his,outcries
here
porridge,asked,in,front,of,the,cell
davos,got,to,his,feet
for,an,instant,he,considered,trying,to,rush,them,when,the,door,was,opened,but,that,was,madness
there,were,too,many,the,guards,wore,swords,and,porridge,was,strong,as,a,bull
ser,axell,gave,the,gaoler,a,curt,nod
let,the,traitors,enjoy,each,other’s,company
i,am,no,traitor
screeched,the,prisoner,as,porridge,was,unlocking,the,door
though,he,was,plainly,dressed,in,grey,wool,doublet,and,black,breeches,his,speech,marked,him,as,highborn
his,birth,will,not,serve,him,here,thought,davos
porridge,swung,the,bars,wide,ser,axell,gave,a,nod,and,the,guards,flung,their,charge,in,headlong
the,man,stumbled,and,might,have,fallen,but,davos,caught,him
at,once,he,wrenched,away,and,staggered,back,toward,the,door,only,to,have,it,slammed,in,his,pale,pampered,face
no,he,shouted
nooooo
all,the,strength,suddenly,left,his,legs,and,he,slid,slowly,to,the,floor,clutching,at,the,iron,bars
ser,axell,porridge,and,the,guards,had,already,turned,to,leave
you,cannot,do,this,the,prisoner,shouted,at,their,retreating,backs

a,man,of,reason,and,my,terms
the,terms,were,fair

that,lord,stannis,give,up,his,claim,to,the,iron,throne,and,retract,all,he,said,of,joffrey’s,bastardy,on,the,condition,that,he,be,accepted,back,into,the,king’s,peace,and,confirmed,as,lord,of,dragonstone,and,storm’s,end
i,vowed,to,do,the,same,for,the,return,of,brightwater,keep,and,all,our,lands
i,thought
lord,tywin,would,see,the,sense,in,my,proposal
he,still,has,the,starks,to,deal,with,and,the,ironmen,as,well
i,offered,to,seal,the,bargain,by,wedding,shireen,to,joffrey’s,brother,tommen
he,shook,his,head
the,terms
they,are,as,good,as,we,are,ever,like,to,get
even,you,can,see,that,surely
yes,said,davos,even,me
unless,stannis,should,father,a,son,such,a,marriage,would,mean,that,dragonstone,and,storm’s,end,would,one,day,pass,to,tommen,which,would,doubtless,please,lord,tywin
meanwhile,the,lannisters,would,have,shireen,as,hostage,to,make,certain,stannis,raised,no,new,rebellions
and,what,did,his,grace,say,when,you,proposed,these,terms,to,him

no,more,than,he,can,unsay,his,words,against,joffrey,when,he,believes,them,true
as,for,the,marriage,tommen,was,born,of,the,same,incest,as,joffrey,and,his,grace,would,sooner,see,shireen,dead,than,wed,to,such

no
but,i,am,the,king’s,man,and,i,will,make,no,peace,without,his,leave
lord,alester,stared,at,him,helplessly,for,a,long,moment,and,then,began,to,weep
jon,the,last,night,fell,black,and,moonless,but,for,once,the,sky,was,clear
i,am,going,up,the,hill,to,look,for,ghost,he,told,the,thenns,at,the,cave,mouth,and,they,grunted,and,let,him,pass
so,many,stars,he,thought,as,he,trudged,up,the,slope,through,pines,and,firs,and,ash
maester,luwin,had,taught,him,his,stars,as,a,boy,in,winterfell,he,had,learned,the,names,of,the,twelve,houses,of,heaven,and,the,rulers,of,each,he,could,find,the,seven,wanderers,sacred,to,the,faith,he,was,old,friends,with,the,ice,dragon,the,shadowcat,the,moonmaid,and,the,sword,of,the,morning
all,those,he,shared,with,ygritte,but,not,some,of,the,others
we,look,up,at,the,same,stars,and,see,such,different,things
the,king’s,crown,was,the,cradle,to,hear,her,tell,it,the,stallion,was,the,horned,lord,the,red,wanderer,that,septons,preached,was,sacred,to,their,smith,up,here,was,called,the,thief
and,when,the,thief,was,in,the,moonmaid,that,was,a,propitious,time,for,a,man,to,steal,a,woman,ygritte,insisted
like,the,night,you,stole,me
the,thief,was,bright,that,night
i,never,meant,to,steal,you,he,said
i,never,knew,you,were,a,girl,until,my,knife,was,at,your,throat
if,you,kill,a,man,and,never,mean,t’,he’s,just,as,dead,ygritte,said,stubbornly
jon,had,never,met,anyone,so,stubborn,except,maybe,for,his,little,sister,arya
is,she,still,my,sister
he,wondered
was,she,ever
he,had,never,truly,been,a,stark,only,lord,eddard’s,motherless,bastard,with,no,more,place,at,winterfell,than,theon,greyjoy
and,even,that,he’d,lost
when,a,man,of,the,night’s,watch,said,his,words,he,put,aside,his,old,family,and,joined,a,new,one,but,jon,snow,had,lost,those,brothers,too
he,found,ghost,atop,the,hill,as,he,thought,he,might
the,white,wolf,never,howled,yet,something,drew,him,to,the,heights,all,the,same,and,he,would,squat,there,on,his,hindquarters,hot,breath,rising,in,a,white,mist,as,his,red,eyes,drank,the,stars
do,you,have,names,for,them,as,well
jon,asked,as,he,went,to,one,knee,beside,the,direwolf,and,scratched,the,thick,white,fur,on,his,neck,the,hare
the,doe
the,she-wolf
ghost,licked,his,face,his,rough,wet,tongue,rasping,against,the,scabs,where,the,eagle’s,talons,had,ripped,jon’s,cheek
the,bird,marked,both,of,us,he,thought
ghost,he,said,quietly,on,the,morrow,we,go,over
there’s,no,steps,here,no,cage-and-crane,no,way,for,me,to,get,you,to,the,other,side
we,have,to,part
do,you,understand
in,the,dark,the,direwolf’s,red,eyes,looked,black
he,nuzzled,at,jon’s,neck,silent,as,ever,his,breath,a,hot,mist
the,wildlings,called,jon,snow,a,warg,but,if,so,he,was,a,poor,one
he,did,not,know,how,to,put,on,a,wolf,skin,the,way,orell,had,with,his,eagle,before,he’d,died
once,jon,had,dreamed,that,he,was,ghost,looking,down,upon,the,valley,of,the,milkwater,where,mance,rayder,had,gathered,his,people,and,that,dream,had,turned,out,to,be,true
but,he,was,not,dreaming,now,and,that,left,him,only,words
you,cannot,come,with,me,jon,said,cupping,the,wolf’s,head,in,his,hands,and,looking,deep,into,those,eyes
you,have,to,go,to,castle,black
do,you,understand
castle,black
can,you,find,it
the,way,home
just,follow,the,ice,east,and,east,into,the,sun,and,you’ll,find,it
they,will,know,you,at,castle,black,and,maybe,your,coming,will,warn,them
he,had,thought,of,writing,out,a,warning,for,ghost,to,carry,but,he,had,no,ink,no,parchment,not,even,a,writing,quill,and,the,risk,of,discovery,was,too,great
i,will,meet,you,again,at,castle,black,but,you,have,to,get,there,by,yourself
we,must,each,hunt,alone,for,a,time
alone
the,direwolf,twisted,free,of,jon’s,grasp,his,ears,pricked,up
and,suddenly,he,was,bounding,away
he,loped,through,a,tangle,of,brush,leapt,a,deadfall,and,raced,down,the,hillside,a,pale,streak,among,the,trees
off,to,castle,black
jon,wondered
or,off,after,a,hare
he,wished,he,knew
he,feared,he,might,prove,just,as,poor,a,warg,as,a,sworn,brother,and,a,spy
a,wind,sighed,through,the,trees,rich,with,the,smell,of,pine,needles,tugging,at,his,faded,blacks
jon,could,see,the,wall,looming,high,and,dark,to,the,south,a,great,shadow,blocking,out,the,stars
the,rough,hilly,ground,made,him,think,they,must,be,somewhere,between,the,shadow,tower,and,castle,black,and,likely,closer,to,the,former
for,days,they,had,been,wending,their,way,south,between,deep,lakes,that,stretched,like,long,thin,fingers,along,the,floors,of,narrow,valleys,while,flint,ridges,and,pine-clad,hills,jostled,against,one,another,to,either,side
such,ground,made,for,slow,riding,but,offered,easy,concealment,for,those,wishing,to,approach,the,wall,unseen
for,wildling,raiders,he,thought
like,us
like,me
beyond,that,wall,lay,the,seven,kingdoms,and,everything,he,had,sworn,to,protect
he,had,said,the,words,had,pledged,his,life,and,honor,and,by,rights,he,should,be,up,there,standing,sentry
he,should,be,raising,a,horn,to,his,lips,to,rouse,the,night’s,watch,to,arms
he,had,no,horn,though
it,would,not,be,hard,to,steal,one,from,the,wildlings,he,suspected,but,what,would,that,accomplish
even,if,he,blew,it,there,was,no,one,to,hear
the,wall,was,a,hundred,leagues,long,and,the,watch,sadly,dwindled
all,but,three,of,the,strongholds,had,been,abandoned,there,might,not,be,a,brother,within,forty,miles,of,here,but,for,jon
if,he,was,a,brother,still
i,should,have,tried,to,kill,mance,rayder,on,the,fist,even,if,it,meant,my,life
that,was,what,qhorin,halfhand,would,have,done
but,jon,had,hesitated,and,the,chance,passed
the,next,day,he,had,ridden,off,with,styr,the,magnar,jarl,and,more,than,a,hundred,picked,thenns,and,raiders
he,told,himself,that,he,was,only,biding,his,time,that,when,the,moment,came,he,would,slip,away,and,ride,for,castle,black
the,moment,never,came
they,rested,most,nights,in,empty,wildling,villages,and,styr,always,set,a,dozen,of,his,thenns,to,guard,the,horses
jarl,watched,him,suspiciously
and,ygritte,was,never,far,day,or,night
two,hearts,that,beat,as,one
mance,rayder’s,mocking,words,rang,bitter,in,his,head
jon,had,seldom,felt,so,confused
i,have,no,choice,he’d,told,himself,the,first,time,when,she,slipped,beneath,his,sleeping,skins
if,i,refuse,her,she,will,know,me,for,a,turncloak
i,am,playing,the,part,the,halfhand,told,me,to,play
his,body,had,played,the,part,eagerly,enough
his,lips,on,hers,his,hand,sliding,under,her,doeskin,shirt,to,find,a,breast,his,manhood,stiffening,when,she,rubbed,her,mound,against,it,through,their,clothes
my,vows,he’d,thought,remembering,the,weirwood,grove,where,he,had,said,them,the,nine,great,white,trees,in,a,circle,the,carved,red,faces,watching,listening
but,her,fingers,were,undoing,his,laces,and,her,tongue,was,in,his,mouth,and,her,hand,slipped,inside,his,smallclothes,and,brought,him,out,and,he,could,not,see,the,weirwoods,anymore,only,her
she,bit,his,neck,and,he,nuzzled,hers,burying,his,nose,in,her,thick,red,hair
lucky,he,thought,she,is,lucky,fire-kissed
isn’t,that,good
she,whispered,as,she,guided,him,inside,her
she,was,sopping,wet,down,there,and,no,maiden,that,was,plain,but,jon,did,not,care
his,vows,her,maidenhood,none,of,it,mattered,only,the,heat,of,her,the,mouth,on,his,the,finger,that,pinched,at,his,nipple
isn’t,that,sweet
she,said,again
not,so,fast,oh,slow,yes,like,that
there,now,there,now,yes,sweet,sweet
you,know,nothing,jon,snow,but,i,can,show,you
harder,now
yessss
a,part,he,tried,to,remind,himself,afterward
i,am,playing,a,part
i,had,to,do,it,once,to,prove,i’d,abandoned,my,vows
i,had,to,make,her,trust,me
it,need,never,happen,again
he,was,still,a,man,of,the,night’s,watch,and,a,son,of,eddard,stark
he,had,done,what,needed,to,be,done,proved,what,needed,to,be,proven
the,proving,had,been,so,sweet,though,and,ygritte,had,gone,to,sleep,beside,him,with,her,head,against,his,chest,and,that,was,sweet,as,well,dangerously,sweet
he,thought,of,the,weirwoods,again,and,the,words,he’d,said,before,them
it,was,only,once,and,it,had,to,be
even,my,father,stumbled,once,when,he,forgot,his,marriage,vows,and,sired,a,bastard
jon,vowed,to,himself,that,it,would,be,the,same,with,him
it,will,never,happen,again
it,happened,twice,more,that,night,and,again,in,the,morning,when,she,woke,to,find,him,hard
the,wildlings,were,stirring,by,then,and,several,could,not,help,but,notice,what,was,going,on,beneath,the,pile,of,furs
jarl,told,them,to,be,quick,about,it,before,he,had,to,throw,a,pail,of,water,over,them
like,a,pair,of,rutting,dogs,jon,thought,afterward
was,that,what,he’d,become
i,am,a,man,of,the,night’s,watch,a,small,voice,inside,insisted,but,every,night,it,seemed,a,little,fainter,and,when,ygritte,kissed,his,ears,or,bit,his,neck,he,could,not,hear,it,at,all
was,this,how,it,was,for,my,father
he,wondered
was,he,as,weak,as,i,am,when,he,dishonored,himself,in,my,mother’s,bed
something,was,coming,up,the,hill,behind,him,he,realized,suddenly
for,half,a,heartbeat,he,thought,it,might,be,ghost,come,back,but,the,direwolf,never,made,so,much,noise
jon,drew,longclaw,in,a,single,smooth,motion,but,it,was,only,one,of,the,thenns,a,broad,man,in,a,bronze,helm
snow,the,intruder,said
come
magnar,wants
the,men,of,thenn,spoke,the,old,tongue,and,most,had,only,a,few,words,of,the,common
jon,did,not,much,care,what,the,magnar,wanted,but,there,was,no,use,arguing,with,someone,who,could,scarcely,understand,him,so,he,followed,the,man,back,down,the,hill
the,mouth,of,the,cave,was,a,cleft,in,the,rock,barely,wide,enough,for,a,horse,half,concealed,behind,a,soldier,pine
it,opened,to,the,north,so,the,glows,of,the,fires,within,would,not,be,visible,from,the,wall
even,if,by,some,mischance,a,patrol,should,happen,to,pass,atop,the,wall,tonight,they,would,see,nothing,but,hills,and,pines,and,the,icy,sheen,of,starlight,on,a,half-frozen,lake
mance,rayder,had,planned,his,thrust,well
within,the,rock,the,passage,descended,twenty,feet,before,it,opened,out,onto,a,space,as,large,as,winterfell’s,great,hall
cookfires,burned,amongst,the,columns,their,smoke,rising,to,blacken,the,stony,ceiling
the,horses,had,been,hobbled,along,one,wall,beside,a,shallow,pool
a,sinkhole,in,the,center,of,the,floor,opened,on,what,might,have,been,an,even,greater,cavern,below,though,the,darkness,made,it,hard,to,tell
jon,could,hear,the,soft,rushing,sound,of,an,underground,stream,somewhere,below,as,well
jarl,was,with,the,magnar,mance,had,given,them,the,joint,command
styr,was,none,too,pleased,by,that,jon,had,noted,early,on
mance,rayder,had,called,the,dark,youth,a,pet,of,val,who,was,sister,to,dalla,his,own,queen,which,made,jarl,a,sort,of,good,brother,once,removed,to,the,king-beyond-the-wall
the,magnar,plainly,resented,sharing,his,authority
he,had,brought,a,hundred,thenns,five,times,as,many,men,as,jarl,and,often,acted,as,if,he,had,the,sole,command
but,it,would,be,the,younger,man,who,got,them,over,the,ice,jon,knew
though,he,could,not,have,been,older,than,twenty,jarl,had,been,raiding,for,eight,years,and,had,gone,over,the,wall,a,dozen,times,with,the,likes,of,alfyn,crowkiller,and,the,weeper,and,more,recently,with,his,own,band
the,magnar,was,direct
jarl,has,warned,me,of,crows,patrolling,on,high
tell,me,all,you,know,of,these,patrols
tell,me,jon,noted,not,tell,us,though,jarl,stood,right,beside,him
he,would,have,liked,nothing,better,than,to,refuse,the,brusque,demand,but,he,knew,styr,would,put,him,to,death,at,the,slightest,disloyalty,and,ygritte,as,well,for,the,crime,of,being,his
there,are,four,men,in,each,patrol,two,rangers,and,two,builders,he,said
the,builders,are,supposed,to,make,note,of,cracks,melting,and,other,structural,problems,while,the,rangers,look,for,signs,of,foes
they,ride,mules
mules
the,earless,man,frowned
mules,are,slow
slow,but,more,surefooted,on,the,ice
the,patrols,often,ride,atop,the,wall,and,aside,from,castle,black,the,paths,up,there,have,not,been,graveled,for,long,years
the,mules,are,bred,at,eastwatch,and,specially,trained,to,their,duty
they,often,ride,atop,the,wall
not,always
no
one,patrol,in,four,follows,the,base,instead,to,search,for,cracks,in,the,foundation,ice,or,signs,of,tunneling
the,magnar,nodded
even,in,far,thenn,we,know,the,tale,of,arson,iceaxe,and,his,tunnel
jon,knew,the,tale,as,well
arson,iceaxe,had,been,halfway,through,the,wall,when,his,tunnel,was,found,by,rangers,from,the,nightfort
they,did,not,trouble,to,disturb,him,at,his,digging,only,sealed,the,way,behind,with,ice,and,stone,and,snow
dolorous,edd,used,to,say,that,if,you,pressed,your,ear,flat,to,the,wall,you,could,still,hear,arson,chipping,away,with,his,axe
when,do,these,patrols,go,out
how,often
jon,shrugged
it,changes
i’ve,heard,that,lord,commander,qorgyle,used,to,send,them,out,every,third,day,from,castle,black,to,eastwatch-by-the-sea,and,every,second,day,from,castle,black,to,the,shadow,tower
the,watch,had,more,men,in,his,day,though
lord,commander,mormont,prefers,to,vary,the,number,of,patrols,and,the,days,of,their,departure,to,make,it,more,difficult,for,anyone,to,know,their,comings,and,goings
and,sometimes,the,old,bear,will,even,send,a,larger,force,to,one,of,the,abandoned,castles,for,a,fortnight,or,a,moon’s,turn
his,uncle,had,originated,that,tactic,jon,knew
anything,to,make,the,enemy,unsure

so,we’re,between,those,two,are,we
jon,kept,his,face,carefully,blank

i,can’t,speak,to,what,bowen,marsh,or,ser,denys,might,have,done,since
how,many,crows,remain,within,the,castles
asked,styr
five,hundred,at,castle,black
two,hundred,at,shadow,tower,perhaps,three,hundred,at,eastwatch
jon,added,three,hundred,men,to,the,count
if,only,it,were,that,easy
jarl,was,not,fooled,however
he’s,lying,he,told,styr
or,else,including,those,they,lost,on,the,fist
crow,the,magnar,warned,do,not,take,me,for,mance,rayder
if,you,lie,to,me,i,will,have,your,tongue
i’m,no,crow,and,won’t,be,called,a,liar
jon,flexed,the,fingers,of,his,sword,hand
the,magnar,of,thenn,studied,jon,with,his,chilly,grey,eyes
we,shall,learn,their,numbers,soon,enough,he,said,after,a,moment
go
i,will,send,for,you,if,i,have,further,questions
jon,bowed,his,head,stiffly,and,went
if,all,the,wildlings,were,like,styr,it,would,be,easier,to,betray,them

and,back,to,drogon
her,mouth,set,grimly
it,was,a,long,dark,windy,night,that,followed
dany,fed,her,dragons,as,she,always,did,but,found,she,had,no,appetite,herself
she,cried,awhile,alone,in,her,cabin,then,dried,her,tears,long,enough,for,yet,another,argument,with,groleo

i,need,the,unsullied,more,than,i,need,these,ships,and,i,will,hear,no,more,about,it
the,anger,burned,the,grief,and,fear,from,her,for,a,few,hours,at,the,least
afterward,she,called,her,bloodriders,to,her,cabin,with,ser,jorah
they,were,the,only,ones,she,truly,trusted
she,meant,to,sleep,afterward,to,be,well,rested,for,the,morrow,but,an,hour,of,restless,tossing,in,the,stuffy,confines,of,the,cabin,soon,convinced,her,that,was,hopeless
outside,her,door,she,found,aggo,fitting,a,new,string,to,his,bow,by,the,light,of,a,swinging,oil,lamp
rakharo,sat,crosslegged,on,the,deck,beside,him,sharpening,his,arakh,with,a,whetstone

all,alone,but,for,my,brother
i,was,such,a,small,scared,thing
viserys,should,have,protected,me,but,instead,he,hurt,me,and,scared,me,worse
he,shouldn’t,have,done,that
he,wasn’t,just,my,brother,he,was,my,king
why,do,the,gods,make,kings,and,queens,if,not,to,protect,the,ones,who,can’t,protect,themselves
some,kings,make,themselves
robert,did
he,was,no,true,king,dany,said,scornfully
he,did,no,justice
justice
that’s,what,kings,are,for
ser,jorah,had,no,answer
he,only,smiled,and,touched,her,hair,so,lightly
it,was,enough
that,night,she,dreamt,that,she,was,rhaegar,riding,to,the,trident
but,she,was,mounted,on,a,dragon,not,a,horse
when,she,saw,the,usurper’s,rebel,host,across,the,river,they,were,armored,all,in,ice,but,she,bathed,them,in,dragonfire,and,they,melted,away,like,dew,and,turned,the,trident,into,a,torrent
some,small,part,of,her,knew,that,she,was,dreaming,but,another,part,exulted
this,is,how,it,was,meant,to,be
the,other,was,a,nightmare,and,i,have,only,now,awakened
she,woke,suddenly,in,the,darkness,of,her,cabin,still,flush,with,triumph
balerion,seemed,to,wake,with,her,and,she,heard,the,faint,creak,of,wood,water,lapping,against,the,hull,a,footfall,on,the,deck,above,her,head
and,something,else
someone,was,in,the,cabin,with,her
irri

the,voice,was,very,close
even,dragons,must,sleep
she,is,standing,over,me
who’s,there
dany,peered,into,the,darkness
she,thought,she,could,see,a,shadow,the,faintest,outline,of,a,shape
what,do,you,want,of,me
remember
to,go,north,you,must,journey,south
to,reach,the,west,you,must,go,east
to,go,forward,you,must,go,back,and,to,touch,the,light,you,must,pass,beneath,the,shadow

pale,yellow,lantern,light,flooded,the,cabin,and,irri,and,jhiqui,sat,up,sleepily
khaleesi
murmured,jhiqui,rubbing,her,eyes
viserion,woke,and,opened,his,jaws,and,a,puff,of,flame,brightened,even,the,darkest,corners
there,was,no,sign,of,a,woman,in,a,red,lacquer,mask
khaleesi,are,you,unwell
asked,jhiqui
a,dream
dany,shook,her,head
i,dreamed,a,dream,no,more

all,of,us,go,back,to,sleep
yet,try,as,she,might,sleep,would,not,come,again
if,i,look,back,i,am,lost,dany,told,herself,the,next,morning,as,she,entered,astapor,through,the,harbor,gates
she,dared,not,remind,herself,how,small,and,insignificant,her,following,truly,was,or,she,would,lose,all,courage
today,she,rode,her,silver,clad,in,horsehair,pants,and,painted,leather,vest,a,bronze,medallion,belt,about,her,waist,and,two,more,crossed,between,her,breasts
irri,and,jhiqui,had,braided,her,hair,and,hung,it,with,a,tiny,silver,bell,whose,chime,sang,of,the,undying,of,qarth,burned,in,their,palace,of,dust
the,red,brick,streets,of,astapor,were,almost,crowded,this,morning
slaves,and,servants,lined,the,ways,while,the,slavers,and,their,women,donned,their,tokars,to,look,down,from,their,stepped,pyramids
they,are,not,so,different,from,qartheen,after,all,she,thought
they,want,a,glimpse,of,dragons,to,tell,their,children,of,and,their,children’s,children
it,made,her,wonder,how,many,of,them,would,ever,have,children
aggo,went,before,her,with,his,great,dothraki,bow
strong,belwas,walked,to,the,right,of,her,mare,the,girl,missandei,to,her,left
ser,jorah,mormont,was,behind,in,mail,and,surcoat,glowering,at,anyone,who,came,too,near
rakharo,and,jhogo,protected,the,litter
dany,had,commanded,that,the,top,be,removed,so,her,three,dragons,might,be,chained,to,the,platform
irri,and,jhiqui,rode,with,them,to,try,and,keep,them,calm
yet,viserion’s,tail,lashed,back,and,forth,and,smoke,rose,angry,from,his,nostrils
rhaegal,could,sense,something,wrong,as,well
thrice,he,tried,to,take,wing,only,to,be,pulled,down,by,the,heavy,chain,in,jhiqui’s,hand
drogon,coiled,into,a,ball,wings,and,tail,tucked,tight
only,his,eyes,remained,to,tell,that,he,was,not,asleep
the,rest,of,her,people,followed,groleo,and,the,other,captains,and,their,crews,and,the,eighty-three,dothraki,who,remained,to,her,of,the,hundred,thousand,who,had,once,ridden,in,drogo’s,khalasar
she,put,the,oldest,and,weakest,on,the,inside,of,the,column,with,the,nursing,women,and,those,with,child,and,the,little,girls,and,the,boys,too,young,to,braid,their,hair
the,rest,her,warriors,such,as,they,were,rode,outside,and,moved,their,dismal,herd,along,the,hundred-odd,gaunt,horses,that,had,survived,both,red,waste,and,black,salt,sea
i,ought,to,have,a,banner,sewn,she,thought,as,she,led,her,tattered,band,up,along,astapor’s,meandering,river
she,closed,her,eyes,to,imagine,how,it,would,look,all,flowing,black,silk,and,on,it,the,red,three-headed,dragon,of,targaryen,breathing,golden,flames
a,banner,such,as,rhaegar,might,have,borne
the,river’s,banks,were,strangely,tranquil
the,worm,the,astapori,called,the,stream
it,was,wide,and,slow,and,crooked,dotted,with,tiny,wooded,islands
she,glimpsed,children,playing,on,one,of,them,darting,amongst,elegant,marble,statues
on,another,island,two,lovers,kissed,in,the,shade,of,tall,green,trees,with,no,more,shame,than,dothraki,at,a,wedding
without,clothing,she,could,not,tell,if,they,were,slave,or,free
the,plaza,of,pride,with,its,great,bronze,harpy,was,too,small,to,hold,all,the,unsullied,she,had,bought
instead,they,had,been,assembled,in,the,plaza,of,punishment,fronting,on,astapor’s,main,gate,so,they,might,be,marched,directly,from,the,city,once,daenerys,had,taken,them,in,hand
there,were,no,bronze,statues,here,only,a,wooden,platform,where,rebellious,slaves,were,racked,and,flayed,and,hanged
the,good,masters,place,them,so,they,will,be,the,first,thing,a,new,slave,sees,upon,entering,the,city,missandei,told,her,as,they,came,to,the,plaza
at,first,glimpse,dany,thought,their,skin,was,striped,like,the,zorses,of,the,jogos,nhai
then,she,rode,her,silver,nearer,and,saw,the,raw,red,flesh,beneath,the,crawling,black,stripes
flies
flies,and,maggots
the,rebellious,slaves,had,been,peeled,like,a,man,might,peel,an,apple,in,a,long,curling,strip
one,man,had,an,arm,black,with,flies,from,fingers,to,elbow,and,red,and,white,beneath
dany,reined,in,beneath,him
what,did,this,one,do
he,raised,a,hand,against,his,owner
her,stomach,roiling,dany,wheeled,her,silver,about,and,trotted,toward,the,center,of,the,plaza,and,the,army,she,had,bought,so,dear
rank,on,rank,on,rank,they,stood,her,stone,halfmen,with,their,hearts,of,brick,eight,thousand,and,six,hundred,in,the,spiked,bronze,caps,of,fully,trained,unsullied,and,five,thousand,odd,behind,them,bareheaded,yet,armed,with,spears,and,shortswords
the,ones,farthest,to,the,back,were,only,boys,she,saw,but,they,stood,as,straight,and,still,as,all,the,rest
kraznys,mo,nakloz,and,his,fellows,were,all,there,to,greet,her
other,well-born,astapori,stood,in,knots,behind,them,sipping,wine,from,silver,flutes,as,slaves,circulated,among,them,with,trays,of,olives,and,cherries,and,figs
the,elder,grazdan,sat,in,a,sedan,chair,supported,by,four,huge,copper-skinned,slaves
half,a,dozen,mounted,lancers,rode,along,the,edges,of,the,plaza,keeping,back,the,crowds,who,had,come,to,watch
the,sun,flashed,blinding,bright,off,the,polished,copper,disks,sewn,to,their,cloaks,but,she,could,not,help,but,notice,how,nervous,their,horses,seemed
they,fear,the,dragons
and,well,they,might
kraznys,had,a,slave,help,her,from,her,saddle
his,own,hands,were,full,one,clutched,his,tokar,while,the,other,held,an,omate,whip
here,they,are
he,looked,at,missandei
tell,her,they,are,hers
if,she,can,pay
she,can,the,girl,said
ser,jorah,barked,a,command,and,the,trade,goods,were,brought,forward
six,bales,of,tiger,skins,three,hundred,bolts,of,fine,silk
jars,of,saffron,jars,of,myrrh,jars,of,pepper,and,curry,and,cardamom,an,onyx,mask,twelve,jade,monkeys,casks,of,ink,in,red,and,black,and,green,a,box,of,rare,black,amethysts,a,box,of,pearls,a,cask,of,pitted,olives,stuffed,with,maggots,a,dozen,casks,of,pickled,cave,fish,a,great,brass,gong,and,a,hammer,to,beat,it,with,seventeen,ivory,eyes,and,a,huge,chest,full,of,books,written,in,tongues,that,dany,could,not,read
and,more,and,more,and,more
her,people,stacked,it,all,before,the,slavers
while,the,payment,was,being,made,kraznys,mo,nakloz,favored,her,with,a,few,final,words,on,the,handling,of,her,troops
they,are,green,as,yet,he,said,through,missandei
tell,the,whore,of,westeros,she,would,be,wise,to,blood,them,early
there,are,many,small,cities,between,here,and,there,cities,ripe,for,sacking
whatever,plunder,she,takes,will,be,hers,alone
unsullied,have,no,lust,for,gold,or,gems
and,should,she,take,captives,a,few,guards,will,suffice,to,march,them,back,to,astapor
we’ll,buy,the,healthy,ones,and,for,a,good,price
and,who,knows
in,ten,years,some,of,the,boys,she,sends,us,may,be,unsullied,in,their,turn
thus,all,shall,prosper
finally,there,were,no,more,trade,goods,to,add,to,the,pile
her,dothraki,mounted,their,horses,once,more,and,dany,said,this,was,all,we,could,carry
the,rest,awaits,you,on,the,ships,a,great,quantity,of,amber,and,wine,and,black,rice
and,you,have,the,ships,themselves
so,all,that,remains,is

the,dragon,finished,the,grazdan,with,the,spiked,beard,who,spoke,the,common,tongue,so,thickly
and,here,he,waits
ser,jorah,and,belwas,walked,beside,her,to,the,litter,where,drogon,and,his,brothers,lay,basking,in,the,sun
jhiqui,unfastened,one,end,of,the,chain,and,handed,it,down,to,her
when,she,gave,a,yank,the,black,dragon,raised,his,head,hissing,and,unfolded,wings,of,night,and,scarlet
kraznys,mo,nakloz,smiled,broadly,as,their,shadow,fell,across,him
dany,handed,the,slaver,the,end,of,drogon’s,chain
in,return,he,presented,her,with,the,whip

the,harpy’s,fingers,kraznys,named,the,scourge
dany,turned,the,whip,in,her,hand
such,a,light,thing,to,bear,such,weight
is,it,done,then
do,they,belong,to,me
it,is,done,he,agreed,giving,the,chain,a,sharp,pull,to,bring,drogon,down,from,the,litter
dany,mounted,her,silver
she,could,feel,her,heart,thumping,in,her,chest
she,felt,desperately,afraid
was,this,what,my,brother,would,have,done
she,wondered,if,prince,rhaegar,had,been,this,anxious,when,he,saw,the,usurper’s,host,formed,up,across,the,trident,with,all,their,banners,floating,on,the,wind
she,stood,in,her,stirrups,and,raised,the,harpy’s,fingers,above,her,head,for,all,the,unsullied,to,see
it,is,done
she,cried,at,the,top,of,her,lungs
you,are,mine

she,glimpsed,old,grazdan,turn,his,grey,head,sharply
he,hears,me,speak,valyrian
the,other,slavers,were,not,listening
they,crowded,around,kraznys,and,the,dragon,shouting,advice
though,the,astapori,yanked,and,tugged,drogon,would,not,budge,off,the,litter
smoke,rose,grey,from,his,open,jaws,and,his,long,neck,curled,and,straightened,as,he,snapped,at,the,slaver’s,face
it,is,time,to,cross,the,trident,dany,thought,as,she,wheeled,and,rode,her,silver,back
her,bloodriders,moved,in,close,around,her
you,are,in,difficulty,she,observed
he,will,not,come,kraznys,said
there,is,a,reason
a,dragon,is,no,slave
and,dany,swept,the,lash,down,as,hard,as,she,could,across,the,slaver’s,face
kraznys,screamed,and,staggered,back,the,blood,running,red,down,his,cheeks,into,his,perfumed,beard
the,harpy’s,fingers,had,torn,his,features,half,to,pieces,with,one,slash,but,she,did,not,pause,to,contemplate,the,ruin

sansa,on,the,morning,her,new,gown,was,to,be,ready,the,serving,girls,filled,sansa’s,tub,with,steaming,hot,water,and,scrubbed,her,head,to,toe,until,she,glowed,pink
cersei’s,own,bedmaid,trimmed,her,nails,and,brushed,and,curled,her,auburn,hair,so,it,fell,down,her,back,in,soft,ringlets
she,brought,a,dozen,of,the,queen’s,favorite,scents,as,well
sansa,chose,a,sharp,sweet,fragrance,with,a,hint,of,lemon,in,it,under,the,smell,of,flowers
the,maid,dabbed,some,on,her,finger,and,touched,sansa,behind,each,ear,and,under,her,chin,and,then,lightly,on,her,nipples
cersei,herself,arrived,with,the,seamstress,and,watched,as,they,dressed,sansa,in,her,new,clothes
the,smallclothes,were,all,silk,but,the,gown,itself,was,ivory,samite,and,cloth-of-silver,and,lined,with,silvery,satin
the,points,of,the,long,dagged,sleeves,almost,touched,the,ground,when,she,lowered,her,arms
and,it,was,a,woman’s,gown,not,a,little,girl’s,there,was,no,doubt,of,that
the,bodice,was,slashed,in,front,almost,to,her,belly,the,deep,vee,covered,over,with,a,panel,of,ornate,myrish,lace,in,dove-grey
the,skirts,were,long,and,full,the,waist,so,tight,that,sansa,had,to,hold,her,breath,as,they,laced,her,into,it
they,brought,her,new,shoes,as,well,slippers,of,soft,grey,doeskin,that,hugged,her,feet,like,lovers
you,are,very,beautiful,my,lady,the,seamstress,said,when,she,was,dressed

the,gods,have,been,kind,to,you,sansa
you,are,a,lovely,girl
it,seems,almost,obscene,to,squander,such,sweet,innocence,on,that,gargoyle
what,gargoyle
sansa,did,not,understand
did,she,mean,willas
how,could,she,know
no,one,knew,but,her,and,margaery,and,the,queen,of,thorns
oh,and,dontos,but,he,didn’t,count
cersei,lannister,ignored,the,question
the,cloak,she,commanded,and,the,women,brought,it,out,a,long,cloak,of,white,velvet,heavy,with,pearls
a,flerce,direwolf,was,embroidered,upon,it,in,silver,thread
sansa,looked,at,it,with,sudden,dread
your,father’s,colors,said,cersei,as,they,fastened,it,about,her,neck,with,a,slender,silver,chain
a,maiden’s,cloak
sansa’s,hand,went,to,her,throat
she,would,have,torn,the,thing,away,if,she,had,dared

the,queen,opened,the,door
ser,meryn,trant,and,ser,osmund,kettleblack,were,waiting,without,in,the,white,scale,armor,of,the,kingsguard
escort,lady,sansa,to,the,sept,she,told,them
carry,her,if,you,must,but,try,not,to,tear,the,gown,it,was,very,costly
sansa,tried,to,run,but,cersei’s,handmaid,caught,her,before,she’d,gone,a,yard
ser,meryn,trant,gave,her,a,look,that,made,her,cringe,but,kettleblack,touched,her,almost,gently,and,said,do,as,you’re,told,sweetling,it,won’t,be,so,bad

brave
sansa,took,a,deep,breath
i,am,a,stark,yes,i,can,be,brave
they,were,all,looking,at,her,the,way,they,had,looked,at,her,that,day,in,the,yard,when,ser,boros,blount,had,torn,her,clothes,off
it,had,been,the,imp,who,saved,her,from,a,beating,that,day,the,same,man,who,was,waiting,for,her,now
he,is,not,so,bad,as,the,rest,of,them,she,told,herself
i’ll,go
cersei,smiled
i,knew,you,would
afterward,she,could,not,remember,leaving,the,room,or,descending,the,steps,or,crossing,the,yard
it,seemed,to,take,all,her,attention,just,to,put,one,foot,down,in,front,of,the,other
ser,meryn,and,ser,osmund,walked,beside,her,in,cloaks,as,pale,as,her,own,lacking,only,the,pearls,and,the,direwolf,that,had,been,her,father’s
joffrey,himself,was,waiting,for,her,on,the,steps,of,the,castle,sept,the,king,was,resplendent,in,crimson,and,gold,his,crown,on,his,head
i’m,your,father,today,he,announced
you’re,not,she,flared
you’ll,never,be
his,face,darkened
i,am
i’m,your,father,and,i,can,marry,you,to,whoever,i,like
to,anyone
you’ll,marry,the,pig,boy,if,i,say,so,and,bed,down,with,him,in,the,sty
his,green,eyes,glittered,with,amusement
or,maybe,i,should,give,you,to,ilyn,payne,would,you,like,him,better
her,heart,lurched
please,your,grace,she,begged
if,you,ever,loved,me,even,a,little,bit,don’t,make,me,marry,your,uncle
tyrion,lannister,stepped,through,the,doors,of,the,sept,your,grace,he,said,to,joffrey
grant,me,a,moment,alone,with,lady,sansa,if,you,would,be,so,kind
the,king,was,about,to,refuse,but,his,mother,gave,him,a,sharp,look
they,drew,off,a,few,feet
tyrion,wore,a,doublet,of,black,velvet,covered,with,golden,scrollwork,thigh-high,boots,that,added,three,inches,to,his,height,a,chain,of,rubies,and,lions’,heads
but,the,gash,across,his,face,was,raw,and,red,and,his,nose,was,a,hideous,scab
you,are,very,beautiful,sansa,he,told,her
it,is,good,of,you,to,say,so,my,lord
she,did,not,know,what,else,to,say
should,i,tell,him,he,is,handsome
he’ll,think,me,a,fool,or,a,liar
she,lowered,her,gaze,and,held,her,tongue
my,lady,this,is,no,way,to,bring,you,to,your,wedding
i,am,sorry,for,that
and,for,making,this,so,sudden,and,so,secret
my,lord,father,felt,it,necessary,for,reasons,of,state
else,i,would,have,come,to,you,sooner,as,i,wished
he,waddled,closer
you,did,not,ask,for,this,marriage,i,know
no,more,than,i,did
if,i,had,refused,you,however,they,would,have,wed,you,to,my,cousin,lancel
perhaps,you,would,prefer,that
he,is,nearer,your,age,and,fairer,to,look,upon
if,that,is,your,wish,say,so,and,i,will,end,this,farce
i,don’t,want,any,lannister,she,wanted,to,say
i,want,willas,i,want,highgarden,and,the,puppies,and,the,barge,and,sons,named,eddard,and,bran,and,rickon
but,then,she,remembered,what,dontos,had,told,her,in,the,godswood
tyrell,or,lannister,it,makes,no,matter,it’s,not,me,they,want,only,my,claim
you,are,kind,my,lord,she,said,defeated
i,am,a,ward,of,the,throne,and,my,duty,is,to,marry,as,the,king,commands
he,studied,her,with,his,mismatched,eyes
i,know,i,am,not,the,sort,of,husband,young,girls,dream,of,sansa,he,said,softly,but,neither,am,i,joffrey
no,she,said
you,were,kind,to,me
i,remember
tyrion,offered,her,a,thick,blunt-fingered,hand
come,then
let,us,do,our,duty
so,she,put,her,hand,in,his,and,he,led,her,to,the,marriage,altar,where,the,septon,waited,between,the,mother,and,the,father,to,join,their,lives,together
she,saw,dontos,in,his,fool’s,motley,looking,at,her,with,big,round,eyes
ser,balon,swann,and,ser,boros,blount,were,there,in,kingsguard,white,but,not,ser,loras
none,of,the,tyrells,are,here,she,realized,suddenly
but,there,were,other,witnesses,aplenty,the,eunuch,varys,ser,addam,marbrand,lord,philip,foote,ser,bronn,jalabhar,xho,a,dozen,others
lord,gyles,was,coughing,lady,ermesande,was,at,the,breast,and,lady,tanda’s,pregnant,daughter,was,sobbing,for,no,apparent,reason
let,her,sob,sansa,thought
perhaps,i,shall,do,the,same,before,this,day,is,done
the,ceremony,passed,as,in,a,dream
sansa,did,all,that,was,required,of,her
there,were,prayers,and,vows,and,singing,and,tall,candles,burning,a,hundred,dancing,lights,that,the,tears,in,her,eyes,transformed,into,a,thousand
thankfully,no,one,seemed,to,notice,that,she,was,crying,as,she,stood,there,wrapped,in,her,father’s,colors,or,if,they,did,they,pretended,not,to
in,what,seemed,no,time,at,all,they,came,to,the,changing,of,the,cloaks
as,father,of,the,realm,joffrey,took,the,place,of,lord,eddard,stark
sansa,stood,stiff,as,a,lance,as,his,hands,came,over,her,shoulders,to,fumble,with,the,clasp,of,her,cloak
one,of,them,brushed,her,breast,and,lingered,to,give,it,a,little,squeeze
then,the,clasp,opened,and,joff,swept,her,maiden’s,cloak,away,with,a,kingly,flourish,and,a,grin
his,uncle’s,part,went,less,well
the,bride’s,cloak,he,held,was,huge,and,heavy,crimson,velvet,richly,worked,with,lions,and,bordered,with,gold,satin,and,rubies
no,one,had,thought,to,bring,a,stool,however,and,tyrion,stood,a,foot,and,a,half,shorter,than,his,bride
as,he,moved,behind,her,sansa,felt,a,sharp,tug,on,her,skirt
he,wants,me,to,kneel,she,realized,blushing
she,was,mortified
it,was,not,supposed,to,be,this,way
she,had,dreamed,of,her,wedding,a,thousand,times,and,always,she,had,pictured,how,her,betrothed,would,stand,behind,her,tall,and,strong,sweep,the,cloak,of,his,protection,over,her,shoulders,and,tenderly,kiss,her,cheek,as,he,leaned,forward,to,fasten,the,clasp
she,felt,another,tug,at,her,skirt,more,insistent
i,won’t
why,should,i,spare,his,feelings,when,no,one,cares,about,mine
the,dwarf,tugged,at,her,a,third,time
stubbornly,she,pressed,her,lips,together,and,pretended,not,to,notice
someone,behind,them,tittered
the,queen,she,thought,but,it,didn’t,matter
they,were,all,laughing,by,then,joffrey,the,loudest
dontos,down,on,your,hands,and,knees,the,king,commanded
my,uncle,needs,a,boost,to,climb,his,bride
and,so,it,was,that,her,lord,husband,cloaked,her,in,the,colors,of,house,lannister,whilst,standing,on,the,back,of,a,fool
when,sansa,turned,the,little,man,was,gazing,up,at,her,his,mouth,tight,his,face,as,red,as,her,cloak
suddenly,she,was,ashamed,of,her,stubbornness
she,smoothed,her,skirts,and,knelt,in,front,of,him,so,their,heads,were,on,the,same,level
with,this,kiss,i,pledge,my,love,and,take,you,for,my,lord,and,husband
with,this,kiss,i,pledge,my,love,the,dwarf,replied,hoarsely,and,take,you,for,my,lady,and,wife
he,leaned,forward,and,their,lips,touched,briefly
he,is,so,ugly,sansa,thought,when,his,face,was,close,to,hers
he,is,even,uglier,than,the,hound
the,septon,raised,his,crystal,high,so,the,rainbow,light,fell,down,upon,them
here,in,the,sight,of,gods,and,men,he,said,i,do,solemnly,proclaim,tyrion,of,house,lannister,and,sansa,of,house,stark,to,be,man,and,wife,one,flesh,one,heart,one,soul,now,and,forever,and,cursed,be,the,one,who,comes,between,them
she,had,to,bite,her,lip,to,keep,from,sobbing
the,wedding,feast,was,held,in,the,small,hall
there,were,perhaps,fifty,guests,lannister,retainers,and,allies,for,the,most,part,joining,those,who,had,been,at,the,wedding
and,here,sansa,found,the,tyrells
margaery,gave,her,such,a,sad,look,and,when,the,queen,of,thorns,tottered,in,between,left,and,right,she,never,looked,at,her,at,all
elinor,alla,and,megga,seemed,determined,not,to,know,her
my,friends,sansa,thought,bitterly
her,husband,drank,heavily,and,ate,but,little
he,listened,whenever,someone,rose,to,make,a,toast,and,sometimes,nodded,a,curt,acknowledgment,but,otherwise,his,face,might,have,been,made,of,stone
the,feast,seemed,to,go,on,forever,though,sansa,tasted,none,of,the,food
she,wanted,it,to,be,done,and,yet,she,dreaded,its,end
for,after,the,feast,would,come,the,bedding
the,men,would,carry,her,up,to,her,wedding,bed,undressing,her,on,the,way,and,making,rude,jokes,about,the,fate,that,awaited,her,between,the,sheets,while,the,women,did,tyrion,the,same,honors
only,after,they,had,been,bundled,naked,into,bed,would,they,be,left,alone,and,even,then,the,guests,would,stand,outside,the,bridal,chamber,shouting,ribald,suggestions,through,the,door
the,bedding,had,seemed,wonderfully,wicked,and,exciting,when,sansa,was,a,girl,but,now,that,the,moment,was,upon,her,she,felt,only,dread
she,did,not,think,she,could,bear,for,them,to,rip,off,her,clothes,and,she,was,certain,she,would,burst,into,tears,at,the,first,randy,jape
when,the,musicians,began,to,play,she,timidly,laid,her,hand,on,tyrion’s,and,said,my,lord,should,we,lead,the,dance
his,mouth,twisted
i,think,we,have,already,given,them,sufficent,amusement,for,one,day,don’t,you
as,you,say,my,lord
she,pulled,her,hand,back
joffrey,and,margaery,led,in,their,place
how,can,a,monster,dance,so,beautifully
sansa,wondered
she,had,often,daydreamed,of,how,she,would,dance,at,her,wedding,with,every,eye,upon,her,and,her,handsome,lord
in,her,dreams,they,had,all,been,smiling
not,even,my,husband,is,smiling

sansa,sat,with,her,hands,in,her,lap,watching,how,the,queen,moved,and,laughed,and,tossed,her,blonde,curls
she,charms,them,all,she,thought,dully
how,i,hate,her
she,looked,away,to,where,moon,boy,danced,with,dontos

perhaps,she,ought,to,have,remained,beside,her,husband,but,she,wanted,to,dance,so,badly
and,ser,garlan,was,brother,to,margaery,to,willas,to,her,knight,of,flowers
i,see,why,they,name,you,garlan,the,gallant,ser,she,said,as,she,took,his,hand
my,lady,is,gracious,to,say,so

so,willas,struck,first,though,not,before,threatening,me,with,garlan,the,greensick,garlan,the,galling,and,garlan,the,gargoyle
it,was,so,sweet,and,silly,that,sansa,had,to,laugh,despite,everything
afterward,she,was,absurdly,grateful
somehow,the,laughter,made,her,hopeful,again,if,only,for,a,little,while
smiling,she,let,the,music,take,her,losing,herself,in,the,steps,in,the,sound,of,flute,and,pipes,and,harp,in,the,rhythm,of,the,drum
and,from,time,to,time,in,ser,garlan’s,arms,when,the,dance,brought,them,together
my,lady,wife,is,most,concerned,for,you,he,said,quietly,one,such,time

the,eastern,sky,was,pink,near,the,horizon,and,pale,grey,higher,up
the,sword,of,the,morning,still,hung,in,the,south,the,bright,white,star,in,its,hilt,blazing,like,a,diamond,in,the,dawn,but,the,blacks,and,greys,of,the,darkling,forest,were,turning,once,again,to,greens,and,golds,reds,and,russets
and,above,the,soldier,pines,and,oaks,and,ash,and,sentinels,stood,the,wall,the,ice,pale,and,glimmering,beneath,the,dust,and,dirt,that,pocked,its,surface
the,magnar,sent,a,dozen,men,riding,west,and,a,dozen,more,east,to,climb,the,highest,hills,they,could,find,and,watch,for,any,sign,of,rangers,in,the,wood,or,riders,on,the,high,ice

the,other,wildlings,fell,in,behind,jarl,jon,and,ygritte,with,the,rest
this,was,to,be,the,young,raider’s,hour,of,glory
the,wall,was,often,said,to,stand,seven,hundred,feet,high,but,jarl,had,found,a,place,where,it,was,both,higher,and,lower
before,them,the,ice,rose,sheer,from,out,of,the,trees,like,some,immense,cliff,crowned,by,wind-carved,battlements,that,loomed,at,least,eight,hundred,feet,high,perhaps,nine,hundred,in,spots
but,that,was,deceptive,jon,realized,as,they,drew,closer
brandon,the,builder,had,laid,his,huge,foundation,blocks,along,the,heights,wherever,feasible,and,hereabouts,the,hills,rose,wild,and,rugged
he,had,once,heard,his,uncle,benjen,say,that,the,wall,was,a,sword,east,of,castle,black,but,a,snake,to,the,west
it,was,true
sweeping,in,over,one,huge,humped,hill,the,ice,dipped,down,into,a,valley,climbed,the,knife,edge,of,a,long,granite,ridgeline,for,a,league,or,more,ran,along,a,jagged,crest,dipped,again,into,a,valley,deeper,still,and,then,rose,higher,and,higher,leaping,from,hill,to,hill,as,far,as,the,eye,could,see,into,the,mountainous,west
jarl,had,chosen,to,assault,the,stretch,of,ice,along,the,ridge
here,though,the,top,of,the,wall,loomed,eight,hundred,feet,above,the,forest,floor,a,good,third,of,that,height,was,earth,and,stone,rather,than,ice,the,slope,was,too,steep,for,their,horses,almost,as,difficult,a,scramble,as,the,fist,of,the,first,men,but,still,vastly,easier,to,ascend,than,the,sheer,vertical,face,of,the,wall,itself
and,the,ridge,was,densely,wooded,as,well,offering,easy,concealment
once,brothers,in,black,had,gone,out,every,day,with,axes,to,cut,back,the,encroaching,trees,but,those,days,were,long,past,and,here,the,forest,grew,right,up,to,the,ice
the,day,promised,to,be,damp,and,cold,and,damper,and,colder,by,the,wall,beneath,those,tons,of,ice
the,closer,they,got,the,more,the,thenns,held,back
they,have,never,seen,the,wall,before,not,even,the,magnar,jon,realized
it,frightens,them
in,the,seven,kingdoms,it,was,said,that,the,wall,marked,the,end,of,the,world
that,is,true,for,them,as,well
it,was,all,in,where,you,stood
and,where,do,i,stand

if,he,abandoned,her,to,return,to,his,duty,the,magnar,might,cut,her,heart,out
and,if,he,took,her,with,him

a,deserter,and,a,wildling,could,expect,no,welcome,anywhere,in,the,seven,kingdoms
we,could,go,look,for,gendel’s,children,i,suppose
though,they’d,be,more,like,to,eat,us,than,to,take,us,in
the,wall,did,not,awe,jarl’s,raiders,jon,saw

all,were,young
the,oldest,could,not,have,been,more,than,five-and-twenty,and,two,of,the,ten,were,younger,than,jon
every,one,was,lean,and,hard,though,they,had,a,look,of,sinewy,strength,that,reminded,him,of,stonesnake,the,brother,the,halfhand,had,sent,off,afoot,when,rattleshirt,was,hunting,them
in,the,very,shadow,of,the,wall,the,wildlings,made,ready,winding,thick,coils,of,hempen,rope,around,one,shoulder,and,down,across,their,chests,and,lacing,on,queer,boots,of,supple,doeskin
the,boots,had,spikes,jutting,from,the,toes,iron,for,jarl,and,two,others,bronze,for,some,but,most,often,jagged,bone

their,ice,axes,were,antlers,with,sharpened,tines,bound,to,wooden,hafts,with,strips,of,hide
the,eleven,climbers,sorted,themselves,into,three,teams,of,four,jarl,himself,made,the,twelfth,man

what,more,could,a,free,man,ask
up,and,the,others,take,the,hindmost
the,others,take,them,all,thought,jon,as,he,watched,them,scramble,up,the,steep,slope,of,the,ridge,and,vanish,beneath,the,trees
it,would,not,be,the,first,time,wildlings,had,scaled,the,wall,not,even,the,hundred,and,first
the,patrols,stumbled,on,climbers,two,or,three,times,a,year,and,rangers,sometimes,came,on,the,broken,corpses,of,those,who,had,fallen
along,the,east,coast,the,raiders,most,often,built,boats,to,slip,across,the,bay,of,seals
in,the,west,they,would,descend,into,the,black,depths,of,the,gorge,to,make,their,way,around,the,shadow,tower
but,in,between,the,only,way,to,defeat,the,wall,was,to,go,over,it,and,many,a,raider,had
fewer,come,back,though,he,thought,with,a,certain,grim,pride
climbers,must,of,necessity,leave,their,mounts,behind,and,many,younger,greener,raiders,began,by,taking,the,first,horses,they,found
then,a,hue,and,cry,would,go,up,ravens,would,fly,and,as,often,as,not,the,night’s,watch,would,hunt,them,down,and,hang,them,before,they,could,get,back,with,their,plunder,and,stolen,women
jarl,would,not,make,that,mistake,jon,knew,but,he,wondered,about,styr
the,magnar,is,a,ruler,not,a,raider
he,may,not,know,how,the,game,is,played
there,they,are,ygritte,said,and,jon,glanced,up,to,see,the,first,climber,emerge,above,the,treetops
it,was,jarl
he,had,found,a,sentinel,tree,that,leaned,against,the,wall,and,led,his,men,up,the,trunk,to,get,a,quicker,start
the,wood,should,never,have,been,allowed,to,creep,so,close
they’re,three,hundred,feet,up,and,they,haven’t,touched,the,ice,itself,yet
he,watched,the,wildling,move,carefully,from,wood,to,wall,hacking,out,a,handhold,with,short,sharp,blows,of,his,ice,axe,then,swinging,over
the,rope,around,his,waist,tied,him,to,the,second,man,in,line,still,edging,up,the,tree
step,by,slow,step,jarl,moved,higher,kicking,out,toeholds,with,his,spiked,boots,when,there,were,no,natural,ones,to,be,found
when,he,was,ten,feet,above,the,sentinel,he,stopped,upon,a,narrow,icy,ledge,slung,his,axe,from,his,belt,took,out,his,hammer,and,drove,an,iron,stake,into,a,cleft
the,second,man,moved,onto,the,wall,behind,him,while,the,third,was,scrambling,to,the,top,of,the,tree
the,other,two,teams,had,no,happily,placed,trees,to,give,them,a,leg,up,and,before,long,the,thenns,were,wondering,whether,they,had,gotten,lost,climbing,the,ridge
jarl’s,party,were,all,on,the,wall,and,eighty,feet,up,before,the,leading,climbers,from,the,other,groups,came,into,view
the,teams,were,spaced,a,good,twenty,yards,apart
jarl’s,four,were,in,the,center
to,the,right,of,them,was,a,team,headed,up,by,grigg,the,goat,whose,long,blond,braid,made,him,easy,to,spot,from,below

he,remembered,the,skirling,pass,all,too,well,and,the,moonlight,climb,he’d,made,with,stonesnake
he,had,swallowed,his,heart,a,half-dozen,times,that,night,and,by,the,end,his,arms,and,legs,had,been,aching,and,his,fingers,were,half,frozen
and,that,was,stone,not,ice
stone,was,solid
ice,was,treacherous,stuff,at,the,best,of,times,and,on,a,day,like,this,when,the,wall,was,weeping,the,warmth,of,a,climber’s,hand,might,be,enough,to,melt,it
the,huge,blocks,could,be,frozen,rock-hard,inside,but,their,outer,surface,would,be,slick,with,runnels,of,water,trickling,down,and,patches,of,rotten,ice,where,the,air,had,gotten,in
whatever,else,the,wildlings,are,they’re,brave
all,the,same,jon,found,himself,hoping,that,styr’s,fears,proved,well,founded
if,the,gods,are,good,a,patrol,will,chance,by,and,put,an,end,to,this
no,wall,can,keep,you,safe,his,father,had,told,him,once,as,they,walked,the,walls,of,winterfell
a,wall,is,only,as,strong,as,the,men,who,defend,it
the,wildlings,might,have,a,hundred,and,twenty,men,but,four,defenders,would,be,enough,to,see,them,off,with,a,few,well-placed,arrows,and,perhaps,a,pail,of,stones
no,defenders,appeared,however,not,four,not,even,one
the,sun,climbed,the,sky,and,the,wildlings,climbed,the,wall
jarl’s,four,remained,well,ahead,till,noon,when,they,hit,a,pitch,of,bad,ice
jarl,had,looped,his,rope,around,a,wind-carved,pinnace,and,was,using,it,to,support,his,weight,when,the,whole,jagged,thing,suddenly,crumbled,and,came,crashing,down,and,him,with,it
chunks,of,ice,as,big,as,a,man’s,head,bombarded,the,three,below,but,they,clung,to,the,handholds,and,the,stakes,held,and,jarl,jerked,to,a,sudden,halt,at,the,end,of,the,rope
by,the,time,his,team,had,recovered,from,that,mischance,grigg,the,goat,had,almost,drawn,even,with,them
errok’s,four,remained,well,behind
the,face,where,they,were,climbing,looked,smooth,and,unpitted,covered,with,a,sheet,of,icemelt,that,glistened,wetly,where,the,sun,brushed,it
grigg’s,section,was,darker,to,the,eye,with,more,obvious,features,long,horizontal,ledges,where,a,block,had,been,imperfectly,positioned,atop,the,block,below,cracks,and,crevices,even,chimneys,along,the,vertical,joins,where,wind,and,water,had,eaten,holes,large,enough,for,a,man,to,hide,in
jarl,soon,had,his,men,edging,upward,again
his,four,and,grigg’s,moved,almost,side,by,side,with,errok’s,fifty,feet,below
deerhorn,axes,chopped,and,hacked,sending,showers,of,glittery,shards,cascading,down,onto,the,trees
stone,hammers,pounded,stakes,deep,into,the,ice,to,serve,as,anchors,for,the,ropes,the,iron,stakes,ran,out,before,they,were,halfway,up,and,after,that,the,climbers,used,horn,and,sharpened,bone
and,the,men,kicked,driving,the,spikes,on,their,boots,against,the,hard,unyielding,ice,again,and,again,and,again,and,again,to,make,one,foothold
their,legs,must,be,numb,jon,thought,by,the,fourth,hour
how,long,can,they,keep,on,with,that
he,watched,as,restless,as,the,magnar,listening,for,the,distant,moan,of,a,thenn,warhorn
but,the,horns,stayed,silent,and,there,was,no,sign,of,the,night’s,watch
by,the,sixth,hour,jarl,had,moved,ahead,of,grigg,the,goat,again,and,his,men,were,widening,the,gap
the,mance’s,pet,must,want,a,sword,the,magnar,said,shading,his,eyes
the,sun,was,high,in,the,sky,and,the,upper,third,of,the,wall,was,a,crystalline,blue,from,below,reflecting,so,brilliantly,that,it,hurt,the,eyes,to,look,on,it
jarl’s,four,and,grigg’s,were,all,but,lost,in,the,glare,though,errok’s,team,was,still,in,shadow
instead,of,moving,upward,they,were,edging,their,way,sideways,at,about,five,hundred,feet,making,for,a,chimney
jon,was,watching,them,inch,along,when,he,heard,the,sound,a,sudden,crack,that,seemed,to,roll,along,the,ice,followed,by,a,shout,of,alarm
and,then,the,air,was,full,of,shards,and,shrieks,and,falling,men,as,a,sheet,of,ice,a,foot,thick,and,fifty,feet,square,broke,off,from,the,wall,and,came,tumbling,crumbling,rumbling,sweeping,all,before,it
even,down,at,the,foot,of,the,ridge,some,chunks,came,spinning,through,the,trees,and,rolling,down,the,slope
jon,grabbed,ygritte,and,pulled,her,down,to,shield,her,and,one,of,the,thenns,was,struck,in,the,face,by,a,chunk,that,broke,his,nose
and,when,they,looked,up,jarl,and,his,team,were,gone
men,ropes,stakes,all,gone,nothing,remained,above,six,hundred,feet
there,was,a,wound,in,the,wall,where,the,climbers,had,clung,half,a,heartbeat,before,the,ice,within,as,smooth,and,white,as,polished,marble,and,shining,in,the,sun
far,far,below,there,was,a,faint,red,smear,where,someone,had,smashed,against,a,frozen,pinnace
the,wall,defends,itself,jon,thought,as,he,pulled,ygritte,back,to,her,feet
they,found,jarl,in,a,tree,impaled,upon,a,splintered,branch,and,still,roped,to,the,three,men,who,lay,broken,beneath,him
one,was,still,alive,but,his,legs,and,spine,were,shattered,and,most,of,his,ribs,as,well
mercy,he,said,when,they,came,upon,him
one,of,the,thenns,smashed,his,head,in,with,a,big,stone,mace
the,magnar,gave,orders,and,his,men,began,to,gather,fuel,for,a,pyre
the,dead,were,burning,when,grigg,the,goat,reached,the,top,of,the,wall
by,the,time,errok’s,four,had,joined,them,nothing,remained,of,jarl,and,his,team,but,bone,and,ash
the,sun,had,begun,to,sink,by,then,so,the,climbers,wasted,little,time
they,unwound,the,long,coils,of,hemp,they’d,had,looped,around,their,chests,tied,them,all,together,and,tossed,down,one,end
the,thought,of,trying,to,climb,five,hundred,feet,up,that,rope,filled,jon,with,dread,but,mance,had,planned,better,than,that
the,raiders,jarl,had,left,below,uncasked,a,huge,ladder,with,rungs,of,woven,hemp,as,thick,as,a,man’s,arm,and,tied,it,to,the,climbers’,rope
errok,and,grigg,and,their,men,grunted,and,heaved,pulled,it,up,staked,it,to,the,top,then,lowered,the,rope,again,to,haul,up,a,second,ladder
there,were,five,altogether
when,all,of,them,were,in,place,the,magnar,shouted,a,brusque,command,in,the,old,tongue,and,five,of,his,thenns,started,up,together
even,with,the,ladders,it,was,no,easy,climb
ygritte,watched,them,struggle,for,a,while
i,hate,this,wall,she,said,in,a,low,angry,voice
can,you,feel,how,cold,it,is
it’s,made,of,ice,jon,pointed,out
you,know,nothing,jon,snow
this,wall,is,made,o’,blood
nor,had,it,drunk,its,fill
by,sunset,two,of,the,thenns,had,fallen,from,the,ladder,to,their,deaths,but,they,were,the,last
it,was,near,midnight,before,jon,reached,the,top
the,stars,were,out,again,and,ygritte,was,trembling,from,the,climb
i,almost,fell,she,said,with,tears,in,her,eyes
twice
thrice
the,wall,was,trying,t’,shake,me,off,i,could,feel,it
one,of,the,tears,broke,free,and,trickled,slowly,down,her,cheek
the,worst,is,behind,us
jon,tried,to,sound,confident
don’t,be,frightened
he,tried,to,put,an,arm,around,her
ygritte,slammed,the,heel,of,her,hand,into,his,chest,so,hard,it,stung,even,through,his,layers,of,wool,mail,and,boiled,leather
i,wasn’t,frightened
you,know,nothing,jon,snow
why,are,you,crying,then
not,for,fear
she,kicked,savagely,at,the,ice,beneath,her,with,a,heel,chopping,out,a,chunk
i’m,crying,because,we,never,found,the,horn,of,winter
we,opened,half,a,hundred,graves,and,let,all,those,shades,loose,in,the,world,and,never,found,the,horn,of,joramun,to,bring,this,cold,thing,down
jaime,his,hand,burned
still,still,long,after,they,had,snuffed,out,the,torch,they’d,used,to,sear,his,bloody,stump,days,after,he,could,still,feel,the,fire,lancing,up,his,arm,and,his,fingers,twisting,in,the,flames,the,fingers,he,no,longer,had
he,had,taken,wounds,before,but,never,like,this
he,had,never,known,there,could,be,such,pain
sometimes,unbidden,old,prayers,bubbled,from,his,lips,prayers,he,learned,as,a,child,and,never,thought,of,since,prayers,he,had,first,prayed,with,cersei,kneeling,beside,him,in,the,sept,at,casterly,rock
sometimes,he,even,wept,until,he,heard,the,mummers,laughing
then,he,made,his,eyes,go,dry,and,his,heart,go,dead,and,prayed,for,his,fever,to,burn,away,his,tears
now,i,know,how,tyrion,has,felt,all,those,times,they,laughed,at,him
after,the,second,time,he,fell,from,the,saddle,they,bound,him,tight,to,brienne,of,tarth,and,made,them,share,a,horse,again
one,day,instead,of,back,to,front,they,bound,them,face-to-face
the,lovers,shagwell,sighed,loudly,and,what,a,lovely,sight,they,are
’twould,be,cruel,to,separate,the,good,knight,and,his,lady
then,he,laughed,that,high,shrill,laugh,of,his,and,said,ah,but,which,one,is,the,knight,and,which,one,is,the,lady
if,i,had,my,hand,you’d,learn,that,soon,enough,jaime,thought
his,arms,ached,and,his,legs,were,numb,from,the,ropes,but,after,a,while,none,of,that,mattered
his,world,shrunk,to,the,throb,of,agony,that,was,his,phantom,hand,and,brienne,pressed,against,him
she’s,warm,at,least,he,consoled,himself,though,the,wench’s,breath,was,as,foul,as,his,own
his,hand,was,always,between,them
urswyck,had,hung,it,about,his,neck,on,a,cord,so,it,dangled,down,against,his,chest,slapping,brienne’s,breasts,as,jaime,slipped,in,and,out,of,consciousness
his,right,eye,was,swollen,shut,the,wound,inflamed,where,brienne,had,cut,him,during,their,fight,but,it,was,his,hand,that,hurt,the,most
blood,and,pus,seeped,from,his,stump,and,the,missing,hand,throbbed,every,time,the,horse,took,a,step
his,throat,was,so,raw,that,he,could,not,eat,but,he,drank,wine,when,they,gave,it,to,him,and,water,when,that,was,all,they,offered
once,they,handed,him,a,cup,and,he,quaffed,it,straight,away,trembling,and,the,brave,companions,burst,into,laughter,so,loud,and,harsh,it,hurt,his,ears
that’s,horse,piss,you’re,drinking,kingslayer,rorge,told,him
jaime,was,so,thirsty,he,drank,it,anyway,but,afterward,he,retched,it,all,back,up
they,made,brienne,wash,the,vomit,out,of,his,beard,just,as,they,made,her,clean,him,up,when,he,soiled,himself,in,the,saddle
one,damp,cold,morning,when,he,was,feeling,slightly,stronger,a,madness,took,hold,of,him,and,he,reached,for,the,dornishman’s,sword,with,his,left,hand,and,wrenched,it,clumsily,from,its,scabbard
let,them,kill,me,he,thought,so,long,as,i,die,fighting,a,blade,in,hand
but,it,was,no,good
shagwell,came,hopping,from,leg,to,leg,dancing,nimbly,aside,when,jaime,slashed,at,him
unbalanced,he,staggered,forward,hacking,wildly,at,the,fool,but,shagwell,spun,and,ducked,and,darted,until,all,the,mummers,were,laughing,at,jaime’s,futile,efforts,to,land,a,blow
when,he,tripped,over,a,rock,and,stumbled,to,his,knees,the,fool,leapt,in,and,planted,a,wet,kiss,atop,his,head
rorge,finally,flung,him,aside,and,kicked,the,sword,from,jaime’s,feeble,fingers,as,he,tried,to,bring,it,up
that,wath,amuthing,kingthlayer,said,vargo,hoat,but,if,you,try,it,again,i,thall,take,your,other,hand,or,perhapth,a,foot
jaime,lay,on,his,back,afterward,staring,at,the,night,sky,trying,not,to,feel,the,pain,that,snaked,up,his,right,arm,every,time,he,moved,it
the,night,was,strangely,beautiful
the,moon,was,a,graceful,crescent,and,it,seemed,as,though,he,had,never,seen,so,many,stars
the,king’s,crown,was,at,the,zenith,and,he,could,see,the,stallion,rearing,and,there,the,swan
the,moonmaid,shy,as,ever,was,half-hidden,behind,a,pine,tree
how,can,such,a,night,be,beautiful
he,asked,himself
why,would,the,stars,want,to,look,down,on,such,as,me
jaime,brienne,whispered,so,faintly,he,thought,he,was,dreaming,it
jaime,what,are,you,doing
dying,he,whispered,back
no,she,said,no,you,must,live
he,wanted,to,laugh
stop,telling,me,what,do,wench
i’ll,die,if,it,pleases,me
are,you,so,craven
the,word,shocked,him
he,was,jaime,lannister,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,he,was,the,kingslayer
no,man,had,ever,called,him,craven
other,things,they,called,him,yes,oathbreaker,liar,murderer
they,said,he,was,cruel,treacherous,reckless
but,never,craven
what,else,can,i,do,but,die
live,she,said,live,and,fight,and,take,revenge
but,she,spoke,too,loudly
rorge,heard,her,voice,if,not,her,words,and,came,over,to,kick,her,shouting,at,her,to,hold,her,bloody,tongue,if,she,wanted,to,keep,it
craven,jaime,thought,as,brienne,fought,to,stifle,her,moans
can,it,be
they,took,my,sword,hand
was,that,all,i,was,a,sword,hand
gods,be,good,is,it,true
the,wench,had,the,right,of,it
he,could,not,die
cersei,was,waiting,for,him
she,would,have,need,of,him
and,tyrion,his,little,brother,who,loved,him,for,a,lie
and,his,enemies,were,waiting,too,the,young,wolf,who,had,beaten,him,in,the,whispering,wood,and,killed,his,men,around,him,edmure,tully,who,had,kept,him,in,darkness,and,chains,these,brave,companions
when,morning,came,he,made,himself,eat
they,fed,him,a,mush,of,oats,horse,food,but,he,forced,down,every,spoon
he,ate,again,at,evenfall,and,the,next,day
live,he,told,himself,harshly,when,the,mush,was,like,to,gag,him,live,for,cersei,live,for,tyrion
live,for,vengeance
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts
his,missing,hand,throbbed,and,burned,and,stank
when,i,reach,king’s,landing,i’ll,have,a,new,hand,forged,a,golden,hand,and,one,day,i’ll,use,it,to,rip,out,vargo,hoat’s,throat
the,days,and,the,nights,blurred,together,in,a,haze,of,pain
he,would,sleep,in,the,saddle,pressed,against,brienne,his,nose,full,of,the,stink,of,his,rotting,hand,and,then,at,night,he,would,lie,awake,on,the,hard,ground,caught,in,a,waking,nightmare
weak,as,he,was,they,always,bound,him,to,a,tree
it,gave,him,some,cold,consolation,to,know,that,they,feared,him,that,much,even,now
brienne,was,always,bound,beside,him
she,lay,there,in,her,bonds,like,a,big,dead,cow,saying,not,a,word
the,wench,has,built,a,fortress,inside,herself
they,will,rape,her,soon,enough,but,behind,her,walls,they,cannot,touch,her
but,jaime’s,walls,were,gone
they,had,taken,his,hand,they,had,taken,his,sword,hand,and,without,it,he,was,nothing
the,other,was,no,good,to,him
since,the,time,he,could,walk,his,left,arm,had,been,his,shield,arm,no,more
it,was,his,right,hand,that,made,him,a,knight,his,right,arm,that,made,him,a,man
one,day,he,heard,urswyck,say,something,about,harrenhal,and,remembered,that,was,to,be,their,destination
that,made,him,laugh,aloud,and,that,made,timeon,slash,his,face,with,a,long,thin,whip
the,cut,bled,but,beside,his,hand,he,scarcely,felt,it
why,did,you,laugh
the,wench,asked,him,that,night,in,a,whisper
harrenhal,was,where,they,gave,me,the,white,cloak,he,whispered,back
whent’s,great,tourney
he,wanted,to,show,us,all,his,big,castle,and,his,fine,sons
i,wanted,to,show,them,too
i,was,only,fifteen,but,no,one,could,have,beaten,me,that,day
aerys,never,let,me,joust
he,laughed,again
he,sent,me,away
but,now,i’m,coming,back
they,heard,the,laugh
that,night,it,was,jaime,who,got,the,kicks,and,punches
he,hardly,felt,them,either,until,rorge,slammed,a,boot,into,his,stump,and,then,he,fainted
it,was,the,next,night,when,they,finally,came,three,of,the,worst,shagwell,noseless,rorge,and,the,fat,dothraki,zollo,the,one,who’d,cut,his,hand,off
zollo,and,rorge,were,arguing,about,who,would,go,first,as,they,approached,there,seemed,to,be,no,question,but,that,the,fool,would,be,going,last
shagwell,suggested,that,they,should,both,go,first,and,take,her,front,and,rear
zollo,and,rorge,liked,that,notion,only,then,they,began,to,fight,about,who,would,get,the,front,and,who,the,rear
they,will,leave,her,a,cripple,too,but,inside,where,it,does,not,show
wench,he,whispered,as,zollo,and,rorge,were,cursing,one,another,let,them,have,the,meat,and,you,go,far,away
it,will,be,over,quicker,and,they’ll,get,less,pleasure,from,it
they’ll,get,no,pleasure,from,what,i’ll,give,them,she,whispered,back,defiant
stupid,stubborn,brave,bitch
she,was,going,to,get,herself,good,and,killed,he,knew,it
and,what,do,i,care,if,she,does
if,she,hadn’t,been,so,pigheaded,i’d,still,have,a,hand
yet,he,heard,himself,whisper,let,them,do,it,and,go,away,inside
that,was,what,he’d,done,when,the,starks,had,died,before,him,lord,rickard,cooking,in,his,armor,while,his,son,brandon,strangled,himself,trying,to,save,him
think,of,renly,if,you,loved,him
think,of,tarth,mountains,and,seas,pools,waterfalls,whatever,you,have,on,your,sapphire,isle,think
but,rorge,had,won,the,argument,by,then

he,did,not,wait,for,an,answer,but,turned,and,climbed,the,steps,his,fur-trimmed,cloak,swirling,behind
jaime,had,only,enough,time,to,exchange,a,quick,look,with,brienne,before,they,were,marched,away,separately
in,the,maester’s,chambers,beneath,the,rookery,a,grey-haired,fatherly,man,named,qyburn,sucked,in,his,breath,when,he,cut,away,the,linen,from,the,stump,of,jaime’s,hand
that,bad
will,i,die
qyburn,pushed,at,the,wound,with,a,finger,and,wrinkled,his,nose,at,the,gush,of,pus
no
though,in,a,few,more,days
he,sliced,away,jaime’s,sleeve
the,corruption,has,spread
see,how,tender,the,flesh,is
i,must,cut,it,all,away
the,safest,course,would,be,to,take,the,arm,off
then,you’ll,die,jaime,promised
clean,the,stump,and,sew,it,up
i’ll,take,my,chances
qyburn,frowned
i,can,leave,you,the,upper,arm,make,the,cut,at,your,elbow,but
take,any,part,of,my,arm,and,you’d,best,chop,off,the,other,one,as,well,or,i’ll,strangle,you,with,it,afterward
qyburn,looked,in,his,eyes
whatever,he,saw,there,gave,him,pause
very,well
i,will,cut,away,the,rotten,flesh,no,more
try,to,burn,out,the,corruption,with,boiling,wine,and,a,poultice,of,nettle,mustard,seed,and,bread,mold
mayhaps,that,will,suffice
it,is,on,your,head
you,will,want,milk,of,the,poppy,no
jaime,dare,not,let,himself,be,put,to,sleep,he,might,be,short,an,arm,when,he,woke,no,matter,what,the,man,said
qyburn,was,taken,aback
there,will,be,pain
i’ll,scream
a,great,deal,of,pain
i’ll,scream,very,loudly
will,you,take,some,wine,at,least
does,the,high,septon,ever,pray
of,that,i,am,not,certain
i,shall,bring,the,wine
lie,back,i,must,needs,strap,down,your,arm
with,a,bowl,and,a,sharp,blade,qyburn,cleaned,the,stump,while,jaime,gulped,down,strongwine,spilling,it,all,over,himself,in,the,process
his,left,hand,did,not,seem,to,know,how,to,find,his,mouth,but,there,was,something,to,be,said,for,that
the,smell,of,wine,in,his,sodden,beard,helped,disguise,the,stench,of,pus
nothing,helped,when,the,time,came,to,pare,away,the,rotten,flesh
jaime,did,scream,then,and,pounded,his,table,with,his,good,fist,over,and,over,and,over,again
he,screamed,again,when,qyburn,poured,boiling,wine,over,what,remained,of,his,stump
despite,all,his,vows,and,all,his,fears,he,lost,consciousness,for,a,time
when,he,woke,the,maester,was,sewing,at,his,arm,with,needle,and,catgut
i,left,a,flap,of,skin,to,fold,back,over,your,wrist
you,have,done,this,before,muttered,jaime,weakly
he,could,taste,blood,in,his,mouth,where,he’d,bitten,his,tongue
no,man,who,serves,with,vargo,hoat,is,a,stranger,to,stumps
he,makes,them,wherever,he,goes
qyburn,did,not,look,a,monster,jaime,thought
he,was,spare,and,soft-spoken,with,warm,brown,eyes
how,does,a,maester,come,to,ride,with,the,brave,companions
the,citadel,took,my,chain
qyburn,put,away,his,needle
i,should,do,something,about,that,wound,above,your,eye,as,well
the,flesh,is,badly,inflamed
jaime,closed,his,eyes,and,let,the,wine,and,qyburn,do,their,work
tell,me,of,the,battle
as,keeper,of,harrenhal’s,ravens,qyburn,would,have,been,the,first,to,hear,the,news
lord,stannis,was,caught,between,your,father,and,the,fire
it’s,said,the,imp,set,the,river,itself,aflame
jaime,saw,green,flames,reaching,up,into,the,sky,higher,than,the,tallest,towers,as,burning,men,screamed,in,the,streets
i,have,dreamed,this,dream,before
it,was,almost,funny,but,there,was,no,one,to,share,the,joke
open,your,eye
qyburn,soaked,a,cloth,in,warm,water,and,dabbed,at,the,crust,of,dried,blood
the,eyelid,was,swollen,but,jaime,found,he,could,force,it,open,halfway
qyburn’s,face,loomed,above
how,did,you,come,by,this,one
the,maester,asked
a,wench’s,gift
rough,wooing,my,lord
this,wench,is,bigger,than,me,and,uglier,than,you
you’d,best,see,to,her,as,well
she’s,still,limping,on,the,leg,i,pricked,when,we,fought
i,will,ask,after,her
what,is,this,woman,to,you
my,protector
jaime,had,to,laugh,no,matter,how,it,hurt
i’ll,grind,some,herbs,you,can,mix,with,wine,to,bring,down,your,fever
come,back,on,the,morrow,and,i’ll,put,a,leech,on,your,eye,to,drain,the,bad,blood
a,leech
lovely
lord,bolton,is,very,fond,of,leeches,qyburn,said,primly
yes,said,jaime
he,would,be
tyrion,nothing,remained,beyond,the,king’s,gate,but,mud,and,ashes,and,bits,of,burned,bone,yet,already,there,were,people,living,in,the,shadow,of,the,city,walls,and,others,selling,fish,from,barrows,and,barrels
tyrion,felt,their,eyes,on,him,as,he,rode,past,chilly,eyes,angry,and,unsympathetic
no,one,dared,speak,to,him,or,try,to,bar,his,way,not,with,bronn,beside,him,in,oiled,black,mail
if,i,were,alone,though,they,would,pull,me,down,and,smash,my,face,in,with,a,cobblestone,as,they,did,for,preston,greenfield
they,come,back,quicker,than,the,rats,he,complained
we,burned,them,out,once,you’d,think,they’d,take,that,as,a,lesson
give,me,a,few,dozen,gold,cloaks,and,i’ll,kill,them,all,said,bronn
once,they’re,dead,they,don’t,come,back
no,but,others,come,in,their,places
leave,them,be
but,if,they,start,throwing,up,hovels,against,the,wall,again,pull,them,down,at,once
the,war’s,not,done,yet,no,matter,what,these,fools,may,think
he,spied,the,mud,gate,up,ahead
i,have,seen,enough,for,now
we’ll,return,on,the,morrow,with,the,guild,masters,to,go,over,their,plans
he,sighed
well,i,burned,most,of,this,i,suppose,it’s,only,just,that,i,rebuild,it
that,task,was,to,have,been,his,uncle’s,but,solid,steady,tireless,ser,kevan,lannister,had,not,been,himself,since,the,raven,had,come,from,riverrun,with,word,of,his,son’s,murder
willem’s,twin,martyn,had,been,taken,captive,by,robb,stark,as,well,and,their,elder,brother,lancel,was,still,abed,beset,by,an,ulcerating,wound,that,would,not,heal
with,one,son,dead,and,two,more,in,mortal,danger,ser,kevan,was,consumed,by,grief,and,fear
lord,tywin,had,always,relied,on,his,brother,but,now,he,had,no,choice,but,to,turn,again,to,his,dwarf,son
the,cost,of,rebuilding,was,going,to,be,ruinous,but,there,was,no,help,for,that
king’s,landing,was,the,realm’s,principal,harbor,rivaled,only,by,oldtown
the,river,had,to,be,reopened,and,the,sooner,the,better
and,where,am,i,going,to,find,the,bloody,coin
it,was,almost,enough,to,make,him,miss,littlefinger,who,had,sailed,north,a,fortnight,past
while,he,beds,lysa,arryn,and,rules,the,vale,beside,her,i,get,to,clean,up,the,mess,he,left,behind,him
though,at,least,his,father,was,giving,him,significant,work,to,do
he,won’t,name,me,heir,to,casterly,rock,but,he’ll,make,use,of,me,wherever,he,can,tyrion,thought,as,a,captain,of,gold,cloaks,waved,them,through,the,mud,gate
the,three,whores,still,dominated,the,market,square,inside,the,gate,but,they,stood,idle,now,and,the,boulders,and,barrels,of,pitch,had,all,been,trundled,away
there,were,children,climbing,the,towering,wooden,structures,swarming,up,like,monkeys,in,roughspun,to,perch,on,the,throwing,arms,and,hoot,at,each,other
remind,me,to,tell,ser,addam,to,post,some,gold,cloaks,here,tyrion,told,bronn,as,they,rode,between,two,of,the,trebuchets
some,fool,boy’s,like,to,fall,off,and,break,his,back
there,was,a,shout,from,above,and,a,clod,of,manure,exploded,on,the,ground,a,foot,in,front,of,them
tyrion’s,mare,reared,and,almost,threw,him
on,second,thoughts,he,said,when,he,had,the,horse,in,hand,let,the,poxy,brats,splatter,on,the,cobbles,like,overripe,melons
he,was,in,a,black,mood,and,not,just,because,a,few,street,urchins,wanted,to,pelt,him,with,dung
his,marriage,was,a,daily,agony
sansa,stark,remained,a,maiden,and,half,the,castle,seemed,to,know,it
when,they,had,saddled,up,this,morning,he’d,heard,two,of,the,stableboys,sniggering,behind,his,back
he,could,almost,imagine,that,the,horses,were,sniggering,as,well
he’d,risked,his,skin,to,avoid,the,bedding,ritual,hoping,to,preserve,the,privacy,of,his,bedchamber,but,that,hope,had,been,dashed,quick,enough
either,sansa,had,been,stupid,enough,to,confide,in,one,of,her,bedmaids,every,one,of,whom,was,a,spy,for,cersei,or,varys,and,his,little,birds,were,to,blame
what,difference,did,it,make
they,were,laughing,at,him,all,the,same
the,only,person,in,the,red,keep,who,didn’t,seem,to,find,his,marriage,a,source,of,amusement,was,his,lady,wife
sansa’s,misery,was,deepening,every,day
tyrion,would,gladly,have,broken,through,her,courtesy,to,give,her,what,solace,he,might,but,it,was,no,good
no,words,would,ever,make,him,fair,in,her,eyes
or,any,less,a,lannister
this,was,the,wife,they,had,given,him,for,all,the,rest,of,his,life,and,she,hated,him
and,their,nights,together,in,the,great,bed,were,another,source,of,torment
he,could,no,longer,bear,to,sleep,naked,as,had,been,his,custom
his,wife,was,too,well,trained,ever,to,say,an,unkind,word,but,the,revulsion,in,her,eyes,whenever,she,looked,on,his,body,was,more,than,he,could,bear
tyrion,had,commanded,sansa,to,wear,a,sleeping,shift,as,well
i,want,her,he,realized
i,want,winterfell,yes,but,i,want,her,as,well,child,or,woman,or,whatever,she,is
i,want,to,comfort,her
i,want,to,hear,her,laugh
i,want,her,to,come,to,me,willingly,to,bring,me,her,joys,and,her,sorrows,and,her,lust
his,mouth,twisted,in,a,bitter,smile
yes,and,i,want,to,be,tall,as,jaime,and,as,strong,as,ser,gregor,the,mountain,too,for,all,the,bloody,good,it,does
unbidden,his,thoughts,went,to,shae
tyrion,had,not,wanted,her,to,hear,the,news,from,any,lips,but,his,own,so,he,had,commanded,varys,to,bring,her,to,him,the,night,before,his,wedding
they,met,again,in,the,eunuch’s,chambers,and,when,shae,began,to,undo,the,laces,of,his,jerkin,he’d,caught,her,by,the,wrist,and,pushed,her,away
wait,he,said,there,is,something,you,must,hear
on,the,morrow,i,am,to,be,wed

to,sansa,stark
i,know
he,was,speechless,for,an,instant
even,sansa,did,not,know,not,then
how,could,you,know
did,varys,tell,you
some,page,was,telling,ser,tallad,about,it,when,i,took,lollys,to,the,sept,he,had,it,from,this,serving,girl,who,heard,ser,kevan,talking,to,your,father
she,wriggled,free,of,his,grasp,and,pulled,her,dress,up,over,her,head
as,ever,she,was,naked,underneath
i,don’t,care
she’s,only,a,little,girl
you’ll,give,her,a,big,belly,and,come,back,to,me
some,part,of,him,had,hoped,for,less,indifference
had,hoped,he,jeered,bitterly,but,now,you,know,better,dwarf
shae,is,all,the,love,you’re,ever,like,to,have
muddy,way,was,crowded,but,soldiers,and,townfolk,alike,made,way,for,the,imp,and,his,escort
hollow-eyed,children,swarmed,underfoot,some,looking,up,in,silent,appeal,whilst,others,begged,noisily
tyrion,pulled,a,big,fistful,of,coppers,from,his,purse,and,tossed,them,in,the,air,and,the,children,went,running,for,them,shoving,and,shouting
the,lucky,ones,might,be,able,to,buy,a,heel,of,stale,bread,tonight
he,had,never,seen,markets,so,crowded,and,for,all,the,food,the,tyrells,were,bringing,in,prices,remained,shockingly,high
six,coppers,for,a,melon,a,silver,stag,for,a,bushel,of,corn,a,dragon,for,a,side,of,beef,or,six,skinny,piglets
yet,there,seemed,no,lack,of,buyers
gaunt,men,and,haggard,women,crowded,around,every,wagon,and,stall,while,others,even,more,ragged,looked,on,sullenly,from,the,mouths,of,alleys
this,way,bronn,said,when,they,reached,the,foot,of,the,hook
if,you,still,mean,to

i,do
the,riverfront,had,made,a,convenient,excuse,but,tyrion,had,another,purpose,today
it,was,not,a,task,he,relished,but,it,must,be,done
they,turned,away,from,aegon’s,high,hill,into,the,maze,of,smaller,streets,that,clustered,around,the,foot,of,visenya’s
bronn,led,the,way
once,or,twice,tyrion,glanced,back,over,his,shoulder,to,see,if,they,were,being,followed,but,there,was,nothing,to,be,seen,except,the,usual,rabble,a,carter,beating,his,horse,an,old,woman,throwing,nightsoil,from,her,window,two,little,boys,fighting,with,sticks,three,gold,cloaks,escorting,a,captive
they,all,looked,innocent,but,any,one,of,them,could,be,his,undoing
varys,had,informers,everywhere
they,turned,at,a,corner,and,again,at,the,next,and,rode,slowly,through,a,crowd,of,women,at,a,well
bronn,led,him,along,a,curving,wynd,through,an,alley,under,a,broken,archway
they,cut,through,the,rubble,where,a,house,had,burned,and,walked,their,horses,up,a,shallow,flight,of,stone,steps
the,buildings,were,close,and,poor
bronn,halted,at,the,mouth,of,a,crooked,alley,too,narrow,for,two,to,ride,abreast
there’s,two,jags,and,then,a,dead,end
the,sink,is,in,the,cellar,of,the,last,building
tyrion,swung,down,off,his,horse
see,that,no,one,enters,or,leaves,till,i,return
this,won’t,take,long
his,hand,went,into,his,cloak,to,make,certain,the,gold,was,still,there,in,the,hidden,pocket
thirty,dragons
a,bloody,fortune,for,a,man,like,him
he,waddled,up,the,alley,quickly,anxious,to,be,done,with,this
the,wine,sink,was,a,dismal,place,dark,and,damp,walls,pale,with,niter,the,ceiling,so,low,that,bronn,would,have,had,to,duck,to,keep,from,hitting,his,head,on,the,beams
tyrion,lannister,had,no,such,problem
at,this,hour,the,front,room,was,empty,but,for,a,dead-eyed,woman,who,sat,on,a,stool,behind,a,rough,plank,bar
she,handed,him,a,cup,of,sour,wine,and,said,in,the,back
the,back,room,was,even,darker
a,flickering,candle,burned,on,a,low,table,beside,a,flagon,of,wine
the,man,behind,it,scarce,looked,a,danger,a,short,man,though,all,men,were,tall,to,tyrion,with,thinning,brown,hair,pink,cheeks,and,a,little,pot,pushing,at,the,bone,buttons,of,his,doeskin,jerkin
in,his,soft,hands,he,held,a,twelve-stringed,woodharp,more,deadly,than,a,longsword
tyrion,sat,across,from,him
symon,silver,tongue
the,man,inclined,his,head
he,was,bald,on,top
my,lord,hand,he,said
you,mistake,me
my,father,is,the,king’s,hand
i,am,no,longer,even,a,finger,i,fear
you,shall,rise,again,i,am,sure
a,man,like,you
my,sweet,lady,shae,tells,me,you,are,newly,wed,would,that,you,had,sent,for,me,earlier
i,should,have,been,honored,to,sing,at,your,feast
the,last,thing,my,wife,needs,is,more,songs,said,tyrion
as,for,shae,we,both,know,she,is,no,lady,and,i,would,thank,you,never,to,speak,her,name,aloud
as,the,hand,commands,symon,said
the,last,time,tyrion,had,seen,the,man,a,sharp,word,had,been,enough,to,set,him,sweating,but,it,seemed,the,singer,had,found,some,courage,somewhere
most,like,in,that,flagon
or,perhaps,tyrion,himself,was,to,blame,for,this,new,boldness
i,threatened,him,but,nothing,ever,came,of,the,threat,so,now,he,believes,me,toothless
he,sighed
i,am,told,you,are,a,very,gifted,singer
you,are,most,kind,to,say,so,my,lord
tyrion,gave,him,a,smile
i,think,it,is,time,you,brought,your,music,to,the,free,cities
they,are,great,lovers,of,song,in,braavos,and,pentos,and,lys,and,generous,with,those,who,please,them
he,took,a,sip,of,wine
it,was,foul,stuff,but,strong
a,tour,of,all,nine,cities,would,be,best
you,wouldn’t,want,to,deny,anyone,the,joy,of,hearing,you,sing
a,year,in,each,should,suffice
he,reached,inside,his,cloak,to,where,the,gold,was,hidden
with,the,port,closed,you,will,need,to,go,to,duskendale,to,take,ship,but,my,man,bronn,will,find,a,horse,for,you,and,i,would,be,honored,if,you,would,let,me,pay,your,passage
but,my,lord,the,man,objected,you,have,never,heard,me,sing
pray,listen,a,moment
his,fingers,moved,deftly,over,the,strings,of,the,woodharp,and,soft,music,filled,the,cellar
symon,began,to,sing
he,rode,through,the,streets,of,the,city,down,from,his,hill,on,high,o’er,the,wynds,and,the,steps,and,the,cobbles,he,rode,to,a,woman’s,sigh
for,she,was,his,secret,treasure,she,was,his,shame,and,his,bliss
and,a,chain,and,a,keep,are,nothing,compared,to,a,woman’s,kiss
there’s,more,the,man,said,as,he,broke,off,oh,a,good,deal,more
the,refrain,is,especially,nice,i,think
for,hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman’s,hands,are,warm
enough
tyrion,slid,his,fingers,from,his,cloak,empty
that’s,not,a,song,i,would,care,to,hear,again
ever
no
symon,silver,tongue,put,his,harp,aside,and,took,a,sip,of,wine
a,pity
still,each,man,has,his,song,as,my,old,master,used,to,say,when,he,was,teaching,me,to,play
others,might,like,my,tune,better
the,queen,perhaps
or,your,lord,father
tyrion,rubbed,the,scar,over,his,nose,and,said,my,father,has,no,time,for,singers,and,my,sister,is,not,as,generous,as,one,might,think
a,wise,man,could,earn,more,from,silence,than,from,song
he,could,not,put,it,much,plainer,than,that
symon,seemed,to,take,his,meaning,quick,enough
you,will,find,my,price,modest,my,lord
that’s,good,to,know
this,would,not,be,a,matter,of,thirty,golden,dragons,tyrion,feared
tell,me
at,king,joffrey’s,wedding,feast,the,man,said,there,is,to,be,a,tournament,of,singers
and,jugglers,and,jesters,and,dancing,bears
only,one,dancing,bear,my,lord,said,symon,who,had,plainly,attended,cersei’s,arrangements,with,far,more,interest,than,tyrion,had,but,seven,singers
galyeon,of,cuy,bethany,fair-fingers,aemon,costayne,alaric,of,eysen,hamish,the,harper,collio,quaynis,and,orland,of,oldtown,will,compete,for,a,gilded,lute,with,silver,strings
yet,unaccountably,no,invitation,has,been,forthcoming,for,one,who,is,master,of,them,all
let,me,guess
symon,silver,tongue
symon,smiled,modestly
i,am,prepared,to,prove,the,truth,of,my,boast,before,king,and,court
hamish,is,old,and,oft,forgets,what,he,is,singing
and,collio,with,that,absurd,tyroshi,accent
if,you,understand,one,word,in,three,count,yourself,fortunate
my,sweet,sister,has,arranged,the,feast
even,if,i,could,secure,you,this,invitation,it,might,look,queer
seven,kingdoms,seven,vows,seven,challenges,seventy-seven,dishes
but,eight,singers
what,would,the,high,septon,think
you,did,not,strike,me,as,a,pious,man,my,lord
piety,is,not,the,point
certain,forms,must,be,observed
symon,took,a,sip,of,wine
still
a,singer’s,life,is,not,without,peril
we,ply,our,trade,in,alehouses,and,wine,sinks,before,unruly,drunkards
if,one,of,your,sister’s,seven,should,suffer,some,mishap,i,hope,you,might,consider,me,to,fill,his,place
he,smiled,slyly,inordinately,pleased,with,himself
six,singers,would,be,as,unfortunate,as,eight,to,be,sure
i,will,inquire,after,the,health,of,cersei’s,seven
if,any,of,them,should,be,indisposed,my,man,bronn,will,find,you
very,good,my,lord
symon,might,have,left,it,at,that,but,flushed,with,triumph,he,added,i,shall,sing,the,night,of,king,joffrey’s,wedding
should,it,happen,that,i,am,called,to,court,why,i,will,want,to,offer,the,king,my,very,best,compositions,songs,i,have,sung,a,thousand,times,that,are,certain,to,please
if,i,should,find,myself,singing,in,some,dreary,winesink,though
well,that,would,be,an,apt,occasion,to,try,my,new,song
for,hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman’s,hands,are,warm
that,will,not,be,necessary,said,tyrion
you,have,my,word,as,a,lannister,bronn,will,call,upon,you,soon
very,good,my,lord
the,balding,kettle-bellied,singer,took,up,his,woodharp,again
bronn,was,waiting,with,the,horses,at,the,mouth,of,the,alley
he,helped,tyrion,into,his,saddle
when,do,i,take,the,man,to,duskendale
you,don’t
tyrion,turned,his,horse
give,him,three,days,then,inform,him,that,hamish,the,harper,has,broken,his,arm
tell,him,that,his,clothes,will,never,serve,for,court,so,he,must,be,fitted,for,new,garb,at,once
he’ll,come,with,you,quick,enough
he,grimaced
you,may,want,his,tongue,i,understand,it’s,made,of,silver
the,rest,of,him,should,never,be,found
bronn,grinned
there’s,a,pot,shop,i,know,in,flea,bottom,makes,a,savory,bowl,of,brown
all,kinds,of,meat,in,it,i,hear
make,certain,i,never,eat,there
tyrion,spurred,to,a,trot
he,wanted,a,bath,and,the,hotter,the,better
even,that,modest,pleasure,was,denied,him,however,no,sooner,had,he,returned,to,his,chambers,than,podrick,payne,informed,him,that,he,had,been,summoned,to,the,tower,of,the,hand
his,lordship,wants,to,see,you
the,hand
lord,tywin
i,recall,who,the,hand,is,pod,tyrion,said
i,lost,my,nose,not,my,wits
bronn,laughed
don’t,bite,the,boy’s,head,off,now
why,not
he,never,uses,it
tyrion,wondered,what,he’d,done,now
or,more,like,what,i,have,failed,to,do
a,summons,from,lord,tywin,always,had,teeth,his,father,never,sent,for,him,just,to,share,a,meal,or,a,cup,of,wine,that,was,for,certain
as,he,entered,his,lord,father’s,solar,a,few,moments,later,he,heard,a,voice,saying
cherrywood,for,the,scabbards,bound,in,red,leather,and,ornamented,with,a,row,of,lion’s-head,studs,in,pure,gold
perhaps,with,garnets,for,the,eyes
rubies,lord,tywin,said
garnets,lack,the,fire
tyrion,cleared,his,throat
my,lord
you,sent,for,me
his,father,glanced,up
i,did
come,have,a,look,at,this
a,bundle,of,oilcloth,lay,on,the,table,between,them,and,lord,tywin,had,a,longsword,in,his,hand
a,wedding,gift,for,joffrey,he,told,tyrion
the,light,streaming,through,the,diamond-shaped,panes,of,glass,made,the,blade,shimmer,black,and,red,as,lord,tywin,turned,it,to,inspect,the,edge,while,the,pommel,and,crossguard,flamed,gold
with,this,fool’s,jabber,of,stannis,and,his,magic,sword,it,seemed,to,me,that,we,had,best,give,joffrey,something,extraordinary,as,well
a,king,should,bear,a,kingly,weapon
that’s,much,too,much,sword,for,joff,tyrion,said
he,will,grow,into,it
here,feel,the,weight,of,it
he,offered,the,weapon,hilt,first
the,sword,was,much,lighter,than,he,had,expected
as,he,turned,it,in,his,hand,he,saw,why
only,one,metal,could,be,beaten,so,thin,and,still,have,strength,enough,to,fight,with,and,there,was,no,mistaking,those,ripples,the,mark,of,steel,that,has,been,folded,back,on,itself,many,thousands,of,times
valyrian,steel
yes,lord,tywin,said,in,a,tone,of,deep,satisfaction
at,long,last,father
valyrian,steel,blades,were,scarce,and,costly,yet,thousands,remained,in,the,world,perhaps,two,hundred,in,the,seven,kingdoms,alone
it,had,always,irked,his,father,that,none,belonged,to,house,lannister
the,old,kings,of,the,rock,had,owned,such,a,weapon,but,the,greatsword,brightroar,had,been,lost,when,the,second,king,tommen,carried,it,back,to,valyria,on,his,fool’s,quest
he,had,never,returned,nor,had,uncle,gery,the,youngest,and,most,reckless,of,his,father’s,brothers,who,had,gone,seeking,after,the,lost,sword,some,eight,years,past
thrice,at,least,lord,tywin,had,offered,to,buy,valyrian,longswords,from,impoverished,lesser,houses,but,his,advances,had,always,been,firmly,rebuffed
the,little,lordlings,would,gladly,part,with,their,daughters,should,a,lannister,come,asking,but,they,cherished,their,old,family,swords
tyrion,wondered,where,the,metal,for,this,one,had,come,from
a,few,master,armorers,could,rework,old,valyrian,steel,but,the,secrets,of,its,making,had,been,lost,when,the,doom,came,to,old,valyria
the,colors,are,strange,he,commented,as,he,turned,the,blade,in,the,sunlight
most,valyrian,steel,was,a,grey,so,dark,it,looked,almost,black,as,was,true,here,as,well
but,blended,into,the,folds,was,a,red,as,deep,as,the,grey
the,two,colors,lapped,over,one,another,without,ever,touching,each,ripple,distinct,like,waves,of,night,and,blood,upon,some,steely,shore
how,did,you,get,this,patterning
i’ve,never,seen,anything,like,it
nor,i,my,lord,said,the,armorer
i,confess,these,colors,were,not,what,i,intended,and,i,do,not,know,that,i,could,duplicate,them
your,lord,father,had,asked,for,the,crimson,of,your,house,and,it,was,that,color,i,set,out,to,infuse,into,the,metal
but,valyrian,steel,is,stubborn
these,old,swords,remember,it,is,said,and,they,do,not,change,easily
i,worked,half,a,hundred,spells,and,brightened,the,red,time,and,time,again,but,always,the,color,would,darken,as,if,the,blade,was,drinking,the,sun,from,it
and,some,folds,would,not,take,the,red,at,all,as,you,can,see
if,my,lords,of,lannister,are,displeased,i,will,of,course,try,again,as,many,times,as,you,should,require,but,no,need,lord,tywin,said
this,will,serve
a,crimson,sword,might,flash,prettily,in,the,sun,but,if,truth,be,told,i,like,these,colors,better,said,tyrion
they,have,an,ominous,beauty
and,they,make,this,blade,unique
there,is,no,other,sword,like,it,in,all,the,world,i,should,think
there,is,one
the,armorer,bent,over,the,table,and,unfolded,the,bundle,of,oilcloth,to,reveal,a,second,longsword
tyrion,put,down,joffrey’s,sword,and,took,up,the,other
if,not,twins,the,two,were,at,least,close,cousins
this,one,was,thicker,and,heavier,a,half-inch,wider,and,three,inches,longer,but,they,shared,the,same,fine,clean,lines,and,the,same,distinctive,color,the,ripples,of,blood,and,night
three,fullers,deeply,incised,ran,down,the,second,blade,from,hilt,to,point,the,king’s,sword,had,only,two
joff’s,hilt,was,a,good,deal,more,ornate,the,arms,of,its,crossguard,done,as,lions’,paws,with,ruby,claws,unsheathed,but,both,swords,had,grips,of,finely,tooled,red,leather,and,gold,lions’,heads,for,pommels
magnificent
even,in,hands,as,unskilled,as,tyrion’s,the,blade,felt,alive
i,have,never,felt,better,balance
it,is,meant,for,my,son
no,need,to,ask,which,son
tyrion,placed,jaime’s,sword,back,on,the,table,beside,joffrey’s,wondering,if,robb,stark,would,let,his,brother,live,long,enough,to,wield,it
our,father,must,surely,think,so,else,why,have,this,blade,forged
you,have,done,good,work,master,mott,lord,tywin,told,the,armorer
my,steward,will,see,to,your,payment
and,remember,rubies,for,the,scabbards
i,shall,my,lord
you,are,most,generous
the,man,folded,the,swords,up,in,the,oilcloth,tucked,the,bundle,under,one,arm,and,went,to,his,knee
it,is,an,honor,to,serve,the,king’s,hand
i,shall,deliver,the,swords,the,day,before,the,wedding
see,that,you,do
when,the,guards,had,seen,the,armorer,out,tyrion,clambered,up,onto,a,chair
so
a,sword,for,joff,a,sword,for,jaime,and,not,even,a,dagger,for,the,dwarf
is,that,the,way,of,it,father
the,steel,was,sufficient,for,two,blades,not,three
if,you,have,need,of,a,dagger,take,one,from,the,armory
robert,left,a,hundred,when,he,died
gerion,gave,him,a,gilded,dagger,with,an,ivory,grip,and,a,sapphire,pommel,for,a,wedding,gift,and,half,the,envoys,who,came,to,court,tried,to,curry,favor,by,presenting,his,grace,with,jewel-encrusted,knives,and,silver,inlay,swords
tyrion,smiled
they’d,have,pleased,him,more,if,they’d,presented,him,with,their,daughters
no,doubt
the,only,blade,he,ever,used,was,the,hunting,knife,he,had,from,jon,arryn,when,he,was,a,boy
lord,tywin,waved,a,hand,dismissing,king,robert,and,all,his,knives
what,did,you,find,at,the,riverfront
mud,said,tyrion,and,a,few,dead,things,no,one’s,bothered,to,bury
before,we,can,open,the,port,again,the,blackwater’s,going,to,have,to,be,dredged,the,sunken,ships,broken,up,or,raised
three-quarters,of,the,quays,need,repair,and,some,may,have,to,be,torn,down,and,rebuilt
the,entire,fish,market,is,gone,and,both,the,river,gate,and,the,king’s,gate,are,splintered,from,the,battering,stannis,gave,them,and,should,be,replaced
i,shudder,to,think,of,the,cost
if,you,do,shit,gold,father,find,a,privy,and,get,busy,he,wanted,to,say,but,he,knew,better
you,will,find,whatever,gold,is,required
will,i
where
the,treasury,is,empty,i’ve,told,you,that
we’re,not,done,paying,the,alchemists,for,all,that,wildfire,or,the,smiths,for,my,chain,and,cersei’s,pledged,the,crown,to,pay,half,the,costs,of,joff’s,wedding,seventy-seven,bloody,courses,a,thousand,guests,a,pie,full,of,doves,singers,jugglers
extravagance,has,its,uses
we,must,demonstrate,the,power,and,wealth,of,casterly,rock,for,all,the,realm,to,see
then,perhaps,casterly,rock,should,pay
why
i,have,seen,littlefinger’s,accounts
crown,incomes,are,ten,times,higher,than,they,were,under,aerys
as,are,the,crown’s,expenses
robert,was,as,generous,with,his,coin,as,he,was,with,his,cock
littlefinger,borrowed,heavily
from,you,amongst,others
yes,the,incomes,are,considerable,but,they,are,barely,sufficient,to,cover,the,usury,on,littlefinger’s,loans
will,you,forgive,the,throne’s,debt,to,house,lannister
don’t,be,absurd
then,perhaps,seven,courses,would,suffice
three,hundred,guests,instead,of,a,thousand
i,understand,that,a,marriage,can,be,just,as,binding,without,a,dancing,bear
the,tyrells,would,think,us,niggardly
i,will,have,the,wedding,and,the,waterfront
if,you,cannot,pay,for,them,say,so,and,i,shall,find,a,master,of,coin,who,can
the,disgrace,of,being,dismissed,after,so,short,a,time,was,not,something,tyrion,cared,to,suffer
i,will,find,your,money
you,will,his,father,promised,and,while,you,are,about,it,see,if,you,can,find,your,wife’s,bed,as,well
so,the,talk,has,reached,even,him
i,have,thank,you
it’s,that,piece,of,furniture,between,the,window,and,the,hearth,with,the,velvet,canopy,and,the,mattress,stuffed,with,goose,down
i,am,pleased,you,know,of,it
now,perhaps,you,ought,to,try,and,know,the,woman,who,shares,it,with,you
woman
child,you,mean
has,a,spider,been,whispering,in,your,ear,or,do,i,have,my,sweet,sister,to,thank
considering,the,things,that,went,on,beneath,cersei’s,blankets,you,would,think,she’d,have,the,decency,to,keep,her,nose,out,of,his
tell,me,why,is,it,that,all,of,sansa’s,maids,arc,women,in,cersei’s,service
i,am,sick,of,being,spied,upon,in,my,own,chambers
if,you,mislike,your,wife’s,servants,dismiss,them,and,hire,ones,more,to,your,liking
that,is,your,right
it,is,your,wife’s,maidenhood,that,concerns,me,not,her,maids
this
delicacy,puzzles,me
you,seem,to,have,no,difficulty,bedding,whores
is,the,stark,girl,made,differently
why,do,you,take,so,much,bloody,interest,in,where,i,put,my,cock
tyrion,demanded
sansa,is,too,young
she,is,old,enough,to,be,lady,of,winterfell,once,her,brother,is,dead
claim,her,maidenhood,and,you,will,be,one,step,closer,to,claiming,the,north
get,her,with,child,and,the,prize,is,all,but,won
do,i,need,to,remind,you,that,a,marriage,that,has,not,been,consummated,can,be,set,aside
by,the,high,septon,or,a,council,of,faith
our,present,high,septon,is,a,trained,seal,who,barks,prettily,on,command
moon,boy,is,more,like,to,annul,my,marriage,than,he,is
perhaps,i,should,have,married,sansa,stark,to,moon,boy
he,might,have,known,what,to,do,with,her
tyrion’s,hands,clenched,on,the,arms,of,his,chair
i,have,heard,all,i,mean,to,hear,on,the,subject,of,my,wife’s,maidenhead
but,so,long,as,we,are,discussing,marriage,why,is,it,that,i,hear,nothing,of,my,sister’s,impending,nuptials
as,i,recall,lord,tywin,cut,him,off
mace,tyrell,has,refused,my,offer,to,marry,cersei,to,his,heir,willas
refused,our,sweet,cersei
that,put,tyrion,in,a,much,better,mood
when,i,first,broached,the,match,to,him,lord,tyrell,seemed,well,enough,disposed,his,father,said
a,day,later,all,was,changed
the,old,woman’s,work
she,hectors,her,son,unmercifully
varys,claims,she,told,him,that,your,sister,was,too,old,and,too,used,for,this,precious,one-legged,grandson,of,hers
cersei,must,have,loved,that
he,laughed
lord,tywin,gave,him,a,chilly,look
she,does,not,know
nor,will,she
it,is,better,for,all,of,us,if,the,offer,was,never,made
see,that,you,remember,that,tyrion
the,offer,was,never,made
what,offer
tyrion,rather,suspected,that,lord,tyrell,might,come,to,regret,this,rebuff
your,sister,will,be,wed,the,question,is,to,whom
i,have,several,thoughts,before,he,could,get,to,them,there,was,a,rap,at,the,door,and,a,guardsman,stuck,in,his,head,to,announce,grand,maester,pycelle
he,may,enter,said,lord,tywin
pycelle,tottered,in,on,a,cane,and,stopped,long,enough,to,give,tyrion,a,look,that,would,curdle,milk
his,once-magnificent,white,beard,which,someone,had,unaccountably,shaved,off,was,growing,back,sparse,and,wispy,leaving,him,with,unsightly,pink,wattles,to,dangle,beneath,his,neck
my,lord,hand,the,old,man,said,bowing,as,deeply,as,he,could,without,falling,there,has,been,another,bird,from,castle,black
mayhaps,we,could,consult,privily
there’s,no,need,for,that
lord,tywin,waved,grand,maester,pycelle,to,a,seat
tyrion,may,stay
oooooh,may,i
he,rubbed,his,nose,and,waited
pycelle,cleared,his,throat,which,involved,a,deal,of,coughing,and,hawking
the,letter,is,from,the,same,bowen,marsh,who,sent,the,last
the,castellan
he,writes,that,lord,mormont,has,sent,word,of,wildlings,moving,south,in,vast,numbers
the,lands,beyond,the,wall,cannot,support,vast,numbers,said,lord,tywin,firmly
this,warning,is,not,new
this,last,is,my,lord
mormont,sent,a,bird,from,the,haunted,forest,to,report,that,he,was,under,attack
more,ravens,have,returned,since,but,none,with,letters
this,bowen,marsh,fears,lord,mormont,slain,with,all,his,strength
tyrion,had,rather,liked,old,jeor,mormont,with,his,gruff,manner,and,talking,bird
is,this,certain
he,asked
it,is,not,pycelle,admitted,but,none,of,mormont’s,men,have,returned,as,yet
marsh,fears,the,wildlings,have,killed,them,and,that,the,wall,itself,may,be,attacked,next
he,fumbled,in,his,robe,and,found,the,paper
here,is,his,letter,my,lord,a,plea,to,all,five,kings
he,wants,men,as,many,men,as,we,can,send,him
five,kings
his,father,was,annoyed
there,is,one,king,in,westeros
those,fools,in,black,might,try,and,remember,that,if,they,wish,his,grace,to,heed,them
when,you,reply,tell,him,that,renly,is,dead,and,the,others,are,traitors,and,pretenders
no,doubt,they,will,be,glad,to,learn,it
the,wall,is,a,world,apart,and,news,oft,reaches,them,late
pycelle,bobbed,his,head,up,and,down
what,shall,i,tell,marsh,concerning,the,men,he,begs,for
shall,we,convene,the,council
there,is,no,need
the,night’s,watch,is,a,pack,of,thieves,killers,and,baseborn,churls,but,it,occurs,to,me,that,they,could,prove,otherwise,given,proper,discipline
if,mormont,is,indeed,dead,the,black,brothers,must,choose,a,new,lord,commander
pycelle,gave,tyrion,a,sly,glance
an,excellent,thought,my,lord
i,know,the,very,man

the,black,brothers,choose,their,own,commander,he,reminded,them
lord,slynt,is,new,to,the,wall
i,know,i,sent,him,there
why,should,they,pick,him,over,a,dozen,more,senior,men
because,his,father,said,in,a,tone,that,suggested,tyrion,was,quite,the,simpleton,if,they,do,not,vote,as,they,are,told,their,wall,will,melt,before,it,sees,another,man
yes,that,would,work
tyrion,hitched,forward
janos,slynt,is,the,wrong,man,father
we’d,do,better,with,the,commander,of,the,shadow,tower
or,eastwatch-by-the-sea
the,commander,of,the,shadow,tower,is,a,mallister,of,seagard
eastwatch,is,held,by,an,ironman
neither,would,serve,his,purposes,lord,tywin’s,tone,said,clear,enough

you,yourself,told,me,i,recall,what,i,told,you

he,knew,what,would,happen,if,he,took,the,bow
he,would,miss,the,butt,and,send,the,arrow,sailing,over,the,dike,off,into,the,trees

my,father,saw,me,true
i,have,no,right,to,be,alive,when,so,many,brave,men,are,dead
grenn,was,tending,the,firepit,south,of,the,compound,gate,stripped,to,the,waist,as,he,split,logs
his,face,was,red,with,exertion,the,sweat,steaming,off,his,skin

the,others,get,your,boot,slayer
him,too
it,was,the,mud
please,don’t,call,me,that
why,not
grenn,sounded,honestly,puzzled
it’s,a,good,name,and,you,came,by,it,fairly
pyp,always,teased,grenn,about,being,thick,as,a,castle,wall,so,sam,explained,patiently
it’s,just,a,different,way,of,calling,me,a,coward,he,said,standing,on,his,left,leg,and,wriggling,back,into,his,muddy,boot
they’re,mocking,me,the,same,way,they,mock,bedwyck,by,calling,him,giant’
he’s,not,a,giant,though,said,grenn,and,paul,was,never,small
well,maybe,when,he,was,a,babe,at,the,breast,but,not,after
you,did,slay,the,other,though,so,it’s,not,the,same
i,just
i,never
i,was,scared
no,more,than,me
it’s,only,pyp,who,says,i’m,too,dumb,to,be,frightened
i,get,as,frightened,as,anyone
grenn,bent,to,scoop,up,a,split,log,and,tossed,it,into,the,fire
i,used,to,be,scared,of,jon,whenever,i,had,to,fight,him
he,was,so,quick,and,he,fought,like,he,meant,to,kill,me
the,green,damp,wood,sat,in,the,flames,smoking,before,it,took,fire
i,never,said,though
sometimes,i,think,everyone,is,just,pretending,to,be,brave,and,none,of,us,really,are
maybe,pretending,is,how,you,get,brave,i,don’t,know
let,them,call,you,slayer,who,cares
you,never,liked,ser,alliser,to,call,you,aurochs
he,was,saying,i,was,big,and,stupid
grenn,scratched,at,his,beard
if,pyp,wanted,to,call,me,aurochs,though,he,could
or,you,or,jon
an,aurochs,is,a,fierce,strong,beast,so,that’s,not,so,bad,and,i,am,big,and,getting,bigger
wouldn’t,you,rather,be,sam,the,slayer,than,ser,piggy
why,can’t,i,just,be,samwell,tarly
he,sat,down,heavily,on,a,wet,log,that,grenn,had,yet,to,split
it,was,the,dragonglass,that,slew,it
not,me,the,dragonglass
he,had,told,them
he,had,told,them,all
some,of,them,didn’t,believe,him,he,knew
dirk,had,shown,sam,his,dirk,and,said,i,got,iron,what,do,i,want,with,glass
black,bernarr,and,the,three,garths,made,it,plain,that,they,doubted,his,whole,story,and,rolley,of,sisterton,came,right,out,and,said,more,like,you,stabbed,some,rustling,bushes,and,it,turned,out,to,be,small,paul,taking,a,shit,so,you,came,up,with,a,lie
but,dywen,listened,and,dolorous,edd,and,they,made,sam,and,grenn,tell,the,lord,commander
mormont,frowned,all,through,the,tale,and,asked,pointed,questions,but,he,was,too,cautious,a,man,to,shun,any,possible,advantage
he,asked,sam,for,all,the,dragonglass,in,his,pack,though,that,was,little,enough
whenever,sam,thought,of,the,cache,jon,had,found,buried,beneath,the,fist,it,made,him,want,to,cry
there’d,been,dagger,blades,and,spearheads,and,two,or,three,hundred,arrowheads,at,least
jon,had,made,daggers,for,himself,sam,and,lord,commander,mormont,and,he’d,given,sam,a,spearhead,an,old,broken,horn,and,some,arrowheads
grenn,had,taken,a,handful,of,arrowheads,as,well,but,that,was,all
so,now,all,they,had,was,mormont’s,dagger,and,the,one,sam,had,given,grenn,plus,nineteen,arrows,and,a,tall,hardwood,spear,with,a,black,dragonglass,head
the,sentries,passed,the,spear,along,from,watch,to,watch,while,mormont,had,divided,the,arrows,among,his,best,bowmen
muttering,bill,garth,greyfeather,ronnel,harclay,sweet,donnel,hill,and,alan,of,rosby,had,three,apiece,and,ulmer,had,four
but,even,if,they,made,every,shaft,tell,they’d,soon,be,down,to,fire,arrows,like,all,the,rest
they,had,loosed,hundreds,of,fire,arrows,on,the,fist,yet,still,the,wights,kept,coming
it,will,not,be,enough,sam,thought
craster’s,sloping,palisades,of,mud,and,melting,snow,would,hardly,slow,the,wights,who’d,climbed,the,much,steeper,slopes,of,the,fist,to,swarm,over,the,ringwall
and,instead,of,three,hundred,brothers,drawn,up,in,disciplined,ranks,to,meet,them,the,wights,would,find,forty-one,ragged,survivors,nine,too,badly,hurt,to,fight
forty-four,had,come,straggling,into,craster’s,out,of,the,storm,out,of,the,sixty-odd,who’d,cut,their,way,free,of,the,fist,but,three,of,those,had,died,of,their,wounds,and,bannen,would,soon,make,four
do,you,think,the,wights,are,gone
sam,asked,grenn
why,don’t,they,come,finish,us
they,only,come,when,it’s,cold
yes,said,sam,but,is,it,the,cold,that,brings,the,wights,or,the,wights,that,bring,the,cold
who,cares
grenn’s,axe,sent,wood,chips,flying
they,come,together,that’s,what,matters
hey,now,that,we,know,that,dragonglass,kills,them,maybe,they,won’t,come,at,all
maybe,they’re,frightened,of,us,now
sam,wished,he,could,believe,that,but,it,seemed,to,him,that,when,you,were,dead,fear,had,no,more,meaning,than,pain,or,love,or,duty
he,wrapped,his,hands,around,his,legs,sweating,under,his,layers,of,wool,and,leather,and,fur
the,dragonglass,dagger,had,melted,the,pale,thing,in,the,woods,true
but,grenn,was,talking,like,it,would,do,the,same,to,the,wights
we,don’t,know,that,he,thought
we,don’t,know,anything,really
i,wish,jon,was,here
he,liked,grenn,but,he,couldn’t,talk,to,him,the,same,way
jon,wouldn’t,call,me,slayer,i,know
and,i,could,talk,to,him,about,gilly’s,baby
jon,had,ridden,off,with,qhorin,halfhand,though,and,they’d,had,no,word,of,him,since
he,had,a,dragonglass,dagger,too,but,did,he,think,to,use,it
is,he,lying,dead,and,frozen,in,some,ravine
or,worse,is,he,dead,and,walking
he,could,not,understand,why,the,gods,would,want,to,take,jon,snow,and,bannen,and,leave,him,craven,and,clumsy,as,he,was
he,should,have,died,on,the,fist,where,he’d,pissed,himself,three,times,and,lost,his,sword,besides
and,he,would,have,died,in,the,woods,if,small,paul,had,not,come,along,to,carry,him
i,wish,it,was,all,a,dream
then,i,could,wake,up
how,flne,that,would,be,to,wake,back,on,the,fist,of,the,first,men,with,all,his,brothers,still,around,him,even,jon,and,ghost
or,even,better,to,wake,in,castle,black,behind,the,wall,and,go,to,the,common,room,for,a,bowl,of,three-finger,hobb’s,thick,cream,of,wheat,with,a,big,spoon,of,butter,melting,in,the,middle,and,a,dollop,of,honey,besides
just,the,thought,of,it,made,his,empty,stomach,rumble

wherever,the,raven,went,mormont,soon,followed
the,lord,commander,emerged,from,beneath,the,trees,mounted,on,his,garron,between,old,dywen,and,the,fox-faced,ranger,ronnel,harclay,who’d,been,raised,to,thoren,smallwood’s,place
the,spearmen,at,the,gate,shouted,a,challenge,and,the,old,bear,returned,a,gruff,who,in,seven,hells,do,you,think,goes,there

he,rode,between,the,gateposts,one,bearing,a,ram’s,skull,and,the,other,the,skull,of,a,bear,then,reined,up,raised,a,fist,and,whistled
the,raven,came,flapping,down,at,his,call
my,lord,sam,heard,ronnel,harclay,say,we,have,only,twenty-two,mounts,and,i,doubt,half,will,reach,the,wall
i,know,that,mormont,grumbled
we,must,go,all,the,same
craster’s,made,that,plain
he,glanced,to,the,west,where,a,bank,of,dark,clouds,hid,the,sun
the,gods,gave,us,a,respite,but,for,how,long
mormont,swung,down,from,the,saddle,jolting,his,raven,back,into,the,air

the,children,of,the,forest,are,all,dead,said,mormont

a,huge,firepit,had,been,dug,in,the,center,of,the,earthen,floor,and,its,flames,rose,swirling,and,crackling,toward,the,smoke-stained,ceiling
the,walls,were,equal,parts,stone,and,soil,with,huge,white,roots,twisting,through,them,like,a,thousand,slow,pale,snakes
people,were,emerging,from,between,those,roots,as,she,watched,edging,out,from,the,shadows,for,a,look,at,the,captives,stepping,from,the,mouths,of,pitch-black,tunnels,popping,out,of,crannies,and,crevices,on,all,sides
in,one,place,on,the,far,side,of,the,fire,the,roots,formed,a,kind,of,stairway,up,to,a,hollow,in,the,earth,where,a,man,sat,almost,lost,in,the,tangle,of,weirwood

something,tom,said,made,him,look,at,her,and,arya,thought,he,was,about,to,come,over,to,her
only,then,the,mad,huntsman,appeared,shoving,his,captive,down,into,the,light,and,she,and,gendry,were,forgotten
the,huntsman,had,turned,out,to,be,a,stocky,man,in,patched,tan,leathers,balding,and,weak-chinned,and,quarrelsome
at,stoney,sept,she,had,thought,that,lem,and,greenbeard,might,be,torn,to,pieces,when,they,faced,him,at,the,crow,cages,to,claim,his,captive,for,the,lightning,lord
the,hounds,had,been,all,around,them,sniffing,and,snarling

the,mad,huntsman,had,cursed,them,all,for,lickspittles,but,finally,he,had,agreed,to,take,his,prize,to,lord,beric,for,judgment
they,had,bound,his,wrists,with,hempen,rope,strung,a,noose,around,his,neck,and,pulled,a,sack,down,over,his,head,but,even,so,there,was,danger,in,the,man

the,flaming,sword,leapt,up,to,meet,the,cold,one,long,streamers,of,fire,trailing,in,its,wake,like,the,ribbons,the,hound,had,spoken,of

toward,the,sullen,red,blaze,of,the,firepit
clegane,gave,ground,until,he,felt,the,heat,at,his,back
a,quick,glance,over,his,shoulder,showed,him,what,was,behind,him,and,almost,cost,him,his,head,when,lord,beric,attacked,anew
arya,could,see,the,whites,of,sandor,clegane’s,eyes,as,he,bulled,his,way,forward,again
three,steps,up,and,two,back,a,move,to,the,left,that,lord,beric,blocked,two,more,forward,and,one,back,clang,and,clang,and,the,big,oaken,shields,took,blow,after,blow,after,blow

in,one,wild,flurry,the,lightning,lord,took,back,all,the,ground,the,hound,had,gained,sending,clegane,staggering,to,the,very,edge,of,the,firepit,once,more
he,is,he,is,he’s,going,to,die

he,charged,swinging,the,heavy,sword,harder,and,harder,trying,to,smash,the,smaller,man,down,with,brute,force,to,break,blade,or,shield,or,arm
but,the,flames,of,dondarrion’s,parries,snapped,at,his,eyes,and,when,the,hound,jerked,away,from,them,his,foot,went,out,from,under,him,and,he,staggered,to,one,knee
at,once,lord,beric,closed,his,downcut,screaming,through,the,air,trailing,pennons,of,fire
panting,from,exertion,clegane,jerked,his,shield,up,over,his,head,just,in,time,and,the,cave,rang,with,the,loud,crack,of,splintering,oak
his,shield,is,afire,gendry,said,in,a,hushed,voice
arya,saw,it,in,the,same,instant
the,flames,had,spread,across,the,chipped,yellow,paint,and,the,three,black,dogs,were,engulfed
sandor,clegane,had,fought,his,way,back,to,his,feet,with,a,reckless,counterattack
not,until,lord,beric,retreated,a,pace,did,the,hound,seem,to,realize,that,the,fire,that,roared,so,near,his,face,was,his,own,shield,burning
with,a,shout,of,revulsion,he,hacked,down,savagely,on,the,broken,oak,completing,its,destruction
the,shield,shattered,one,piece,of,it,spinning,away,still,afire,while,the,other,clung,stubbornly,to,his,forearm
his,efforts,to,free,himself,only,fanned,the,flames
his,sleeve,caught,and,now,his,whole,left,arm,was,ablaze

lord,beric,blocked,the,cut,easily
noooooo,arya,shrieked

but,the,burning,sword,snapped,in,two,and,the,hound’s,cold,steel,plowed,into,lord,beric’s,flesh,where,his,shoulder,joined,his,neck,and,clove,him,clean,down,to,the,breastbone
the,blood,came,rushing,out,in,a,hot,black,gush
sandor,clegane,jerked,backward,still,burning
he,ripped,the,remnants,of,his,shield,off,and,flung,them,away,with,a,curse,then,rolled,in,the,dirt,to,smother,the,fire,running,along,his,arm
lord,beric’s,knees,folded,slowly,as,if,for,prayer

the,dirt,drank,his,blood
beneath,the,hollow,hill,there,was,no,sound,but,the,soft,crackling,of,flames,and,the,whimper,the,hound,made,when,he,tried,to,rise
arya,could,only,think,of,mycah,and,all,the,stupid,prayers,she’d,prayed,for,the,hound,to,die

catelyn,let,the,kings,of,winter,have,their,cold,crypt,under,the,earth,catelyn,thought
the,tullys,drew,their,strength,from,the,river,and,it,was,to,the,river,they,returned,when,their,lives,had,run,their,course
they,laid,lord,hoster,in,a,slender,wooden,boat,clad,in,shining,silver,armor,plate-and-mail
his,cloak,was,spread,beneath,him,rippling,blue,and,red
his,surcoat,was,divided,blue-and-red,as,well
a,trout,scaled,in,silver,and,bronze,crowned,the,crest,of,the,greathelm,they,placed,beside,his,head

his,massive,oak-and-iron,shield,was,set,by,his,left,side,his,hunting,horn,to,his,right
the,rest,of,the,boat,was,filled,with,driftwood,and,kindling,and,scraps,of,parchment,and,stones,to,make,it,heavy,in,the,water

forty,soldiers,rode,in,his,escort,commanded,by,walder,rivers,the,eldest,of,lord,walder’s,bastard,brood,a,stern,grey-haired,man,with,a,formidable,reputation,as,a,warrior
their,arrival,coming,within,hours,of,lord,hoster’s,passing,had,sent,edmure,into,a,rage
walder,frey,should,be,flayed,and,quartered
he’d,shouted
he,sends,a,cripple,and,a,bastard,to,treat,with,us,tell,me,there,is,no,insult,meant,by,that
i,have,no,doubt,that,lord,walder,chose,his,envoys,with,care,she,replied
it,was,a,peevish,thing,to,do,a,petty,sort,of,revenge,but,remember,who,we,are,dealing,with
the,late,lord,frey,father,used,to,call,him
the,man,is,ill-tempered,envious,and,above,all,prideful
blessedly,her,son,had,shown,better,sense,than,her,brother
robb,had,greeted,the,freys,with,every,courtesy,found,barracks,space,for,the,escort,and,quietly,asked,ser,desmond,grell,to,stand,aside,so,lothar,might,have,the,honor,of,helping,to,send,lord,hoster,on,his,last,voyage
he,has,learned,a,rough,wisdom,beyond,his,years,my,son
house,frey,might,have,abandoned,the,king,in,the,north,but,the,lord,of,the,crossing,remained,the,most,powerful,of,riverrun’s,bannermen,and,lothar,was,here,in,his,stead
the,seven,launched,lord,hoster,from,the,water,stair,wading,down,the,steps,as,the,portcullis,was,winched,upward
lothar,frey,a,soft-bodied,portly,man,was,breathing,heavily,as,they,shoved,the,boat,out,into,the,current
jason,mallister,and,tytos,blackwood,at,the,prow,stood,chest,deep,in,the,river,to,guide,it,on,its,way
catelyn,watched,from,the,battlements,waiting,and,watching,as,she,had,waited,and,watched,so,many,times,before
beneath,her,the,swift,wild,tumblestone,plunged,like,a,spear,into,the,side,of,the,broad,red,fork,its,blue-white,current,churning,the,muddy,red-brown,flow,of,the,greater,river
a,morning,mist,hung,over,the,water,as,thin,as,gossamer,and,the,wisps,of,memory
bran,and,rickon,will,be,waiting,for,him,catelyn,thought,sadly,as,once,i,used,to,wait
the,slim,boat,drifted,out,from,under,the,red,stone,arch,of,the,water,gate,picking,up,speed,as,it,was,caught,in,the,headlong,rush,of,the,tumblestone,and,pushed,out,into,the,tumult,where,the,waters,met
as,the,boat,emerged,from,beneath,the,high,sheltering,walls,of,the,castle,its,square,sail,filled,with,wind,and,catelyn,saw,sunlight,flashing,on,her,father’s,helm
lord,hoster,tully’s,rudder,held,true,and,he,sailed,serenely,down,the,center,of,the,channel,into,the,rising,sun
now,her,uncle,urged
beside,him,her,brother,edmure,lord,edmure,now,in,truth,and,how,long,would,that,take,to,grow,used,to,nocked,an,arrow,to,his,bowstring
his,squire,held,a,brand,to,its,point
edmure,waited,until,the,flame,caught,then,lifted,the,great,bow,drew,the,string,to,his,ear,and,let,fly
with,a,deep,thrum,the,arrow,sped,upward
catelyn,followed,its,flight,with,her,eyes,and,heart,until,it,plunged,into,the,water,with,a,soft,hiss,well,astern,of,lord,hoster’s,boat
edmure,cursed,softly
the,wind,he,said,pulling,a,second,arrow
again
the,brand,kissed,the,oil-soaked,rag,behind,the,arrowhead,the,flames,went,licking,up,edmure,lifted,pulled,and,released
high,and,far,the,arrow,flew
too,far
it,vanished,in,the,river,a,dozen,yards,beyond,the,boat,its,fire,winking,out,in,an,instant
a,flush,was,creeping,up,edmure’s,neck,red,as,his,beard
once,more,he,commanded,taking,a,third,arrow,from,the,quiver
he,is,as,tight,as,his,bowstring,catelyn,thought
ser,brynden,must,have,seen,the,same,thing
let,me,my,lord,he,offered
i,can,do,it,edmure,insisted
he,let,them,light,the,arrow,jerked,the,bow,up,took,a,deep,breath,drew,back,the,arrow
for,a,long,moment,he,seemed,to,hesitate,while,the,fire,crept,up,the,shaft,crackling
finally,he,released
the,arrow,flashed,up,and,up,and,finally,curved,down,again,falling,falling
and,hissing,past,the,billowing,sail
a,narrow,miss,no,more,than,a,handspan,and,yet,a,miss
the,others,take,it
her,brother,swore
the,boat,was,almost,out,of,range,drifting,in,and,out,among,the,river,mists
wordless,edmure,thrust,the,bow,at,his,uncle
swiftly,ser,brynden,said,he,nocked,an,arrow,held,it,steady,for,the,brand,drew,and,released,before,catelyn,was,quite,sure,that,the,fire,had,caught
but,as,the,shot,rose,she,saw,the,flames,trailing,through,the,air,a,pale,orange,pennon
the,boat,had,vanished,in,the,mists
falling,the,flaming,arrow,was,swallowed,up,as,well
but,only,for,a,heartbeat
then,sudden,as,hope,they,saw,the,red,bloom,flower
the,sails,took,fire,and,the,fog,glowed,pink,and,orange
for,a,moment,catelyn,saw,the,outline,of,the,boat,clearly,wreathed,in,leaping,flames
watch,for,me,little,cat,she,could,hear,him,whisper
catelyn,reached,out,blindly,groping,for,her,brother’s,hand,but,edmure,had,moved,away,to,stand,alone,on,the,highest,point,of,the,battlements
her,uncle,brynden,took,her,hand,instead,twining,his,strong,fingers,through,hers
together,they,watched,the,little,fire,grow,smaller,as,the,burning,boat,receded,in,the,distance
and,then,it,was,gone
drifting,downriver,still,perhaps,or,broken,up,and,sinking
the,weight,of,his,armor,would,carry,lord,hoster,down,to,rest,in,the,soft,mud,of,the,riverbed,in,the,watery,halls,where,the,tullys,held,eternal,court,with,schools,of,fish,their,last,attendants
no,sooner,had,the,burning,boat,vanished,from,their,sight,than,edmure,walked,off
catelyn,would,have,liked,to,embrace,him,if,only,for,a,moment,to,sit,for,an,hour,or,a,night,or,the,turn,of,a,moon,to,speak,of,the,dead,and,mourn
yet,she,knew,as,well,as,he,that,this,was,not,the,time,he,was,lord,of,riverrun,now,and,his,knights,were,falling,in,around,him,murmuring,condolences,and,promises,of,fealty,walling,him,off,from,something,as,small,as,a,sister’s,grief
edmure,listened,hearing,none,of,the,words
it,is,no,disgrace,to,miss,your,shot,her,uncle,told,her,quietly
edmure,should,hear,that
the,day,my,own,lord,father,went,downriver,hoster,missed,as,well
with,his,first,shaft
catelyn,had,been,too,young,to,remember,but,lord,hoster,had,often,told,the,tale
his,second,found,the,sail
she,sighed
edmure,was,not,as,strong,as,he,seemed
their,father’s,death,had,been,a,mercy,when,it,came,at,last,but,even,so,her,brother,had,taken,it,hard
last,night,in,his,cups,he,had,broken,down,and,wept,full,of,regrets,for,things,undone,and,words,unsaid
he,ought,never,to,have,ridden,off,to,fight,his,battle,on,the,fords,he,told,her,tearfully,he,should,have,stayed,at,their,father’s,bedside
i,should,have,been,with,him,as,you,were,he,said
did,he,speak,of,me,at,the,end
tell,me,true,cat
did,he,ask,for,me
lord,hoster’s,last,word,had,been,tansy,but,catelyn,could,not,bring,herself,to,tell,him,that
he,whispered,your,name,she,lied,and,her,brother,had,nodded,gratefully,and,kissed,her,hand
if,he,had,not,tried,to,drown,his,grief,and,guilt,he,might,have,been,able,to,bend,a,bow,she,thought,to,herself,sighing,but,that,was,something,else,she,dare,not,say
the,blackfish,escorted,her,down,from,the,battlements,to,where,robb,stood,among,his,bannermen,his,young,queen,at,his,side
when,he,saw,her,her,son,took,her,silently,in,his,arms
lord,hoster,looked,as,noble,as,a,king,my,lady,murmured,jeyne
would,that,i,had,been,given,the,chance,to,know,him
and,i,to,know,him,better,added,robb
he,would,have,wished,that,too,said,catelyn
there,were,too,many,leagues,between,riverrun,and,winterfell
and,too,many,mountains,and,rivers,and,armies,between,riverrun,and,the,eyrie,it,would,seem
lysa,had,made,no,reply,to,her,letter
and,from,king’s,landing,came,only,silence,as,well
by,now,she,had,hoped,that,brienne,and,ser,cleos,would,have,reached,the,city,with,their,captive
it,might,even,be,that,brienne,was,on,her,way,back,and,the,girls,with,her
ser,cleos,swore,he,would,make,the,imp,send,a,raven,once,the,trade,was,made
he,swore,it
ravens,did,not,always,win,through
some,bowman,could,have,brought,the,bird,down,and,roasted,him,for,supper
the,letter,that,would,have,set,her,heart,at,ease,might,even,now,be,lying,by,the,ashes,of,some,campfire,beside,a,pile,of,raven,bones
others,were,waiting,to,offer,robb,their,consolations,so,catelyn,stood,aside,patiently,while,lord,jason,mallister,the,greatjon,and,ser,rolph,spicer,spoke,to,him,each,in,turn
but,when,lothar,frey,approached,she,gave,his,sleeve,a,tug
robb,turned,and,waited,to,hear,what,lothar,would,say
your,grace
a,plump,man,in,his,middle,thirties,lothar,frey,had,close-set,eyes,a,pointed,beard,and,dark,hair,that,fell,to,his,shoulders,in,ringlets
a,leg,twisted,at,birth,had,earned,him,the,name,lame,lothar
he,had,served,as,his,father’s,steward,for,the,past,dozen,years
we,are,loath,to,intrude,upon,your,grief,but,perhaps,you,might,grant,us,audience,tonight
it,would,be,my,pleasure,said,robb
it,was,never,my,wish,to,sow,enmity,between,us
nor,mine,to,be,the,cause,of,it,said,queen,jeyne
lothar,frey,smiled
i,understand,as,does,my,lord,father
he,instructed,me,to,say,that,he,was,young,once,and,well,remembers,what,it,is,like,to,lose,one’s,heart,to,beauty
catelyn,doubted,very,much,that,lord,walder,had,said,any,such,thing,or,that,he,had,ever,lost,his,heart,to,beauty
the,lord,of,the,crossing,had,outlived,seven,wives,and,was,now,wed,to,his,eighth,but,he,spoke,of,them,only,as,bedwarmers,and,brood,mares
still,the,words,were,fairly,spoken,and,she,could,scarce,object,to,the,compliment
nor,did,robb
your,father,is,most,gracious,he,said
i,shall,look,forward,to,our,talk
lothar,bowed,kissed,the,queen’s,hand,and,withdrew
by,then,a,dozen,others,had,gathered,for,a,word
robb,spoke,with,them,each,giving,a,thanks,here,a,smile,there,as,needed
only,when,the,last,of,them,was,done,did,he,turn,back,to,catelyn
there,is,something,we,must,speak,of
will,you,walk,with,me
as,you,command,your,grace
that,wasn’t,a,command,mother
it,will,be,my,pleasure,then
her,son,had,treated,her,kindly,enough,since,returning,to,riverrun,yet,he,seldom,sought,her,out
if,he,was,more,comfortable,with,his,young,queen,she,could,scarcely,blame,him
jeyne,makes,him,smile,and,i,have,nothing,to,share,with,him,but,grief
he,seemed,to,enjoy,the,company,of,his,bride’s,brothers,as,well,young,rollam,his,squire,and,ser,raynald,his,standard-bearer
they,are,standing,in,the,boots,of,those,he’s,lost,catelyn,realized,when,she,watched,them,together
rollam,has,taken,bran’s,place,and,raynald,is,part,theon,and,part,jon,snow
only,with,the,westerlings,did,she,see,robb,smile,or,hear,him,laugh,like,the,boy,he,was
to,the,others,he,was,always,the,king,in,the,north,head,bowed,beneath,the,weight,of,the,crown,even,when,his,brows,were,bare
robb,kissed,his,wife,gently,promised,to,see,her,in,their,chambers,and,went,off,with,his,lady,mother
his,steps,led,them,toward,the,godswood
lothar,seemed,amiable,that’s,a,hopeful,sign
we,need,the,freys
that,does,not,mean,we,shall,have,them
he,nodded,and,there,was,glumness,to,his,face,and,a,slope,to,his,shoulders,that,made,her,heart,go,out,to,him
the,crown,is,crushing,him,she,thought
he,wants,so,much,to,be,a,good,king,to,be,brave,and,honorable,and,clever,but,the,weight,is,too,much,for,a,boy,to,bear
robb,was,doing,all,he,could,yet,still,the,blows,kept,falling,one,after,the,other,relentless
when,they,brought,him,word,of,the,battle,at,duskendale,where,lord,randyll,tarly,had,shattered,robett,glover,and,ser,helman,tallhart,he,might,have,been,expected,to,rage
instead,he’d,stared,in,dumb,disbelief,and,said,duskendale,on,the,narrow,sea
why,would,they,go,to,duskendale
he’d,shook,his,head,bewildered
a,third,of,my,foot,lost,for,duskendale
the,ironmen,have,my,castle,and,now,the,lannisters,hold,my,brother,galbart,glover,said,in,a,voice,thick,with,despair
robett,glover,had,survived,the,battle,but,had,been,captured,near,the,kingsroad,not,long,after
not,for,long,her,son,promised
i,will,offer,them,martyn,lannister,in,exchange
lord,tywin,will,have,to,accept,for,his,brother’s,sake
martyn,was,ser,kevan’s,son,a,twin,to,the,willem,that,lord,karstark,had,butchered
those,murders,still,haunted,her,son,catelyn,knew
he,had,tripled,the,guard,around,martyn,but,still,feared,for,his,safety
i,should,have,traded,the,kingslayer,for,sansa,when,you,first,urged,it,robb,said,as,they,walked,the,gallery
if,i’d,offered,to,wed,her,to,the,knight,of,flowers,the,tyrells,might,be,ours,instead,of,joffrey’s
i,should,have,thought,of,that
your,mind,was,on,your,battles,and,rightly,so
even,a,king,cannot,think,of,everything
battles,muttered,robb,as,he,led,her,out,beneath,the,trees
i,have,won,every,battle,yet,somehow,i’m,losing,the,war
he,looked,up,as,if,the,answer,might,be,written,on,the,sky
the,ironmen,hold,winterfell,and,moat,cailin,too
father’s,dead,and,bran,and,rickon,maybe,arya
and,now,your,father,too
she,could,not,let,him,despair
she,knew,the,taste,of,that,draught,too,well,herself
my,father,has,been,dying,for,a,long,time
you,could,not,have,changed,that
you,have,made,mistakes,robb,but,what,king,has,not
ned,would,have,been,proud,of,you
mother,there,is,something,you,must,know
catelyn’s,heart,skipped,a,beat
this,is,something,he,hates
something,he,dreads,to,tell,me
all,she,could,think,of,was,brienne,and,her,mission
is,it,the,kingslayer
no
it’s,sansa
she’s,dead,catelyn,thought,at,once
brienne,failed,jaime,is,dead,and,cersei,has,killed,my,sweet,girl,in,retribution

sansa,and,arya,both
we,would,have,them,back,if,we,returned,his,precious,jaime,he,swore,it,before,the,whole,court
how,could,he,marry,her,after,saying,that,in,sight,of,gods,and,men
he’s,the,kingslayer’s,brother
oathbreaking,runs,in,their,blood
robb’s,fingers,brushed,the,pommel,of,his,sword
if,i,could,i’d,take,his,ugly,head,off
sansa,would,be,a,widow,then,and,free
there’s,no,other,way,that,i,can,see
they,made,her,speak,the,vows,before,a,septon,and,don,a,crimson,cloak
catelyn,remembered,the,twisted,little,man,she,had,seized,at,the,crossroads,inn,and,carried,all,the,way,to,the,eyrie
i,should,have,let,lysa,push,him,out,her,moon,door
my,poor,sweet,sansa
why,would,anyone,do,this,to,her
for,winterfell,robb,said,at,once

suddenly,catelyn,was,full,of,dread
wars,need,not,be,fought,until,the,last,drop,of,blood
even,she,could,hear,the,desperation,in,her,voice
you,would,not,be,the,first,king,to,bend,the,knee,nor,even,the,first,stark

to,make,a,peace,with,the,lannisters
i,freed,jaime,for,sansa’s,sake

it,was,an,effort,to,remind,herself,how,frightened,and,alone,he,must,feel
you,are,king,in,the,north,the,choice,is,yours
i,only,ask,that,you,think,on,what,i’ve,said
the,singers,make,much,of,kings,who,die,valiantly,in,battle,but,your,life,is,worth,more,than,a,song
to,me,at,least,who,gave,it,to,you
she,lowered,her,head
do,i,have,your,leave,to,go
yes
he,turned,away,and,drew,his,sword
what,he,meant,to,do,with,it,she,could,not,say
there,was,no,enemy,there,no,one,to,fight
only,her,and,him,amongst,tall,trees,and,fallen,leaves
there,are,fights,no,sword,can,win,catelyn,wanted,to,tell,him,but,she,feared,the,king,was,deaf,to,such,words
hours,later,she,was,sewing,in,her,bedchamber,when,young,rollam,westerling,came,running,with,the,summons,to,supper
good,catelyn,thought,relieved
she,had,not,been,certain,that,her,son,would,want,her,there,after,their,quarrel
a,dutiful,squire,she,said,to,rollam,gravely
bran,would,have,been,the,same
if,robb,seemed,cool,at,table,and,edmure,surly,lame,lothar,made,up,for,them,both
he,was,the,model,of,courtesy,reminiscing,warmly,about,lord,hoster,offering,catelyn,gentle,condolences,on,the,loss,of,bran,and,rickon,praising,edmure,for,the,victory,at,stone,mill,and,thanking,robb,for,the,swift,sure,justice,he,had,meted,out,to,rickard,karstark
lothar’s,bastard,brother,walder,rivers,was,another,matter,a,harsh,sour,man,with,old,lord,walder’s,suspicious,face,he,spoke,but,seldom,and,devoted,most,of,his,attention,to,the,meat,and,mead,that,was,set,before,him
when,all,the,empty,words,were,said,the,queen,and,the,other,westerlings,excused,themselves,the,remains,of,the,meal,were,cleared,away,and,lothar,frey,cleared,his,throat
before,we,turn,to,the,business,that,brings,us,here,there,is,another,matter,he,said,solemnly
a,grave,matter,i,fear
i,had,hoped,it,would,not,fall,to,me,to,bring,you,these,tidings,but,it,seems,i,must
my,lord,father,has,had,a,letter,from,his,grandsons
catelyn,had,been,so,lost,in,grief,for,her,own,that,she,had,almost,forgotten,the,two,freys,she,had,agreed,to,foster
no,more,she,thought
mother,have,mercy,how,many,more,blows,can,we,bear
somehow,she,knew,the,next,words,she,heard,would,plunge,yet,another,blade,into,her,heart
the,grandsons,at,winterfell
she,made,herself,ask
my,wards
walder,and,walder,yes
but,they,are,presently,at,the,dreadfort,my,lady
i,grieve,to,tell,you,this,but,there,has,been,a,battle
winterfell,is,burned
burned
robb’s,voice,was,incredulous
your,northern,lords,tried,to,retake,it,from,the,ironmen
when,theon,greyjoy,saw,that,his,prize,was,lost,he,put,the,castle,to,the,torch
we,have,heard,naught,of,any,battle,said,ser,brynden
my,nephews,are,young,i,grant,you,but,they,were,there
big,walder,wrote,the,letter,though,his,cousin,signed,as,well
it,was,a,bloody,bit,of,business,by,their,account
your,castellan,was,slain
ser,rodrik,was,that,his,name
ser,rodrik,cassel,said,catelyn,numbly
that,dear,brave,loyal,old,soul
she,could,almost,see,him,tugging,on,his,fierce,white,whiskers
what,of,our,other,people
the,ironmen,put,many,of,them,to,the,sword,i,fear
wordless,with,rage,robb,slammed,a,fist,down,on,the,table,and,turned,his,face,away,so,the,freys,would,not,see,his,tears
but,his,mother,saw,them
the,world,grows,a,little,darker,every,day
catelyn’s,thoughts,went,to,ser,rodrik’s,little,daughter,beth,to,tireless,maester,luwin,and,cheerful,septon,chayle,mikken,at,the,forge,farlen,and,palla,in,the,kennels,old,nan,and,simple,hodor

no,said,lame,lothar
the,women,and,children,hid,my,nephews,walder,and,walder,among,them
with,winterfell,in,ruins,the,survivors,were,carried,back,to,the,dreadfort,by,this,son,of,lord,bolton’s
bolton’s,son
robb’s,voice,was,strained
walder,rivers,spoke,up
a,bastard,son,i,believe
not,ramsay,snow
does,lord,roose,have,another,bastard
robb,scowled
this,ramsay,was,a,monster,and,a,murderer,and,he,died,a,coward
or,so,i,was,told
i,cannot,speak,to,that
there,is,much,confusion,in,any,war
many,false,reports
all,i,can,tell,you,is,that,my,nephews,claim,it,was,this,bastard,son,of,bolton’s,who,saved,the,women,of,winterfell,and,the,little,ones
they,are,safe,at,the,dreadfort,now,all,those,who,remain
theon,robb,said,suddenly
what,happened,to,theon,greyjoy
was,he,slain
lame,lothar,spread,his,hands
that,i,cannot,say,your,grace
walder,and,walder,made,no,mention,of,his,fate
perhaps,lord,bolton,might,know,if,he,has,had,word,from,this,son,of,his
ser,brynden,said,we,will,be,certain,to,ask,him
you,are,all,distraught,i,see
i,am,sorry,to,have,brought,you,such,fresh,grief
perhaps,we,should,adjourn,until,the,morrow
our,business,can,wait,until,you,have,composed,yourselves
no,said,robb,i,want,the,matter,settled
her,brother,edmure,nodded
me,as,well
do,you,have,an,answer,to,our,offer,my,lord
i,do
lothar,smiled
my,lord,father,bids,me,tell,your,grace,that,he,will,agree,to,this,new,marriage,alliance,between,our,houses,and,renew,his,fealty,to,the,king,in,the,north,upon,the,condition,that,the,king’s,grace,apologize,for,the,insult,done,to,house,frey,in,his,royal,person,face,to,face
an,apology,was,a,small,enough,price,to,pay,but,catelyn,misliked,this,petty,condition,of,lord,walder’s,at,once
i,am,pleased,robb,said,cautiously
it,was,never,my,wish,to,cause,this,rift,between,us,lothar
the,freys,have,fought,valiantly,for,my,cause
i,would,have,them,at,my,side,once,more
you,are,too,kind,your,grace
as,you,accept,these,terms,i,am,then,instructed,to,offer,lord,tully,the,hand,of,my,sister,the,lady,roslin,a,maid,of,sixteen,years
roslin,is,my,lord,father’s,youngest,daughter,by,lady,bethany,of,house,rosby,his,sixth,wife
she,has,a,gentle,nature,and,a,gift,for,music
edmure,shifted,in,his,seat
might,not,it,be,better,if,i,first,met,you’ll,meet,when,you’re,wed,said,walder,rivers,curtly
unless,lord,tully,feels,a,need,to,count,her,teeth,first
edmure,kept,his,temper
i,will,take,your,word,so,far,as,her,teeth,are,concerned,but,it,would,be,pleasant,if,i,might,gaze,upon,her,face,before,i,espoused,her
you,must,accept,her,now,my,lord,said,walder,rivers
else,my,father’s,offer,is,withdrawn
lame,lothar,spread,his,hands
my,brother,has,a,soldier’s,bluntness,but,what,he,says,is,true
it,is,my,lord,father’s,wish,that,this,marriage,take,place,at,once
at,once
edmure,sounded,so,unhappy,that,catelyn,had,the,unworthy,thought,that,perhaps,he,had,been,entertaining,notions,of,breaking,the,betrothal,after,the,fighting,was,done
has,lord,walder,forgotten,that,we,are,fighting,a,war
brynden,blackfish,asked,sharply
scarcely,said,lothar
that,is,why,he,insists,that,the,marriage,take,place,now,ser
men,die,in,war,even,men,who,are,young,and,strong
what,would,become,of,our,alliance,should,lord,edmure,fall,before,he,took,roslin,to,bride
and,there,is,my,father’s,age,to,consider,as,well
he,is,past,ninety,and,not,like,to,see,the,end,of,this,struggle
it,would,put,his,noble,heart,at,peace,if,he,could,see,his,dear,roslin,safely,wed,before,the,gods,take,him,so,he,might,die,with,the,knowledge,that,the,girl,had,a,strong,husband,to,cherish,and,protect,her
we,all,want,lord,walder,to,die,happy
catelyn,was,growing,less,and,less,comfortable,with,this,arrangement
my,brother,has,just,lost,his,own,father
he,needs,time,to,mourn
roslin,is,a,cheerful,girl,said,lothar
she,may,be,the,very,thing,lord,edmure,needs,to,help,him,through,his,grief
and,my,grandfather,has,come,to,mislike,lengthy,betrothals,the,bastard,walder,rivers,added
i,cannot,imagine,why
robb,gave,him,a,chilly,look
i,take,your,meaning,rivers
pray,excuse,us
as,your,grace,commands
lame,lothar,rose,and,his,bastard,brother,helped,him,hobble,from,the,room
edmure,was,seething
they’re,as,much,as,saying,that,my,promise,is,worthless
why,should,i,let,that,old,weasel,choose,my,bride
lord,walder,has,other,daughters,besides,this,roslin
granddaughters,as,well
i,should,be,offered,the,same,choice,you,were
i’m,his,liege,lord,he,should,be,overjoyed,that,i’m,willing,to,wed,any,of,them
he,is,a,proud,man,and,we’ve,wounded,him,said,catelyn
the,others,take,his,pride
i,will,not,be,shamed,in,my,own,hall
my,answer,is,no
robb,gave,him,a,weary,look
i,will,not,command,you
not,in,this
but,if,you,refuse,lord,frey,will,take,it,for,another,slight,and,any,hope,of,putting,this,arights,will,be,gone
you,cannot,know,that,edmure,insisted
frey,has,wanted,me,for,one,of,his,daughters,since,the,day,i,was,born
he,will,not,let,a,chance,like,this,slip,between,those,grasping,fingers,of,his
when,lothar,brings,him,our,answer,he’ll,come,wheedling,back,and,accept,a,betrothal
and,to,a,daughter,of,my,choosing
perhaps,in,time,said,brynden,blackfish
but,can,we,wait,while,lothar,rides,back,and,forth,with,offers,and,counters
robb’s,hands,curled,into,fists
i,must,get,back,to,the,north
my,brothers,dead,winterfell,burned,my,smallfolk,put,to,the,sword
the,gods,only,know,what,this,bastard,of,bolton’s,is,about,or,whether,theon,is,still,alive,and,on,the,loose
i,can’t,sit,here,waiting,for,a,wedding,that,might,or,might,not,happen
it,must,happen,said,catelyn,though,not,gladly
i,have,no,more,wish,to,suffer,walder,frey’s,insults,and,complaints,than,you,do,brother,but,i,see,little,choice,here
without,this,wedding,robb’s,cause,is,lost
edmure,we,must,accept
we,must,accept
he,echoed,peevishly
i,don’t,see,you,offering,to,become,the,ninth,lady,frey,cat
the,eighth,lady,frey,is,still,alive,and,well,so,far,as,i,know,she,replied
thankfully
otherwise,it,might,well,have,come,to,that,knowing,lord,walder
the,blackfish,said,i,am,the,last,man,in,the,seven,kingdoms,to,tell,anyone,who,they,must,wed,nephew
nonetheless,you,did,say,something,of,making,amends,for,your,battle,of,the,fords
i,had,in,mind,a,different,sort,of,amends
single,combat,with,the,kingslayer
seven,years,of,penace,as,a,begging,brother
swimming,the,sunset,sea,with,my,legs,tied
when,he,saw,that,no,one,was,smiling,edmure,threw,up,his,hands
the,others,take,you,all
very,well,i’ll,wed,the,wench
as,amends
davos,lord,alester,looked,up,sharply
voices,he,said

someone,is,coming,for,us
lamprey,said,davos
it’s,time,for,our,supper,or,near,enough
last,night,lamprey,had,brought,them,half,a,beef-and-bacon,pie,and,a,flagon,of,mead,as,well
just,the,thought,of,it,made,his,belly,start,to,rumble
no,there’s,more,than,one
he’s,right
davos,heard,two,voices,at,least,and,footsteps,growing,louder
he,got,to,his,feet,and,moved,to,the,bars
lord,alester,brushed,the,straw,from,his,clothes
the,king,has,sent,for,me
or,the,queen,yes,selyse,would,never,let,me,rot,here,her,own,blood
outside,the,cell,lamprey,appeared,with,a,ring,of,keys,in,hand
ser,axell,florent,and,four,guardsmen,followed,close,behind,him
they,waited,beneath,the,torch,while,lamprey,searched,for,the,correct,key

is,it,the,king,who,sends,for,me,or,the,queen
no,one,has,sent,for,you,traitor,ser,axell,said
lord,alester,recoiled,as,if,he’d,been,slapped
no,i,swear,to,you,i,committed,no,treason
why,won’t,you,listen
if,his,grace,would,only,let,me,explain,lamprey,thrust,a,great,iron,key,into,the,lock,turned,it,and,pulled,open,the,cell
the,rusted,hinges,screamed,in,protest
you,he,said,to,davos

tell,me,true,ser,do,you,mean,to,burn,me
you,are,sent,for

i,can,walk
davos,stepped,from,the,cell
lord,alester,gave,a,cry,of,dismay,as,lamprey,slammed,the,door,shut,once,more
take,the,torch,ser,axell,commanded,the,gaoler
leave,the,traitor,to,the,darkness

are,you,taking,me,to,melisandre
davos,asked
she,will,be,there,ser,axell,said
she,is,never,far,from,the,king
but,it,is,his,grace,himself,who,asked,for,you
davos,lifted,his,hand,to,his,chest,where,once,his,luck,had,hung,in,a,leather,bag,on,a,thong
gone,now,he,remembered,and,the,ends,of,four,fingers,as,well
but,his,hands,were,still,long,enough,to,wrap,about,a,woman’s,throat,he,thought,especially,a,slender,throat,like,hers
up,they,went,climbing,the,turnpike,stair,in,single,file
the,walls,were,rough,dark,stone,cool,to,the,touch
the,light,of,the,torches,went,before,them,and,their,shadows,marched,beside,them,on,the,walls
at,the,third,turn,they,passed,an,iron,gate,that,opened,on,blackness,and,another,at,the,fifth,turn
davos,guessed,that,they,were,near,the,surface,by,then,perhaps,even,above,it
the,next,door,they,came,to,was,made,of,wood,but,still,they,climbed
now,the,walls,were,broken,by,arrow,slits,but,no,shafts,of,sunlight,pried,their,way,through,the,thickness,of,the,stone
it,was,night,outside
his,legs,were,aching,by,the,time,ser,axell,thrust,open,a,heavy,door,and,gestured,him,through
beyond,a,high,stone,bridge,arched,over,emptiness,to,the,massive,central,tower,called,the,stone,drum
a,sea,wind,blew,restlessly,through,the,arches,that,supported,the,roof,and,davos,could,smell,the,salt,water,as,they,crossed
he,took,a,deep,breath,filling,his,lungs,with,the,clean,cold,air
wind,and,water,give,me,strength,he,prayed
a,huge,nightfire,burned,in,the,yard,below,to,keep,the,terrors,of,the,dark,at,bay,and,the,queen’s,men,were,gathered,around,it,singing,praises,to,their,new,red,god
they,were,in,the,center,of,the,bridge,when,ser,axell,stopped,suddenly
he,made,a,brusque,gesture,with,his,hand,and,his,men,moved,out,of,earshot
were,it,my,choice,i,would,burn,you,with,my,brother,alester,he,told,davos
you,are,both,traitors

i,would,never,betray,king,stannis
you,would
you,will
i,see,it,in,your,face
and,i,have,seen,it,in,the,flames,as,well
r’hllor,has,blessed,me,with,that,gift
like,lady,melisandre,he,shows,me,the,future,in,the,fire
stannis,baratheon,will,sit,the,iron,throne
i,have,seen,it
and,i,know,what,must,be,done
his,grace,must,make,me,his,hand,in,place,of,my,traitor,brother
and,you,will,tell,him,so
will,i
davos,said,nothing
the,queen,has,urged,my,appointment,ser,axell,went,on
even,your,old,friend,from,lys,the,pirate,saan,he,says,the,same
we,have,made,a,plan,together,him,and,me
yet,his,grace,does,not,act
the,defeat,gnaws,inside,him,a,black,worm,in,his,soul
it,is,up,to,us,who,love,him,to,show,him,what,to,do
if,you,are,as,devoted,to,his,cause,as,you,claim,smuggler,you,will,join,your,voice,to,ours
tell,him,that,i,am,the,only,hand,he,needs
tell,him,and,when,we,sail,i,shall,see,that,you,have,a,new,ship
a,ship
davos,studied,the,other,man’s,face
ser,axell,had,big,florent,ears,much,like,the,queen’s
coarse,hair,grew,from,them,as,from,his,nostrils,more,sprouted,in,tufts,and,patches,beneath,his,double,chin
his,nose,was,broad,his,brow,beetled,his,eyes,close-set,and,hostile
he,would,sooner,give,me,a,pyre,than,a,ship,he,said,as,much,but,if,i,do,him,this,favor
if,you,think,to,betray,me,ser,axell,said,pray,remember,that,i,have,been,castellan,of,dragonstone,a,good,long,time
the,garrison,is,mine
perhaps,i,cannot,burn,you,without,the,king’s,consent,but,who,is,to,say,you,might,not,suffer,a,fall
he,laid,a,meaty,hand,on,the,back,of,davos’s,neck,and,shoved,him,bodily,against,the,waist-high,side,of,the,bridge,then,shoved,a,little,harder,to,force,his,face,out,over,the,yard
do,you,hear,me
i,hear,said,davos
and,you,dare,name,me,traitor
ser,axell,released,him
good
he,smiled
his,grace,awaits
best,we,do,not,keep,him
at,the,very,top,of,stone,drum,within,the,great,round,room,called,the,chamber,of,the,painted,table,they,found,stannis,baratheon,standing,behind,the,artifact,that,gave,the,hall,its,name,a,massive,slab,of,wood,carved,and,painted,in,the,shape,of,westeros,as,it,had,been,in,the,time,of,aegon,the,conqueror
an,iron,brazier,stood,beside,the,king,its,coals,glowing,a,ruddy,orange
four,tall,pointed,windows,looked,out,to,north,south,east,and,west
beyond,was,the,night,and,the,starry,sky
davos,could,hear,the,wind,moving,and,fainter,the,sounds,of,the,sea
your,grace,ser,axell,said,as,it,please,you,i,have,brought,the,onion,knight
so,i,see
stannis,wore,a,grey,wool,tunic,a,dark,red,mantle,and,a,plain,black,leather,belt,from,which,his,sword,and,dagger,hung
a,red-gold,crown,with,flame-shaped,points,encircled,his,brows
the,look,of,him,was,a,shock
he,seemed,ten,years,older,than,the,man,that,davos,had,left,at,storm’s,end,when,he,set,sail,for,the,blackwater,and,the,battle,that,would,be,their,undoing
the,king’s,close-cropped,beard,was,spiderwebbed,with,grey,hairs,and,he,had,dropped,two,stone,or,more,of,weight
he,had,never,been,a,fleshy,man,but,now,the,bones,moved,beneath,his,skin,like,spears,fighting,to,cut,free
even,his,crown,seemed,too,large,for,his,head
his,eyes,were,blue,pits,lost,in,deep,hollows,and,the,shape,of,a,skull,could,be,seen,beneath,his,face
yet,when,he,saw,davos,a,faint,smile,brushed,his,lips
so,the,sea,has,returned,me,my,knight,of,the,fish,and,onions
it,did,your,grace
does,he,know,that,he,had,me,in,his,dungeon
davos,went,to,one,knee
rise,ser,davos,stannis,commanded
i,have,missed,you,ser
i,have,need,of,good,counsel,and,you,never,gave,me,less
so,tell,me,true,what,is,the,penalty,for,treason
the,word,hung,in,the,air
a,frightful,word,thought,davos
was,he,being,asked,to,condemn,his,cellmate
or,himself,perchance
kings,know,the,penalty,for,treason,better,than,any,man
treason
he,finally,managed,weakly
what,else,would,you,call,it,to,deny,your,king,and,seek,to,steal,his,rightful,throne
i,ask,you,again,what,is,the,penalty,for,treason,under,the,law
davos,had,no,choice,but,to,answer
death,he,said
the,penalty,is,death,your,grace
it,has,always,been,so
i,am,not
i,am,not,a,cruel,man,ser,davos
you,know,me
have,known,me,long
this,is,not,my,decree
it,has,always,been,so,since,aegon’s,day,and,before

traitors,have,always,paid,with,their,lives
even,rhaenyra,targaryen
she,was,daughter,to,one,king,and,mother,to,two,more,yet,she,died,a,traitor’s,death,for,trying,to,usurp,her,brother’s,crown
it,is,law
law,davos
not,cruelty
yes,your,grace
he,does,not,speak,of,me
davos,felt,a,moment’s,pity,for,his,cellmate,down,in,the,dark
he,knew,he,should,keep,silent,but,he,was,tired,and,sick,of,heart,and,he,heard,himself,say,sire,lord,florent,meant,no,treason
do,smugglers,have,another,name,for,it
i,made,him,hand,and,he,would,have,sold,my,rights,for,a,bowl,of,pease,porridge
he,would,even,have,given,them,shireen
mine,only,child,he,would,have,wed,to,a,bastard,born,of,incest
the,king’s,voice,was,thick,with,anger
my,brother,had,a,gift,for,inspiring,loyalty
even,in,his,foes
at,summerhall,he,won,three,battles,in,a,single,day,and,brought,lords,grandison,and,cafferen,back,to,storm’s,end,as,prisoners
he,hung,their,banners,in,the,hall,as,trophies
cafferen’s,white,fawns,were,spotted,with,blood,and,grandison’s,sleeping,lion,was,torn,near,in,two
yet,they,would,sit,beneath,those,banners,of,a,night,drinking,and,feasting,with,robert
he,even,took,them,hunting
these,men,meant,to,deliver,you,to,aerys,to,be,burned’,i,told,him,after,i,saw,them,throwing,axes,in,the,yard
you,should,not,be,putting,axes,in,their,hands,’,robert,only,laughed
i,would,have,thrown,grandison,and,cafferen,into,a,dungeon,but,he,turned,them,into,friends
lord,cafferen,died,at,ashford,castle,cut,down,by,randyll,tarly,whilst,fighting,for,robert
lord,grandison,was,wounded,on,the,trident,and,died,of,it,a,year,after
my,brother,made,them,love,him,but,it,would,seem,that,i,inspire,only,betrayal
even,in,mine,own,blood,and,kin
brother,grandfather,cousins,good,uncle
your,grace,said,ser,axell,i,beg,you,give,me,the,chance,to,prove,to,you,that,not,all,florents,are,so,feeble
ser,axell,would,have,me,resume,the,war,king,stannis,told,davos
the,lannisters,think,i,am,done,and,beaten,and,my,sworn,lords,have,forsaken,me,near,every,one
even,lord,estermont,my,own,mother’s,father,has,bent,his,knee,to,joffrey
the,few,loyal,men,who,remain,to,me,are,losing,heart
they,waste,their,days,drinking,and,gambling,and,lick,their,wounds,like,beaten,curs
battle,will,set,their,hearts,ablaze,once,more,your,grace,ser,axell,said
defeat,is,a,disease,and,victory,is,the,cure
victory
the,king’s,mouth,twisted
there,are,victories,and,victories,ser
but,tell,your,plan,to,ser,davos
i,would,hear,his,views,on,what,you,propose
ser,axell,turned,to,davos,with,a,look,on,his,face,much,like,the,look,that,proud,lord,belgrave,must,have,worn,the,day,king,baelor,the,blessed,had,commanded,him,to,wash,the,beggar’s,ulcerous,feet
nonetheless,he,obeyed
the,plan,ser,axell,had,devised,with,salladhor,saan,was,simple
a,few,hours’,sail,from,dragonstone,lay,claw,isle,ancient,sea-girt,seat,of,house,celtigar
lord,ardrian,celtigar,had,fought,beneath,the,flery,heart,on,the,blackwater,but,once,taken,he,had,wasted,no,time,in,going,over,to,joffrey
he,remained,in,king’s,landing,even,now
too,frightened,of,his,grace’s,wrath,to,come,near,dragonstone,no,doubt,ser,axell,declared
and,wisely,so
the,man,has,betrayed,his,rightful,king
ser,axell,proposed,to,use,salladhor,saan’s,fleet,and,the,men,who,had,escaped,the,blackwater,stannis,still,had,some,fifteen,hundred,on,dragonstone,more,than,half,of,them,florents,to,exact,retribution,for,lord,celtigar’s,defection
claw,isle,was,but,lightly,garrisoned,its,castle,reputedly,stuffed,with,myrish,carpets,volantene,glass,gold,and,silver,plate,jeweled,cups,magnificent,hawks,an,axe,of,valyrian,steel,a,horn,that,could,summon,monsters,from,the,deep,chests,of,rubies,and,more,wines,than,a,man,could,drink,in,a,hundred,years
though,celtigar,had,shown,the,world,a,niggardly,face,he,had,never,stinted,on,his,own,comforts
put,his,castle,to,the,torch,and,his,people,to,the,sword,i,say,ser,axell,concluded
leave,claw,isle,a,desolation,of,ash,and,bone,fit,only,for,carrion,crows,so,the,realm,might,see,the,fate,of,those,who,bed,with,lannisters
stannis,listened,to,ser,axell’s,recitation,in,silence,grinding,his,jaw,slowly,from,side,to,side
when,it,was,done,he,said,it,could,be,done,i,believe
the,risk,is,small
joffrey,has,no,strength,at,sea,until,lord,redwyne,sets,sail,from,the,arbor
the,plunder,might,serve,to,keep,that,lysene,pirate,salladhor,saan,loyal,for,a,time
by,itself,claw,isle,is,worthless,but,its,fall,would,serve,notice,to,lord,tywin,that,my,cause,is,not,yet,done
the,king,turned,back,to,davos
speak,truly,ser
what,do,you,make,of,ser,axell’s,proposal
speak,truly,ser
davos,remembered,the,dark,cell,he,had,shared,with,lord,alester,remembered,lamprey,and,porridge
he,thought,of,the,promises,that,ser,axell,had,made,on,the,bridge,above,the,yard
a,ship,or,a,shove,what,shall,it,be
but,this,was,stannis,asking
your,grace,he,said,slowly,i,make,it,folly
aye,and,cowardice
cowardice
ser,axell,all,but,shouted
no,man,calls,me,craven,before,my,king
silence,stannis,commanded
ser,davos,speak,on,i,would,hear,your,reasons
davos,turned,to,face,ser,axell
you,say,we,ought,show,the,realm,we,are,not,done
strike,a,blow
make,war,aye
but,on,what,enemy
you,will,find,no,lannisters,on,claw,isle
we,will,find,traitors,said,ser,axell,though,it,may,be,i,could,find,some,closer,to,home
even,in,this,very,room
davos,ignored,the,jibe
i,don’t,doubt,lord,celtigar,bent,the,knee,to,the,boy,joffrey
he,is,an,old,done,man,who,wants,no,more,than,to,end,his,days,in,his,castle,drinking,his,fine,wine,out,of,his,jeweled,cups
he,turned,back,to,stannis
yet,he,came,when,you,called,sire
came,with,his,ships,and,swords
he,stood,by,you,at,storm’s,end,when,lord,renly,came,down,on,us,and,his,ships,sailed,up,the,blackwater
his,men,fought,for,you,killed,for,you,burned,for,you
claw,isle,is,weakly,held,yes
held,by,women,and,children,and,old,men
and,why,is,that
because,their,husbands,and,sons,and,fathers,died,on,the,blackwater,that’s,why
died,at,their,oars,or,with,swords,in,their,hands,fighting,beneath,our,banners
yet,ser,axell,proposes,we,swoop,down,on,the,homes,they,left,behind,to,rape,their,widows,and,put,their,children,to,the,sword
these,smallfolk,are,no,traitors
they,are,insisted,ser,axell
not,all,of,celtigar’s,men,were,slain,on,the,blackwater
hundreds,were,taken,with,their,lord,and,bent,the,knee,when,he,did
when,he,did,davos,repeated
they,were,his,men
his,sworn,men
what,choice,were,they,given
every,man,has,choices
they,might,have,refused,to,kneel
some,did,and,died,for,it
yet,they,died,true,men,and,loyal
some,men,are,stronger,than,others
it,was,a,feeble,answer,and,davos,knew,it
stannis,baratheon,was,a,man,of,iron,will,who,neither,understood,nor,forgave,weakness,in,others
i,am,losing,he,thought,despairing
it,is,every,man’s,duty,to,remain,loyal,to,his,rightful,king,even,if,the,lord,he,serves,proves,false,stannis,declared,in,a,tone,that,brooked,no,argument
a,desperate,folly,took,hold,of,davos,a,recklessness,akin,to,madness
as,you,remained,loyal,to,king,aerys,when,your,brother,raised,his,banners
he,blurted
shocked,silence,followed,until,ser,axell,cried,treason
and,snatched,his,dagger,from,its,sheath
your,grace,he,speaks,his,infamy,to,your,face
davos,could,hear,stannis,grinding,his,teeth
a,vein,bulged,blue,and,swollen,in,the,king’s,brow
their,eyes,met
put,up,your,knife,ser,axell
and,leave,us
as,it,please,your,grace,it,would,please,me,for,you,to,leave,said,stannis
take,yourself,from,my,presence,and,send,me,melisandre
as,you,command
ser,axell,slid,the,knife,away,bowed,and,hurried,toward,the,door
his,boots,rang,against,the,floor,angry
you,have,always,presumed,on,my,forbearance,stannis,warned,davos,when,they,were,alone
i,can,shorten,your,tongue,as,easy,as,i,did,your,fingers,smuggler
i,am,your,man,your,grace
so,it,is,your,tongue,to,do,with,as,you,please
it,is,he,said,calmer
and,i,would,have,it,speak,the,truth
though,the,truth,is,a,bitter,draught,at,times
aerys
if,you,only,knew
that,was,a,hard,choosing
my,blood,or,my,liege
my,brother,or,my,king
he,grimaced
have,you,ever,seen,the,iron,throne
the,barbs,along,the,back,the,ribbons,of,twisted,steel,the,jagged,ends,of,swords,and,knives,all,tangled,up,and,melted
it,is,not,a,comfortable,seat,ser
aerys,cut,himself,so,often,men,took,to,calling,him,king,scab,and,maegor,the,cruel,was,murdered,in,that,chair
by,that,chair,to,hear,some,tell,it
it,is,not,a,seat,where,a,man,can,rest,at,ease
ofttimes,i,wonder,why,my,brothers,wanted,it,so,desperately
why,would,you,want,it,then
davos,asked,him
it,is,not,a,question,of,wanting
the,throne,is,mine,as,robert’s,heir
that,is,law
after,me,it,must,pass,to,my,daughter,unless,selyse,should,finally,give,me,a,son
he,ran,three,fingers,lightly,down,the,table,over,the,layers,of,smooth,hard,varnish,dark,with,age
i,am,king

i,have,a,duty,to,my,daughter
to,the,realm
even,to,robert

the,lannister,woman,gave,him,horns,and,made,a,motley,fool,of,him
she,may,have,murdered,him,as,well,as,she,murdered,jon,arryn,and,ned,stark
for,such,crimes,there,must,be,justice
starting,with,cersei,and,her,abominations
but,only,starting
i,mean,to,scour,that,court,clean
as,robert,should,have,done,after,the,trident
ser,barristan,once,told,me,that,the,rot,in,king,aerys’s,reign,began,with,varys
the,eunuch,should,never,have,been,pardoned
no,more,than,the,kingslayer
at,the,least,robert,should,have,stripped,the,white,cloak,from,jaime,and,sent,him,to,the,wall,as,lord,stark,urged
he,listened,to,jon,arryn,instead
i,was,still,at,storm’s,end,under,siege,and,unconsulted
he,turned,abruptly,to,give,davos,a,hard,shrewd,look
the,truth,now
why,did,you,wish,to,murder,lady,melisandre
so,he,does,know
davos,could,not,lie,to,him
four,of,my,sons,burned,on,the,blackwater
she,gave,them,to,the,flames
you,wrong,her
those,fires,were,no,work,of,hers
curse,the,imp,curse,the,pyromancers,curse,that,fool,of,florent,who,sailed,my,fleet,into,the,jaws,of,a,trap
or,curse,me,for,my,stubborn,pride,for,sending,her,away,when,i,needed,her,most
but,not,melisandre
she,remains,my,faithful,servant
maester,cressen,was,your,faithful,servant
she,slew,him,as,she,killed,ser,cortnay,penrose,and,your,brother,renly
now,you,sound,a,fool,the,king,complained
she,saw,renly’s,end,in,the,flames,yes,but,she,had,no,more,part,in,it,than,i,did
the,priestess,was,with,me
your,devan,would,tell,you,so
ask,him,if,you,doubt,me
she,would,have,spared,renly,if,she,could
it,was,melisandre,who,urged,me,to,meet,with,him,and,give,him,one,last,chance,to,amend,his,treason
and,it,was,melisandre,who,told,me,to,send,for,you,when,ser,axell,wished,to,give,you,to,r’hllor
he,smiled,thinly
does,that,surprise,you
yes
she,knows,i,am,no,friend,to,her,or,her,red,god
but,you,are,a,friend,to,me
she,knows,that,as,well
he,beckoned,davos,closer
the,boy,is,sick

he,has,that,gift
he,got,it,from,his,father,with,the,blood
he,knows,he,is,a,king’s,son,but,chooses,to,forget,that,he,is,bastard-born
and,he,worships,robert,as,renly,did,when,he,was,young
my,royal,brother,played,the,fond,father,on,his,visits,to,storm’s,end,and,there,were,gifts
swords,and,ponies,and,fur-trimmed,cloaks
the,eunuch’s,work,every,one
the,boy,would,write,the,red,keep,full,of,thanks,and,robert,would,laugh,and,ask,varys,what,he’d,sent,this,year
renly,was,no,better
he,left,the,boy’s,upbringing,to,castellans,and,maesters,and,every,one,fell,victim,to,his,charm
penrose,chose,to,die,rather,than,give,him,up
the,king,ground,his,teeth,together
it,still,angers,me
how,could,he,think,i,would,hurt,the,boy
i,chose,robert,did,i,not
when,that,hard,day,came
i,chose,blood,over,honor
he,does,not,use,the,boy’s,name
that,made,davos,very,uneasy
i,hope,young,edric,will,recover,soon
stannis,waved,a,hand,dismissing,his,concern
it,is,a,chill,no,more
he,coughs,he,shivers,he,has,a,fever
maester,pylos,will,soon,set,him,right
by,himself,the,boy,is,nought,you,understand,but,in,his,veins,flows,my,brother’s,blood
there,is,power,in,a,king’s,blood,she,says
davos,did,not,have,to,ask,who,she,was
stannis,touched,the,painted,table
look,at,it,onion,knight
my,realm,by,rights
my,westeros
he,swept,a,hand,across,it
this,talk,of,seven,kingdoms,is,a,folly

they,painted,this,table,at,his,command
rivers,and,bays,they,painted,hills,and,mountains,castles,and,cities,and,market,towns,lakes,and,swamps,and,forests
but,no,borders
it,is,all,one
one,realm,for,one,king,to,rule,alone
one,king,agreed,davos

i,shall,bring,justice,to,westeros
a,thing,ser,axell,understands,as,little,as,he,does,war
claw,isle,would,gain,me,naught
and,it,was,evil,just,as,you,said
celtigar,must,pay,the,traitor’s,price,himself,in,his,own,person
and,when,i,come,into,my,kingdom,he,shall
every,man,shall,reap,what,he,has,sown,from,the,highest,lord,to,the,lowest,gutter,rat
and,some,will,lose,more,than,the,tips,off,their,fingers,i,promise,you
they,have,made,my,kingdom,bleed,and,i,do,not,forget,that

i,am,content,to,be,your,knight,your,grace
i,would,not,know,how,to,begin,being,lordly
good
to,be,lordly,is,to,be,false
i,have,learned,that,lesson,hard
now,kneel
your,king,commands
davos,knelt,and,stannis,drew,his,longsword
lightbringer,melisandre,had,named,it,the,red,sword,of,heroes,drawn,from,the,fires,where,the,seven,gods,were,consumed
the,room,seemed,to,grow,brighter,as,the,blade,slid,from,its,scabbard
the,steel,had,a,glow,to,it,now,orange,now,yellow,now,red
the,air,shimmered,around,it,and,no,jewel,had,ever,sparkled,so,brilliantly
but,when,stannis,touched,it,to,davos’s,shoulder,it,felt,no,different,than,any,other,longsword
ser,davos,of,house,seaworth,the,king,said,are,you,my,true,and,honest,liege,man,now,and,forever
i,am,your,grace
and,do,you,swear,to,serve,me,loyally,all,your,days,to,give,me,honest,counsel,and,swift,obedience,to,defend,my,rights,and,my,realm,against,all,foes,in,battles,great,and,small,to,protect,my,people,and,punish,my,enemies
i,do,your,grace
then,rise,again,davos,seaworth,and,rise,as,lord,of,the,rainwood,admiral,of,the,narrow,sea,and,hand,of,the,king
for,a,moment,davos,was,too,stunned,to,move

i,am,lowborn,davos,reminded,him
an,upjumped,smuggler
your,lords,will,never,obey,me

you,will,be,my,hand
it,is,you,i,want,beside,me,for,the,battle
another,battle,will,be,the,end,of,all,of,us,thought,davos
lord,alester,saw,that,much,true,enough
your,grace,asked,for,honest,counsel
in,honesty,then
we,lack,the,strength,for,another,battle,against,the,lannisters
it,is,the,great,battle,his,grace,is,speaking,of,said,a,woman’s,voice,rich,with,the,accents,of,the,east
melisandre,stood,at,the,door,in,her,red,silks,and,shimmering,satins,holding,a,covered,silver,dish,in,her,hands
these,little,wars,are,no,more,than,a,scuffle,of,children,before,what,is,to,come
the,one,whose,name,may,not,be,spoken,is,marshaling,his,power,davos,seaworth,a,power,fell,and,evil,and,strong,beyond,measure
soon,comes,the,cold,and,the,night,that,never,ends

stannis,stared,at,the,silver,dish
she,has,shown,it,to,me,lord,davos
in,the,flames
you,saw,it,sire
it,was,not,like,stannis,baratheon,to,lie,about,such,a,thing
with,mine,own,eyes
after,the,battle,when,i,was,lost,to,despair,the,lady,melisandre,bid,me,gaze,into,the,hearthfire
the,chimney,was,drawing,strongly,and,bits,of,ash,were,rising,from,the,fire
i,stared,at,them,feeling,half,a,fool,but,she,bid,me,look,deeper,and
the,ashes,were,white,rising,in,the,updraft,yet,all,at,once,it,seemed,as,if,they,were,falling
snow,i,thought
then,the,sparks,in,the,air,seemed,to,circle,to,become,a,ring,of,torches,and,i,was,looking,through,the,fire,down,on,some,high,hill,in,a,forest
the,cinders,had,become,men,in,black,behind,the,torches,and,there,were,shapes,moving,through,the,snow
for,all,the,heat,of,the,fire,i,felt,a,cold,so,terrible,i,shivered,and,when,i,did,the,sight,was,gone,the,fire,but,a,fire,once,again
but,what,i,saw,was,real,i’d,stake,my,kingdom,on,it
and,have,said,melisandre
the,conviction,in,the,king’s,voice,frightened,davos,to,the,core
a,hill,in,a,forest
shapes,in,the,snow
i,don’t

melisandre,bowed,her,head,stiffly,and,said,as,my,king,commands
reaching,up,her,left,sleeve,with,her,right,hand,she,flung,a,handful,of,powder,into,the,brazier
the,coals,roared
as,pale,flames,writhed,atop,them,the,red,woman,retrieved,the,silver,dish,and,brought,it,to,the,king

a,king’s,blood
stannis,stretched,forth,a,hand,and,his,fingers,closed,around,one,of,the,leeches
say,the,name,melisandre,commanded
the,leech,was,twisting,in,the,king’s,grip,trying,to,attach,itself,to,one,of,his,fingers
the,usurper,he,said
joffrey,baratheon
when,he,tossed,the,leech,into,the,fire,it,curled,up,like,an,autumn,leaf,amidst,the,coals,and,burned
stannis,grasped,the,second
the,usurper,he,declared,louder,this,time
balon,greyjoy
he,flipped,it,lightly,onto,the,brazier,and,its,flesh,split,and,cracked
the,blood,burst,from,it,hissing,and,smoking
the,last,was,in,the,king’s,hand
this,one,he,studied,a,moment,as,it,writhed,between,his,fingers
the,usurper,he,said,at,last
robb,stark
and,he,threw,it,on,the,flames
jaime,harrenhal’s,bathhouse,was,a,dim,steamy,low-ceilinged,room,filled,with,great,stone,tubs
when,they,led,jaime,in,they,found,brienne,seated,in,one,of,them,scrubbing,her,arm,almost,angrily
not,so,hard,wench,he,called
you’ll,scrub,the,skin,off
she,dropped,her,brush,and,covered,her,teats,with,hands,as,big,as,gregor,clegane’s
the,pointy,little,buds,she,was,so,intent,on,hiding,would,have,looked,more,natural,on,some,ten-year-old,than,they,did,on,her,thick,muscular,chest
what,are,you,doing,here
she,demanded
lord,bolton,insists,i,sup,with,him,but,he,neglected,to,invite,my,fleas
jaime,tugged,at,his,guard,with,his,left,hand
help,me,out,of,these,stinking,rags
one-handed,he,could,not,so,much,as,unlace,his,breeches
the,man,obeyed,grudgingly,but,he,obeyed
now,leave,us,jaime,said,when,his,clothes,lay,in,a,pile,on,the,wet,stone,floor
my,lady,of,tarth,doesn’t,want,the,likes,of,you,scum,gaping,at,her,teats
he,pointed,his,stump,at,the,hatchet-faced,woman,attending,brienne
you,too
wait,without
there’s,only,the,one,door,and,the,wench,is,too,big,to,try,and,shinny,up,a,chimney
the,habit,of,obedience,went,deep
the,woman,followed,his,guard,out,leaving,the,bathhouse,to,the,two,of,them
the,tubs,were,large,enough,to,hold,six,or,seven,after,the,fashion,of,the,free,cities,so,jaime,climbed,in,with,the,wench,awkward,and,slow
both,his,eyes,were,open,though,the,right,remained,somewhat,swollen,despite,qyburn’s,leeches
jaime,felt,a,hundred,and,nine,years,old,which,was,a,deal,better,than,he,had,been,feeling,when,he,came,to,harrenhal
brienne,shrunk,away,from,him
there,are,other,tubs
this,one,suits,me,well,enough
gingerly,he,immersed,himself,up,to,the,chin,in,the,steaming,water
have,no,fear,wench
your,thighs,are,purple,and,green,and,i’m,not,interested,in,what,you’ve,got,between,them
he,had,to,rest,his,right,arm,on,the,rim,since,qyburn,had,warned,him,to,keep,the,linen,dry
he,could,feel,the,tension,drain,from,his,legs,but,his,head,spun
if,i,faint,pull,me,out
no,lannister,has,ever,drowned,in,his,bath,and,i,don’t,mean,to,be,the,first
why,should,i,care,how,you,die
you,swore,a,solemn,vow
he,smiled,as,a,red,flush,crept,up,the,thick,white,column,of,her,neck
she,turned,her,back,to,him
still,the,shy,maiden
what,is,it,that,you,think,i,haven’t,seen
he,groped,for,the,brush,she,had,dropped,caught,it,with,his,fingers,and,began,to,scrub,himself,desultorily
even,that,was,difficult,awkward
my,left,hand,is,good,for,nothing
still,the,water,darkened,as,the,caked,dirt,dissolved,off,his,skin
the,wench,kept,her,back,to,him,the,muscles,in,her,great,shoulders,hunched,and,hard
does,the,sight,of,my,stump,distress,you,so
jaime,asked
you,ought,to,be,pleased
i’ve,lost,the,hand,i,killed,the,king,with
the,hand,that,flung,the,stark,boy,from,that,tower
the,hand,i’d,slide,between,my,sister’s,thighs,to,make,her,wet
he,thrust,his,stump,at,her,face
no,wonder,renly,died,with,you,guarding,him
she,jerked,to,her,feet,as,if,he’d,struck,her,sending,a,wash,of,hot,water,across,the,tub
jaime,caught,a,glimpse,of,the,thick,blonde,bush,at,the,juncture,of,her,thighs,as,she,climbed,out
she,was,much,hairier,than,his,sister
absurdly,he,felt,his,cock,stir,beneath,the,bathwater
now,i,know,i,have,been,too,long,away,from,cersei
he,averted,his,eyes,troubled,by,his,body’s,response
that,was,unworthy,he,mumbled
i’m,a,maimed,man,and,bitter
forgive,me,wench
you,protected,me,as,well,as,any,man,could,have,and,better,than,most
she,wrapped,her,nakedness,in,a,towel
do,you,mock,me
that,pricked,him,back,to,anger
are,you,as,thick,as,a,castle,wall
that,was,an,apology
i,am,tired,of,fighting,with,you
what,say,we,make,a,truce
truces,are,built,on,trust
would,you,have,me,trust,the,kingslayer,yes
the,oathbreaker,who,murdered,poor,sad,aerys,targaryen
jaime,snorted
it’s,not,aerys,i,rue,it’s,robert
i,hear,they’ve,named,you,kingslayer’,he,said,to,me,at,his,coronation,feast
just,don’t,think,to,make,it,a,habit,’,and,he,laughed
why,is,it,that,no,one,names,robert,oathbreaker
he,tore,the,realm,apart,yet,i,am,the,one,with,shit,for,honor
robert,did,all,he,did,for,love
water,ran,down,brienne’s,legs,and,pooled,beneath,her,feet
robert,did,all,he,did,for,pride,a,cunt,and,a,pretty,face
he,made,a,fist
or,would,have,if,he’d,had,a,hand
pain,lanced,up,his,arm,cruel,as,laughter
he,rode,to,save,the,realm,she,insisted
to,save,the,realm
did,you,know,that,my,brother,set,the,blackwater,rush,afire
wildfire,will,burn,on,water
aerys,would,have,bathed,in,it,if,he’d,dared
the,targaryens,were,all,mad,for,fire
jaime,felt,lightheaded
it,is,the,heat,in,here,the,poison,in,my,blood,the,last,of,my,fever
i,am,not,myself
he,eased,himself,down,until,the,water,reached,his,chin
soiled,my,white,cloak
i,wore,my,gold,armor,that,day,but
gold,armor
her,voice,sounded,far,off,faint
he,floated,in,heat,in,memory
after,dancing,griffins,lost,the,battle,of,the,bells,aerys,exiled,him
why,am,i,telling,this,absurd,ugly,child
he,had,finally,realized,that,robert,was,no,mere,outlaw,lord,to,be,crushed,at,whim,but,the,greatest,threat,house,targaryen,had,faced,since,daemon,blackfyre
the,king,reminded,lewyn,martell,gracelessly,that,he,held,elia,and,sent,him,to,take,command,of,the,ten,thousand,dornishmen,coming,up,the,kingsroad
jon,darry,and,barristan,selmy,rode,to,stoney,sept,to,rally,what,they,could,of,griffins’,men,and,prince,rhaegar,returned,from,the,south,and,persuaded,his,father,to,swallow,his,pride,and,summon,my,father
but,no,raven,returned,from,casterly,rock,and,that,made,the,king,even,more,afraid
he,saw,traitors,everywhere,and,varys,was,always,there,to,point,out,any,he,might,have,missed
so,his,grace,commanded,his,alchemists,to,place,caches,of,wildfire,all,over,king’s,landing
beneath,baelor’s,sept,and,the,hovels,of,flea,bottom,under,stables,and,storehouses,at,all,seven,gates,even,in,the,cellars,of,the,red,keep,itself
everything,was,done,in,the,utmost,secrecy,by,a,handful,of,master,pyromancers
they,did,not,even,trust,their,own,acolytes,to,help
the,queen’s,eyes,had,been,closed,for,years,and,rhaegar,was,busy,marshaling,an,army
but,aerys’s,new,mace-and-dagger,hand,was,not,utterly,stupid,and,with,rossart,belis,and,garigus,coming,and,going,night,and,day,he,became,suspicious
chelsted,that,was,his,name,lord,chelsted
it,had,come,back,to,him,suddenly,with,the,telling
i’d,thought,the,man,craven,but,the,day,he,confronted,aerys,he,found,some,courage,somewhere
he,did,all,he,could,to,dissuade,him
he,reasoned,he,jested,he,threatened,and,finally,he,begged
when,that,failed,he,took,off,his,chain,of,office,and,flung,it,down,on,the,floor
aerys,burnt,him,alive,for,that,and,hung,his,chain,about,the,neck,of,rossart,his,favorite,pyromancer
the,man,who,had,cooked,lord,rickard,stark,in,his,own,armor
and,all,the,time,i,stood,by,the,foot,of,the,iron,throne,in,my,white,plate,still,as,a,corpse,guarding,my,liege,and,all,his,sweet,secrets
my,sworn,brothers,were,all,away,you,see,but,aerys,liked,to,keep,me,close
i,was,my,father’s,son,so,he,did,not,trust,me
he,wanted,me,where,varys,could,watch,me,day,and,night
so,i,heard,it,all
he,remembered,how,rossart’s,eyes,would,shine,when,he,unrolled,his,maps,to,show,where,the,substance,must,be,placed
garigus,and,belis,were,the,same
rhaegar,met,robert,on,the,trident,and,you,know,what,happened,there
when,the,word,reached,court,aerys,packed,the,queen,off,to,dragonstone,with,prince,viserys
princess,elia,would,have,gone,as,well,but,he,forbade,it
somehow,he,had,gotten,it,in,his,head,that,prince,lewyn,must,have,betrayed,rhaegar,on,the,trident,but,he,thought,he,could,keep,dorne,loyal,so,long,as,he,kept,elia,and,aegon,by,his,side
the,traitors,want,my,city,i,heard,him,tell,rossart,but,i’ll,give,them,naught,but,ashes
let,robert,be,king,over,charred,bones,and,cooked,meat
the,targaryens,never,bury,their,dead,they,burn,them
aerys,meant,to,have,the,greatest,funeral,pyre,of,them,all
though,if,truth,be,told,i,do,not,believe,he,truly,expected,to,die
like,aerion,brightfire,before,him,aerys,thought,the,fire,would,transform,him
that,he,would,rise,again,reborn,as,a,dragon,and,turn,all,his,enemies,to,ash
ned,stark,was,racing,south,with,robert’s,van,but,my,father’s,forces,reached,the,city,first
pycelle,convinced,the,king,that,his,warden,of,the,west,had,come,to,defend,him,so,he,opened,the,gates
the,one,time,he,should,have,heeded,varys,and,he,ignored,him
my,father,had,held,back,from,the,war,brooding,on,all,the,wrongs,aerys,had,done,him,and,determined,that,house,lannister,should,be,on,the,winning,side
the,trident,decided,him
it,fell,to,me,to,hold,the,red,keep,but,i,knew,we,were,lost
i,sent,to,aerys,asking,his,leave,to,make,terms
my,man,came,back,with,a,royal,command
bring,me,your,father’s,head,if,you,are,no,traitor,’,aerys,would,have,no,yielding
lord,rossart,was,with,him,my,messenger,said
i,knew,what,that,meant
when,i,came,on,rossart,he,was,dressed,as,a,common,man-at-arms,hurrying,to,a,postern,gate
i,slew,him,first
then,i,slew,aerys,before,he,could,find,someone,else,to,carry,his,message,to,the,pyromancers
days,later,i,hunted,down,the,others,and,slew,them,as,well
belis,offered,me,gold,and,garigus,wept,for,mercy
well,a,sword’s,more,merciful,than,fire,but,i,don’t,think,garigus,much,appreciated,the,kindness,i,showed,him
the,water,had,grown,cool
when,jaime,opened,his,eyes,he,found,himself,staring,at,the,stump,of,his,sword,hand
the,hand,that,made,me,kingslayer
the,goat,had,robbed,him,of,his,glory,and,his,shame,both,at,once
leaving,what
who,am,i,now
the,wench,looked,ridiculous,clutching,her,towel,to,her,meager,teats,with,her,thick,white,legs,sticking,out,beneath
has,my,tale,turned,you,speechless
come,curse,me,or,kiss,me,or,call,me,a,liar
something
if,this,is,true,how,is,it,no,one,knows
the,knights,of,the,kingsguard,are,sworn,to,keep,the,king’s,secrets
would,you,have,me,break,my,oath
jaime,laughed
do,you,think,the,noble,lord,of,winterfell,wanted,to,hear,my,feeble,explanations
such,an,honorable,man
he,only,had,to,look,at,me,to,judge,me,guilty
jaime,lurched,to,his,feet,the,water,running,cold,down,his,chest
by,what,right,does,the,wolf,judge,the,lion
by,what,right
a,violent,shiver,took,him,and,he,smashed,his,stump,against,the,rim,of,the,tub,as,he,tried,to,climb,out
pain,shuddered,through,him
and,suddenly,the,bathhouse,was,spinning
brienne,caught,him,before,he,could,fall
her,arm,was,all,gooseflesh,clammy,and,chilled,but,she,was,strong,and,gentler,than,he,would,have,thought
gentler,than,cersei,he,thought,as,she,helped,him,from,the,tub,his,legs,wobbly,as,a,limp,cock
guards
he,heard,the,wench,shout
the,kingslayer
jaime,he,thought,my,name,is,jaime
the,next,he,knew,he,was,lying,on,the,damp,floor,with,the,guards,and,the,wench,and,qyburn,all,standing,over,him,looking,concerned
brienne,was,naked,but,she,seemed,to,have,forgotten,that,for,the,moment
the,heat,of,the,tubs,will,do,it,maester,qyburn,was,telling,them
no,he’s,not,a,maester,they,took,his,chain
there’s,still,poison,in,his,blood,as,well,and,he’s,malnourished
what,have,you,been,feeding,him
worms,and,piss,and,grey,vomit,offered,jaime
hardbread,and,water,and,oat,porridge,insisted,the,guard
he,don’t,hardly,eat,it,though
what,should,we,do,with,him
scrub,him,and,dress,him,and,carry,him,to,kingspyre,if,need,be,qyburn,said
lord,bolton,insists,he,will,sup,with,him,tonight
the,time,is,growing,short
bring,me,clean,garb,for,him,brienne,said,i’ll,see,that,he’s,washed,and,dressed
the,others,were,all,too,glad,to,give,her,the,task
they,lifted,him,to,his,feet,and,sat,him,on,a,stone,bench,by,the,wall
brienne,went,away,to,retrieve,her,towel,and,returned,with,a,stiff,brush,to,finish,scrubbing,him
one,of,the,guards,gave,her,a,razor,to,trim,his,beard
qyburn,returned,with,roughspun,smallclothes,clean,black,woolen,breeches,a,loose,green,tunic,and,a,leather,jerkin,that,laced,up,the,front
jaime,was,feeling,less,dizzy,by,then,though,no,less,clumsy
with,the,wench’s,help,he,managed,to,dress,himself
now,all,i,need,is,a,silver,looking,glass
the,bloody,maester,had,brought,fresh,clothing,for,brienne,as,well,a,stained,pink,satin,gown,and,a,linen,undertunic
i,am,sorry,my,lady
these,were,the,only,women’s,garments,in,harrenhal,large,enough,to,fit,you
it,was,obvious,at,once,that,the,gown,had,been,cut,for,someone,with,slimmer,arms,shorter,legs,and,much,fuller,breasts
the,fine,myrish,lace,did,little,to,conceal,the,bruising,that,mottled,brienne’s,skin
all,in,all,the,garb,made,the,wench,look,ludicrous
she,has,thicker,shoulders,than,i,do,and,a,bigger,neck,jaime,thought
small,wonder,she,prefers,to,dress,in,mail
pink,was,not,a,kind,color,for,her,either
a,dozen,cruel,japes,leaped,into,his,head,but,for,once,he,kept,them,there
best,not,to,make,her,angry,he,was,no,match,for,her,one-handed
qyburn,had,brought,a,flask,as,well
what,is,it
jaime,demanded,when,the,chainless,maester,pressed,him,to,drink
licorice,steeped,in,vinegar,with,honey,and,cloves

huge,hearths,lined,the,walls,one,every,ten,feet,or,so,more,than,he,could,count,but,no,fires,had,been,lit,so,the,chill,between,the,walls,went,bone-deep
a,dozen,spearmen,in,fur,cloaks,guarded,the,doors,and,the,steps,that,led,up,to,the,two,galleries,above
and,in,the,center,of,that,immense,emptiness,at,a,trestle,table,surrounded,by,what,seemed,like,acres,of,smooth,slate,floor,the,lord,of,the,dreadfort,waited,attended,only,by,a,cupbearer

you’d,send,us,on

that,is,good,my,lord
it,is
however,lord,vargo,has,created,me,one,small
difficulty
he,turned,his,pale,eyes,on,jaime

he,enjoys,cutting,off,hands
the,linen,that,covered,jaime’s,stump,was,spotted,with,blood,and,wine
he,enjoys,cutting,off,feet,as,well
he,doesn’t,seem,to,need,a,reason
nonetheless,he,had,one
hoat,is,more,cunning,than,he,appears
no,man,commands,a,company,such,as,the,brave,companions,for,long,unless,he,has,some,wits,about,him
bolton,stabbed,a,chunk,of,meat,with,the,point,of,his,dagger,put,it,in,his,mouth,chewed,thoughtfully,swallowed
lord,vargo,abandoned,house,lannister,because,i,offered,him,harrenhal,a,reward,a,thousand,times,greater,than,any,he,could,hope,to,have,from,lord,tywin
as,a,stranger,to,westeros,he,did,not,know,the,prize,was,poisoned
the,curse,of,harren,the,black
mocked,jaime
the,curse,of,tywin,lannister
bolton,held,out,his,goblet,and,elmar,refilled,it,silently
our,goat,should,have,consulted,the,tarbecks,or,the,reynes
they,might,have,warned,him,how,your,lord,father,deals,with,betrayal
there,are,no,tarbecks,or,reynes,said,jaime
my,point,precisely
lord,vargo,doubtless,hoped,that,lord,stannis,would,triumph,at,king’s,landing,and,thence,confirm,him,in,his,possession,of,this,castle,in,gratitude,for,his,small,part,in,the,downfall,of,house,lannister
he,gave,a,dry,chuckle
he,knows,little,of,stannis,baratheon,either,i,fear
that,one,might,have,given,him,harrenhal,for,his,service
but,he,would,have,given,him,a,noose,for,his,crimes,as,well
a,noose,is,kinder,than,what,he’ll,get,from,my,father
by,now,he,has,come,to,the,same,realization
with,stannis,broken,and,renly,dead,only,a,stark,victory,can,save,him,from,lord,tywin’s,vengeance,but,the,chances,of,that,grow,perishingly,slim
king,robb,has,won,every,battle,brienne,said,stoutly,as,stubbornly,loyal,of,speech,as,she,was,of,deed
won,every,battle,while,losing,the,freys,the,karstarks,winterfell,and,the,north
a,pity,the,wolf,is,so,young
boys,of,sixteen,always,believe,they,are,immortal,and,invincible
an,older,man,would,bend,the,knee,i’d,think
after,a,war,there,is,always,a,peace,and,with,peace,there,are,pardons
for,the,robb,starks,at,least
not,for,the,likes,of,vargo,hoat
bolton,gave,him,a,small,smile
both,sides,have,made,use,of,him,but,neither,will,shed,a,tear,at,his,passing
the,brave,companions,did,not,fight,in,the,battle,of,the,blackwater,yet,they,died,there,all,the,same
you’ll,forgive,me,if,i,don’t,mourn
you,have,no,pity,for,our,wretched,doomed,goat
ah,but,the,gods,must
else,why,deliver,you,into,his,hands
bolton,chewed,another,chunk,of,meat
karhold,is,smaller,and,meaner,than,harrenhal,but,it,lies,well,beyond,the,reach,of,the,lion’s,claws
once,wed,to,alys,karstark,hoat,might,be,a,lord,in,truth
if,he,could,collect,some,gold,from,your,father,so,much,the,better,but,he,would,have,delivered,you,to,lord,rickard,no,matter,how,much,lord,tywin,paid
his,price,would,be,the,maid,and,safe,refuge
but,to,sell,you,he,must,keep,you,and,the,riverlands,are,full,of,those,who,would,gladly,steal,you,away
glover,and,tallhart,were,broken,at,duskendale,but,remnants,of,their,host,are,still,abroad,with,the,mountain,slaughtering,the,stragglers
a,thousand,karstarks,prowl,the,lands,south,and,east,of,riverrun,hunting,you
elsewhere,are,darry,men,left,lordless,and,lawless,packs,of,four-footed,wolves,and,the,lightning,lord’s,outlaw,bands
dondarrion,would,gladly,hang,you,and,the,goat,together,from,the,same,tree
the,lord,of,the,dreadfort,sopped,up,some,of,the,blood,with,a,chunk,of,bread
harrenhal,was,the,only,place,lord,vargo,could,hope,to,hold,you,safe,but,here,his,brave,companions,are,much,outnumbered,by,my,own,men,and,by,ser,aenys,and,his,freys
no,doubt,he,feared,i,might,return,you,to,ser,edmure,at,riverrun
or,worse,send,you,on,to,your,father
by,maiming,you,he,meant,to,remove,your,sword,as,a,threat,gain,himself,a,grisly,token,to,send,to,your,father,and,diminish,your,value,to,me
for,he,is,my,man,as,i,am,king,robb’s,man
thus,his,crime,is,mine,or,may,seem,so,in,your,father’s,eyes
and,therein,lies,my
small,difficulty
he,gazed,at,jaime,his,pale,eyes,unblinking,expectant,chill
i,see
you,want,me,to,absolve,you,of,blame
to,tell,my,father,that,this,stump,is,no,work,of,yours

had,i,a,hand,i’d,write,it,out
how,i,was,maimed,by,the,sellsword,my,own,father,brought,to,westeros,and,saved,by,the,noble,lord,bolton
i,will,trust,to,your,word,ser
there’s,something,i,don’t,often,hear
how,soon,might,we,be,permitted,to,leave

jaime,was,almost,as,surprised,if,truth,be,told,but,he,hid,it,better
sansa,stark,that,ought,to,put,a,smile,on,tyrion’s,face

i,said,nothing,about,you,i,fear

he,may,have,feared,his,litter,would,make,too,tempting,a,target,for,brigands,or,that,it,would,prove,too,cumbersome,in,the,high,passes,of,the,boneway
perhaps,his,gout,is,better
so,why,did,he,have,such,a,bad,feeling,about,this
this,waiting,was,intolerable
banners,forward,he,snapped
we’ll,meet,them
he,kicked,his,horse
bronn,and,pod,followed,one,to,either,side

the,salty,dornishmen,had,the,most,rhoynish,blood,the,stony,dornishmen,the,least
all,three,sorts,seemed,well,represented,in,doran’s,retinue
the,salty,dornishmen,were,lithe,and,dark,with,smooth,olive,skin,and,long,black,hair,streaming,in,the,wind
the,sandy,dornishmen,were,even,darker,their,faces,burned,brown,by,the,hot,dornish,sun
they,wound,long,bright,scarfs,around,their,helms,to,ward,off,sunstroke
the,stony,dornishmen,were,biggest,and,fairest,sons,of,the,andals,and,the,first,men,brown-haired,or,blond,with,faces,that,freckled,or,burned,in,the,sun,instead,of,browning
the,lords,wore,silk,and,satin,robes,with,jeweled,belts,and,flowing,sleeves

the,fabled,sand,steeds,of,dorne,were,smaller,than,proper,warhorses,and,could,not,bear,such,weight,of,armor,but,it,was,said,that,they,could,run,for,a,day,and,night,and,another,day,and,never,tire
the,dornish,leader,forked,a,stallion,black,as,sin,with,a,mane,and,tail,the,color,of,fire
he,sat,his,saddle,as,if,he’d,been,born,there,tall,slim,graceful
a,cloak,of,pale,red,silk,fluttered,from,his,shoulders,and,his,shirt,was,armored,with,overlapping,rows,of,copper,disks,that,glittered,like,a,thousand,bright,new,pennies,as,he,rode
his,high,gilded,helm,displayed,a,copper,sun,on,its,brow,and,the,round,shield,slung,behind,him,bore,the,sun-and-spear,of,house,martell,on,its,polished,metal,surface

the,red,viper,of,dorne
and,what,in,the,seven,hells,am,i,supposed,to,do,with,him
he,knew,the,man,only,by,reputation,to,be,sure
but,the,reputation,was,fearsome
when,he,was,no,more,than,sixteen,prince,oberyn,had,been,found,abed,with,the,paramour,of,old,lord,yronwood,a,huge,man,of,fierce,repute,and,short,temper
a,duel,ensued,though,in,view,of,the,prince’s,youth,and,high,birth,it,was,only,to,first,blood
both,men,took,cuts,and,honor,was,satisfied
yet,prince,oberyn,soon,recovered,while,lord,yronwood’s,wounds,festered,and,killed,him
afterward,men,whispered,that,oberyn,had,fought,with,a,poisoned,sword,and,ever,thereafter,friends,and,foes,alike,called,him,the,red,viper
that,was,many,years,ago,to,be,sure
the,boy,of,sixteen,was,a,man,past,forty,now,and,his,legend,had,grown,a,deal,darker
he,had,traveled,in,the,free,cities,leaming,the,poisoner’s,trade,and,perhaps,arts,darker,still,if,rumors,could,be,believed
he,had,studied,at,the,citadel,going,so,far,as,to,forge,six,links,of,a,maester’s,chain,before,he,grew,bored
he,had,soldiered,in,the,disputed,lands,across,the,narrow,sea,riding,with,the,second,sons,for,a,time,before,forming,his,own,company
his,tourneys,his,battles,his,duels,his,horses,his,carnality
it,was,said,that,he,bedded,men,and,women,both,and,had,begotten,bastard,girls,all,over,dorne
the,sand,snakes,men,called,his,daughters
so,far,as,tyrion,had,heard,prince,oberyn,had,never,fathered,a,son
and,of,course,he,had,crippled,the,heir,to,highgarden
there,is,no,man,in,the,seven,kingdoms,who,will,be,less,welcome,at,a,tyrell,wedding,thought,tyrion
to,send,prince,oberyn,to,king’s,landing,while,the,city,still,hosted,lord,mace,tyrell,two,of,his,sons,and,thousands,of,their,men-at-arms,was,a,provocation,as,dangerous,as,prince,oberyn,himself
a,wrong,word,an,ill-timed,jest,a,look,that’s,all,it,will,take,and,our,noble,allies,will,be,at,one,another’s,throats
we,have,met,before,the,dornish,prince,said,lightly,to,tyrion,as,they,rode,side,by,side,along,the,kingsroad,past,ashen,fields,and,the,skeletons,of,trees
i,would,not,expect,you,to,remember,though
you,were,even,smaller,than,you,are,now
there,was,a,mocking,edge,to,his,voice,that,tyrion,misliked,but,he,was,not,about,to,let,the,dornishman,provoke,him
when,was,this,my,lord
he,asked,in,tones,of,polite,interest
oh,many,and,many,a,year,ago,when,my,mother,ruled,in,dorne,and,your,lord,father,was,hand,to,a,different,king
not,so,different,as,you,might,think,reflected,tyrion
it,was,when,i,visited,casterly,rock,with,my,mother,her,consort,and,my,sister,elia
i,was,oh,fourteen,fifteen,thereabouts,elia,a,year,older
your,brother,and,sister,were,eight,or,nine,as,i,recall,and,you,had,just,been,born
a,queer,time,to,come,visiting
his,mother,had,died,giving,him,birth,so,the,martells,would,have,found,the,rock,deep,in,mouming
his,father,especially
lord,tywin,seldom,spoke,of,his,wife,but,tyrion,had,heard,his,uncles,talk,of,the,love,between,them
in,those,days,his,father,had,been,aerys’s,hand,and,many,people,said,that,lord,tywin,lannister,ruled,the,seven,kingdoms,but,lady,joanna,ruled,lord,tywin
he,was,not,the,same,man,after,she,died,imp,his,uncle,gery,told,him,once
the,best,part,of,him,died,with,her
gerion,had,been,the,youngest,of,lord,tytos,lannister’s,four,sons,and,the,uncle,tyrion,liked,best
but,he,was,gone,now,lost,beyond,the,seas,and,tyrion,himself,had,put,lady,joanna,in,her,grave
did,you,find,casterly,rock,to,your,liking,my,lord
scarcely
your,father,ignored,us,the,whole,time,we,were,there,after,commanding,ser,kevan,to,see,to,our,entertainment
the,cell,they,gave,me,had,a,featherbed,to,sleep,in,and,myrish,carpets,on,the,floor,but,it,was,dark,and,windowless,much,like,a,dungeon,when,you,come,down,to,it,as,i,told,elia,at,the,time
your,skies,were,too,grey,your,wines,too,sweet,your,women,too,chaste,your,food,too,bland
and,you,yourself,were,the,greatest,disappointment,of,all
i,had,just,been,born
what,did,you,expect,of,me
enormity,the,black-haired,prince,replied
you,were,small,but,far-famed
we,were,in,oldtown,at,your,birth,and,all,the,city,talked,of,was,the,monster,that,had,been,born,to,the,king’s,hand,and,what,such,an,omen,might,foretell,for,the,realm
famine,plague,and,war,no,doubt
tyrion,gave,a,sour,smile
it’s,always,famine,plague,and,war
oh,and,winter,and,the,long,night,that,never,ends
all,that,said,prince,oberyn,and,your,father’s,fall,as,well
lord,tywin,had,made,himself,greater,than,king,aerys,i,heard,one,begging,brother,preach,but,only,a,god,is,meant,to,stand,above,a,king
you,were,his,curse,a,punishment,sent,by,the,gods,to,teach,him,that,he,was,no,better,than,any,other,man
i,try,but,he,refuses,to,learn
tyrion,gave,a,sigh
but,do,go,on,i,pray,you
i,love,a,good,tale
and,well,you,might,since,you,were,said,to,have,one,a,stiff,curly,tail,like,a,swine’s
your,head,was,monstrous,huge,we,heard,half,again,the,size,of,your,body,and,you,had,been,born,with,thick,black,hair,and,a,beard,besides,an,evil,eye,and,lion’s,claws
your,teeth,were,so,long,you,could,not,close,your,mouth,and,between,your,legs,were,a,girl’s,privates,as,well,as,a,boy’s
life,would,be,much,simpler,if,men,could,fuck,themselves,don’t,you,agree
and,i,can,think,of,a,few,times,when,claws,and,teeth,might,have,proved,useful
even,so,i,begin,to,see,the,nature,of,your,complaint
bronn,gave,out,with,a,chuckle,but,oberyn,only,smiled
we,might,never,have,seen,you,at,all,but,for,your,sweet,sister
you,were,never,seen,at,table,or,hall,though,sometimes,at,night,we,could,hear,a,baby,howling,down,in,the,depths,of,the,rock
you,did,have,a,monstrous,great,voice,i,must,grant,you,that
you,would,wail,for,hours,and,nothing,would,quiet,you,but,a,woman’s,teat
still,true,as,it,happens
this,time,prince,oberyn,did,laugh
a,taste,we,share
lord,gargalen,once,told,me,he,hoped,to,die,with,a,sword,in,his,hand,to,which,i,replied,that,i,would,sooner,go,with,a,breast,in,mine
tyrion,had,to,grin
you,were,speaking,of,my,sister
cersei,promised,elia,to,show,you,to,us
the,day,before,we,were,to,sail,whilst,my,mother,and,your,father,were,closeted,together,she,and,jaime,took,us,down,to,your,nursery
your,wet,nurse,tried,to,send,us,off,but,your,sister,was,having,none,of,that
he’s,mine’,she,said,and,you’re,just,a,milk,cow,you,can’t,tell,me,what,to,do
be,quiet,or,i’ll,have,my,father,cut,your,tongue,out
a,cow,doesn’t,need,a,tongue,only,udders,’,her,grace,learned,charm,at,an,early,age,said,tyrion,amused,by,the,notion,of,his,sister,claiming,him,as,hers
she’s,never,been,in,any,rush,to,claim,me,since,the,gods,know
cersei,even,undid,your,swaddling,clothes,to,give,us,a,better,look,the,dornish,prince,continued
you,did,have,one,evil,eye,and,some,black,fuzz,on,your,scalp
perhaps,your,head,was,larger,than,most
but,there,was,no,tail,no,beard,neither,teeth,nor,claws,and,nothing,between,your,legs,but,a,tiny,pink,cock
after,all,the,wonderful,whispers,lord,tywin’s,doom,turned,out,to,be,just,a,hideous,red,infant,with,stunted,legs
elia,even,made,the,noise,that,young,girls,make,at,the,sight,of,infants,i’m,sure,you’ve,heard,it
the,same,noise,they,make,over,cute,kittens,and,playful,puppies
i,believe,she,wanted,to,nurse,you,herself,ugly,as,you,were
when,i,commented,that,you,seemed,a,poor,sort,of,monster,your,sister,said,he,killed,my,mother’,and,twisted,your,little,cock,so,hard,i,thought,she,was,like,to,pull,it,off
you,shrieked,but,it,was,only,when,your,brother,jaime,said,leave,him,be,you’re,hurting,him’,that,cersei,let,go,of,you
it,doesn’t,matter’,she,told,us
everyone,says,he’s,like,to,die,soon
he,shouldn’t,even,have,lived,this,long,’,the,sun,was,shining,bright,above,them,and,the,day,was,pleasantly,warm,for,autumn,but,tyrion,lannister,went,cold,all,over,when,he,heard,that
my,sweet,sister
he,scratched,at,the,scar,of,his,nose,and,gave,the,dornishman,a,taste,of,his,evil,eye
now,why,would,he,tell,such,a,tale
is,he,testing,me,or,simply,twisting,my,cock,as,cersei,did,so,he,can,hear,me,scream
be,sure,and,tell,that,story,to,my,father
it,will,delight,him,as,much,as,it,did,me
the,part,about,my,tail,especially
i,did,have,one,but,he,had,it,lopped,off
prince,oberyn,had,a,chuckle
you’ve,grown,more,amusing,since,last,we,met
yes,but,i,meant,to,grow,taller
while,we,are,speaking,of,amusement,i,heard,a,curious,tale,from,lord,buckler’s,steward
he,claimed,that,you,had,put,a,tax,on,women’s,privy,purses
it,is,a,tax,on,whoring,said,tyrion,irritated,all,over,again
and,it,was,my,bloody,father’s,notion
only,a,penny,for,each,ah
act
the,king’s,hand,felt,it,might,help,improve,the,morals,of,the,city
and,pay,for,joffrey’s,wedding,besides
needless,to,say,as,master,of,coin,tyrion,had,gotten,all,the,blame,for,it

i,will,make,certain,to,keep,my,pouch,full,of,pennies
even,a,prince,must,pay,his,taxes
why,should,you,need,to,go,whoring

i,struck,his,breastplate,clean,but,his,foot,caught,in,a,stirrup,as,he,fell,and,his,horse,came,down,on,top,of,him
i,sent,a,maester,to,him,afterward,but,it,was,all,he,could,do,to,save,the,boy’s,leg
the,knee,was,far,past,mending
if,any,were,to,blame,it,was,his,fool,of,a,father
willas,tyrell,was,green,as,his,surcoat,and,had,no,business,riding,in,such,company
the,fat,flower,thrust,him,into,tourneys,at,too,tender,an,age,just,as,he,did,with,the,other,two
he,wanted,another,leo,longthorn,and,made,himself,a,cripple

tyrion,cantered,on,ahead,to,where,the,ferry,barges,waited,on,the,south,bank,of,the,blackwater
he,had,suffered,all,he,meant,to,suffer,of,what,passed,for,dornish,wit
father,should,have,sent,joffrey,after,all
he,could,have,asked,prince,oberyn,if,he,knew,how,a,dornishman,differed,from,a,cowflop
that,made,him,grin,despite,himself
he,would,have,to,make,a,point,of,being,on,hand,when,the,red,viper,was,presented,to,the,king
arya,the,man,on,the,roof,was,the,first,to,die
he,was,crouched,down,by,the,chimney,two,hundred,yards,away,no,more,than,a,vague,shadow,in,the,predawn,gloom,but,as,the,sky,began,to,lighten,he,stirred,stretched,and,stood
anguy’s,arrow,took,him,in,the,chest
he,tumbled,bonelessly,down,the,steep,slate,pitch,and,fell,in,front,of,the,septry,door
the,mummers,had,posted,two,guards,there,but,their,torch,left,them,night,blind,and,the,outlaws,had,crept,in,close
kyle,and,notch,let,fly,together
one,man,went,down,with,an,arrow,through,his,throat,the,other,through,his,belly
the,second,man,dropped,the,torch,and,the,flames,licked,up,at,him
he,screamed,as,his,clothes,took,fire,and,that,was,the,end,of,stealth
thoros,gave,a,shout,and,the,outlaws,attacked,in,earnest
arya,watched,from,atop,her,horse,on,the,crest,of,the,wooded,ridge,that,overlooked,the,septry,mill,brewhouse,and,stables,and,the,desolation,of,weeds,burnt,trees,and,mud,that,surrounded,them
the,trees,were,mostly,bare,now,and,the,few,withered,brown,leaves,that,still,clung,to,the,branches,did,little,to,obstruct,her,view
lord,beric,had,left,beardless,dick,and,mudge,to,guard,them
arya,hated,being,left,behind,like,she,was,some,stupid,child,but,at,least,gendry,had,been,kept,back,as,well
she,knew,better,than,to,try,and,argue
this,was,battle,and,in,battle,you,had,to,obey
the,eastern,horizon,glowed,gold,and,pink,and,overhead,a,half,moon,peeked,out,through,low,scuttling,clouds
the,wind,blew,cold,and,arya,could,hear,the,rush,of,water,and,the,creak,of,the,mill’s,great,wooden,waterwheel
there,was,a,smell,of,rain,in,the,dawn,air,but,no,drops,were,falling,yet
flaming,arrows,flew,through,the,morning,mists,trailing,pale,ribbons,of,fire,and,thudded,into,the,wooden,walls,of,the,septry
a,few,smashed,through,shuttered,windows,and,soon,enough,thin,tendrils,of,smoke,were,rising,between,the,broken,shutters
two,mummers,came,bursting,from,the,septry,side,by,side,axes,in,their,hands
anguy,and,the,other,archers,were,waiting
one,axeman,died,at,once
the,other,managed,to,duck,so,the,shaft,ripped,through,his,shoulder
he,staggered,on,till,two,more,arrows,found,him,so,quickly,it,was,hard,to,say,which,had,struck,first
the,long,shafts,punched,through,his,breastplate,as,if,it,had,been,made,of,silk,instead,of,steel
he,fell,heavily
anguy,had,arrows,tipped,with,bodkins,as,well,as,broadheads
a,bodkin,could,pierce,even,heavy,plate
i’m,going,to,learn,to,shoot,a,bow,arya,thought
she,loved,sword,fighting,but,she,could,see,how,arrows,were,good,too
flames,were,creeping,up,the,west,wall,of,the,septry,and,thick,smoke,poured,through,a,broken,window
a,myrish,crossbowman,poked,his,head,out,a,different,window,got,off,a,bolt,and,ducked,down,to,rewind
she,could,hear,fighting,from,the,stables,as,well,shouts,well,mingled,with,the,screams,of,horses,and,the,clang,of,steel
kill,them,all,she,thought,fiercely
she,bit,her,lip,so,hard,she,tasted,blood
kill,every,single,one
the,crossbowman,appeared,again,but,no,sooner,had,he,loosed,than,three,arrows,hissed,past,his,head
one,rattled,off,his,helm
he,vanished,bow,and,all
arya,could,see,flames,in,several,of,the,second-story,windows
between,the,smoke,and,the,morning,mists,the,air,was,a,haze,of,blowing,black,and,white
anguy,and,the,other,bowmen,were,creeping,closer,the,better,to,find,targets
then,the,septry,erupted,the,mummers,boiling,out,like,angry,ants
two,ibbenese,rushed,through,the,door,with,shaggy,brown,shields,held,high,before,them,and,behind,them,came,a,dothraki,with,a,great,curved,arakh,and,bells,in,his,braid,and,behind,him,three,volantene,sellswords,covered,with,fierce,tattoos
others,were,climbing,out,windows,and,leaping,to,the,ground
arya,saw,a,man,take,an,arrow,through,the,chest,with,one,leg,across,a,windowsill,and,heard,his,scream,as,he,fell
the,smoke,was,thickening
quarrels,and,arrows,sped,back,and,forth
watty,fell,with,a,grunt,his,bow,slipping,from,his,hand
kyle,was,trying,to,nock,another,shaft,to,his,string,when,a,man,in,black,mail,flung,a,spear,through,his,belly
she,heard,lord,beric,shout
from,out,of,the,ditches,and,trees,the,rest,of,his,band,came,pouring,steel,in,hand
arya,saw,lem’s,bright,yellow,cloak,flapping,behind,him,as,he,rode,down,the,man,who’d,killed,kyle
thoros,and,lord,beric,were,everywhere,their,swords,swirling,fire
the,red,priest,hacked,at,a,hide,shield,until,it,flew,to,pieces,while,his,horse,kicked,the,man,in,the,face
a,dothraki,screamed,and,charged,the,lightning,lord,and,the,flaming,sword,leapt,out,to,meet,his,arakh
the,blades,kissed,and,spun,and,kissed,again
then,the,dothraki’s,hair,was,ablaze,and,a,moment,later,he,was,dead
she,spied,ned,too,fighting,at,the,lightning,lord’s,side
it’s,not,fair,he’s,only,a,little,older,than,me,they,should,have,let,me,fight
the,battle,did,not,last,very,long
the,brave,companions,still,on,their,feet,soon,died,or,threw,down,their,swords
two,of,the,dothraki,managed,to,regain,their,horses,and,flee,but,only,because,lord,beric,let,them,go
let,them,carry,the,word,back,to,harrenhal,he,said,with,flaming,sword,in,hand
it,will,give,the,leech,lord,and,his,goat,a,few,more,sleepless,nights
jack-be-lucky,harwin,and,merrit,o’,moontown,braved,the,burning,septry,to,search,for,captives
they,emerged,from,the,smoke,and,flames,a,few,moments,later,with,eight,brown,brothers,one,so,weak,that,merrit,had,to,carry,him,across,a,shoulder
there,was,a,septon,with,them,as,well,round-shouldered,and,balding,but,he,wore,black,chainmail,over,his,grey,robes
found,him,hiding,under,the,cellar,steps,said,jack,coughing
thoros,smiled,to,see,him
you,are,utt
septon,utt
a,man,of,god
what,god,would,want,the,likes,o’,you
growled,lem
i,have,sinned,the,septon,wailed
i,know,i,know
forgive,me,father
oh,grievously,have,i,sinned
arya,remembered,septon,utt,from,her,time,at,harrenhal
shagwell,the,fool,said,he,always,wept,and,prayed,for,forgiveness,after,he’d,killed,his,latest,boy
sometimes,he,even,made,the,other,mummers,scourge,him
they,all,thought,that,was,very,funny
lord,beric,slammed,his,sword,into,its,scabbard,quenching,the,flames
give,the,dying,the,gift,of,mercy,and,bind,the,others,hand,and,foot,for,trial,he,commanded,and,it,was,done
the,trials,went,swiftly
various,of,the,outlaws,came,forward,to,tell,of,things,the,brave,companions,had,done,towns,and,villages,sacked,crops,burned,women,raped,and,murdered,men,maimed,and,tortured
a,few,spoke,of,the,boys,that,septon,utt,had,carried,off
the,septon,wept,and,prayed,through,it,all
i,am,a,weak,reed,he,told,lord,beric
i,pray,to,the,warrior,for,strength,but,the,gods,made,me,weak
have,mercy,on,my,weakness
the,boys,the,sweet,boys
i,never,mean,to,hurt,them
septon,utt,soon,dangled,beneath,a,tall,elm,swinging,slowly,by,the,neck,as,naked,as,his,name,day
the,other,brave,companions,followed,one,by,one
a,few,fought,kicking,and,struggling,as,the,noose,was,tightened,round,their,throats
one,of,the,crossbowmen,kept,shouting,i,soldier,i,soldier,in,a,thick,myrish,accent
another,offered,to,lead,his,captors,to,gold,a,third,told,them,what,a,good,outlaw,he,would,make
each,was,stripped,and,bound,and,hanged,in,turn
tom,sevenstrings,played,a,dirge,for,them,on,his,woodharp,and,thoros,implored,the,lord,of,light,to,roast,their,souls,until,the,end,of,time
a,mummer,tree,arya,thought,as,she,watched,them,dangle,their,pale,skins,painted,a,sullen,red,by,the,flames,of,the,burning,septry
already,the,crows,were,coming,appearing,out,of,nowhere
she,heard,them,croaking,and,cackling,at,one,another,and,wondered,what,they,were,saying
arya,had,not,feared,septon,utt,as,much,as,she,did,rorge,and,biter,and,some,of,the,others,still,at,harrenhal,but,she,was,glad,that,he,was,dead,all,the,same
they,should,have,hanged,the,hound,too,or,chopped,his,head,off
instead,to,her,disgust,the,outlaws,had,treated,sandor,clegane’s,burned,arm,restored,his,sword,and,horse,and,armor,and,set,him,free,a,few,miles,from,the,hollow,hill
all,they’d,taken,was,his,gold
the,septry,soon,collapsed,in,a,roar,of,smoke,and,flame,its,walls,no,longer,able,to,support,the,weight,of,its,heavy,slate,roof
the,eight,brown,brothers,watched,with,resignation
they,were,all,that,remained,explained,the,eldest,who,wore,a,small,iron,hammer,on,a,thong,about,his,neck,to,signify,his,devotion,to,the,smith
before,the,war,we,were,four-and-forty,and,this,was,a,prosperous,place
we,had,a,dozen,milk,cows,and,a,bull,a,hundred,beehives,a,vineyard,and,an,apple,arbor
but,when,the,lions,came,through,they,took,all,our,wine,and,milk,and,honey,slaughtered,the,cows,and,put,our,vineyard,to,the,torch
after,that
i,have,lost,count,of,our,visitors
this,false,septon,was,only,the,latest
there,was,one,monster
we,gave,him,all,our,silver,but,he,was,certain,we,were,hiding,gold,so,his,men,killed,us,one,by,one,to,make,elder,brother,talk
how,did,the,eight,of,you,survive
asked,anguy,the,archer
i,am,ashamed,the,old,man,said
it,was,me
when,it,came,my,turn,to,die,i,told,them,where,our,gold,was,hidden
brother,said,thoros,of,myr,the,only,shame,was,not,telling,them,at,once
the,outlaws,sheltered,that,night,in,the,brewhouse,beside,the,little,river
their,hosts,had,a,cache,of,food,hidden,beneath,the,floor,of,the,stables,so,they,shared,a,simple,supper,oaten,bread,onions,and,a,watery,cabbage,soup,tasting,faintly,of,garlic
arya,found,a,slice,of,carrot,floating,in,her,bowl,and,counted,herself,lucky
the,brothers,never,asked,the,outlaws,for,names
they,know,arya,thought
how,could,they,not
lord,beric,wore,the,lightning,bolt,on,breastplate,shield,and,cloak,and,thoros,his,red,robes,or,what,remained,of,them
one,brother,a,young,novice,was,bold,enough,to,tell,the,red,priest,not,to,pray,to,his,false,god,so,long,as,he,was,under,their,roof
bugger,that,said,lem,lemoncloak
he’s,our,god,too,and,you,owe,us,for,your,bloody,lives
and,what’s,false,about,him
might,be,your,smith,can,mend,a,broken,sword,but,can,he,heal,a,broken,man
enough,lem,lord,beric,commanded
beneath,their,roof,we,will,honor,their,rules
the,sun,will,not,cease,to,shine,if,we,miss,a,prayer,or,two,thoros,agreed,mildly
i,am,one,who,would,know
lord,beric,himself,did,not,eat
arya,had,never,seen,him,eat,though,from,time,to,time,he,took,a,cup,of,wine
he,did,not,seem,to,sleep,either
his,good,eye,would,often,close,as,if,from,weariness,but,when,you,spoke,to,him,it,would,flick,open,again,at,once
the,marcher,lord,was,still,clad,in,his,ratty,black,cloak,and,dented,breastplate,with,its,chipped,enamel,lightning
he,even,slept,in,that,breastplate
the,dull,black,steel,hid,the,terrible,wound,the,hound,had,given,him,the,same,way,his,thick,woolen,scarf,concealed,the,dark,ring,about,his,throat
but,nothing,hid,his,broken,head,all,caved,in,at,the,temple,or,the,raw,red,pit,that,was,his,missing,eye,or,the,shape,of,the,skull,beneath,his,face
arya,looked,at,him,warily,remembering,all,the,tales,told,of,him,in,harrenhal
lord,beric,seemed,to,sense,her,fear
he,turned,his,head,and,beckoned,her,closer
do,i,frighten,you,child
no
she,chewed,her,lip
only
well
i,thought,the,hound,had,killed,you,but
a,wound,said,lem,lemoncloak
a,grievous,wound,aye,but,thoros,healed,it
there’s,never,been,no,better,healer
lord,beric,gazed,at,lem,with,a,queer,look,in,his,good,eye,and,no,look,at,all,in,the,other,only,scars,and,dried,blood
no,better,healer,he,agreed,wearily
lem,past,time,to,change,the,watch,i’d,think
see,to,it,if,you’d,be,so,good
aye,m’lord
lem’s,big,yellow,cloak,swirled,behind,him,as,he,strode,out,into,the,windy,night
even,brave,men,blind,themselves,sometimes,when,they,are,afraid,to,see,lord,beric,said,when,lem,was,gone
thoros,how,many,times,have,you,brought,me,back,now
the,red,priest,bowed,his,head
it,is,r’hllor,who,brings,you,back,my,lord
the,lord,of,light
i,am,only,his,instrument
how,many,times

and,each,time,is,harder
you,have,grown,reckless,my,lord

no,my,friend
not,sweet
then,do,not,court,it,so
lord,tywin,leads,from,the,rear

you,would,be,wise,to,do,the,same
a,seventh,death,might,mean,the,end,of,both,of,us
lord,beric,touched,the,spot,above,his,left,ear,where,his,temple,was,caved,in
here,is,where,ser,burton,crakehall,broke,helm,and,head,with,a,blow,of,his,mace
he,unwound,his,scarf,exposing,the,black,bruise,that,encircled,his,neck
here,the,mark,the,manticore,made,at,rushing,falls
he,seized,a,poor,beekeeper,and,his,wife,thinking,they,were,mine,and,let,it,be,known,far,and,wide,that,he,would,hang,them,both,unless,i,gave,myself,up,to,him
when,i,did,he,hanged,them,anyway,and,me,on,the,gibbet,between,them
he,lifted,a,finger,to,the,raw,red,pit,of,his,eye
here,is,where,the,mountain,thrust,his,dirk,through,my,visor
a,weary,smile,brushed,his,lips
that’s,thrice,i,have,died,at,the,hands,of,house,clegane
you,would,think,that,i,might,have,learned
it,was,a,jest,arya,knew,but,thoros,did,not,laugh
he,put,a,hand,on,lord,beric’s,shoulder
best,not,to,dwell,on,it
can,i,dwell,on,what,i,scarce,remember
i,held,a,castle,on,the,marches,once,and,there,was,a,woman,i,was,pledged,to,marry,but,i,could,not,find,that,castle,today,nor,tell,you,the,color,of,that,woman’s,hair
who,knighted,me,old,friend
what,were,my,favorite,foods
it,all,fades
sometimes,i,think,i,was,born,on,the,bloody,grass,in,that,grove,of,ash,with,the,taste,of,fire,in,my,mouth,and,a,hole,in,my,chest
are,you,my,mother,thoros
arya,stared,at,the,myrish,priest,all,shaggy,hair,and,pink,rags,and,bits,of,old,armor
grey,stubble,covered,his,cheeks,and,the,sagging,skin,beneath,his,chin
he,did,not,look,much,like,the,wizards,in,old,nan’s,stories,but,even,so
could,you,bring,back,a,man,without,a,head
arya,asked
just,the,once,not,six,times
could,you
i,have,no,magic,child
only,prayers
that,first,time,his,lordship,had,a,hole,right,through,him,and,blood,in,his,mouth,i,knew,there,was,no,hope
so,when,his,poor,torn,chest,stopped,moving,i,gave,him,the,good,god’s,own,kiss,to,send,him,on,his,way
i,filled,my,mouth,with,fire,and,breathed,the,flames,inside,him,down,his,throat,to,lungs,and,heart,and,soul
the,last,kiss,it,is,called,and,many,a,time,i,saw,the,old,priests,bestow,it,on,the,lord’s,servants,as,they,died
i,had,given,it,a,time,or,two,myself,as,all,priests,must
but,never,before,had,i,felt,a,dead,man,shudder,as,the,fire,filled,him,nor,seen,his,eyes,come,open
it,was,not,me,who,raised,him,my,lady
it,was,the,lord
r’hllor,is,not,done,with,him,yet
life,is,warmth,and,warmth,is,fire,and,fire,is,god’s,and,god’s,alone
arya,felt,tears,well,in,her,eyes
thoros,used,a,lot,of,words,but,all,they,meant,was,no,that,much,she,understood
your,father,was,a,good,man,lord,beric,said
harwin,has,told,me,much,of,him
for,his,sake,i,would,gladly,forgo,your,ransom,but,we,need,the,gold,too,desperately
she,chewed,her,lip
that’s,true,i,guess
he,had,given,the,hound’s,gold,to,greenbeard,and,the,huntsman,to,buy,provisions,south,of,the,mander,she,knew
the,last,harvest,burned,this,one,is,drowning,and,winter,will,soon,be,on,us,she,had,heard,him,say,when,he,sent,them,off
the,smallfolk,need,grain,and,seed,and,we,need,blades,and,horses
too,many,of,my,men,ride,rounseys,drays,and,mules,against,foes,mounted,on,coursers,and,destriers
arya,didn’t,know,how,much,robb,would,pay,for,her,though
he,was,a,king,now,not,the,boy,she’d,left,at,winterfell,with,snow,melting,in,his,hair
and,if,he,knew,the,things,she’d,done,the,stableboy,and,the,guard,at,harrenhal,and,all
what,if,my,brother,doesn’t,want,to,ransom,me
why,would,you,think,that
asked,lord,beric

it,was,the,first,village,they,had,seen,since,leaving,the,foothills
meera,had,scouted,ahead,to,make,certain,there,was,no,one,lurking,amongst,the,ruins
sliding,in,and,amongst,oaks,and,apple,trees,with,her,net,and,spear,in,hand,she,startled,three,red,deer,and,sent,them,bounding,away,through,the,brush

bran,watched,the,direwolf,lope,off,and,for,a,moment,wanted,nothing,so,much,as,to,slip,his,skin,and,run,with,him,but,meera,was,waving,for,them,to,come,ahead
reluctantly,he,turned,away,from,summer,and,urged,hodor,on,into,the,village
jojen,walked,with,them
the,ground,from,here,to,the,wall,was,grasslands,bran,knew,fallow,fields,and,low,rolling,hills,high,meadows,and,lowland,bogs
it,would,be,much,easier,going,than,the,mountains,behind,but,so,much,open,space,made,meera,uneasy
i,feel,naked,she,confessed
there’s,no,place,to,hide
who,holds,this,land
jojen,asked,bran
the,night’s,watch,he,answered
this,is,the,gift
the,new,gift,and,north,of,that,brandon’s,gift
maester,luwin,had,taught,him,the,history
brandon,the,builder,gave,all,the,land,south,of,the,wall,to,the,black,brothers,to,a,distance,of,twenty-five,leagues
for,their
for,their,sustenance,and,support
he,was,proud,that,he,still,remembered,that,part
some,maesters,say,it,was,some,other,brandon,not,the,builder,but,it’s,still,brandon’s,gift
thousands,of,years,later,good,queen,alysanne,visited,the,wall,on,her,dragon,silverwing,and,she,thought,the,night’s,watch,was,so,brave,that,she,had,the,old,king,double,the,size,of,their,lands,to,fifty,leagues
so,that,was,the,new,gift
he,waved,a,hand
here
all,this
no,one,had,lived,in,the,village,for,long,years,bran,could,see
all,the,houses,were,falling,down
even,the,inn
it,had,never,been,much,of,an,inn,to,look,at,it,but,now,all,that,remained,was,a,stone,chimney,and,two,cracked,walls,set,amongst,a,dozen,apple,trees
one,was,growing,up,through,the,common,room,where,a,layer,of,wet,brown,leaves,and,rotting,apples,carpeted,the,floor
the,air,was,thick,with,the,smell,of,them,a,cloying,cidery,scent,that,was,almost,overwhelming
meera,stabbed,a,few,apples,with,her,frog,spear,trying,to,find,some,still,good,enough,to,eat,but,they,were,all,too,brown,and,wormy
it,was,a,peaceful,spot,still,and,tranquil,and,lovely,to,behold,but,bran,thought,there,was,something,sad,about,an,empty,inn,and,hodor,seemed,to,feel,it,too

but,where,are,the,people,bran
why,would,they,leave,such,a,place
they,were,afraid,of,the,wildlings,said,bran

the,places,nearest,the,wall,got,raided,so,much,the,smallfolk,moved,south,into,the,mountains,or,onto,the,umber,lands,east,of,the,kingsroad
the,greatjon’s,people,get,raided,too,but,not,so,much,as,the,people,who,used,to,live,in,the,gift

we,need,to,shelter,here
there’s,a,storm,coming
a,bad,one
bran,looked,up,at,the,sky
it,had,been,a,beautiful,crisp,clear,autumn,day,sunny,and,almost,warm,but,there,were,dark,clouds,off,to,the,west,now,that,was,true,and,the,wind,seemed,to,be,picking,up
there’s,no,roof,on,the,inn,and,only,the,two,walls,he,pointed,out
we,should,go,out,to,the,holdfast
hodor,said,hodor
maybe,he,agreed
we,have,no,boat,bran
meera,poked,through,the,leaves,idly,with,her,frog,spear
there’s,a,causeway
a,stone,causeway,hidden,under,the,water
we,could,walk,out
they,could,anyway,he,would,have,to,ride,on,hodor’s,back,but,at,least,he’d,stay,dry,that,way
the,reeds,exchanged,a,look

she,took,them,out,step,by,careful,step,probing,ahead,with,her,frog,spear
they,could,see,where,the,path,emerged,again,climbing,from,the,water,onto,the,island,and,turning,into,a,short,flight,of,stone,steps,that,led,to,the,holdfast,door
path,steps,and,door,were,in,a,straight,line,which,made,you,think,the,causeway,ran,straight,but,that,wasn’t,so
under,the,lake,it,zigged,and,zagged,going,a,third,of,a,way,around,the,island,before,jagging,back
the,turns,were,treacherous,and,the,long,path,meant,that,anyone,approaching,would,be,exposed,to,arrow,fire,from,the,tower,for,a,long,time
the,hidden,stones,were,slimy,and,slippery,too,twice,hodor,almost,lost,his,footing,and,shouted,hodor
in,alarm,before,regaining,his,balance
the,second,time,scared,bran,badly
if,hodor,fell,into,the,lake,with,him,in,his,basket,he,could,well,drown,especially,if,the,huge,stableboy,panicked,and,forgot,that,bran,was,there,the,way,he,did,sometimes
maybe,we,should,have,stayed,at,the,inn,under,the,apple,tree,he,thought,but,by,then,it,was,too,late
thankfully,there,was,no,third,time,and,the,water,never,got,up,past,hodor’s,waist,though,the,reeds,were,in,it,up,to,their,chests
and,before,long,they,were,on,the,island,climbing,the,steps,to,the,holdfast
the,door,was,still,stout,though,its,heavy,oak,planks,had,warped,over,the,years,and,it,could,no,longer,be,closed,completely

bran,looked,up,and,saw,another,grate,just,above,his,head
a,murder,hole
he,was,glad,there,was,no,one,up,there,now,to,pour,boiling,oil,down,on,them
the,grates,were,locked,but,the,iron,bars,were,red,with,rust
hodor,grabbed,hold,of,the,lefthand,door,and,gave,it,a,pull,grunting,with,effort
nothing,happened
he,tried,pushing,with,no,more,success
he,shook,the,bars,kicked,shoved,against,them,and,rattled,them,and,punched,the,hinges,with,a,huge,hand,until,the,air,was,filled,with,flakes,of,rust,but,the,iron,door,would,not,budge
the,one,down,to,the,undervault,was,no,more,accommodating

the,crannogmen,took,bran,by,the,arms,and,drew,him,up,after,them
getting,hodor,inside,was,the,hard,part
he,was,too,heavy,for,the,reeds,to,lift,the,way,they’d,lifted,bran
finally,bran,told,him,to,go,look,for,some,big,rocks
the,island,had,no,lack,of,those,and,hodor,was,able,to,pile,them,high,enough,to,grab,the,crumbling,edges,of,the,hole,and,climb,through
hodor,he,panted,happily,grinning,at,all,of,them
they,found,themselves,in,a,maze,of,small,cells,dark,and,empty,but,meera,explored,until,she,found,the,way,back,to,the,steps

they,might,decide,to,hold,us,or,send,us,back

just,the,men,who,used,to,live,here
what,happened,to,them
they,died,or,went,away
brandon’s,gift,had,been,farmed,for,thousands,of,years,but,as,the,watch,dwindled,there,were,fewer,hands,to,plow,the,fields,tend,the,bees,and,plant,the,orchards,so,the,wild,had,reclaimed,many,a,field,and,hall
in,the,new,gift,there,had,been,villages,and,holdfasts,whose,taxes,rendered,in,goods,and,labor,helped,feed,and,clothe,the,black,brothers

they,were,fools,to,leave,such,a,castle,said,ygritte
it’s,only,a,towerhouse
some,little,lordling,lived,there,once,with,his,family,and,a,few,sworn,men
when,raiders,came,he,would,light,a,beacon,from,the,roof
winterfell,has,towers,three,times,the,size,of,that
she,looked,as,if,she,thought,he,was,making,that,up
how,could,men,build,so,high,with,no,giants,to,lift,the,stones
in,legend,brandon,the,builder,had,used,giants,to,help,raise,winterfell,but,jon,did,not,want,to,confuse,the,issue
men,can,build,a,lot,higher,than,this
in,oldtown,there’s,a,tower,taller,than,the,wall
he,could,tell,she,did,not,believe,him
if,i,could,show,her,winterfell
give,her,a,flower,from,the,glass,gardens,feast,her,in,the,great,hall,and,show,her,the,stone,kings,on,their,thrones
we,could,bathe,in,the,hot,pools,and,love,beneath,the,heart,tree,while,the,old,gods,watched,over,us
the,dream,was,sweet

after,the,conquest
after,the,wildlings,break,the,wall
his,lord,father,had,once,talked,about,raising,new,lords,and,settling,them,in,the,abandoned,holdfasts,as,a,shield,against,wildlings
the,plan,would,have,required,the,watch,to,yield,back,a,large,part,of,the,gift,but,his,uncle,benjen,believed,the,lord,commander,could,be,won,around,so,long,as,the,new,lordlings,paid,taxes,to,castle,black,rather,than,winterfell

no,one,lives,here
your,raiders,drove,them,off
they,were,cowards,then
if,they,wanted,the,land,they,should,have,stayed,and,fought
maybe,they,were,tired,of,fighting
tired,of,barring,their,doors,every,night,and,wondering,if,rattleshirt,or,someone,like,him,would,break,them,down,to,carry,off,their,wives
tired,of,having,their,harvests,stolen,and,any,valuables,they,might,have
it’s,easier,to,move,beyond,the,reach,of,raiders
but,if,the,wall,should,fail,all,the,north,will,lie,within,the,reach,of,raiders
you,know,nothing,jon,snow

you’re,the,ones,who,steal
you,took,the,whole,world,and,built,the,wall,t’,keep,the,free,folk,out

he’d,have,t’,be,quick,and,cunning,and,brave,t’,steal,me
so,his,sons,would,be,strong,and,smart,as,well
why,would,i,hate,such,a,man,as,that

i,know,one,thing
i,know,that,you,are,wildling,to,the,bone
it,was,easy,to,forget,that,sometimes,when,they,were,laughing,together,or,kissing
but,then,one,of,them,would,say,something,or,do,something,and,he,would,suddenly,be,reminded,of,the,wall,between,their,worlds
a,man,can,own,a,woman,or,a,man,can,own,a,knife,ygritte,told,him,but,no,man,can,own,both
every,little,girl,learns,that,from,her,mother
she,raised,her,chin,defiantly,and,gave,her,thick,red,hair,a,shake
and,men,can’t,own,the,land,no,more’n,they,can,own,the,sea,or,the,sky
you,kneelers,think,you,do,but,mance,is,going,t’,show,you,different
it,was,a,fine,brave,boast,but,it,rang,hollow
jon,glanced,back,to,make,certain,the,magnar,was,not,in,earshot
errok,big,boil,and,hempen,dan,were,walking,a,few,yards,behind,them,but,paying,no,attention
big,boil,was,complaining,of,his,arse
ygritte,he,said,in,a,low,voice,mance,cannot,win,this,war
he,can
she,insisted
you,know,nothing,jon,snow
you,have,never,seen,the,free,folk,fight
wildlings,fought,like,heroes,or,demons,depending,on,who,you,talked,to,but,it,came,down,to,the,same,thing,in,the,end
they,fight,with,reckless,courage,every,man,out,for,glory
i,don’t,doubt,that,you’re,all,very,brave,but,when,it,comes,to,battle,discipline,beats,valor,every,time
in,the,end,mance,will,fail,as,all,the,kings-beyond-the-wall,have,failed,before,him
and,when,he,does,you’ll,die
all,of,you
ygritte,had,looked,so,angry,he,thought,she,was,about,to,strike,him
all,of,us,she,said
you,too
you’re,no,crow,now,jon,snow
i,swore,you,weren’t,so,you,better,not,be
she,pushed,him,back,against,the,trunk,of,a,tree,and,kissed,him,full,on,the,lips,right,there,in,the,midst,of,the,ragged,column
jon,heard,grigg,the,goat,urging,her,on
someone,else,laughed
he,kissed,her,back,despite,all,that
when,they,finally,broke,apart,ygritte,was,flushed
you’re,mine,she,whispered
mine,as,i’m,yours
and,if,we,die,we,die
all,men,must,die,jon,snow
but,first,we’ll,live
yes
his,voice,was,thick
first,we’ll,live
she,grinned,at,that,showing,jon,the,crooked,teeth,that,he,had,somehow,come,to,love
wildling,to,the,bone,he,thought,again,with,a,sick,sad,feeling,in,the,pit,of,his,stomach
he,flexed,the,fingers,of,his,sword,hand,and,wondered,what,ygritte,would,do,if,she,knew,his,heart
would,she,betray,him,if,he,sat,her,down,and,told,her,that,he,was,still,ned,stark’s,son,and,a,man,of,the,night’s,watch
he,hoped,not,but,he,dare,not,take,that,risk
too,many,lives,depended,on,his,somehow,reaching,castle,black,before,the,magnar
assuming,he,found,a,chance,to,escape,the,wildlings
they,had,descended,the,south,face,of,the,wall,at,greyguard,abandoned,for,two,hundred,years
a,section,of,the,huge,stone,steps,had,collapsed,a,century,before,but,even,so,the,descent,was,a,good,deal,easier,than,the,climb
from,there,styr,marched,them,deep,into,the,gift,to,avoid,the,watch’s,customary,patrols
grigg,the,goat,led,them,past,the,few,inhabited,villages,that,remained,in,these,lands
aside,from,a,few,scattered,roundtowers,poking,the,sky,like,stone,fingers,they,saw,no,sign,of,man
through,cold,wet,hills,and,windy,plains,they,marched,unwatched,unseen
you,must,not,balk,whatever,is,asked,of,you,the,halfhand,had,said
ride,with,them,eat,with,them,fight,with,them,for,as,long,as,it,takes
he’d,ridden,many,leagues,and,walked,for,more,had,shared,their,bread,and,salt,and,ygritte’s,blankets,as,well,but,still,they,did,not,trust,him
day,and,night,the,thenns,watched,him,alert,for,any,signs,of,betrayal
he,could,not,get,away,and,soon,it,would,be,too,late
fight,with,them,qhorin,had,said,before,he,surrendered,his,own,life,to,longclaw
but,it,had,not,come,to,that,till,now
once,i,shed,a,brother’s,blood,i,am,lost
i,cross,the,wall,for,good,then,and,there,is,no,crossing,back
after,each,day’s,march,the,magnar,summoned,him,to,ask,shrewd,sharp,questions,about,castle,black,its,garrison,and,defenses
jon,lied,where,he,dared,and,feigned,ignorance,a,few,times,but,grigg,the,goat,and,errok,listened,as,well,and,they,knew,enough,to,make,jon,careful
too,blatant,a,lie,would,betray,him
but,the,truth,was,terrible
castle,black,had,no,defenses,but,for,the,wall,itself
it,lacked,even,wooden,palisades,or,earthen,dikes
the,castle,was,nothing,more,than,a,cluster,of,towers,and,keeps,two-thirds,of,them,falling,into,ruin
as,for,the,garrison,the,old,bear,had,taken,two,hundred,on,his,ranging
had,any,returned
jon,could,not,know
perhaps,four,hundred,remained,at,the,castle,but,most,of,those,were,builders,or,stewards,not,rangers
the,thenns,were,hardened,warriors,and,more,disciplined,than,the,common,run,of,wildling,no,doubt,that,was,why,mance,had,chosen,them
the,defenders,of,castle,black,would,include,blind,maester,aemon,and,his,half-blind,steward,clydas,one-armed,donal,noye,drunken,septon,cellador,deaf,dick,follard,three-finger,hobb,the,cook,old,ser,wynton,stout,as,well,as,halder,and,toad,and,pyp,and,albett,and,the,rest,of,the,boys,who’d,trained,with,jon
and,commanding,them,would,be,red-faced,bowen,marsh,the,plump,lord,steward,who,had,been,made,castellan,in,lord,mormont’s,absence
dolorous,edd,sometimes,called,marsh,the,old,pomegranate,which,fit,him,just,as,well,as,the,old,bear,fit,mormont
he’s,the,man,you,want,in,front,when,the,foes,are,in,the,field,edd,would,say,in,his,usual,dour,voice
he’ll,count,them,right,up,for,you
a,regular,demon,for,counting,that,one
if,the,magnar,takes,castle,black,unawares,it,will,be,red,slaughter,boys,butchered,in,their,beds,before,they,know,they,are,under,attack
jon,had,to,warn,them,but,how
he,was,never,sent,out,to,forage,or,hunt,nor,allowed,to,stand,a,watch,alone
and,he,feared,for,ygritte,as,well
he,could,not,take,her,but,if,he,left,her,would,the,magnar,make,her,answer,for,his,treachery
two,hearts,that,beat,as,one
they,shared,the,same,sleeping,skins,every,night,and,he,went,to,sleep,with,her,head,against,his,chest,and,her,red,hair,tickling,his,chin
the,smell,of,her,had,become,a,part,of,him
her,crooked,teeth,the,feel,of,her,breast,when,he,cupped,it,in,his,hand,the,taste,of,her,mouth
they,were,his,joy,and,his,despair
many,a,night,he,lay,with,ygritte,warm,beside,him,wondering,if,his,lord,father,had,felt,this,confused,about,his,mother,whoever,she,had,been
ygritte,set,the,trap,and,mance,rayder,pushed,me,into,it
every,day,he,spent,among,the,wildlings,made,what,he,had,to,do,that,much,harder
he,was,going,to,have,to,find,some,way,to,betray,these,men,and,when,he,did,they,would,die
he,did,not,want,their,friendship,any,more,than,he,wanted,ygritte’s,love
and,yet
the,thenns,spoke,the,old,tongue,and,seldom,talked,to,jon,at,all,but,it,was,different,with,jarl’s,raiders,the,men,who’d,climbed,the,wall
jon,was,coming,to,know,them,despite,himself,gaunt,quiet,errok,and,gregarious,grigg,the,goat,the,boys,quort,and,bodger,hempen,dan,the,ropemaker
the,worst,of,the,lot,was,del,a,horsefaced,youth,near,jon’s,own,age,who,would,talk,dreamily,of,this,wildling,girl,he,meant,to,steal
she’s,lucky,like,your,ygritte
she’s,kissed,by,fire
jon,had,to,bite,his,tongue
he,didn’t,want,to,know,about,del’s,girl,or,bodger’s,mother,the,place,by,the,sea,that,henk,the,helm,came,from,how,grigg,yearned,to,visit,the,green,men,on,the,isle,of,faces,or,the,time,a,moose,had,chased,toefinger,up,a,tree
he,didn’t,want,to,hear,about,the,boil,on,big,boil’s,arse,how,much,ale,stone,thumbs,could,drink,or,how,quort’s,little,brother,had,begged,him,not,to,go,with,jarl
quort,could,not,have,been,older,than,fourteen,though,he’d,already,stolen,himself,a,wife,and,had,a,child,on,the,way
might,be,he’ll,be,born,in,some,castle,the,boy,boasted
born,in,a,castle,like,a,lord
he,was,very,taken,with,the,castles,they’d,seen,by,which,he,meant,watchtowers
jon,wondered,where,ghost,was,now
had,he,gone,to,castle,black,or,was,he,was,running,with,some,wolfpack,in,the,woods
he,had,no,sense,of,the,direwolf,not,even,in,his,dreams
it,made,him,feel,as,if,part,of,himself,had,been,cut,off
even,with,ygritte,sleeping,beside,him,he,felt,alone
he,did,not,want,to,die,alone
by,that,afternoon,the,trees,had,begun,to,thin,and,they,marched,east,over,gently,rolling,plains
grass,rose,waist,high,around,them,and,stands,of,wild,wheat,swayed,gently,when,the,wind,came,gusting,but,for,the,most,part,the,day,was,warm,and,bright
toward,sunset,however,clouds,began,to,threaten,in,the,west
they,soon,engulfed,the,orange,sun,and,lenn,foretold,a,bad,storm,coming
his,mother,was,a,woods,witch,so,all,the,raiders,agreed,he,had,a,gift,for,foretelling,the,weather
there’s,a,village,close,grigg,the,goat,told,the,magnar
two,miles,three
we,could,shelter,there
styr,agreed,at,once
it,was,well,past,dark,and,the,storm,was,raging,by,the,time,they,reached,the,place
the,village,sat,beside,a,lake,and,had,been,so,long,abandoned,that,most,of,the,houses,had,collapsed
even,the,small,timber,inn,that,must,once,have,been,a,welcome,sight,for,travelers,stood,half-fallen,and,roofless
we,will,find,scant,shelter,here,jon,thought,gloomily
whenever,the,lightning,flashed,he,could,see,a,stone,roundtower,rising,from,an,island,out,in,the,lake,but,without,boats,they,had,no,way,to,reach,it
errok,and,del,had,crept,ahead,to,scout,the,ruins,but,del,was,back,almost,at,once
styr,halted,the,column,and,sent,a,dozen,of,his,thenns,trotting,forward,spears,in,hand
by,then,jon,had,seen,it,too,the,glimmer,of,a,fire,reddening,the,chimney,of,the,inn
we,are,not,alone
dread,coiled,inside,him,like,a,snake
he,heard,a,horse,neigh,and,then,shouts
ride,with,them,eat,with,them,fight,with,them,qhorin,had,said
but,the,fighting,was,done
there’s,only,one,of,them,errok,said,when,he,came,back
an,old,man,with,a,horse
the,magnar,shouted,commands,in,the,old,tongue,and,a,score,of,his,thenns,spread,out,to,establish,a,perimeter,around,the,village,whilst,others,went,prowling,through,the,houses,to,make,certain,no,one,else,was,hiding,amongst,the,weeds,and,tumbled,stones
the,rest,crowded,into,the,roofless,inn,jostling,each,other,to,get,closer,to,the,hearth
the,broken,branches,the,old,man,had,been,burning,seemed,to,generate,more,smoke,than,heat,but,any,warmth,was,welcome,on,such,a,wild,rainy,night
two,of,the,thenns,had,thrown,the,man,to,the,ground,and,were,going,through,his,things
another,held,his,horse,while,three,more,looted,his,saddlebags
jon,walked,away
a,rotten,apple,squished,beneath,his,heel
styr,will,kill,him
the,magnar,had,said,as,much,at,greyguard,any,kneelers,they,met,were,to,be,put,to,death,at,once,to,make,certain,they,could,not,raise,the,alarm
ride,with,them,eat,with,them,fight,with,them

near,the,edge,of,the,village,jon,came,face-to-face,with,one,of,the,guards,styr,had,posted
the,thenn,growled,something,in,the,old,tongue,and,pointed,his,spear,back,toward,the,inn
get,back,where,you,belong,jon,guessed
but,where,is,that
he,walked,towards,the,water,and,discovered,an,almost,dry,spot,beneath,the,leaning,daub-and-wattle,wall,of,a,tumbledown,cottage,that,had,mostly,tumbled,down
that,was,where,ygritte,found,him,sitting,staring,off,across,the,rain-whipped,lake
i,know,this,place,he,told,her,when,she,sat,beside,him
that,tower
look,at,the,top,of,it,the,next,time,the,lightning,flashes,and,tell,me,what,you,see
aye,if,you,like,she,said,and,then,some,o’,the,thenns,are,saying,they,heard,noises,out,there

the,clap,of,thunder,was,so,loud,that,ygritte,gasped,and,covered,her,ears

alysanne,the,wife,of,king,jaehaerys,the,conciliator
he’s,called,the,old,king,because,he,reigned,so,long,but,he,was,young,when,he,first,came,to,the,iron,throne
in,those,days,it,was,his,wont,to,travel,all,over,the,realm

he,got,to,his,feet
ygritte,came,with,him,which,always,made,styr,frown,but,whenever,he,tried,to,dismiss,her,she,would,remind,him,that,she,was,a,free,woman,not,a,kneeler
she,came,and,went,as,she,pleased
they,found,the,magnar,standing,beneath,the,tree,that,grew,through,the,floor,of,the,common,room
his,captive,knelt,before,the,hearth,encircled,by,wooden,spears,and,bronze,swords

even,in,death,the,man,did,not,cry,out
you,know,nothing,jon,snow
she,shouted,at,him,and,flung,the,bloody,blade,at,his,feet
the,magnar,said,something,in,the,old,tongue
he,might,have,been,telling,the,thenns,to,kill,jon,where,he,stood,but,he,would,never,know,the,truth,of,that
lightning,crashed,down,from,the,sky,a,searing,blue-white,bolt,that,touched,the,top,of,the,tower,in,the,lake
they,could,smell,the,fury,of,it,and,when,the,thunder,came,it,seemed,to,shake,the,night
and,death,leapt,down,amongst,them
the,lightning,flash,left,jon,night-blind,but,he,glimpsed,the,hurtling,shadow,half,a,heartbeat,before,he,heard,the,shriek
the,first,thenn,died,as,the,old,man,had,blood,gushing,from,his,torn,throat
then,the,light,was,gone,and,the,shape,was,spinning,away,snarling,and,another,man,went,down,in,the,dark
there,were,curses,shouts,howls,of,pain
jon,saw,big,boil,stumble,backward,and,knock,down,three,men,behind,him
ghost,he,thought,for,one,mad,instant
ghost,leapt,the,wall
then,the,lightning,turned,the,night,to,day,and,he,saw,the,wolf,standing,on,del’s,chest,blood,running,black,from,his,jaws
grey
he’s,grey
darkness,descended,with,the,thunderclap
the,thenns,were,jabbing,with,their,spears,as,the,wolf,darted,between,them
the,old,man’s,mare,reared,maddened,by,the,smell,of,slaughter,and,lashed,out,with,her,hooves
longclaw,was,still,in,his,hand
all,at,once,jon,snow,knew,he,would,never,get,a,better,chance
he,cut,down,the,first,man,as,he,turned,toward,the,wolf,shoved,past,a,second,slashed,at,a,third
through,the,madness,he,heard,someone,call,his,name,but,whether,it,was,ygritte,or,the,magnar,he,could,not,say
the,thenn,fighting,to,control,the,horse,never,saw,him
longclaw,was,feather-light
he,swung,at,the,back,of,the,man’s,calf,and,felt,the,steel,bite,down,to,the,bone
when,the,wildling,fell,the,mare,bolted,but,somehow,jon,managed,to,grab,her,mane,with,his,off,hand,and,vault,himself,onto,her,back
a,hand,closed,round,his,ankle,and,he,hacked,down,and,saw,bodger’s,face,dissolve,in,a,welter,of,blood
the,horse,reared,lashing,out
one,hoof,caught,a,thenn,in,the,temple,with,a,crunch
and,then,they,were,running
jon,made,no,effort,to,guide,the,horse
it,was,all,he,could,do,to,stay,on,her,as,they,plunged,through,mud,and,rain,and,thunder
wet,grass,whipped,at,his,face,and,a,spear,flew,past,his,ear
if,the,horse,stumbles,and,breaks,a,leg,they,will,run,me,down,and,kill,me,he,thought,but,the,old,gods,were,with,him,and,the,horse,did,not,stumble
lightning,shivered,through,the,black,dome,of,sky,and,thunder,rolled,across,the,plains
the,shouts,dwindled,and,died,behind,him
long,hours,later,the,rain,stopped
jon,found,himself,alone,in,a,sea,of,tall,black,grass
there,was,a,deep,throbbing,ache,in,his,right,thigh
when,he,looked,down,he,was,surprised,to,see,an,arrow,jutting,out,the,back,of,it
when,did,that,happen
he,grabbed,hold,of,the,shaft,and,gave,it,a,tug,but,the,arrowhead,was,sunk,deep,in,the,meat,of,his,leg,and,the,pain,when,he,pulled,on,it,was,excruciating
he,tried,to,think,back,on,the,madness,at,the,inn,but,all,he,could,remember,was,the,beast,gaunt,and,grey,and,terrible
it,was,too,large,to,be,a,common,wolf
a,direwolf,then
it,had,to,be
he,had,never,seen,an,animal,move,so,fast
like,a,grey,wind
could,robb,have,returned,to,the,north
jon,shook,his,head
he,had,no,answers
it,was,too,hard,to,think
about,the,wolf,the,old,man,ygritte,any,of,it
clumsily,he,slid,down,off,the,mare’s,back
his,wounded,leg,buckled,under,him,and,he,had,to,swallow,a,scream
this,is,going,to,be,agony
the,arrow,had,to,come,out,though,and,nothing,good,could,come,of,waiting
jon,curled,his,hand,around,the,fletching,took,a,deep,breath,and,shoved,the,arrow,forward
he,grunted,then,cursed
it,hurt,so,much,he,had,to,stop
i,am,bleeding,like,a,butchered,pig,he,thought,but,there,was,nothing,to,be,done,for,it,until,the,arrow,was,out
he,grimaced,and,tried,again
and,soon,stopped,again,trembling
once,more
this,time,he,screamed,but,when,he,was,done,the,arrowhead,was,poking,through,the,front,of,his,thigh
jon,pushed,back,his,bloody,breeches,to,get,a,better,grip,grimaced,and,slowly,drew,the,shaft,through,his,leg
how,he,got,through,that,without,fainting,he,never,knew
he,lay,on,the,ground,afterward,clutching,his,prize,and,bleeding,quietly,too,weak,to,move
after,a,while,he,realized,that,if,he,did,not,make,himself,move,he,was,like,to,bleed,to,death
jon,crawled,to,the,shallow,stream,where,the,mare,was,drinking,washed,his,thigh,in,the,cold,water,and,bound,it,tight,with,a,strip,of,cloth,torn,from,his,cloak
he,washed,the,arrow,too,turning,it,in,his,hands
was,the,fletching,grey,or,white
ygritte,fletched,her,arrows,with,pale,grey,goose,feathers
did,she,loose,a,shaft,at,me,as,i,fled
jon,could,not,blame,her,for,that
he,wondered,if,she’d,been,aiming,for,him,or,the,horse
if,the,mare,had,gone,down,he,would,have,been,doomed
a,lucky,thing,my,leg,got,in,the,way,he,muttered
he,rested,for,a,while,to,let,the,horse,graze
she,did,not,wander,far
that,was,good
hobbled,with,a,bad,leg,he,could,never,have,caught,her
it,was,all,he,could,do,to,force,himself,back,to,his,feet,and,climb,onto,her,back
how,did,i,ever,mount,her,before,without,saddle,or,stirrups,and,a,sword,in,one,hand
that,was,another,question,he,could,not,answer
thunder,rumbled,softly,in,the,distance,but,above,him,the,clouds,were,breaking,up
jon,searched,the,sky,until,he,found,the,ice,dragon,then,turned,the,mare,north,for,the,wall,and,castle,black
the,throb,of,pain,in,his,thigh,muscle,made,him,wince,as,he,put,his,heels,into,the,old,man’s,horse
i,am,going,home,he,told,himself
but,if,that,was,true,why,did,he,feel,so,hollow
he,rode,till,dawn,while,the,stars,stared,down,like,eyes
daenerys,her,dothraki,scouts,had,told,her,how,it,was,but,dany,wanted,to,see,for,herself
ser,jorah,mormont,rode,with,her,through,a,birchwood,forest,and,up,a,slanting,sandstone,ridge
near,enough,he,warned,her,at,the,crest
dany,reined,in,her,mare,and,looked,across,the,fields,to,where,the,yunkish,host,lay,athwart,her,path
whitebeard,had,been,teaching,her,how,best,to,count,the,numbers,of,a,foe
five,thousand,she,said,after,a,moment

easily,ser,jorah,said

we,might,win,a,battle,here,but,at,such,cost,we,cannot,take,the,city
that,is,ever,a,risk,khaleesi
astapor,was,complacent,and,vulnerable
yunkai,is,forewarned
dany,considered
the,slaver,host,seemed,small,compared,to,her,own,numbers,but,the,sellswords,were,ahorse
she’d,ridden,too,long,with,dothraki,not,to,have,a,healthy,respect,for,what,mounted,warriors,could,do,to,foot
the,unsullied,could,withstand,their,charge,but,my,freedmen,will,be,slaughtered
the,slavers,like,to,talk,she,said

and,invite,the,captains,of,the,sellsword,companies,to,call,on,me,as,well
but,not,together
the,stormcrows,at,midday,the,second,sons,two,hours,later
as,you,wish,ser,jorah,said
but,if,they,do,not,come,they’ll,come
they,will,be,curious,to,see,the,dragons,and,hear,what,i,might,have,to,say,and,the,clever,ones,will,see,it,for,a,chance,to,gauge,my,strength
she,wheeled,her,silver,mare,about
i’ll,await,them,in,my,pavilion
slate,skies,and,brisk,winds,saw,dany,back,to,her,host
the,deep,ditch,that,would,encircle,her,camp,was,already,half,dug,and,the,woods,were,full,of,unsullied,lopping,branches,off,birch,trees,to,sharpen,into,stakes
the,eunuchs,could,not,sleep,in,an,unfortified,camp,or,so,grey,worm,insisted

yunkai,has,girded,up,her,loins,for,battle
this,is,good,your,grace
these,ones,thirst,for,blood
when,she,had,commanded,the,unsullied,to,choose,officers,from,amongst,themselves,grey,worm,had,been,their,overwhelming,choice,for,the,highest,rank
dany,had,put,ser,jorah,over,him,to,train,him,for,command,and,the,exile,knight,said,that,so,far,the,young,eunuch,was,hard,but,fair,quick,to,learn,tireless,and,utterly,unrelenting,in,his,attention,to,detail
the,wise,masters,have,assembled,a,slave,army,to,meet,us
a,slave,in,yunkai,learns,the,way,of,seven,sighs,and,the,sixteen,seats,of,pleasure,your,grace
the,unsullied,learn,the,way,of,the,three,spears
your,grey,worm,hopes,to,show,you
one,of,the,first,things,dany,had,done,after,the,fall,of,astapor,was,abolish,the,custom,of,giving,the,unsullied,new,slave,names,every,day
most,of,those,born,free,had,returned,to,their,birth,names,those,who,still,remembered,them,at,least
others,had,called,themselves,after,heroes,or,gods,and,sometimes,weapons,gems,and,even,flowers,which,resulted,in,soldiers,with,some,very,peculiar,names,to,dany’s,ears
grey,worm,had,remained,grey,worm
when,she,asked,him,why,he,said,it,is,a,lucky,name
the,name,this,one,was,born,to,was,accursed
that,was,the,name,he,had,when,he,was,taken,for,a,slave
but,grey,worm,is,the,name,this,one,drew,the,day,daenerys,stormborn,set,him,free
if,battle,is,joined,let,grey,worm,show,wisdom,as,well,as,valor,dany,told,him

within,the,perimeter,the,unsullied,had,established,the,tents,were,going,up,in,orderly,rows,with,her,own,tall,golden,pavilion,at,the,center
a,second,encampment,lay,close,beyond,her,own,five,times,the,size,sprawling,and,chaotic,this,second,camp,had,no,ditches,no,tents,no,sentries,no,horselines
those,who,had,horses,or,mules,slept,beside,them,for,fear,they,might,be,stolen
goats,sheep,and,half-starved,dogs,wandered,freely,amongst,hordes,of,women,children,and,old,men
dany,had,left,astapor,in,the,hands,of,a,council,of,former,slaves,led,by,a,healer,a,scholar,and,a,priest
wise,men,all,she,thought,and,just
yet,even,so,tens,of,thousands,preferred,to,follow,her,to,yunkai,rather,than,remain,behind,in,astapor
i,gave,them,the,city,and,most,of,them,were,too,frightened,to,take,it
the,raggle-taggle,host,of,freedmen,dwarfed,her,own,but,they,were,more,burden,than,benefit
perhaps,one,in,a,hundred,had,a,donkey,a,camel,or,an,ox,most,carried,weapons,looted,from,some,slaver’s,armory,but,only,one,in,ten,was,strong,enough,to,fight,and,none,was,trained
they,ate,the,land,bare,as,they,passed,like,locusts,in,sandals
yet,dany,could,not,bring,herself,to,abandon,them,as,ser,jorah,and,her,bloodriders,urged
i,told,them,they,were,free
i,cannot,tell,them,now,they,are,not,free,to,join,me
she,gazed,at,the,smoke,rising,from,their,cookfires,and,swallowed,a,sigh
she,might,have,the,best,footsoldiers,in,the,world,but,she,also,had,the,worst
arstan,whitebeard,stood,outside,the,entrance,of,her,tent,while,strong,belwas,sat,crosslegged,on,the,grass,nearby,eating,a,bowl,of,figs
on,the,march,the,duty,of,guarding,her,fell,upon,their,shoulders
she,had,made,jhogo,aggo,and,rakharo,her,kos,as,well,as,her,bloodriders,and,just,now,she,needed,them,more,to,command,her,dothraki,than,to,protect,her,person
her,khalasar,was,tiny,some,thirty-odd,mounted,warriors,and,most,of,them,braidless,boys,and,bentback,old,men
yet,they,were,all,the,horse,she,had,and,she,dared,not,go,without,them
the,unsullied,might,be,the,finest,infantry,in,all,the,world,as,ser,jorah,claimed,but,she,needed,scouts,and,outriders,as,well
yunkai,will,have,war,dany,told,whitebeard,inside,the,pavilion

explain,to,me,how,you,propose,to,defeat,ten,thousand,unsullied,with,your,five,hundred
innocent,as,i,am,these,odds,seem,poor,to,me
the,second,sons,have,faced,worse,odds,and,won
the,second,sons,have,faced,worse,odds,and,run

or,do,you,deny,it
that,was,many,and,more,years,ago,before,the,second,sons,were,led,by,the,titan’s,bastard

he,will,drink,three,toasts,to,your,health,tonight,and,rape,you,on,the,morrow
the,old,man’s,right,for,once,ser,jorah,said
the,second,sons,are,an,old,company,and,not,without,valor,but,under,mero,they’ve,turned,near,as,bad,as,the,brave,companions
the,man,is,as,dangerous,to,his,employers,as,to,his,foes
that’s,why,you,find,him,out,here
none,of,the,free,cities,will,hire,him,any,longer
it,is,not,his,reputation,that,i,want,it’s,his,five,hundred,horse
what,of,the,stormcrows,is,there,any,hope,there
no,ser,jorah,said,bluntly
that,prendahl,is,ghiscari,by,blood
likely,he,had,kin,in,astapor
a,pity
well,perhaps,we,will,not,need,to,fight
let,us,wait,and,hear,what,the,yunkai’i,have,to,say
the,envoys,from,yunkai,arrived,as,the,sun,was,going,down,fifty,men,on,magnificent,black,horses,and,one,on,a,great,white,camel
their,helms,were,twice,as,tall,as,their,heads,so,as,not,to,crush,the,bizarre,twists,and,towers,and,shapes,of,their,oiled,hair,beneath
they,dyed,their,linen,skirts,and,tunics,a,deep,yellow,and,sewed,copper,disks,to,their,cloaks
the,man,on,the,white,camel,named,himself,grazdan,mo,eraz
lean,and,hard,he,had,a,white,smile,such,as,kraznys,had,worn,until,drogon,burned,off,his,face
his,hair,was,drawn,up,in,a,unicorn’s,horn,that,jutted,from,his,brow,and,his,tokar,was,fringed,with,golden,myrish,lace
ancient,and,glorious,is,yunkai,the,queen,of,cities,he,said,when,dany,welcomed,him,to,her,tent
our,walls,are,strong,our,nobles,proud,and,fierce,our,common,folk,without,fear
ours,is,the,blood,of,ancient,ghis,whose,empire,was,old,when,valyria,was,yet,a,squalling,child

grazdan,shrugged,expansively
if,blood,is,what,you,wish,let,it,flow
i,am,told,you,have,freed,your,eunuchs
freedom,means,as,much,to,an,unsullied,as,a,hat,to,a,haddock
he,smiled,at,grey,worm,but,the,eunuch,might,have,been,made,of,stone
those,who,survive,we,shall,enslave,again,and,use,to,retake,astapor,from,the,rabble
we,can,make,a,slave,of,you,as,well,do,not,doubt,it
there,are,pleasure,houses,in,lys,and,tyrosh,where,men,would,pay,handsomely,to,bed,the,last,targaryen
it,is,good,to,see,you,know,who,i,am,said,dany,mildly
i,pride,myself,on,my,knowledge,of,the,savage,senseless,west
grazdan,spread,his,hands,a,gesture,of,conciliation
and,yet,why,should,we,speak,thus,harshly,to,one,another
it,is,true,that,you,committed,savageries,in,astapor,but,we,yunkai’i,are,a,most,forgiving,people
your,quarrel,is,not,with,us,your,grace
why,squander,your,strength,against,our,mighty,walls,when,you,will,need,every,man,to,regain,your,father’s,throne,in,far,westeros
yunkai,wishes,you,only,well,in,that,endeavor
and,to,prove,the,truth,of,that,i,have,brought,you,a,gift
he,clapped,his,hands,and,two,of,his,escort,came,forward,bearing,a,heavy,cedar,chest,bound,in,bronze,and,gold
they,set,it,at,her,feet
fifty,thousand,golden,marks,grazdan,said,smoothly
yours,as,a,gesture,of,friendship,from,the,wise,masters,of,yunkai
gold,given,freely,is,better,than,plunder,bought,with,blood,surely
so,i,say,to,you,daenerys,targaryen,take,this,chest,and,go
dany,pushed,open,the,lid,of,the,chest,with,a,small,slippered,foot
it,was,full,of,gold,coins,just,as,the,envoy,said
she,grabbed,a,handful,and,let,them,run,through,her,fingers
they,shone,brightly,as,they,tumbled,and,fell,new,minted,most,of,them,stamped,with,a,stepped,pyramid,on,one,face,and,the,harpy,of,ghis,on,the,other
very,pretty
i,wonder,how,many,chests,like,this,i,shall,find,when,i,take,your,city
he,chuckled
none,for,that,you,shall,never,do
i,have,a,gift,for,you,as,well

these,they,shall,be,allowed,to,choose,freely,from,among,their,masters’,possessions,as,payment,for,their,years,of,servitude
when,all,the,slaves,have,departed,you,will,open,your,gates,and,allow,my,unsullied,to,enter,and,search,your,city,to,make,certain,none,remain,in,bondage
if,you,do,this,yunkai,will,not,be,burned,or,plundered,and,none,of,your,people,shall,be,molested
the,wise,masters,will,have,the,peace,they,desire,and,will,have,proved,themselves,wise,indeed

it,touched,the,drape,of,grazdan’s,tokar,and,the,silk,caught,in,half,a,heartbeat
golden,marks,spilled,across,the,carpets,as,the,envoy,stumbled,over,the,chest,shouting,curses,and,beating,at,his,arm,until,whitebeard,flung,a,flagon,of,water,over,him,to,douse,the,flames

a,fine,black,night,thought,dany
the,fires,burned,all,around,her,small,orange,stars,strewn,across,hill,and,field
ser,jorah,she,said,summon,my,bloodriders
dany,seated,herself,on,a,mound,of,cushions,to,await,them,her,dragons,all,about,her
when,they,were,assembled,she,said,an,hour,past,midnight,should,be,time,enough

we,will,take,them,under,cover,of,this,darkness
they,will,have,scouts,watching,for,us
and,in,the,dark,they,will,see,hundreds,of,campfires,burning,said,dany
if,they,see,anything,at,all
khaleesi,said,jhogo,i,will,deal,with,these,scouts
they,are,no,riders,only,slavers,on,horses

it,took,an,hour,to,work,out,all,the,details
now,begins,the,most,dangerous,time,dany,thought,as,her,captains,departed,to,their,commands
she,could,only,pray,that,the,gloom,of,the,night,would,hide,her,preparations,from,the,foe
near,midnight,she,got,a,scare,when,ser,jorah,bulled,his,way,past,strong,belwas
the,unsullied,caught,one,of,the,sellswords,trying,to,sneak,into,the,camp
a,spy
that,frightened,her

it’s,the,yellow,fool,with,the,blue,hair
daario,naharis
that,one
i’ll,hear,him,then
when,the,exile,knight,delivered,him,she,asked,herself,whether,two,men,had,ever,been,so,different
the,tyroshi,was,fair,where,ser,jorah,was,swarthy,lithe,where,the,knight,was,brawny,graced,with,flowing,locks,where,the,other,was,balding,yet,smooth-skinned,where,mormont,was,hairy
and,her,knight,dressed,plainly,while,this,other,made,a,peacock,look,drab,though,he,had,thrown,a,heavy,black,cloak,over,his,bright,yellow,finery,for,this,visit

the,stormcrows,are,yours
a,golden,tooth,gleamed,in,his,mouth,when,he,smiled
and,so,is,daario,naharis
dany,was,dubious
if,this,tyroshi,had,come,to,spy,this,declaration,might,be,no,more,than,a,desperate,plot,to,save,his,head
what,do,prendahl,na,ghezn,and,sallor,say,of,this
little
daario,upended,the,sack,and,the,heads,of,sallor,the,bald,and,prendahl,na,ghezn,spilled,out,upon,her,carpets
my,gifts,to,the,dragon,queen
viserion,sniffed,the,blood,leaking,from,prendahl’s,neck,and,let,loose,a,gout,of,flame,that,took,the,dead,man,full,in,the,face,blackening,and,blistering,his,bloodless,cheeks
drogon,and,rhaegal,stirred,at,the,smell,of,roasted,meat
you,did,this
dany,asked,queasily
none,other
if,her,dragons,discomfited,daario,naharis,he,hid,it,well
for,all,the,mind,he,paid,them,they,might,have,been,three,kittens,playing,with,a,mouse
why
because,you,are,so,beautiful
his,hands,were,large,and,strong,and,there,was,something,in,his,hard,blue,eyes,and,great,curving,nose,that,suggested,the,fierceness,of,some,splendid,bird,of,prey
prendahl,talked,too,much,and,said,too,little
his,garb,rich,as,it,was,had,seen,hard,wear,salt,stains,patterned,his,boots,the,enamel,of,his,nails,was,chipped,his,lace,was,soiled,by,sweat,and,she,could,see,where,the,end,of,his,cloak,was,fraying
and,sallor,picked,his,nose,as,if,his,snot,was,gold
he,stood,with,his,hands,crossed,at,the,wrists,his,palms,resting,on,the,pommels,of,his,blades,a,curving,dothraki,arakh,on,his,left,hip,a,myrish,stiletto,on,his,right
their,hilts,were,a,matched,pair,of,golden,women,naked,and,wanton
are,you,skilled,in,the,use,of,those,handsome,blades
dany,asked,him
prendahl,and,sallor,would,tell,you,so,if,dead,men,could,talk
i,count,no,day,as,lived,unless,i,have,loved,a,woman,slain,a,foeman,and,eaten,a,fine,meal
and,the,days,that,i,have,lived,are,as,numberless,as,the,stars,in,the,sky
i,make,of,slaughter,a,thing,of,beauty,and,many,a,tumbler,and,fire,dancer,has,wept,to,the,gods,that,they,might,be,half,so,quick,a,quarter,so,graceful
i,would,tell,you,the,names,of,all,the,men,i,have,slain,but,before,i,could,finish,your,dragons,would,grow,large,as,castles,the,walls,of,yunkai,would,crumble,into,yellow,dust,and,winter,would,come,and,go,and,come,again
dany,laughed
she,liked,the,swagger,she,saw,in,this,daario,naharis
draw,your,sword,and,swear,it,to,my,service
in,a,blink,daario’s,arakh,was,free,of,its,sheath

how,can,you,know,that

you,have,a,battle,to,fight,and,win
when,he,was,gone,dany,threw,herself,down,on,her,pillows,beside,her,dragons
she,had,not,meant,to,be,so,sharp,with,ser,jorah,but,his,endless,suspicion,had,finally,woken,her,dragon
he,will,forgive,me,she,told,herself
i,am,his,liege
dany,found,herself,wondering,whether,he,was,right,about,daario
she,felt,very,lonely,all,of,a,sudden
mirri,maz,duur,had,promised,that,she,would,never,bear,a,living,child
house,targaryen,will,end,with,me
that,made,her,sad
you,must,be,my,children,she,told,the,dragons,my,three,fierce,children
arstan,says,dragons,live,longer,than,men,so,you,will,go,on,after,i,am,dead
drogon,looped,his,neck,around,to,nip,at,her,hand
his,teeth,were,very,sharp,but,he,never,broke,her,skin,when,they,played,like,this
dany,laughed,and,rolled,him,back,and,forth,until,he,roared,his,tail,lashing,like,a,whip
it,is,longer,than,it,was,she,saw,and,tomorrow,it,will,be,longer,still
they,grow,quickly,now,and,when,they,are,grown,i,shall,have,my,wings
mounted,on,a,dragon,she,could,lead,her,own,men,into,battle,as,she,had,in,astapor,but,as,yet,they,were,still,too,small,to,bear,her,weight
a,stillness,settled,over,her,camp,when,midnight,came,and,went
dany,remained,in,her,pavilion,with,her,maids,while,arstan,whitebeard,and,strong,belwas,kept,the,guard
the,waiting,is,the,hardest,part
to,sit,in,her,tent,with,idle,hands,while,her,battle,was,being,fought,without,her,made,dany,feel,half,a,child,again
the,hours,crept,by,on,turtle,feet
even,after,jhiqui,rubbed,the,knots,from,her,shoulders,dany,was,too,restless,for,sleep
missandei,offered,to,sing,her,a,lullaby,of,the,peaceful,people,but,dany,shook,her,head
bring,me,arstan,she,said
when,the,old,man,came,she,was,curled,up,inside,her,hrakkar,pelt,whose,musty,smell,still,reminded,her,of,drogo
i,cannot,sleep,when,men,are,dying,for,me,whitebeard,she,said
tell,me,more,of,my,brother,rhaegar,if,you,would
i,liked,the,tale,you,told,me,on,the,ship,of,how,he,decided,that,he,must,be,a,warrior
your,grace,is,kind,to,say,so
viserys,said,that,our,brother,won,many,tourneys
arstan,bowed,his,white,head,respectfully
it,is,not,meet,for,me,to,deny,his,grace’s,words
but
said,dany,sharply
tell,me
i,command,it
prince,rhaegar’s,prowess,was,unquestioned,but,he,seldom,entered,the,lists
he,never,loved,the,song,of,swords,the,way,that,robert,did,or,jaime,lannister
it,was,something,he,had,to,do,a,task,the,world,had,set,him
he,did,it,well,for,he,did,everything,well
that,was,his,nature
but,he,took,no,joy,in,it
men,said,that,he,loved,his,harp,much,better,than,his,lance
he,won,some,tourneys,surely,said,dany,disappointed
when,he,was,young,his,grace,rode,brilliantly,in,a,tourney,at,storm’s,end,defeating,lord,steffon,baratheon,lord,jason,mallister,the,red,viper,of,dorne,and,a,mystery,knight,who,proved,to,be,the,infamous,simon,toyne,chief,of,the,kingswood,outlaws
he,broke,twelve,lances,against,ser,arthur,dayne,that,day
was,he,the,champion,then
no,your,grace
that,honor,went,to,another,knight,of,the,kingsguard,who,unhorsed,prince,rhaegar,in,the,final,tilt
dany,did,not,want,to,hear,about,rhaegar,being,unhorsed
but,what,tourneys,did,my,brother,win
your,grace
the,old,man,hesitated
he,won,the,greatest,tourney,of,them,all
which,was,that
dany,demanded
the,tourney,lord,whent,staged,at,harrenhal,beside,the,gods,eye,in,the,year,of,the,false,spring
a,notable,event
besides,the,jousting,there,was,a,mêlée,in,the,old,style,fought,between,seven,teams,of,knights,as,well,as,archery,and,axe-throwing,a,horse,race,a,tournament,of,singers,a,mummer,show,and,many,feasts,and,frolics
lord,whent,was,as,open,handed,as,he,was,rich
the,lavish,purses,he,proclaimed,drew,hundreds,of,challengers
even,your,royal,father,came,to,harrenhal,when,he,had,not,left,the,red,keep,for,long,years
the,greatest,lords,and,mightiest,champions,of,the,seven,kingdoms,rode,in,that,tourney,and,the,prince,of,dragonstone,bested,them,all
but,that,was,the,tourney,when,he,crowned,lyanna,stark,as,queen,of,love,and,beauty
said,dany
princess,elia,was,there,his,wife,and,yet,my,brother,gave,the,crown,to,the,stark,girl,and,later,stole,her,away,from,her,betrothed
how,could,he,do,that
did,the,dornish,woman,treat,him,so,ill
it,is,not,for,such,as,me,to,say,what,might,have,been,in,your,brother’s,heart,your,grace
the,princess,elia,was,a,good,and,gracious,lady,though,her,health,was,ever,delicate
dany,pulled,the,lion,pelt,tighter,about,her,shoulders
viserys,said,once,that,it,was,my,fault,for,being,born,too,late
she,had,denied,it,hotly,she,remembered,going,so,far,as,to,tell,viserys,that,it,was,his,fault,for,not,being,born,a,girl
he,beat,her,cruelly,for,that,insolence
if,i,had,been,born,more,timely,he,said,rhaegar,would,have,married,me,instead,of,elia,and,it,would,all,have,come,out,different
if,rhaegar,had,been,happy,in,his,wife,he,would,not,have,needed,the,stark,girl
perhaps,so,your,grace
whitebeard,paused,a,moment
but,i,am,not,certain,it,was,in,rhaegar,to,be,happy
you,make,him,sound,so,sour,dany,protested
not,sour,no,but
there,was,a,melancholy,to,prince,rhaegar,a,sense
the,old,man,hesitated,again
say,it,she,urged
a,sense


of,doom
he,was,born,in,grief,my,queen,and,that,shadow,hung,over,him,all,his,days
viserys,had,spoken,of,rhaegar’s,birth,only,once
perhaps,the,tale,saddened,him,too,much
it,was,the,shadow,of,summerhall,that,haunted,him,was,it,not
yes
and,yet,summerhall,was,the,place,the,prince,loved,best
he,would,go,there,from,time,to,time,with,only,his,harp,for,company
even,the,knights,of,the,kingsguard,did,not,attend,him,there
he,liked,to,sleep,in,the,ruined,hall,beneath,the,moon,and,stars,and,whenever,he,came,back,he,would,bring,a,song
when,you,heard,him,play,his,high,harp,with,the,silver,strings,and,sing,of,twilights,and,tears,and,the,death,of,kings,you,could,not,but,feel,that,he,was,singing,of,himself,and,those,he,loved
what,of,the,usurper
did,he,play,sad,songs,as,well
arstan,chuckled
robert
robert,liked,songs,that,made,him,laugh,the,bawdier,the,better
he,only,sang,when,he,was,drunk,and,then,it,was,like,to,be,a,cask,of,ale’,or,fifty-four,tuns’,or,the,bear,and,the,maiden,fair,’,robert,was,much,as,one,her,dragons,lifted,their,heads,and,roared
horses
dany,leapt,to,her,feet,clutching,the,lion,pelt
outside,she,heard,strong,belwas,bellow,something,and,then,other,voices,and,the,sounds,of,many,horses
irri,go,see,who
the,tent,flap,pushed,open,and,ser,jorah,mormont,entered
he,was,dusty,and,spattered,with,blood,but,otherwise,none,the,worse,for,battle
the,exile,knight,went,to,one,knee,before,dany,and,said,your,grace,i,bring,you,victory
the,stormcrows,turned,their,cloaks,the,slaves,broke,and,the,second,sons,were,too,drunk,to,fight,just,as,you,said
two,hundred,dead,yunkai’i,for,the,most,part
their,slaves,threw,down,their,spears,and,ran,and,their,sellswords,yielded
we,have,several,thousand,captives
our,own,losses
a,dozen
if,that,many
only,then,did,she,allow,herself,to,smile
rise,my,good,brave,bear

or,the,titan’s,bastard
grazdan,went,to,yunkai,to,deliver,your,terms

sellsword,or,slave,spare,all,those,who,will,pledge,me,their,faith
if,enough,of,the,second,sons,will,join,us,keep,the,company,intact
the,next,day,they,marched,the,last,three,leagues,to,yunkai
the,city,was,built,of,yellow,bricks,instead,of,red,elsewise,it,was,astapor,all,over,again,with,the,same,crumbling,walls,and,high,stepped,pyramids,and,a,great,harpy,mounted,above,its,gates
the,wall,and,towers,swarmed,with,crossbowmen,and,slingers
ser,jorah,and,grey,worm,deployed,her,men,irri,and,jhiqui,raised,her,pavilion,and,dany,sat,down,to,wait
on,the,morning,of,the,third,day,the,city,gates,swung,open,and,a,line,of,slaves,began,to,emerge
dany,mounted,her,silver,to,greet,them
as,they,passed,little,missandei,told,them,that,they,owed,their,freedom,to,daenerys,stormborn,the,unburnt,queen,of,the,seven,kingdoms,of,westeros,and,mother,of,dragons
mhysa

more,slaves,were,streaming,from,the,gates,every,moment,and,as,they,came,they,took,up,the,call
they,were,running,toward,her,now,pushing,stumbling,wanting,to,touch,her,hand,to,stroke,her,horse’s,mane,to,kiss,her,feet

and,so,lem,woke,tom,sevenstrings,beneath,his,furs,and,brought,him,yawning,to,the,fireside,with,his,woodharp,in,hand
the,same,song,as,before
he,asked
oh,aye
my,jenny’s,song
is,there,another
and,so,he,sang,and,the,dwarf,woman,closed,her,eyes,and,rocked,slowly,back,and,forth,murmuring,the,words,and,crying
thoros,took,arya,firmly,by,the,hand,and,drew,her,aside
let,her,savor,her,song,in,peace,he,said
it,is,all,she,has,left
i,wasn’t,going,to,hurt,her,arya,thought
what,did,she,mean,about,the,twins
my,mother’s,at,riverrun,isn’t,she
she,was
the,red,priest,rubbed,beneath,his,chin
a,wedding,she,said
we,shall,see
whenever,she,is,lord,beric,will,find,her,though
not,long,after,the,sky,opened
lightning,cracked,and,thunder,rolled,across,the,hills,and,the,rain,fell,in,blinding,sheets
the,dwarf,woman,vanished,as,suddenly,as,she,had,appeared,while,the,outlaws,gathered,branches,and,threw,up,crude,shelters
it,rained,all,through,that,night,and,come,morning,ned,lem,and,watty,the,miller,awoke,with,chills
watty,could,not,keep,his,breakfast,down,and,young,ned,was,feverish,and,shivering,by,turns,with,skin,clammy,to,the,touch
there,was,an,abandoned,village,half,a,day’s,ride,to,the,north,notch,told,lord,beric,they’d,find,better,shelter,there,a,place,to,wait,out,the,worst,of,the,rains
so,they,dragged,themselves,back,into,the,saddles,and,urged,their,horses,down,the,great,hill
the,rains,did,not,let,up
they,rode,through,woods,and,fields,fording,swollen,streams,where,the,rushing,water,came,up,to,the,bellies,of,their,horses
arya,pulled,up,the,hood,of,her,cloak,and,hunched,down,sodden,and,shivering,but,determined,not,to,falter
merrit,and,mudge,were,soon,coughing,as,bad,as,watty,and,poor,ned,seemed,to,grow,more,miserable,with,every,mile
when,i,wear,my,helm,the,rain,beats,against,the,steel,and,gives,me,headaches,he,complained
but,when,i,take,it,off,my,hair,gets,soaked,and,sticks,to,my,face,and,in,my,mouth
you,have,a,knife,gendry,suggested
if,your,hair,annoys,you,so,much,shave,your,bloody,head
he,doesn’t,like,ned
the,squire,seemed,nice,enough,to,arya,maybe,a,little,shy,but,good-natured
she,had,always,heard,that,dornishmen,were,small,and,swarthy,with,black,hair,and,small,black,eyes,but,ned,had,big,blue,eyes,so,dark,that,they,looked,almost,purple
and,his,hair,was,a,pale,blond,more,ash,than,honey
how,long,have,you,been,lord,beric’s,squire
she,asked,to,take,his,mind,from,his,misery
he,took,me,for,his,page,when,he,espoused,my,aunt
he,coughed
i,was,seven,but,when,i,turned,ten,he,raised,me,to,squire
i,won,a,prize,once,riding,at,rings
i,never,learned,the,lance,but,i,could,beat,you,with,a,sword,said,arya
have,you,killed,anyone
that,seemed,to,startle,him
i’m,only,twelve
i,killed,a,boy,when,i,was,eight,arya,almost,said,but,she,thought,she’d,better,not
you’ve,been,in,battles,though
yes
he,did,not,sound,very,proud,of,it
i,was,at,the,mummer’s,ford
when,lord,beric,fell,into,the,river,i,dragged,him,up,onto,the,bank,so,he,wouldn’t,drown,and,stood,over,him,with,my,sword
i,never,had,to,fight,though
he,had,a,broken,lance,sticking,out,of,him,so,no,one,bothered,us
when,we,regrouped,green,gergen,helped,pull,his,lordship,back,onto,a,horse
arya,was,remembering,the,stableboy,at,king’s,landing
after,him,there’d,been,that,guard,whose,throat,she,cut,at,harrenhal,and,ser,amory’s,men,at,that,holdfast,by,the,lake
she,didn’t,know,if,weese,and,chiswyck,counted,or,the,ones,who’d,died,on,account,of,the,weasel,soup
all,of,a,sudden,she,felt,very,sad
my,father,was,called,ned,too,she,said
i,know
i,saw,him,at,the,hand’s,tourney
i,wanted,to,go,up,and,speak,with,him,but,i,couldn’t,think,what,to,say
ned,shivered,beneath,his,cloak,a,sodden,length,of,pale,purple
were,you,at,the,tourney
i,saw,your,sister,there
ser,loras,tyrell,gave,her,a,rose
she,told,me
it,all,seemed,so,long,ago
her,friend,jeyne,poole,fell,in,love,with,your,lord,beric
he’s,promised,to,my,aunt
ned,looked,uncomfortable
that,was,before,though
before,he

died
she,thought,as,ned’s,voice,trailed,off,into,an,awkward,silence
their,horses’,hooves,made,sucking,sounds,as,they,pulled,free,of,the,mud
my,lady
ned,said,at,last
you,have,a,baseborn,brother
jon,snow
he’s,with,the,night’s,watch,on,the,wall
maybe,i,should,go,to,the,wall,instead,of,riverrun
jon,wouldn’t,care,who,i,killed,or,whether,i,brushed,my,hair
jon,looks,like,me,even,though,he’s,bastard-born
he,used,to,muss,my,hair,and,call,me,little,sister,’,arya,missed,jon,most,of,all
just,saying,his,name,made,her,sad
how,do,you,know,about,jon
he,is,my,milk,brother
brother
arya,did,not,understand
but,you’re,from,dorne
how,could,you,and,jon,be,blood
milk,brothers
not,blood
my,lady,mother,had,no,milk,when,i,was,little,so,wylla,had,to,nurse,me
arya,was,lost
who’s,wylla
jon,snow’s,mother
he,never,told,you
she’s,served,us,for,years,and,years
since,before,i,was,born
jon,never,knew,his,mother
not,even,her,name
arya,gave,ned,a,wary,look
you,know,her
truly
is,he,making,mock,of,me
if,you,lie,i’ll,punch,your,face
wylla,was,my,wetnurse,he,repeated,solemnly
i,swear,it,on,the,honor,of,my,house
you,have,a,house
that,was,stupid,he,was,a,squire,of,course,he,had,a,house
who,are,you
my,lady
ned,looked,embarrassed
i’m,edric,dayne,the
the,lord,of,starfall
behind,them,gendry,groaned
lords,and,ladies,he,proclaimed,in,a,disgusted,tone
arya,plucked,a,withered,crabapple,off,a,passing,branch,and,whipped,it,at,him,bouncing,it,off,his,thick,bull,head
ow,he,said
that,hurt
he,felt,the,skin,above,his,eye
what,kind,of,lady,throws,crabapples,at,people
the,bad,kind,said,arya,suddenly,contrite
she,turned,back,to,ned
i’m,sorry,i,didn’t,know,who,you,were
my,lord
the,fault,is,mine,my,lady
he,was,very,polite
jon,has,a,mother
wylla,her,name,is,wylla
she,would,need,to,remember,so,she,could,tell,him,the,next,time,she,saw,him
she,wondered,if,he,would,still,call,her,little,sister
i’m,not,so,little,anymore
he’d,have,to,call,me,something,else
maybe,once,she,got,to,riverrun,she,could,write,jon,a,letter,and,tell,him,what,ned,dayne,had,said
there,was,an,arthur,dayne,she,remembered
the,one,they,called,the,sword,of,the,morning
my,father,was,ser,arthur’s,elder,brother
lady,ashara,was,my,aunt
i,never,knew,her,though
she,threw,herself,into,the,sea,from,atop,the,palestone,sword,before,i,was,born
why,would,she,do,that
said,arya,startled
ned,looked,wary
maybe,he,was,afraid,that,she,was,going,to,throw,something,at,him
your,lord,father,never,spoke,of,her
he,said
the,lady,ashara,dayne,of,starfall
no
did,he,know,her
before,robert,was,king
she,met,your,father,and,his,brothers,at,harrenhal,during,the,year,of,the,false,spring
oh
arya,did,not,know,what,else,to,say
why,did,she,jump,in,the,sea,though
her,heart,was,broken
sansa,would,have,sighed,and,shed,a,tear,for,true,love,but,arya,just,thought,it,was,stupid
she,couldn’t,say,that,to,ned,though,not,about,his,own,aunt
did,someone,break,it
he,hesitated
perhaps,it’s,not,my,place
tell,me
he,looked,at,her,uncomfortably
my,aunt,allyria,says,lady,ashara,and,your,father,fell,in,love,at,harrenhal,that’s,not,so
he,loved,my,lady,mother
i’m,sure,he,did,my,lady,but,she,was,the,only,one,he,loved
he,must,have,found,that,bastard,under,a,cabbage,leaf,then,gendry,said,behind,them
arya,wished,she,had,another,crabapple,to,bounce,off,his,face
my,father,had,honor,she,said,angrily
and,we,weren’t,talking,to,you,anyway
why,don’t,you,go,back,to,stoney,sept,and,ring,that,girl’s,stupid,bells
gendry,ignored,that
at,least,your,father,raised,his,bastard,not,like,mine
i,don’t,even,know,my,father’s,name
some,smelly,drunk,i’d,wager,like,the,others,my,mother,dragged,home,from,the,alehouse
whenever,she,got,mad,at,me,she’d,say,if,your,father,was,here,he’d,beat,you,bloody,’,that’s,all,i,know,of,him
he,spat
well,if,he,was,here,now,might,be,i’d,beat,him,bloody
but,he’s,dead,i,figure,and,your,father’s,dead,too,so,what,does,it,matter,who,he,lay,with
it,mattered,to,arya,though,she,could,not,have,said,why
ned,was,trying,to,apologize,for,upsetting,her,but,she,did,not,want,to,hear,it
she,pressed,her,heels,into,her,horse,and,left,them,both
anguy,the,archer,was,riding,a,few,yards,ahead
when,she,caught,up,with,him,she,said,dornishmen,lie,don’t,they
they’re,famous,for,it
the,bowman,grinned
of,course,they,say,the,same,of,us,marchers,so,there,you,are
what’s,the,trouble,now
ned’s,a,good,lad
he’s,just,a,stupid,liar
arya,left,the,trail,leapt,a,rotten,log,and,splashed,across,a,streambed,ignoring,the,shouts,of,the,outlaws,behind,her
they,just,want,to,tell,me,more,lies
she,thought,about,trying,to,get,away,from,them,but,there,were,too,many,and,they,knew,these,lands,too,well
what,was,the,use,of,running,if,they,caught,you
it,was,harwin,who,rode,up,beside,her,in,the,end
where,do,you,think,you’re,going,milady
you,shouldn’t,run,off
there,are,wolves,in,these,woods,and,worse,things
i’m,not,afraid,she,said
that,boy,ned,said
aye,he,told,me
lady,ashara,dayne
it’s,an,old,tale,that,one
i,heard,it,once,at,winterfell,when,i,was,no,older,than,you,are,now
he,took,hold,of,her,bridle,firmly,and,turned,her,horse,around
i,doubt,there’s,any,truth,to,it
but,if,there,is,what,of,it
when,ned,met,this,dornish,lady,his,brother,brandon,was,still,alive,and,it,was,him,betrothed,to,lady,catelyn,so,there’s,no,stain,on,your,father’s,honor
there’s,nought,like,a,tourney,to,make,the,blood,run,hot,so,maybe,some,words,were,whispered,in,a,tent,of,a,night,who,can,say
words,or,kisses,maybe,more,but,where’s,the,harm,in,that
spring,had,come,or,so,they,thought,and,neither,one,of,them,was,pledged
she,killed,herself,though,said,arya,uncertainly
ned,says,she,jumped,from,a,tower,into,the,sea
so,she,did,harwin,admitted,as,he,led,her,back,but,that,was,for,grief,i’d,wager
she’d,lost,a,brother,the,sword,of,the,morning
he,shook,his,head
let,it,lie,my,lady
they’re,dead,all,of,them
let,it,lie
and,please,when,we,come,to,riverrun,say,naught,of,this,to,your,mother
the,village,was,just,where,notch,had,promised,it,would,be
they,took,shelter,in,a,grey,stone,stable
only,half,a,roof,remained,but,that,was,half,a,roof,more,than,any,other,building,in,the,village
it’s,not,a,village,it’s,only,black,stones,and,old,bones
did,the,lannisters,kill,the,people,who,lived,here
arya,asked,as,she,helped,anguy,dry,the,horses
no
he,pointed
look,at,how,thick,the,moss,grows,on,the,stones
no,one’s,moved,them,for,a,long,time
and,there’s,a,tree,growing,out,of,the,wall,there,see

this,was,lord,goodbrook’s,village
when,riverrun,declared,for,robert,goodbrook,stayed,loyal,to,the,king,so,lord,tully,came,down,on,him,with,fire,and,sword
after,the,trident,goodbrook’s,son,made,his,peace,with,robert,and,lord,hoster,but,that,didn’t,help,the,dead,none
a,silence,fell
gendry,gave,arya,a,queer,look,then,turned,away,to,brush,his,horse

soon,it,grew,almost,hot,inside,the,stable
thoros,sat,before,it,crosslegged,devouring,the,flames,with,his,eyes,just,as,he,had,atop,high,heart
arya,watched,him,closely,and,once,his,lips,moved,and,she,thought,she,heard,him,mutter,riverrun
lem,paced,back,and,forth,coughing,a,long,shadow,matching,him,stride,for,stride,while,tom,o’,sevens,pulled,off,his,boots,and,rubbed,his,feet

they,made,me,sing,the,name,day,boy’andthe,king,without,courage’,before,they,opened,that,gate
my,only,solace,was,that,three,of,them,died,laughing

he,lurched,to,his,feet,and,went,to,lord,beric
lem,and,tom,wasted,no,time,joining,them
arya,could,not,make,out,what,they,were,saying,but,the,singer,kept,glancing,at,her,and,one,time,lem,got,so,angry,he,pounded,a,fist,against,the,wall
that,was,when,lord,beric,gestured,for,her,to,come,closer
it,was,the,last,thing,she,wanted,to,do,but,harwin,put,a,hand,in,the,small,of,her,back,and,pushed,her,forward
she,took,two,steps,and,hesitated,full,of,dread
my,lord
she,waited,to,hear,what,lord,beric,would,say
tell,her,the,lightning,lord,commanded,thoros
the,red,priest,squatted,down,beside,her
my,lady,he,said,the,lord,granted,me,a,view,of,riverrun

a,final,word,hung,unspoken,in,the,air

she,wanted,riverrun,not,acorn,hall,she,wanted,her,mother,and,her,brother,robb,not,lady,smallwood,or,some,uncle,she,never,knew
whirling,she,broke,for,the,door,and,when,harwin,tried,to,grab,her,arm,she,spun,away,from,him,quick,as,a,snake
outside,the,stables,the,rain,was,still,falling,and,distant,lightning,flashed,in,the,west
arya,ran,as,fast,as,she,could
she,did,not,know,where,she,was,going,only,that,she,wanted,to,be,alone,away,from,all,the,voices,away,from,their,hollow,words,and,broken,promises
all,i,wanted,was,to,go,to,riverrun
it,was,her,own,fault,for,taking,gendry,and,hot,pie,with,her,when,she,left,harrenhal
she,would,have,been,better,alone
if,she,had,been,alone,the,outlaws,would,never,have,caught,her,and,she’d,be,with,robb,and,her,mother,by,now
they,were,never,my,pack
if,they,had,been,they,wouldn’t,leave,me
she,splashed,through,a,puddle,of,muddy,water
someone,was,shouting,her,name,harwin,probably,or,gendry,but,the,thunder,drowned,them,out,as,it,rolled,across,the,hills,half,a,heartbeat,behind,the,lightning

such,men,obeyed,without,question,but,the,deep,malignant,cruelty,of,the,brave,companions,was,not,a,part,of,their,nature

lord,bolton,had,accoutred,him,as,a,knight,preferring,to,ignore,the,missing,hand,that,made,such,warlike,garb,a,travesty
jaime,rode,with,sword,and,dagger,on,his,belt,shield,and,helm,hung,from,his,saddle,chainmail,under,a,dark,brown,surcoat
he,was,not,such,a,fool,as,to,show,the,lion,of,lannister,on,his,arms,though,nor,the,plain,white,blazon,that,was,his,right,as,a,sworn,brother,of,the,kingsguard
he,found,an,old,shield,in,the,armory,battered,and,splintered,the,chipped,paint,still,showing,most,of,the,great,black,bat,of,house,lothston,upon,a,field,of,silver,and,gold
the,lothstons,held,harrenhal,before,the,whents,and,had,been,a,powerful,family,in,their,day,but,they,had,died,out,ages,ago,so,no,one,was,likely,to,object,to,him,bearing,their,arms
he,would,be,no,one’s,cousin,no,one’s,enemy,no,one’s,sworn,sword
in,sum,no,one
they,left,through,harrenhal’s,smaller,eastern,gate,and,took,their,leave,of,roose,bolton,and,his,host,six,miles,farther,on,turning,south,to,follow,along,the,lake,road,for,a,time
walton,meant,to,avoid,the,kingsroad,as,long,as,he,could,preferring,the,farmer’s,tracks,and,game,trails,near,the,gods,eye
the,kingsroad,would,be,faster
jaime,was,anxious,to,return,to,cersei,as,quickly,as,he,could
if,they,made,haste,he,might,even,arrive,in,time,for,joffrey’s,wedding
i,want,no,trouble,said,steelshanks
gods,know,who,we’d,meet,along,that,kingsroad
no,one,you,need,fear,surely
you,have,two,hundred,men
aye
but,others,might,have,more
m’lord,said,to,bring,you,safe,to,your,lord,father,and,that’s,what,i,mean,to,do
i,have,come,this,way,before,jaime,reflected,a,few,miles,further,on,when,they,passed,a,deserted,mill,beside,the,lake
weeds,now,grew,where,once,the,miller’s,daughter,had,smiled,shyly,at,him,and,the,miller,himself,had,shouted,out,the,tourney’s,back,the,other,way,ser
as,if,i,had,not,known
king,aerys,made,a,great,show,of,jaime’s,investiture
he,said,his,vows,before,the,king’s,pavilion,kneeling,on,the,green,grass,in,white,armor,while,half,the,realm,looked,on
when,ser,gerold,hightower,raised,him,up,and,put,the,white,cloak,about,his,shoulders,a,roar,went,up,that,jaime,still,remembered,all,these,years,later
but,that,very,night,aerys,had,turned,sour,declaring,that,he,had,no,need,of,seven,kingsguard,here,at,harrenhal
jaime,was,commanded,to,return,to,king’s,landing,to,guard,the,queen,and,little,prince,viserys,who’d,remained,behind
even,when,the,white,bull,offered,to,take,that,duty,himself,so,jaime,might,compete,in,lord,whent’s,tourney,aerys,had,refused
he’ll,win,no,glory,here,the,king,had,said
he’s,mine,now,not,tywin’s
he’ll,serve,as,i,see,fit
i,am,the,king
i,rule,and,he’ll,obey
that,was,the,first,time,that,jaime,understood
it,was,not,his,skill,with,sword,and,lance,that,had,won,him,his,white,cloak,nor,any,feats,of,valor,he’d,performed,against,the,kingswood,brotherhood
aerys,had,chosen,him,to,spite,his,father,to,rob,lord,tywin,of,his,heir
even,now,all,these,years,later,the,thought,was,bitter
and,that,day,as,he’d,ridden,south,in,his,new,white,cloak,to,guard,an,empty,castle,it,had,been,almost,too,much,to,stomach
he,would,have,ripped,the,cloak,off,then,and,there,if,he,could,have,but,it,was,too,late
he,had,said,the,words,whilst,half,the,realm,looked,on,and,a,kingsguard,served,for,life
qyburn,fell,in,beside,him
is,your,hand,troubling,you
the,lack,of,my,hand,is,troubling,me
the,mornings,were,the,hardest
in,his,dreams,jaime,was,a,whole,man,and,each,dawn,he,would,lie,half-awake,and,feel,his,fingers,move
it,was,a,nightmare,some,part,of,him,would,whisper,refusing,to,believe,even,now,only,a,nightmare
but,then,he,would,open,his,eyes
i,understand,you,had,a,visitor,last,night,said,qyburn
i,trust,that,you,enjoyed,her
jaime,gave,him,a,cool,look
she,did,not,say,who,sent,her
the,maester,smiled,modestly
your,fever,was,largely,gone,and,i,thought,you,might,enjoy,a,bit,of,exercise
pia,is,quite,skilled,would,you,not,agree
and,so
willing
she,had,been,that,certainly
she,had,slipped,in,his,door,and,out,of,her,clothes,so,quickly,that,jaime,had,thought,he,was,still,dreaming
it,hadn’t,been,until,the,woman,slid,in,under,his,blankets,and,put,his,good,hand,on,her,breast,that,he,roused
she,was,a,pretty,little,thing,too
i,was,a,slip,of,a,girl,when,you,came,for,lord,whent’s,tourney,and,the,king,gave,you,your,cloak,she,confessed
you,were,so,handsome,all,in,white,and,everyone,said,what,a,brave,knight,you,were
sometimes,when,i’m,with,some,man,i,close,my,eyes,and,pretend,it’s,you,on,top,of,me,with,your,smooth,skin,and,gold,curls
i,never,truly,thought,i’d,have,you,though
sending,her,away,had,not,been,easy,after,that,but,jaime,had,done,it,all,the,same
i,have,a,woman,he,reminded,himself
do,you,send,girls,to,everyone,you,leech
he,asked,qyburn
more,often,lord,vargo,sends,them,to,me
he,likes,me,to,examine,them,before
well,suffice,it,to,say,that,once,he,loved,unwisely,and,he,has,no,wish,to,do,so,again
but,have,no,fear,pia,is,quite,healthy
as,is,your,maid,of,tarth
jaime,gave,him,a,sharp,look
brienne
yes
a,strong,girl,that,one
and,her,maidenhead,is,still,intact
as,of,last,night,at,least
qyburn,gave,a,chuckle
he,sent,you,to,examine,her
to,be,sure
he,is
fastidious,shall,we,say
does,this,concern,the,ransom
jaime,asked
does,her,father,require,proof,she,is,still,maiden
you,have,not,heard
qyburn,gave,a,shrug
we,had,a,bird,from,lord,selwyn
in,answer,to,mine
the,evenstar,offers,three,hundred,dragons,for,his,daughter’s,safe,return
i,had,told,lord,vargo,there,were,no,sapphires,on,tarth,but,he,will,not,listen
he,is,convinced,the,evenstar,intends,to,cheat,him
three,hundred,dragons,is,a,fair,ransom,for,a,knight
the,goat,should,take,what,he,can,get
the,goat,is,lord,of,harrenhal,and,the,lord,of,harrenhal,does,not,haggle
the,news,irritated,him,though,he,supposed,he,should,have,seen,it,coming
the,lie,spared,you,awhile,wench
be,grateful,for,that,much
if,her,maidenhead’s,as,hard,as,the,rest,of,her,the,goat,will,break,his,cock,off,trying,to,get,in,he,jested
brienne,was,tough,enough,to,survive,a,few,rapes,jaime,judged,though,if,she,resisted,too,vigorously,vargo,hoat,might,start,lopping,off,her,hands,and,feet
and,if,he,does,why,should,i,care
i,might,still,have,a,hand,if,she,had,let,me,have,my,cousin’s,sword,without,getting,stupid
he,had,almost,taken,off,her,leg,himself,with,that,first,stroke,of,his,but,after,that,she,had,given,him,more,than,he,wanted
hoat,may,not,know,how,freakish,strong,she,is
he,had,best,be,careful,or,she’ll,snap,that,skinny,neck,of,his,and,wouldn’t,that,be,sweet
qyburn’s,companionship,was,wearing,on,him
jaime,trotted,toward,the,head,of,the,column
a,round,little,tick,of,a,northman,name,of,nage,went,before,steelshanks,with,the,peace,banner,a,rainbow-striped,flag,with,seven,long,tails,on,a,staff,topped,by,a,seven-pointed,star
shouldn’t,you,northmen,have,a,different,sort,of,peace,banner
he,asked,walton
what,are,the,seven,to,you
southron,gods,the,man,said,but,it’s,a,southron,peace,we,need,to,get,you,safe,to,your,father
my,father
jaime,wondered,whether,lord,tywin,had,received,the,goat’s,demand,for,ransom,with,or,without,his,rotted,hand
what,is,a,swordsman,worth,without,his,sword,hand
half,the,gold,in,casterly,rock
three,hundred,dragons
or,nothing
his,father,had,never,been,unduly,swayed,by,sentiment
tywin,lannister’s,own,father,lord,tytos,had,once,imprisoned,an,unruly,bannerman,lord,tarbeck
the,redoubtable,lady,tarbeck,responded,by,capturing,three,lannisters,including,young,stafford,whose,sister,was,betrothed,to,cousin,tywin
send,back,my,lord,and,love,or,these,three,shall,answer,for,any,harm,that,comes,him,she,had,written,to,casterly,rock
young,tywin,suggested,his,father,oblige,by,sending,back,lord,tarbeck,in,three,pieces
lord,tytos,was,a,gentler,sort,of,lion,however,so,lady,tarbeck,won,a,few,more,years,for,her,muttonheaded,lord,and,stafford,wed,and,bred,and,blundered,on,till,oxcross
but,tywin,lannister,endured,eternal,as,casterly,rock
and,now,you,have,a,cripple,for,a,son,as,well,as,a,dwarf,my,lord
how,you,will,hate,that
the,road,led,them,through,a,burned,village
it,must,have,been,a,year,or,more,since,the,place,had,been,put,to,torch
the,hovels,stood,blackened,and,roofless,but,weeds,were,growing,waist,high,in,all,the,surrounding,fields
steelshanks,called,a,halt,to,allow,them,to,water,the,horses
i,know,this,place,too,jaime,thought,as,he,waited,by,the,well
there,had,been,a,small,inn,where,only,a,few,foundation,stones,and,a,chimney,now,stood,and,he,had,gone,in,for,a,cup,of,ale
a,dark-eyed,serving,wench,brought,him,cheese,and,apples,but,the,innkeep,had,refused,his,coin
it’s,an,honor,to,have,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,under,my,roof,ser,the,man,had,said
it’s,a,tale,i’ll,tell,my,grandchildren
jaime,looked,at,the,chimney,poking,out,of,the,weeds,and,wondered,whether,he,had,ever,gotten,those,grandchildren
did,he,tell,them,the,kingslayer,once,drank,his,ale,and,ate,his,cheese,and,apples,or,was,he,ashamed,to,admit,he,fed,the,likes,of,me
not,that,he,would,ever,know,whoever,burned,the,inn,had,likely,killed,the,grandchildren,as,well
he,could,feel,his,phantom,fingers,clench
when,steelshanks,said,that,perhaps,they,should,have,a,fire,and,a,bit,of,food,jaime,shook,his,head
i,mislike,this,place
we’ll,ride,on
by,evenfall,they,had,left,the,lake,to,follow,a,rutted,track,through,a,wood,of,oak,and,elm
jaime’s,stump,was,throbbing,dully,when,steelshanks,decided,to,make,camp
qyburn,had,brought,a,skin,of,dreamwine,thankfully
while,walton,set,the,watches,jaime,stretched,out,near,the,fire,and,propped,a,rolled-up,bearskin,against,a,stump,as,a,pillow,for,his,head
the,wench,would,have,told,him,he,had,to,eat,before,he,slept,to,keep,his,strength,up,but,he,was,more,tired,than,hungry
he,closed,his,eyes,and,hoped,to,dream,of,cersei
the,fever,dreams,were,all,so,vivid
naked,and,alone,he,stood,surrounded,by,enemies,with,stone,walls,all,around,him,pressing,close
the,rock,he,knew
he,could,feel,the,immense,weight,of,it,above,his,head
he,was,home
he,was,home,and,whole
he,held,his,right,hand,up,and,flexed,his,fingers,to,feel,the,strength,in,them
it,felt,as,good,as,sex
as,good,as,swordplay
four,fingers,and,a,thumb
he,had,dreamed,that,he,was,maimed,but,it,wasn’t,so
relief,made,him,dizzy
my,hand,my,good,hand
nothing,could,hurt,him,so,long,as,he,was,whole
around,him,stood,a,dozen,tall,dark,figures,in,cowled,robes,that,hid,their,faces
in,their,hands,were,spears
who,are,you
he,demanded,of,them
what,business,do,you,have,in,casterly,rock
they,gave,no,answer,only,prodded,him,with,the,points,of,their,spears
he,had,no,choice,but,to,descend
down,a,twisting,passageway,he,went,narrow,steps,carved,from,the,living,rock,down,and,down
i,must,go,up,he,told,himself
up,not,down
why,am,i,going,down
below,the,earth,his,doom,awaited,he,knew,with,the,certainty,of,dream,something,dark,and,terrible,lurked,there,something,that,wanted,him
jaime,tried,to,halt,but,their,spears,prodded,him,on
if,only,i,had,my,sword,nothing,could,harm,me
the,steps,ended,abruptly,on,echoing,darkness
jaime,had,the,sense,of,vast,space,before,him
he,jerked,to,a,halt,teetering,on,the,edge,of,nothingness
a,spearpoint,jabbed,at,the,small,of,the,back,shoving,him,into,the,abyss
he,shouted,but,the,fall,was,short
he,landed,on,his,hands,and,knees,upon,soft,sand,and,shallow,water
there,were,watery,caverns,deep,below,casterly,rock,but,this,one,was,strange,to,him
what,place,is,this
your,place
the,voice,echoed,it,was,a,hundred,voices,a,thousand,the,voices,of,all,the,lannisters,since,lann,the,clever,who’d,lived,at,the,dawn,of,days
but,most,of,all,it,was,his,father’s,voice,and,beside,lord,tywin,stood,his,sister,pale,and,beautiful,a,torch,burning,in,her,hand
joffrey,was,there,as,well,the,son,they’d,made,together,and,behind,them,a,dozen,more,dark,shapes,with,golden,hair
sister,why,has,father,brought,us,here
us
this,is,your,place,brother
this,is,your,darkness
her,torch,was,the,only,light,in,the,cavern
her,torch,was,the,only,light,in,the,world
she,turned,to,go
stay,with,me,jaime,pleaded
don’t,leave,me,here,alone
but,they,were,leaving
don’t,leave,me,in,the,dark
something,terrible,lived,down,here
give,me,a,sword,at,least
i,gave,you,a,sword,lord,tywin,said
it,was,at,his,feet
jaime,groped,under,the,water,until,his,hand,closed,upon,the,hilt
nothing,can,hurt,me,so,long,as,i,have,a,sword
as,he,raised,the,sword,a,finger,of,pale,flame,flickered,at,the,point,and,crept,up,along,the,edge,stopping,a,hand’s,breath,from,the,hilt
the,fire,took,on,the,color,of,the,steel,itself,so,it,burned,with,a,silvery-blue,light,and,the,gloom,pulled,back
crouching,listening,jaime,moved,in,a,circle,ready,for,anything,that,might,come,out,of,the,darkness
the,water,flowed,into,his,boots,ankle,deep,and,bitterly,cold
beware,the,water,he,told,himself
there,may,be,creatures,living,in,it,hidden,deeps
from,behind,came,a,great,splash
jaime,whirled,toward,the,sound
but,the,faint,light,revealed,only,brienne,of,tarth,her,hands,bound,in,heavy,chains
i,swore,to,keep,you,safe,the,wench,said,stubbornly

if,you,would,be,so,good
the,steel,links,parted,like,silk
a,sword,brienne,begged,and,there,it,was,scabbard,belt,and,all
she,buckled,it,around,her,thick,waist
the,light,was,so,dim,that,jaime,could,scarcely,see,her,though,they,stood,a,scant,few,feet,apart
in,this,light,she,could,almost,be,a,beauty,he,thought
in,this,light,she,could,almost,be,a,knight
brienne’s,sword,took,flame,as,well,burning,silvery,blue
the,darkness,retreated,a,little,more
the,flames,will,burn,so,long,as,you,live,he,heard,cersei,call
when,they,die,so,must,you
sister
he,shouted
stay,with,me
stay
there,was,no,reply,but,the,soft,sound,of,retreating,footsteps
brienne,moved,her,longsword,back,and,forth,watching,the,silvery,flames,shift,and,shimmer
beneath,her,feet,a,reflection,of,the,burning,blade,shone,on,the,surface,of,the,flat,black,water
she,was,as,tall,and,strong,as,he,remembered,yet,it,seemed,to,jaime,that,she,had,more,of,a,woman’s,shape,now

in,the,cool,silvery-blue,light,of,the,swords,the,big,wench,looked,pale,and,fierce
i,mislike,this,place
i’m,not,fond,of,it,myself
their,blades,made,a,little,island,of,light,but,all,around,them,stretched,a,sea,of,darkness,unending
my,feet,are,wet
we,could,go,back,the,way,they,brought,us
if,you,climbed,on,my,shoulders,you’d,have,no,trouble,reaching,that,tunnel,mouth
then,i,could,follow,cersei
he,could,feel,himself,growing,hard,at,the,thought,and,turned,away,so,brienne,would,not,see
listen
she,put,a,hand,on,his,shoulder,and,he,trembled,at,the,sudden,touch
she’s,warm
something,comes
brienne,lifted,her,sword,to,point,off,to,his,left
there,he,peered,into,the,gloom,until,he,saw,it,too

they,make,no,sound,jaime,realized
no,splashing,no,clink,of,mail,nor,clop,of,hoof
he,remembered,eddard,stark,riding,the,length,of,aerys’s,throne,room,wrapped,in,silence

they,were,armored,all,in,snow,it,seemed,to,him,and,ribbons,of,mist,swirled,back,from,their,shoulders
the,visors,of,their,helms,were,closed,but,jaime,lannister,did,not,need,to,look,upon,their,faces,to,know,them

the,shades,dismounted,from,their,ghostly,horses
when,they,drew,their,longswords,it,made,not,a,sound
he,was,going,to,burn,the,city,jaime,said

he,was,your,king,said,darry

the,fires,that,ran,along,the,blade,were,guttering,out,and,jaime,remembered,what,cersei,had,said
no
terror,closed,a,hand,about,his,throat
then,his,sword,went,dark,and,only,brienne’s,burned,as,the,ghosts,came,rushing,in
no,he,said,no,no,no
nooooooooo
heart,pounding,he,jerked,awake,and,found,himself,in,starry,darkness,amidst,a,grove,of,trees
he,could,taste,bile,in,his,mouth,and,he,was,shivering,with,sweat,hot,and,cold,at,once
when,he,looked,down,for,his,sword,hand,his,wrist,ended,in,leather,and,linen,wrapped,snug,around,an,ugly,stump
he,felt,sudden,tears,well,up,in,his,eyes
i,felt,it,i,felt,the,strength,in,my,fingers,and,the,rough,leather,of,the,sword’s,grip
my,hand
my,lord
qyburn,knelt,beside,him,his,fatherly,face,all,crinkly,with,concern
what,is,it
i,heard,you,cry,out
steelshanks,walton,stood,above,them,tall,and,dour
what,is,it
why,did,you,scream
a,dream
only,a,dream
jaime,stared,at,the,camp,around,him,lost,for,a,moment
i,was,in,the,dark,but,i,had,my,hand,back
he,looked,at,the,stump,and,felt,sick,all,over,again
there’s,no,place,like,that,beneath,the,rock,he,thought
his,stomach,was,sour,and,empty,and,his,head,was,pounding,where,he’d,pillowed,it,against,the,stump
qyburn,felt,his,brow
you,still,have,a,touch,of,fever
a,fever,dream
jaime,reached,up
help,me
steelshanks,took,him,by,his,good,hand,and,pulled,him,to,his,feet
another,cup,of,dreamwine
asked,qyburn
no
i’ve,dreamt,enough,this,night
he,wondered,how,long,it,was,till,dawn
somehow,he,knew,that,if,he,closed,his,eyes,he,would,be,back,in,that,dark,wet,place,again
milk,of,the,poppy,then
and,something,for,your,fever
you,are,still,weak,my,lord
you,need,to,sleep
to,rest
that,is,the,last,thing,i,mean,to,do
the,moonlight,glimmered,pale,upon,the,stump,where,jaime,had,rested,his,head
the,moss,covered,it,so,thickly,he,had,not,noticed,before,but,now,he,saw,that,the,wood,was,white
it,made,him,think,of,winterfell,and,ned,stark’s,heart,tree
it,was,not,him,he,thought
it,was,never,him
but,the,stump,was,dead,and,so,was,stark,and,so,were,all,the,others,prince,rhaegar,and,ser,arthur,and,the,children
and,aerys
aerys,is,most,dead,of,all
do,you,believe,in,ghosts,maester
he,asked,qyburn
the,man’s,face,grew,strange
once,at,the,citadel,i,came,into,an,empty,room,and,saw,an,empty,chair
yet,i,knew,a,woman,had,been,there,only,a,moment,before
the,cushion,was,dented,where,she’d,sat,the,cloth,was,still,warm,and,her,scent,lingered,in,the,air
if,we,leave,our,smells,behind,us,when,we,leave,a,room,surely,something,of,our,souls,must,remain,when,we,leave,this,life
qyburn,spread,his,hands
the,archmaesters,did,not,like,my,thinking,though
well,marwyn,did,but,he,was,the,only,one
jaime,ran,his,fingers,through,his,hair
walton,he,said,saddle,the,horses
i,want,to,go,back
back
steelshanks,regarded,him,dubiously
he,thinks,i’ve,gone,mad
and,perhaps,i,have
i,left,something,at,harrenhal
lord,vargo,holds,it,now
him,and,his,bloody,mummers
you,have,twice,the,men,he,does
if,i,don’t,serve,you,up,to,your,father,as,commanded,lord,bolton,will,have,my,hide
we,press,on,to,king’s,landing
once,jaime,might,have,countered,with,a,smile,and,a,threat,but,onehanded,cripples,do,not,inspire,much,fear
he,wondered,what,his,brother,would,do
tyrion,would,find,a,way
lannisters,lie,steelshanks
didn’t,lord,bolton,tell,you,that
the,man,frowned,suspiciously
what,if,he,did
unless,you,take,me,back,to,harrenhal,the,song,i,sing,my,father,may,not,be,one,the,lord,of,the,dreadfort,would,wish,to,hear
i,might,even,say,it,was,bolton,ordered,my,hand,cut,off,and,steelshanks,walton,who,swung,the,blade
walton,gaped,at,him
that,isn’t,so
no,but,who,will,my,father,believe
jaime,made,himself,smile,the,way,he,used,to,smile,when,nothing,in,the,world,could,frighten,him
it,will,be,so,much,easier,if,we,just,go,back
we’d,be,on,our,way,again,soon,enough,and,i’d,sing,such,a,sweet,song,in,king’s,landing,you’ll,never,believe,your,ears
you’d,get,the,girl,and,a,nice,fat,purse,of,gold,as,thanks
gold
walton,liked,that,well,enough
how,much,gold
i,have,him
why,how,much,would,you,want
and,by,the,time,the,sun,came,up,they,were,halfway,back,to,harrenhal
jaime,pushed,his,horse,much,harder,than,he,had,the,day,before,and,steelshanks,and,the,northmen,were,forced,to,match,his,pace
even,so,it,was,midday,before,they,reached,the,castle,on,the,lake
beneath,a,darkening,sky,that,threatened,rain,the,immense,walls,and,five,great,towers,stood,black,and,ominous
it,looks,so,dead
the,walls,were,empty,the,gates,closed,and,barred
but,high,above,the,barbican,a,single,banner,hung,limp
the,black,goat,of,qohor,he,knew
jaime,cupped,his,hands,to,shout
you,in,there
open,your,gates,or,i’ll,kick,them,down
it,was,not,until,qyburn,and,steelshanks,added,their,voices,that,a,head,finally,appeared,on,the,battlements,above,them
he,goggled,down,at,them,then,vanished
a,short,time,later,they,heard,the,portcullis,being,drawn,upward
the,gates,swung,open,and,jaime,lannister,spurred,his,horse,through,the,walls,scarcely,glancing,at,the,murder,holes,as,he,passed,beneath,them
he,had,been,worried,that,the,goat,might,not,admit,them,but,it,seemed,as,if,the,brave,companions,still,thought,of,them,as,allies
fools
the,outer,ward,was,deserted,only,the,long,slate-roofed,stables,showed,any,signs,of,life,and,it,was,not,horses,that,interested,jaime,just,then
he,reined,up,and,looked,about
he,could,hear,sounds,from,somewhere,behind,the,tower,of,ghosts,and,men,shouting,in,half,a,dozen,tongues
steelshanks,and,qyburn,rode,up,on,either,side
get,what,you,came,back,for,and,we’ll,be,gone,again,said,walton
i,want,no,trouble,with,the,mummers
tell,your,men,to,keep,their,hands,on,their,sword,hilts,and,the,mummers,will,want,no,trouble,with,you
two,to,one,remember
jaime’s,head,jerked,round,at,the,sound,of,a,distant,roar,faint,but,ferocious
it,echoed,off,the,walls,of,harrenhal,and,the,laughter,swelled,up,like,the,sea
all,of,a,sudden,he,knew,what,was,happening
have,we,come,too,late
his,stomach,did,a,lurch,and,he,slammed,his,spurs,into,his,horse,galloping,across,the,outer,ward,beneath,an,arched,stone,bridge,around,the,wailing,tower,and,through,the,flowstone,yard
they,had,her,in,the,bear,pit
king,harren,the,black,had,wished,to,do,even,his,bear-baiting,in,lavish,style
the,pit,was,ten,yards,across,and,five,yards,deep,walled,in,stone,floored,with,sand,and,encircled,by,six,tiers,of,marble,benches
the,brave,companions,filled,only,a,quarter,of,the,seats,jaime,saw,as,he,swung,down,clumsily,from,his,horse
the,sellswords,were,so,fixed,on,the,spectacle,beneath,that,only,those,across,the,pit,noticed,their,arrival
brienne,wore,the,same,ill-fitting,gown,she’d,worn,to,supper,with,roose,bolton
no,shield,no,breastplate,no,chainmail,not,even,boiled,leather,only,pink,satin,and,myrish,lace
maybe,the,goat,thought,she,was,more,amusing,when,dressed,as,a,woman
half,her,gown,was,hanging,off,in,tatters,and,her,left,arm,dripped,blood,where,the,bear,had,raked,her
at,least,they,gave,her,a,sword
the,wench,held,it,one-handed,moving,sideways,trying,to,put,some,distance,between,her,and,the,bear
that’s,no,good,the,ring’s,too,small
she,needed,to,attack,to,make,a,quick,end,to,it
good,steel,was,a,match,for,any,bear
but,the,wench,seemed,afraid,to,close
the,mummers,showered,her,with,insults,and,obscene,suggestions
this,is,none,of,our,concern,steelshanks,warned,jaime
lord,bolton,said,the,wench,was,theirs,to,do,with,as,they,liked
her,name’s,brienne
jaime,descended,the,steps,past,a,dozen,startled,sellswords
vargo,hoat,had,taken,the,lord’s,box,in,the,lowest,tier
lord,vargo,he,called,over,the,shouts

a,roar,turned,jaime,back,around
the,bear,was,eight,feet,tall
gregor,clegane,with,a,pelt,he,thought,though,likely,smarter
the,beast,did,not,have,the,reach,the,mountain,had,with,that,monster,greatsword,of,his,though
bellowing,in,fury,the,bear,showed,a,mouth,full,of,great,yellow,teeth,then,fell,back,to,all,fours,and,went,straight,at,brienne
there’s,your,chance,jaime,thought
strike
now
instead,she,poked,out,ineffectually,with,the,point,of,her,blade
the,bear,recoiled,then,came,on,rumbling
brienne,slid,to,her,left,and,poked,again,at,the,bear’s,face
this,time,he,lifted,a,paw,to,swat,the,sword,aside
he’s,wary,jaime,realized
he’s,gone,up,against,other,men
he,knows,swords,and,spears,can,hurt,him
but,that,won’t,keep,him,off,her,long
kill,him
he,shouted,but,his,voice,was,lost,amongst,all,the,other,shouts
if,brienne,heard,she,gave,no,sign
she,moved,around,the,pit,keeping,the,wall,at,her,back
too,close
if,the,bear,pins,her,by,the,wall
the,beast,turned,clumsily,too,far,and,too,fast
quick,as,a,cat,brienne,changed,direction
there’s,the,wench,i,remember
she,leapt,in,to,land,a,cut,across,the,bear’s,back
roaring,the,beast,went,up,on,his,hind,legs,again
brienne,scrambled,back,away
where’s,the,blood
then,suddenly,he,understood
jaime,rounded,on,hoat
you,gave,her,a,tourney,sword
the,goat,brayed,laughter,spraying,him,with,wine,and,spittle
of,courth
i’ll,pay,her,bloody,ransom
gold,sapphires,whatever,you,want
pull,her,out,of,there
you,want,her
go,get,her
so,he,did
he,put,his,good,hand,on,the,marble,rail,and,vaulted,over,rolling,as,he,hit,the,sand
the,bear,turned,at,the,thump,sniffing,watching,this,new,intruder,warily
jaime,scrambled,to,one,knee
well,what,in,seven,hells,do,i,do,now
he,filled,his,fist,with,sand
kingslayer
he,heard,brienne,say,astonished
jaime
he,uncoiled,flinging,the,sand,at,the,bear’s,face
the,bear,mauled,the,air,and,roared,like,blazes
what,are,you,doing,here
something,stupid
get,behind,me
he,circled,toward,her,putting,himself,between,brienne,and,the,bear
you,get,behind
i,have,the,sword
a,swordwith,no,point,and,no,edge
get,behind,me
he,saw,something,half-buried,in,the,sand,and,snatched,it,up,with,his,good,hand
it,proved,to,be,a,human,jawbone,with,some,greenish,flesh,still,clinging,to,it,crawling,with,maggots
charming,he,thought,wondering,whose,face,he,held
the,bear,was,edging,closer,so,jaime,whipped,his,arm,around,and,flung,bone,meat,and,maggots,at,the,beast’s,head
he,missed,by,a,good,yard
i,ought,to,lop,my,left,hand,off,as,well,for,all,the,good,it,does,me
brienne,tried,to,dart,around,but,he,kicked,her,legs,out,from,under,her
she,fell,in,the,sand,clutching,the,useless,sword
jaime,straddled,her,and,the,bear,came,charging
there,was,a,deep,twang,and,a,feathered,shaft,sprouted,suddenly,beneath,the,beast’s,left,eye
blood,and,slaver,ran,from,his,open,mouth,and,another,bolt,took,him,in,the,leg
the,bear,roared,reared
he,saw,jaime,and,brienne,again,and,lumbered,toward,them
more,crossbows,fired,the,quarrels,ripping,through,fur,and,flesh
at,such,short,range,the,bowmen,could,hardly,miss
the,shafts,hit,as,hard,as,maces,but,the,bear,took,another,step
the,poor,dumb,brave,brute
when,the,beast,swiped,at,him,he,danced,aside,shouting,kicking,sand
the,bear,turned,to,follow,his,tormentor,and,took,another,two,quarrels,in,the,back
he,gave,one,last,rumbling,growl,settled,back,onto,his,haunches,stretched,out,on,the,bloodstained,sand,and,died
brienne,got,back,to,her,knees,clutching,the,sword,and,breathing,short,ragged,breaths
steelshanks’s,archers,were,winding,their,crossbows,and,reloading,while,the,bloody,mummers,shouted,curses,and,threats,at,them
rorge,and,three,toes,had,swords,out,jaime,saw,and,zollo,was,uncoiling,his,whip
you,thlew,my,bear

tell,your,lord,father
i,will,my,lord
not,that,it,will,do,you,any,good
not,until,they,were,half,a,league,from,harrenhal,and,out,of,range,of,archers,on,the,walls,did,steelshanks,walton,let,his,anger,show

did,you,mean,to,die
no,man,can,fight,a,bear,with,his,bare,hands
one,bare,hand,and,one,bare,stump,jaime,corrected
but,i,hoped,you’d,kill,the,beast,before,the,beast,killed,me
elsewise,lord,bolton,would,have,peeled,you,like,an,orange,no
steelshanks,cursed,him,roundly,for,a,fool,of,lannister,spurred,his,horse,and,galloped,away,up,the,column
ser,jaime
even,in,soiled,pink,satin,and,torn,lace,brienne,looked,more,like,a,man,in,a,gown,than,a,proper,woman
i,am,grateful,but
you,were,well,away
why,come,back
a,dozen,quips,came,to,mind,each,crueler,than,the,one,before,but,jaime,only,shrugged
i,dreamed,of,you,he,said
catelyn,rob,bid,farewell,to,his,young,queen,thrice
once,in,the,godswood,before,the,heart,tree,in,sight,of,gods,and,men
the,second,time,beneath,the,portcullis,where,jeyne,sent,him,forth,with,a,long,embrace,and,a,longer,kiss
and,finally,an,hour,beyond,the,tumblestone,when,the,girl,came,galloping,up,on,a,well-lathered,horse,to,plead,with,her,young,king,to,take,her,along
robb,was,touched,by,that,catelyn,saw,but,abashed,as,well
the,day,was,damp,and,grey,a,drizzle,had,begun,to,fall,and,the,last,thing,he,wanted,was,to,call,a,halt,to,his,march,so,he,could,stand,in,the,wet,and,console,a,tearful,young,wife,in,front,of,half,his,army
he,speaks,her,gently,she,thought,as,she,watched,them,together,but,there,is,anger,underneath
all,the,time,the,king,and,queen,were,talking,grey,wind,prowled,around,them,stopping,only,to,shake,the,water,from,his,coat,and,bare,his,teeth,at,the,rain
when,at,last,robb,gave,jeyne,one,final,kiss,dispatched,a,dozen,men,to,take,her,back,to,riverrun,and,mounted,his,horse,once,more,the,direwolf,raced,off,ahead,as,swift,as,an,arrow,loosed,from,a,longbow
queen,jeyne,has,a,loving,heart,i,see,said,lame,lothar,frey,to,catelyn

he,turned,in,the,saddle,to,smile,at,edmure
but,you,are,strangely,quiet,lord,tully
how,do,you,feel,i,wonder
much,as,i,did,at,the,stone,mill,just,before,the,warhorns,sounded,edmure,said,only,half,in,jest

it,had,been,her,who,had,insisted,that,jeyne,remain,at,riverrun,when,robb,would,sooner,have,kept,her,by,his,side
lord,walder,might,well,construe,the,queen’s,absence,from,the,wedding,as,another,slight,yet,her,presence,would,have,been,a,different,sort,of,insult,salt,in,the,old,man’s,wound
walder,frey,has,a,sharp,tongue,and,a,long,memory,she,had,warned,her,son
i,do,not,doubt,that,you,are,strong,enough,to,suffer,an,old,man’s,rebukes,as,the,price,of,his,allegiance,but,you,have,too,much,of,your,father,in,you,to,sit,there,while,he,insults,jeyne,to,her,face
robb,could,not,deny,the,sense,of,that
yet,all,the,same,he,resents,me,for,it,catelyn,thought,wearily
he,misses,jeyne,already,and,some,part,of,him,blames,me,for,her,absence,though,he,knows,it,was,good,counsel
of,the,six,westerlings,who,had,come,with,her,son,from,the,crag,only,one,remained,by,his,side,ser,raynald,jeyne’s,brother,the,royal,banner-bearer

it,was,deftly,done
her,son,was,relieved,of,his,fear,for,martyn’s,safety,galbart,glover,was,relieved,to,hear,that,his,brother,robett,had,been,put,on,a,ship,at,duskendale,ser,rolph,had,important,and,honorable,employment
and,grey,wind,was,at,the,king’s,side,once,more
where,he,belongs
lady,westerling,had,remained,at,riverrun,with,her,children,jeyne,her,little,sister,eleyna,and,young,rollam,robb’s,squire,who,complained,bitterly,about,being,left
yet,that,was,wise,as,well
olyvar,frey,had,squired,for,robb,previously,and,would,doubtless,be,present,for,his,sister’s,wedding,to,parade,his,replacement,before,him,would,be,as,unwise,as,it,was,unkind
as,for,ser,raynald,he,was,a,cheerful,young,knight,who,swore,that,no,insult,of,walder,frey’s,could,possibly,provoke,him
and,let,us,pray,that,insults,are,all,we,need,to,contend,with
catelyn,had,her,fears,on,that,score,though
her,lord,father,had,never,trusted,walder,frey,after,the,trident,and,she,was,ever,mindful,of,that
queen,jeyne,would,be,safest,behind,the,high,strong,walls,of,riverrun,with,the,blackfish,to,protect,her
robb,had,even,created,him,a,new,title,warden,of,the,southern,marches
ser,brynden,would,hold,the,trident,if,any,man,could
all,the,same,catelyn,would,miss,her,uncle’s,craggy,face,and,robb,would,miss,his,counsel
ser,brynden,had,played,a,part,in,every,victory,her,son,had,won
galbart,glover,had,taken,command,of,the,scouts,and,outriders,in,his,place,a,good,man,loyal,and,steady,but,without,the,blackfish’s,brilliance
behind,glover’s,screen,of,scouts,robb’s,line,of,march,stretched,several,miles
the,greatjon,led,the,van
catelyn,traveled,in,the,main,column,surrounded,by,plodding,warhorses,with,steelclad,men,on,their,backs
next,came,the,baggage,train,a,procession,of,wayns,laden,with,food,fodder,camp,supplies,wedding,gifts,and,the,wounded,too,weak,to,walk,under,the,watchful,eye,of,ser,wendel,manderly,and,his,white,harbor,knights
herds,of,sheep,and,goats,and,scrawny,cattle,trailed,behind,and,then,a,little,tail,of,footsore,camp,followers
even,farther,back,was,robin,flint,and,the,rearguard
there,was,no,enemy,in,back,of,them,for,hundreds,of,leagues,but,robb,would,take,no,chances
thirty-five,hundred,they,were,thirty-five,hundred,who,had,been,blooded,in,the,whispering,wood,who,had,reddened,their,swords,at,the,battle,of,the,camps,at,oxcross,ashemark,and,the,crag,and,all,through,the,gold-rich,hills,of,the,lannister,west
aside,from,her,brother,edmure’s,modest,retinue,of,friends,the,lords,of,the,trident,had,remained,to,hold,the,riverlands,while,the,king,retook,the,north
ahead,awaited,edmure’s,bride,and,robb’s,next,battle
and,for,me,two,dead,sons,an,empty,bed,and,a,castle,full,of,ghosts
it,was,a,cheerless,prospect
brienne,where,are,you
bring,my,girls,back,to,me,brienne
bring,them,back,safe
the,drizzle,that,had,sent,them,off,turned,into,a,soft,steady,rain,by,midday,and,continued,well,past,nightfall
the,next,day,the,northmen,never,saw,the,sun,at,all,but,rode,beneath,leaden,skies,with,their,hoods,pulled,up,to,keep,the,water,from,their,eyes
it,was,a,heavy,rain,turning,roads,to,mud,and,fields,to,quagmires,swelling,the,rivers,and,stripping,the,trees,of,their,leaves
the,constant,patter,made,idle,chatter,more,bother,than,it,was,worth,so,men,spoke,only,when,they,had,something,to,say,and,that,was,seldom,enough
we,are,stronger,than,we,seem,my,lady,lady,maege,mormont,said,as,they,rode
catelyn,had,grown,fond,of,lady,maege,and,her,eldest,daughter,dacey,they,were,more,understanding,than,most,in,the,matter,of,jaime,lannister,she,had,found
the,daughter,was,tall,and,lean,the,mother,short,and,stout,but,they,dressed,alike,in,mail,and,leather,with,the,black,bear,of,house,mormont,on,shield,and,surcoat
by,catelyn’s,lights,that,was,queer,garb,for,a,lady,yet,dacey,and,lady,maege,seemed,more,comfortable,both,as,warriors,and,as,women,than,ever,the,girl,from,tarth,had,been
i,have,fought,beside,the,young,wolf,in,every,battle,dacey,mormont,said,cheerfully
he,has,not,lost,one,yet
no,but,he,has,lost,everything,else,catelyn,thought,but,it,would,not,do,to,say,it,aloud
the,northmen,did,not,lack,for,courage,but,they,were,far,from,home,with,little,enough,to,sustain,them,but,for,their,faith,in,their,young,king
that,faith,must,be,protected,at,all,costs
i,must,be,stronger,she,told,herself
i,must,be,strong,for,robb
if,i,despair,my,grief,will,consume,me
everything,would,turn,on,this,marriage
if,edmure,and,roslin,were,happy,in,one,another,if,the,late,lord,frey,could,be,appeased,and,his,power,once,more,wedded,to,robb’s
even,then,what,chance,will,we,have,caught,between,lannister,and,greyjoy
it,was,a,question,catelyn,dared,not,dwell,on,though,robb,dwelt,on,little,else
she,saw,how,he,studied,his,maps,whenever,they,made,camp,searching,for,some,plan,that,might,win,back,the,north
her,brother,edmure,had,other,cares
you,don’t,suppose,all,lord,walder’s,daughters,look,like,him,do,you
he,wondered,as,he,sat,in,his,tall,striped,pavilion,with,catelyn,and,his,friends
with,so,many,different,mothers,a,few,of,the,maids,are,bound,to,turn,up,comely,said,ser,marq,piper,but,why,should,the,old,wretch,give,you,a,pretty,one
no,reason,at,all,said,edmure,in,a,glum,tone
it,was,more,than,catelyn,could,stand
cersei,lannister,is,comely,she,said,sharply
you’d,be,wiser,to,pray,that,roslin,is,strong,and,healthy,with,a,good,head,and,a,loyal,heart
and,with,that,she,left,them
edmure,did,not,take,that,well
the,next,day,he,avoided,her,entirely,on,the,march,preferring,the,company,of,marq,piper,lymond,goodbrook,patrek,mallister,and,the,young,vances
they,do,not,scold,him,except,in,jest,catelyn,told,herself,when,they,raced,by,her,that,afternoon,with,nary,a,word
i,have,always,been,too,hard,with,edmure,and,now,grief,sharpens,my,every,word
she,regretted,her,rebuke
there,was,rain,enough,falling,from,the,sky,without,her,making,more
and,was,it,really,such,a,terrible,thing,to,want,a,pretty,wife
she,remembered,her,own,childish,disappointment,the,first,time,she,had,laid,eyes,on,eddard,stark
she,had,pictured,him,as,a,younger,version,of,his,brother,brandon,but,that,was,wrong
ned,was,shorter,and,plainer,of,face,and,so,somber
he,spoke,courteously,enough,but,beneath,the,words,she,sensed,a,coolness,that,was,all,at,odds,with,brandon,whose,mirths,had,been,as,wild,as,his,rages
even,when,he,took,her,maidenhood,their,love,had,more,of,duty,to,it,than,of,passion
we,made,robb,that,night,though,we,made,a,king,together
and,after,the,war,at,winterfell,i,had,love,enough,for,any,woman,once,i,found,the,good,sweet,heart,beneath,ned’s,solemn,face
there,is,no,reason,edmure,should,not,find,the,same,with,his,roslin
as,the,gods,would,have,it,their,route,took,them,through,the,whispering,wood,where,robb,had,won,his,first,great,victory
they,followed,the,course,of,the,twisting,stream,on,the,floor,of,that,pinched,narrow,valley,much,as,jaime,lannister’s,men,had,done,that,fateful,night
it,was,warmer,then,catelyn,remembered,the,trees,were,still,green,and,the,stream,did,not,overflow,its,banks
fallen,leaves,choked,the,flow,now,and,lay,in,sodden,snarls,among,the,rocks,and,roots,and,the,trees,that,had,once,hidden,robb’s,army,had,exchanged,their,green,raiment,for,leaves,of,dull,gold,spotted,with,brown,and,a,red,that,reminded,her,of,rust,and,dry,blood
only,the,spruce,and,the,soldier,pines,still,showed,green,thrusting,up,at,the,belly,of,the,clouds,like,tall,dark,spears
more,than,the,trees,have,died,since,then,she,reflected
on,the,night,of,the,whispering,wood,ned,was,still,alive,in,his,cell,beneath,aegon’s,high,hill,bran,and,rickon,were,safe,behind,the,walls,of,winterfell
and,theon,greyjoy,fought,at,robb’s,side,and,boasted,of,how,he,had,almost,crossed,swords,with,the,kingslayer
would,that,he,had
if,theon,had,died,in,place,of,lord,karstark’s,sons,how,much,ill,would,have,been,undone
as,they,passed,through,the,battleground,catelyn,glimpsed,signs,of,the,carnage,that,had,been,an,overturned,helm,filling,with,rain,a,splintered,lance,the,bones,of,a,horse
stone,cairns,had,been,raised,over,some,of,the,men,who,had,fallen,here,but,scavengers,had,already,been,at,them
amidst,the,tumbles,of,rock,she,spied,brightly,colored,cloth,and,bits,of,shiny,metal
once,she,saw,a,face,peering,out,at,her,the,shape,of,the,skull,beginning,to,emerge,from,beneath,the,melting,brown,flesh
it,made,her,wonder,where,ned,had,come,to,rest
the,silent,sisters,had,taken,his,bones,north,escorted,by,hallis,mollen,and,a,small,honor,guard
had,ned,ever,reached,winterfell,to,be,interred,beside,his,brother,brandon,in,the,dark,crypts,beneath,the,castle
or,did,the,door,slam,shut,at,moat,cailin,before,hal,and,the,sisters,could,pass
thirty-five,hundred,riders,wound,their,way,along,the,valley,floor,through,the,heart,of,the,whispering,wood,but,catelyn,stark,had,seldom,felt,lonelier
every,league,she,crossed,took,her,farther,from,riverrun,and,she,found,herself,wondering,whether,she,would,ever,see,the,castle,again
or,was,it,lost,to,her,forever,like,so,much,else
five,days,later,their,scouts,rode,back,to,warn,them,that,the,rising,waters,had,washed,out,the,wooden,bridge,at,fairmarket
galbart,glover,and,two,of,his,bolder,men,had,tried,swimming,their,mounts,across,the,turbulent,blue,fork,at,ramsford
two,of,the,horses,had,been,swept,under,and,drowned,and,one,of,the,riders,glover,himself,managed,to,cling,to,a,rock,until,they,could,pull,him,in
the,river,hasn’t,run,this,high,since,spring,edmure,said
and,if,this,rain,keeps,falling,it,will,go,higher,yet
there’s,a,bridge,further,upstream,near,oldstones,remembered,catelyn,who,had,often,crossed,these,lands,with,her,father
it’s,older,and,smaller,but,if,it,still,stands,it’s,gone,my,lady,galbart,glover,said
washed,away,even,before,the,one,at,fairmarket
robb,looked,to,catelyn
is,there,another,bridge
no
and,the,fords,will,be,impassable
she,tried,to,remember
if,we,cannot,cross,the,blue,fork,we’ll,have,to,go,around,it,through,sevenstreams,and,hag’s,mire
bogs,and,bad,roads,or,none,at,all,warned,edmure
the,going,will,be,slow,but,we’ll,get,there,i,suppose
lord,walder,will,wait,i’m,sure,said,robb
lothar,sent,him,a,bird,from,riverrun,he,knows,we,are,coming
yes,but,the,man,is,prickly,and,suspicious,by,nature,said,catelyn
he,may,take,this,delay,as,a,deliberate,insult
very,well,i’ll,beg,his,pardon,for,our,tardiness,as,well
a,sorry,king,i’ll,be,apologizing,with,every,second,breath
robb,made,a,wry,face
i,hope,bolton,got,across,the,trident,before,the,rains,began
the,kingsroad,runs,straight,north,he’ll,have,an,easy,march
even,afoot,he,should,reach,the,twins,before,us
and,when,you’ve,joined,his,men,to,yours,and,seen,my,brother,married,what,then
catelyn,asked,him
north
robb,scratched,grey,wind,behind,an,ear
by,the,causeway
against,moat,cailin
he,gave,her,an,enigmatic,smile
that’s,one,way,to,go,he,said,and,she,knew,from,his,tone,that,he,would,say,no,more
a,wise,king,keeps,his,own,counsel,she,reminded,herself
they,reached,oldstones,after,eight,more,days,of,steady,rain,and,made,their,camp,upon,the,hill,overlooking,the,blue,fork,within,a,ruined,stronghold,of,the,ancient,river,kings
its,foundations,remained,amongst,the,weeds,to,show,where,the,walls,and,keeps,had,stood,but,the,local,smallfolk,had,long,ago,made,off,with,most,of,the,stones,to,raise,their,barns,and,septs,and,holdfasts
yet,in,the,center,of,what,once,would,have,been,the,castle’s,yard,a,great,carved,sepulcher,still,rested,half,hidden,in,waist-high,brown,grass,amongst,a,stand,of,ash
the,lid,of,the,sepulcher,had,been,carved,into,a,likeness,of,the,man,whose,bones,lay,beneath,but,the,rain,and,the,wind,had,done,their,work
the,king,had,worn,a,beard,they,could,see,but,otherwise,his,face,was,smooth,and,featureless,with,only,vague,suggestions,of,a,mouth,a,nose,eyes,and,the,crown,about,the,temples
his,hands,folded,over,the,shaft,of,a,stone,warhammer,that,lay,upon,his,chest
once,the,warhammer,would,have,been,carved,with,runes,that,told,its,name,and,history,but,all,that,the,centuries,had,worn,away
the,stone,itself,was,cracked,and,crumbling,at,the,corners,discolored,here,and,there,by,spreading,white,splotches,of,lichen,while,wild,roses,crept,up,over,the,king’s,feet,almost,to,his,chest
it,was,there,that,catelyn,found,robb,standing,somber,in,the,gathering,dusk,with,only,grey,wind,beside,him
the,rain,had,stopped,for,once,and,he,was,bareheaded
does,this,castle,have,a,name
he,asked,quietly,when,she,came,up,to,him
oldstones,all,the,smallfolk,called,it,when,i,was,a,girl,but,no,doubt,it,had,some,other,name,when,it,was,still,a,hall,of,kings
she,had,camped,here,once,with,her,father,on,their,way,to,seagard
petyr,was,with,us,too
there’s,a,song,he,remembered
jenny,of,oldstones,with,the,flowers,in,her,hair,’,we’re,all,just,songs,in,the,end
if,we,are,lucky
she,had,played,at,being,jenny,that,day,had,even,wound,flowers,in,her,hair
and,petyr,had,pretended,to,be,her,prince,of,dragonflies
catelyn,could,not,have,been,more,than,twelve,petyr,just,a,boy
robb,studied,the,sepulcher
whose,grave,is,this
here,lies,tristifer,the,fourth,of,his,name,king,of,the,rivers,and,the,hills
her,father,had,told,her,his,story,once
he,ruled,from,the,trident,to,the,neck,thousands,of,years,before,jenny,and,her,prince,in,the,days,when,the,kingdoms,of,the,first,men,were,falling,one,after,the,other,before,the,onslaught,of,the,andals
the,hammer,of,justice,they,called,him
he,fought,a,hundred,battles,and,won,nine-and-ninety,or,so,the,singers,say,and,when,he,raised,this,castle,it,was,the,strongest,in,westeros
she,put,a,hand,on,her,son’s,shoulder
he,died,in,his,hundredth,battle,when,seven,andal,kings,joined,forces,against,him
the,fifth,tristifer,was,not,his,equal,and,soon,the,kingdom,was,lost,and,then,the,castle,and,last,of,all,the,line
with,tristifer,the,fifth,died,house,mudd,that,had,ruled,the,riverlands,for,a,thousand,years,before,the,andals,came
his,heir,failed,him
robb,ran,a,hand,over,the,rough,weathered,stone
i,had,hoped,to,leave,jeyne,with,child
we,tried,often,enough,but,i’m,not,certain
it,does,not,always,happen,the,first,time
though,it,did,with,you
nor,even,the,hundredth
you,are,very,young
young,and,a,king,he,said
a,king,must,have,an,heir
if,i,should,die,in,my,next,battle,the,kingdom,must,not,die,with,me
by,law,sansa,is,next,in,line,of,succession,so,winterfell,and,the,north,would,pass,to,her
his,mouth,tightened
to,her,and,her,lord,husband
tyrion,lannister
i,cannot,allow,that
i,will,not,allow,that
that,dwarf,must,never,have,the,north
no,catelyn,agreed
you,must,name,another,heir,until,such,time,as,jeyne,gives,you,a,son
she,considered,a,moment
your,father’s,father,had,no,siblings,but,his,father,had,a,sister,who,married,a,younger,son,of,lord,raymar,royce,of,the,junior,branch
they,had,three,daughters,all,of,whom,wed,vale,lordlings
a,waynwood,and,a,corbray,for,certain
the,youngest
it,might,have,been,a,templeton,but
mother
there,was,a,sharpness,in,robb’s,tone
you,forget
my,father,had,four,sons
she,had,not,forgotten,she,had,not,wanted,to,look,at,it,yet,there,it,was
a,snow,is,not,a,stark
jon’s,more,a,stark,than,some,lordlings,from,the,vale,who,have,never,so,much,as,set,eyes,on,winterfell
jon,is,a,brother,of,the,night’s,watch,sworn,to,take,no,wife,and,hold,no,lands
those,who,take,the,black,serve,for,life
so,do,the,knights,of,the,kingsguard
that,did,not,stop,the,lannisters,from,stripping,the,white,cloaks,from,ser,barristan,selmy,and,ser,boros,blount,when,they,had,no,more,use,for,them
if,i,send,the,watch,a,hundred,men,in,jon’s,place,i’ll,wager,they,find,some,way,to,release,him,from,his,vows
he,is,set,on,this
catelyn,knew,how,stubborn,her,son,could,be
a,bastard,cannot,inherit
not,unless,he’s,legitimized,by,a,royal,decree,said,robb
there,is,more,precedent,for,that,than,for,releasing,a,sworn,brother,from,his,oath
precedent,she,said,bitterly
yes,aegon,the,fourth,legitimized,all,his,bastards,on,his,deathbed
and,how,much,pain,grief,war,and,murder,grew,from,that
i,know,you,trust,jon
but,can,you,trust,his,sons
or,their,sons
the,blackfyre,pretenders,troubled,the,targaryens,for,five,generations,until,barristan,the,bold,slew,the,last,of,them,on,the,stepstones
if,you,make,jon,legitimate,there,is,no,way,to,turn,him,bastard,again
should,he,wed,and,breed,any,sons,you,may,have,by,jeyne,will,never,be,safe
jon,would,never,harm,a,son,of,mine
no,more,than,theon,greyjoy,would,harm,bran,or,rickon
grey,wind,leapt,up,atop,king,tristifer’s,crypt,his,teeth,bared
robb’s,own,face,was,cold
that,is,as,cruel,as,it,is,unfair
jon,is,no,theon
so,you,pray
have,you,considered,your,sisters
what,of,their,rights
i,agree,that,the,north,must,not,be,permitted,to,pass,to,the,imp,but,what,of,arya
by,law,she,comes,after,sansa
your,own,sister,trueborn

and,dead
no,one,has,seen,or,heard,of,arya,since,they,cut,father’s,head,off
why,do,you,lie,to,yourself
arya’s,gone,the,same,as,bran,and,rickon,and,they’ll,kill,sansa,too,once,the,dwarf,gets,a,child,from,her
jon,is,the,only,brother,that,remains,to,me
should,i,die,without,issue,i,want,him,to,succeed,me,as,king,in,the,north
i,had,hoped,you,would,support,my,choice
i,cannot,she,said
in,all,else,robb
in,everything
but,not,in,this
this,folly
do,not,ask,it
i,don’t,have,to
i’m,the,king
robb,turned,and,walked,off,grey,wind,bounding,down,from,the,tomb,and,loping,after,him
what,have,i,done
catelyn,thought,wearily,as,she,stood,alone,by,tristifer’s,stone,sepulcher
first,i,anger,edmure,and,now,robb,but,all,i,have,done,is,speak,the,truth
are,men,so,fragile,they,cannot,bear,to,hear,it
she,might,have,wept,then,had,not,the,sky,begun,to,do,it,for,her
it,was,all,she,could,do,to,walk,back,to,her,tent,and,sit,there,in,the,silence
in,the,days,that,followed,robb,was,everywhere,and,anywhere,riding,at,the,head,of,the,van,with,the,greatjon,scouting,with,grey,wind,racing,back,to,robin,flint,and,the,rearguard
men,said,proudly,that,the,young,wolf,was,the,first,to,rise,each,dawn,and,the,last,to,sleep,at,night,but,catelyn,wondered,whether,he,was,sleeping,at,all
he,grows,as,lean,and,hungry,as,his,direwolf
my,lady,maege,mormont,said,to,her,one,morning,as,they,rode,through,a,steady,rain,you,seem,so,somber
is,aught,amiss
my,lord,husband,is,dead,as,is,my,father
two,of,my,sons,have,been,murdered,my,daughter,has,been,given,to,a,faithless,dwarf,to,bear,his,vile,children,my,other,daughter,is,vanished,and,likely,dead,and,my,last,son,and,my,only,brother,are,both,angry,with,me
what,could,possibly,be,amiss
that,was,more,truth,than,lady,maege,would,wish,to,hear,however
this,is,an,evil,rain,she,said,instead
we,have,suffered,much,and,there,is,more,peril,and,more,grief,ahead
we,need,to,face,it,boldly,with,horns,blowing,and,banners,flying,bravely
but,this,rain,beats,us,down
the,banners,hang,limp,and,sodden,and,the,men,huddle,under,their,cloaks,and,scarcely,speak,to,one,another
only,an,evil,rain,would,chill,our,hearts,when,most,we,need,them,to,burn,hot
dacey,mormont,looked,up,at,the,sky
i,would,sooner,have,water,raining,down,on,me,than,arrows
catelyn,smiled,despite,herself

one,night,after,several,cups,of,wine,she,had,confessed,to,catelyn,that,the,north,was,no,place,for,a,hightower,of,oldtown

you,cannot,mean,to,attack,up,the,causeway,your,grace,said,galbart,glover
the,approaches,are,too,narrow
there,is,no,way,to,deploy
no,one,has,ever,taken,the,moat
from,the,south,said,robb
but,if,we,can,attack,from,the,north,and,west,simultaneously,and,take,the,ironmen,in,the,rear,while,they,are,beating,off,what,they,think,is,my,main,thrust,up,the,causeway,then,we,have,a,chance
once,i,link,up,with,lord,bolton,and,the,freys,i,will,have,more,than,twelve,thousand,men
i,mean,to,divide,them,into,three,battles,and,start,up,the,causeway,a,half-day,apart
if,the,greyjoys,have,eyes,south,of,the,neck,they,will,see,my,whole,strength,rushing,headlong,at,moat,cailin

the,greatjon,chuckled
your,creepers,best,come,fast,or,my,men,will,swarm,those,walls,and,win,the,moat,before,you,show,your,face
i’ll,make,a,gift,of,it,to,you,when,you,come,dawdling,up
that’s,a,gift,i,should,be,glad,to,have,said,robb
edmure,was,frowning
you,talk,of,attacking,the,ironmen,in,the,rear,sire,but,how,do,you,mean,to,get,north,of,them
there,are,ways,through,the,neck,that,are,not,on,any,map,uncle
ways,known,only,to,the,crannogmen,narrow,trails,between,the,bogs,and,wet,roads,through,the,reeds,that,only,boats,can,follow
he,turned,to,his,two,messengers
tell,howland,reed,that,he,is,to,send,guides,to,me,two,days,after,i,have,started,up,the,causeway
to,the,center,battle,where,my,own,standard,flies
three,hosts,will,leave,the,twins,but,only,two,will,reach,moat,cailin
mine,own,battle,will,melt,away,into,the,neck,to,reemerge,on,the,fever
if,we,move,swiftly,once,my,uncle’s,wed,we,can,all,be,in,position,by,year’s,end
we,will,fall,upon,the,moat,from,three,sides,on,the,first,day,of,the,new,century,as,the,ironmen,are,waking,with,hammers,beating,at,their,heads,from,the,mead,they’ll,quaff,the,night,before
i,like,this,plan,said,the,greatjon
i,like,it,well
galbart,glover,rubbed,his,mouth
there,are,risks
if,the,crannogmen,should,fail,you
we,will,be,no,worse,than,before
but,they,will,not,fail
my,father,knew,the,worth,of,howland,reed
robb,rolled,up,the,map,and,only,then,looked,at,catelyn
mother
she,tensed
do,you,have,some,part,in,this,for,me
your,part,is,to,stay,safe
our,journey,through,the,neck,will,be,dangerous,and,naught,but,battle,awaits,us,in,the,north
but,lord,mallister,has,kindly,offered,to,keep,you,safe,at,seagard,until,the,war,is,done
you,will,be,comfortable,there,i,know
is,this,my,punishment,for,opposing,him,about,jon,snow
or,for,being,a,woman,and,worse,a,mother
it,took,her,a,moment,to,realize,that,they,were,all,watching,her
they,had,known,she,realized
catelyn,should,not,have,been,surprised
she,had,won,no,friends,by,freeing,the,kingslayer,and,more,than,once,she,had,heard,the,greatjon,say,that,women,had,no,place,on,a,battlefield
her,anger,must,have,blazed,across,her,face,because,galbart,glover,spoke,up,before,she,said,a,word
my,lady,his,grace,is,wise
it’s,best,you,do,not,come,with,us
seagard,will,be,brightened,by,your,presence,lady,catelyn,said,lord,jason,mallister
you,would,make,me,a,prisoner,she,said
an,honored,guest,lord,jason,insisted
catelyn,turned,to,her,son
i,mean,no,offense,to,lord,jason,she,said,stiffly,but,if,i,cannot,continue,on,with,you,i,would,sooner,return,to,riverrun
i,left,my,wife,at,riverrun
i,want,my,mother,elsewhere
if,you,keep,all,your,treasures,in,one,purse,you,only,make,it,easier,for,those,who,would,rob,you
after,the,wedding,you,shall,go,to,seagard,that,is,my,royal,command
robb,stood,and,as,quick,as,that,her,fate,was,settled
he,picked,up,a,sheet,of,parchment
one,more,matter
lord,balon,has,left,chaos,in,his,wake,we,hope
i,would,not,do,the,same
yet,i,have,no,son,as,yet,my,brothers,bran,and,rickon,are,dead,and,my,sister,is,wed,to,a,lannister
i’ve,thought,long,and,hard,about,who,might,follow,me
i,command,you,now,as,my,true,and,loyal,lords,to,fix,your,seals,to,this,document,as,witnesses,to,my,decision
a,king,indeed,catelyn,thought,defeated
she,could,only,hope,that,the,trap,he’d,planned,for,moat,cailin,worked,as,well,as,the,one,in,which,he’d,just,caught,her
samwell,whitetree,sam,thought
please,let,this,be,whitetree
he,remembered,whitetree
whitetree,was,on,the,maps,he’d,drawn,on,their,way,north
if,this,village,was,whitetree,he,knew,where,they,were
please,it,has,to,be
he,wanted,that,so,badly,that,he,forgot,his,feet,for,a,little,bit,he,forgot,the,ache,in,his,calves,and,his,lower,back,and,the,stiff,frozen,fingers,he,could,scarcely,feel
he,even,forgot,about,lord,mormont,and,craster,and,the,wights,and,the,others
whitetree,sam,prayed,to,any,god,that,might,be,listening
all,wildling,villages,looked,much,alike,though
a,huge,weirwood,grew,in,the,center,of,this,one
but,a,white,tree,did,not,mean,whitetree,necessarily
hadn’t,the,weirwood,at,whitetree,been,bigger,than,this,one
maybe,he,was,remembering,it,wrong
the,face,carved,into,the,bone,pale,trunk,was,long,and,sad,red,tears,of,dried,sap,leaked,from,its,eyes
was,that,how,it,looked,when,we,came,north
sam,couldn’t,recall
around,the,tree,stood,a,handful,of,one-room,hovels,with,sod,roofs,a,longhall,built,of,logs,and,grown,over,with,moss,a,stone,well,a,sheepfold
but,no,sheep,nor,any,people
the,wildlings,had,gone,to,join,mance,rayder,in,the,frostfangs,taking,all,they,owned,except,their,houses
sam,was,thankful,for,that
night,was,coming,on,and,it,would,be,good,to,sleep,beneath,a,roof,for,once
he,was,so,tired
it,seemed,as,though,he,had,been,walking,half,his,life
his,boots,were,falling,to,pieces,and,all,the,blisters,on,his,feet,had,burst,and,turned,to,callus,but,now,he,had,new,blisters,under,the,callus,and,his,toes,were,getting,frostbitten
but,it,was,either,walk,or,die,sam,knew
gilly,was,still,weak,from,childbirth,and,carrying,the,babe,besides,she,needed,the,horse,more,than,he,did
the,second,horse,had,died,on,them,three,days,out,from,craster’s,keep
it,was,a,wonder,she,lasted,that,long,poor,half-starved,thing
sam’s,weight,had,probably,done,for,her
they,might,have,tried,riding,double,but,he,was,afraid,the,same,thing,would,happen,again
it’s,better,that,i,walk
sam,left,gilly,in,the,longhall,to,make,a,fire,while,he,poked,his,head,into,the,hovels
she,was,better,at,making,fires,he,could,never,seem,to,get,the,kindling,to,catch,and,the,last,time,he’d,tried,to,strike,a,spark,off,flint,and,steel,he,managed,to,cut,himself,on,his,knife
gilly,bound,up,the,gash,for,him,but,his,hand,was,stiff,and,sore,even,clumsier,than,it,had,been,before
he,knew,he,should,wash,the,wound,and,change,the,binding,but,he,was,afraid,to,look,at,it
besides,it,was,so,cold,that,he,hated,taking,off,his,gloves
sam,did,not,know,what,he,hoped,to,find,in,the,empty,houses
maybe,the,wildlings,had,left,some,food,behind
he,had,to,take,a,look
jon,had,searched,the,huts,at,whitetree,on,their,way,north
inside,one,hovel,sam,heard,a,rustling,of,rats,from,a,dark,corner,but,otherwise,there,was,nothing,in,any,of,them,but,old,straw,old,smells,and,some,ashes,beneath,the,smoke,hole
he,turned,back,to,the,weirwood,and,studied,the,carved,face,a,moment
it,is,not,the,face,we,saw,he,admitted,to,himself
the,tree’s,not,half,as,big,as,the,one,at,whitetree
the,red,eyes,wept,blood,and,he,didn’t,remember,that,either
clumsily,sam,sank,to,his,knees
old,gods,hear,my,prayer
the,seven,were,my,father’s,gods,but,i,said,my,words,to,you,when,i,joined,the,watch
help,us,now
i,fear,we,might,be,lost
we’re,hungry,too,and,so,cold
i,don’t,know,what,gods,i,believe,in,now,but
please,if,you’re,there,help,us
gilly,has,a,little,son
that,was,all,that,he,could,think,to,say
the,dusk,was,deepening,the,leaves,of,the,weirwood,rustling,softly,waving,like,a,thousand,blood-red,hands
whether,jon’s,gods,had,heard,him,or,not,he,could,not,say
by,the,time,he,returned,to,the,longhall,gilly,had,the,fire,going
she,sat,close,to,it,with,her,furs,opened,the,babe,at,her,breast
he’s,as,hungry,as,we,are,sam,thought
the,old,women,had,smuggled,out,food,for,them,from,craster’s,but,they,had,eaten,most,of,it,by,now
sam,had,been,a,hopeless,hunter,even,at,horn,hill,where,game,was,plentiful,and,he,had,hounds,and,huntsmen,to,help,him,here,in,this,endless,empty,forest,the,chances,of,him,catching,anything,were,remote
his,efforts,at,fishing,the,lakes,and,half-frozen,streams,had,been,dismal,failures,as,well
how,much,longer,sam
gilly,asked
is,it,far,still
not,so,far
not,so,far,as,it,was
sam,shrugged,out,of,his,pack,eased,himself,awkwardly,to,the,floor,and,tried,to,cross,his,legs
his,back,ached,so,abominably,from,the,walking,that,he,would,have,liked,to,lean,up,against,one,of,the,carved,wooden,pillars,that,supported,the,roof,but,the,fire,was,in,the,center,of,the,hall,beneath,the,smoke,hole,and,he,craved,warmth,even,more,than,comfort
another,few,days,should,see,us,there
sam,had,his,maps,but,if,this,wasn’t,whitetree,then,they,weren’t,going,to,be,much,use
we,went,too,far,east,to,get,around,that,lake,he,fretted,or,maybe,too,far,west,when,i,tried,to,double,back
he,was,coming,to,hate,lakes,and,rivers
up,here,there,was,never,a,ferry,or,bridge,which,meant,walking,all,the,way,around,the,lakes,and,searching,for,places,to,ford,the,rivers
it,was,easier,to,follow,a,game,trail,than,to,struggle,through,the,brush,easier,to,circle,a,ridge,instead,of,climbing,it
if,bannen,or,dywen,were,with,us,we’d,be,at,castle,black,by,now,warming,our,feet,in,the,common,room
bannen,was,dead,though,and,dywen,gone,with,grenn,and,dolorous,edd,and,the,others
the,wall,is,three,hundred,miles,long,and,seven,hundred,feet,high,sam,reminded,himself
if,they,kept,going,south,they,had,to,find,it,sooner,or,later
and,he,was,certain,that,they,had,been,going,south
by,day,he,took,directions,from,the,sun,and,on,clear,nights,they,could,follow,the,ice,dragon’s,tail,though,they,hadn’t,traveled,much,by,night,since,the,second,horse,had,died
even,when,the,moon,was,full,it,was,too,dark,beneath,the,trees,and,it,would,have,been,so,easy,for,sam,or,the,last,garron,to,break,a,leg
we,have,to,be,well,south,by,now,we,have,to,be
what,he,wasn’t,so,certain,of,was,how,far,east,or,west,they,might,have,strayed
they,would,reach,the,wall,yes
in,a,day,or,a,fortnight,it,couldn’t,be,farther,than,that,surely,surely
but,where
it,was,the,gate,at,castle,black,they,needed,to,find,the,only,way,through,the,wall,for,a,hundred,leagues

so,big,you,can’t,even,see,the,castles,hidden,behind,it
but,they’re,there,you’ll,see
the,wall,is,all,ice,but,the,castles,are,stone,and,wood
there,are,tall,towers,and,deep,vaults,and,a,huge,longhall,with,a,great,fire,burning,in,the,hearth,day,and,night

they,had,been,numb,with,cold,but,as,feeling,returned,they,hurt,so,much,he,almost,cried
sometimes,one,of,the,brothers,will,sing,he,said,to,take,his,mind,off,the,pain

could,you,sing,some,southron,song
for,the,babe

there’s,a,song,our,septon,used,to,sing,to,me,and,my,sisters,when,we,were,little,and,it,was,time,for,us,to,go,to,sleep
the,song,of,the,seven,’,it’s,called

sam,remembered,the,last,time,he’d,sung,the,song,with,his,mother,to,lull,baby,dickon,to,sleep
his,father,had,heard,their,voices,and,come,barging,in,angry
i,will,have,no,more,of,that,lord,randyll,told,his,wife,harshly
you,ruined,one,boy,with,those,soft,septon’s,songs,do,you,mean,to,do,the,same,to,this,babe
then,he,looked,at,sam,and,said,go,sing,to,your,sisters,if,you,must,sing
i,don’t,want,you,near,my,son
gilly’s,babe,had,gone,to,sleep
he,was,such,a,tiny,thing,and,so,quiet,that,sam,feared,for,him
he,didn’t,even,have,a,name
he,had,asked,gilly,about,that,but,she,said,it,was,bad,luck,to,name,a,child,before,he,was,two
so,many,of,them,died
she,tucked,her,nipple,back,inside,her,furs
that,was,pretty,sam
you,sing,good
you,should,hear,dareon
his,voice,is,sweet,as,mead
we,drank,the,sweetest,mead,the,day,craster,made,me,a,wife
it,was,summer,then,and,not,so,cold
gilly,gave,him,a,puzzled,look
did,you,only,sing,of,six,gods
craster,always,told,us,you,southrons,had,seven
seven,he,agreed,but,no,one,sings,of,the,stranger
the,stranger’s,face,was,the,face,of,death
even,talking,of,him,made,sam,uncomfortable
we,should,eat,something
a,bite,or,two
nothing,was,left,but,a,few,black,sausages,as,hard,as,wood
sam,sawed,off,a,few,thin,slices,for,each,of,them
the,effort,made,his,wrist,ache,but,he,was,hungry,enough,to,persist
if,you,chewed,the,slices,long,enough,they,softened,up,and,tasted,good
craster’s,wives,seasoned,them,with,garlic
after,they,had,finished,sam,begged,her,pardon,and,went,out,to,relieve,himself,and,look,after,the,horse
a,biting,wind,was,blowing,from,the,north,and,the,leaves,in,the,trees,rattled,at,him,as,he,passed
he,had,to,break,the,thin,scum,of,ice,on,top,of,the,stream,so,the,horse,could,get,a,drink
i,had,better,bring,her,inside
he,did,not,want,to,wake,up,at,break,of,day,to,find,that,their,horse,had,frozen,to,death,during,the,night
gilly,would,keep,going,even,if,that,happened
the,girl,was,very,brave,not,like,him
he,wished,he,knew,what,he,was,going,to,do,with,her,back,at,castle,black
she,kept,saying,how,she’d,be,his,wife,if,he,wanted,but,black,brothers,didn’t,keep,wives,besides,he,was,a,tarly,of,horn,hill,he,could,never,wed,a,wildling
i’ll,have,to,think,of,something
so,long,as,we,reach,the,wall,alive,the,rest,doesn’t,matter,it,doesn’t,matter,one,little,bit
leading,the,horse,to,the,longhall,was,simple,enough
getting,her,through,the,door,was,not,but,sam,persisted
gilly,was,already,dozing,by,the,time,he,got,the,garron,inside
he,hobbled,the,horse,in,a,corner,fed,some,fresh,wood,to,the,fire,took,off,his,heavy,cloak,and,wriggled,down,under,the,furs,beside,the,wildling,woman
his,cloak,was,big,enough,to,cover,all,three,of,them,and,keep,in,the,warmth,of,their,bodies
gilly,smelled,of,milk,and,garlic,and,musty,old,fur,but,he,was,used,to,that,by,now
they,were,good,smells,so,far,as,sam,was,concerned
he,liked,sleeping,next,to,her
it,made,him,remember,times,long,past,when,he,had,shared,a,huge,bed,at,horn,hill,with,two,of,his,sisters
that,had,ended,when,lord,randyll,decided,it,was,making,him,soft,as,a,girl
sleeping,alone,in,my,own,cold,cell,never,made,me,any,harder,or,braver,though
he,wondered,what,his,father,would,say,if,he,could,see,him,now
i,killed,one,of,the,others,my,lord,he,imagined,saying
i,stabbed,him,with,an,obsidian,dagger,and,my,sworn,brothers,call,me,sam,the,slayer,now
but,even,in,his,fancies,lord,randyll,only,scowled,disbelieving
his,dreams,were,strange,that,night
he,was,back,at,horn,hill,at,the,castle,but,his,father,was,not,there
it,was,sam’s,castle,now
jon,snow,was,with,him
lord,mormont,too,the,old,bear,and,grenn,and,dolorous,edd,and,pyp,and,toad,and,all,his,other,brothers,from,the,watch,but,they,wore,bright,colors,instead,of,black
sam,sat,at,the,high,table,and,feasted,them,all,cutting,thick,slices,off,a,roast,with,his,father’s,greatsword,heartsbane
there,were,sweet,cakes,to,eat,and,honeyed,wine,to,drink,there,was,singing,and,dancing,and,everyone,was,warm
when,the,feast,was,done,he,went,up,to,sleep,not,to,the,lord’s,bedchamber,where,his,mother,and,father,lived,but,to,the,room,he,had,once,shared,with,his,sisters
only,instead,of,his,sisters,it,was,gilly,waiting,in,the,huge,soft,bed,wearing,nothing,but,a,big,shaggy,fur,milk,leaking,from,her,breasts
he,woke,suddenly,in,cold,and,dread
the,fire,had,burned,down,to,smouldering,red,embers
the,air,itself,seemed,frozen,it,was,so,cold
in,the,corner,the,garron,was,whinnying,and,kicking,the,logs,with,her,hind,legs
gilly,sat,beside,the,fire,hugging,her,babe
sam,sat,up,groggy,his,breath,puffing,pale,from,his,open,mouth
the,longball,was,dark,with,shadows,black,and,blacker
the,hair,on,his,arms,was,standing,up
it’s,nothing,he,told,himself
i’m,cold,that’s,all
then,by,the,door,one,of,the,shadows,moved
a,big,one
this,is,still,a,dream,sam,prayed
oh,make,it,that,i’m,still,asleep,make,it,a,nightmare
he’s,dead,he’s,dead,i,saw,him,die
he’s,come,for,the,babe,gilly,wept
he,smells,him
a,babe,fresh-born,stinks,o’,life
he’s,come,for,the,life
the,huge,dark,shape,stooped,under,the,lintel,into,the,hall,and,shambled,toward,them
in,the,dim,light,of,the,fire,the,shadow,became,small,paul
go,away,sam,croaked
we,don’t,want,you,here
paul’s,hands,were,coal,his,face,was,milk,his,eyes,shone,a,bitter,blue
hoarfrost,whitened,his,beard,and,on,one,shoulder,hunched,a,raven,pecking,at,his,cheek,eating,the,dead,white,flesh
sam’s,bladder,let,go,and,he,felt,the,warmth,running,down,his,legs
gilly,calm,the,horse,and,lead,her,out
you,do,that
you,she,started
i,have,the,knife
the,dragonglass,dagger
he,fumbled,it,out,as,he,got,to,his,feet
he’d,given,the,first,knife,to,grenn,but,thankfully,he’d,remembered,to,take,lord,mormont’s,dagger,before,fleeing,craster’s,keep
he,clutched,it,tight,moving,away,from,the,fire,away,from,gilly,and,the,babe
paul
he,meant,to,sound,brave,but,it,came,out,in,a,squeak
small,paul
do,you,know,me
i’m,sam,fat,sam,sam,the,scared,you,saved,me,in,the,woods
you,carried,me,when,i,couldn’t,walk,another,step

i,am,such,a,coward
don’t,hurt,us,paul
please
why,would,you,want,to,hurt,us
gilly,scrabbled,backward,across,the,hard,dirt,floor
the,wight,turned,his,head,to,look,at,her,but,sam,shouted,no
and,he,turned,back
the,raven,on,his,shoulder,ripped,a,strip,of,flesh,from,his,pale,ruined,cheek
sam,held,the,dagger,before,him,breathing,like,a,blacksmith’s,bellows
across,the,longhall,gilly,reached,the,garron
gods,give,me,courage,sam,prayed
for,once,give,me,a,little,courage
just,long,enough,for,her,to,get,away
small,paul,moved,toward,him
sam,backed,off,until,he,came,up,against,a,rough,log,wall
he,clutched,the,dagger,with,both,hands,to,hold,it,steady
the,wight,did,not,seem,to,fear,the,dragonglass
perhaps,he,did,not,know,what,it,was
he,moved,slowly,but,small,paul,had,never,been,quick,even,when,he’d,been,alive
behind,him,gilly,murmured,to,calm,the,garron,and,tried,to,urge,it,toward,the,door
but,the,horse,must,have,caught,a,whiff,of,the,wight’s,queer,cold,scent
suddenly,she,balked,rearing,her,hooves,lashing,at,the,frosty,air
paul,swung,toward,the,sound,and,seemed,to,lose,all,interest,in,sam
there,was,no,time,to,think,or,pray,or,be,afraid
samwell,tarly,threw,himself,forward,and,plunged,the,dagger,down,into,small,paul’s,back
half-turned,the,wight,never,saw,him,coming
the,raven,gave,a,shriek,and,took,to,the,air
you’re,dead
sam,screamed,as,he,stabbed
you’re,dead,you’re,dead
he,stabbed,and,screamed,again,and,again,tearing,huge,rents,in,paul’s,heavy,black,cloak
shards,of,dragonglass,flew,everywhere,as,the,blade,shattered,on,the,iron,mail,beneath,the,wool
sam’s,wail,made,a,white,mist,in,the,black,air
he,dropped,the,useless,hilt,and,took,a,hasty,step,backwards,as,small,paul,twisted,around
before,he,could,get,out,his,other,knife,the,steel,knife,that,every,brother,carried,the,wight’s,black,hands,locked,beneath,his,chins
paul’s,fingers,were,so,cold,they,seemed,to,burn
they,burrowed,deep,into,the,soft,flesh,of,sam’s,throat
run,gilly,run,he,wanted,to,scream,but,when,he,opened,his,mouth,only,a,choking,sound,emerged
his,fumbling,fingers,finally,found,the,dagger,but,when,he,slammed,it,up,into,the,wight’s,belly,the,point,skidded,off,the,iron,links,and,the,blade,went,spinning,from,sam’s,hand
small,paul’s,fingers,tightened,inexorably,and,began,to,twist
he’s,going,to,rip,my,head,off,sam,thought,in,despair
his,throat,felt,frozen,his,lungs,on,fire
he,punched,and,pulled,at,the,wight’s,wrists,to,no,avail
he,kicked,paul,between,the,legs,uselessly
the,world,shrank,to,two,blue,stars,a,terrible,crushing,pain,and,a,cold,so,fierce,that,his,tears,froze,over,his,eyes
sam,squirmed,and,pulled,desperate
and,then,he,lurched,forward
small,paul,was,big,and,powerful,but,sam,still,outweighed,him,and,the,wights,were,clumsy,he,had,seen,that,on,the,fist
the,sudden,shift,sent,paul,staggering,back,a,step,and,the,living,man,and,the,dead,one,went,crashing,down,together
the,impact,knocked,one,hand,from,sam’s,throat,and,he,was,able,to,suck,in,a,quick,breath,of,air,before,the,icy,black,fingers,returned
the,taste,of,blood,filled,his,mouth
he,twisted,his,neck,around,looking,for,his,knife,and,saw,a,dull,orange,glow
the,fire
only,ember,and,ashes,remained,but,still
he,could,not,breathe,or,think
sam,wrenched,himself,sideways,pulling,paul,with,him
his,arms,flailed,against,the,dirt,floor,groping,reaching,scattering,the,ashes,until,at,last,they,found,something,hot
a,chunk,of,charred,wood,smouldering,red,and,orange,within,the,black
his,fingers,closed,around,it,and,he,smashed,it,into,paul’s,mouth,so,hard,he,felt,teeth,shatter
yet,even,so,the,wight’s,grip,did,not,loosen
sam’s,last,thoughts,were,for,the,mother,who,had,loved,him,and,the,father,he,had,failed
the,longhall,was,spinning,around,him,when,he,saw,the,wisp,of,smoke,rising,from,between,paul’s,broken,teeth
then,the,dead,man’s,face,burst,into,flame,and,the,hands,were,gone
sam,sucked,in,air,and,rolled,feebly,away
the,wight,was,burning,hoarfrost,dripping,from,his,beard,as,the,flesh,beneath,blackened
sam,heard,the,raven,shriek,but,paul,himself,made,no,sound
when,his,mouth,opened,only,flames,came,out
and,his,eyes
it’s,gone,the,blue,glow,is,gone
he,crept,to,the,door
the,air,was,so,cold,that,it,hurt,to,breathe,but,such,a,fine,sweet,hurt
he,ducked,from,the,longhall
gilly
he,called
gilly,i,killed,it
gil,she,stood,with,her,back,against,the,weirwood,the,boy,in,her,arms
the,wights,were,all,around,her
there,were,a,dozen,of,them,a,score,more
some,had,been,wildlings,once,and,still,wore,skins,and,hides
but,more,had,been,his,brothers
sam,saw,lark,the,sisterman,softfoot,ryles
the,wen,on,chett’s,neck,was,black,his,boils,covered,with,a,thin,film,of,ice
and,that,one,looked,like,hake,though,it,was,hard,to,know,for,certain,with,half,his,head,missing
they,had,torn,the,poor,garron,apart,and,were,pulling,out,her,entrails,with,dripping,red,hands
pale,steam,rose,from,her,belly
sam,made,a,whimpery,sound
it’s,not,fair
fair
the,raven,landed,on,his,shoulder
fair,far,fear
it,flapped,its,wings,and,screamed,along,with,gilly
the,wights,were,almost,on,her
he,heard,the,dark,red,leaves,of,the,weirwood,rustling,whispering,to,one,another,in,a,tongue,he,did,not,know
the,starlight,itself,seemed,to,stir,and,all,around,them,the,trees,groaned,and,creaked
sam,tarly,turned,the,color,of,curdled,milk,and,his,eyes,went,wide,as,plates
ravens
they,were,in,the,weirwood,hundreds,of,them,thousands,perched,on,the,bone-white,branches,peering,between,the,leaves
he,saw,their,beaks,open,as,they,screamed,saw,them,spread,their,black,wings
shrieking,flapping,they,descended,on,the,wights,in,angry,clouds
they,swarmed,round,chett’s,face,and,pecked,at,his,blue,eyes,they,covered,the,sisterman,like,flies,they,plucked,gobbets,from,inside,hake’s,shattered,head
there,were,so,many,that,when,sam,looked,up,he,could,not,see,the,moon
go,said,the,bird,on,his,shoulder
go,go,go
sam,ran,puffs,of,frost,exploding,from,his,mouth
all,around,him,the,wights,flailed,at,the,black,wings,and,sharp,beaks,that,assailed,them,falling,in,an,eerie,silence,with,never,a,grunt,nor,cry
but,the,ravens,ignored,sam
he,took,gilly,by,the,hand,and,pulled,her,away,from,the,weirwood
we,have,to,go
but,where
gilly,hurried,after,him,holding,her,baby
they,killed,our,horse,how,will,we
brother
the,shout,cut,through,the,night,through,the,shrieks,of,a,thousand,ravens
beneath,the,trees,a,man,muffled,head,to,heels,in,mottled,blacks,and,greys,sat,astride,an,elk
here,the,rider,called
a,hood,shadowed,his,face
he’s,wearing,blacks
sam,urged,gilly,toward,him
the,elk,was,huge,a,great,elk,ten,feet,tall,at,the,shoulder,with,a,rack,of,antlers,near,as,wide
the,creature,sank,to,his,knees,to,let,them,mount
here,the,rider,said,reaching,down,with,a,gloved,hand,to,pull,gilly,up,behind,him
then,it,was,sam’s,turn
my,thanks,he,puffed
only,when,he,grasped,the,offered,hand,did,he,realize,that,the,rider,wore,no,glove
his,hand,was,black,and,cold,with,fingers,hard,as,stone
arya,when,they,reached,the,top,of,the,ridge,and,saw,the,river,sandor,clegane,reined,up,hard,and,cursed
the,rain,was,falling,from,a,black,iron,sky,pricking,the,green,and,brown,torrent,with,ten,thousand,swords
it,must,be,a,mile,across,arya,thought
the,tops,of,half,a,hundred,trees,poked,up,out,the,swirling,waters,their,limbs,clutching,for,the,sky,like,the,arms,of,drowning,men
thick,mats,of,sodden,leaves,choked,the,shoreline,and,farther,out,in,the,channel,she,glimpsed,something,pale,and,swollen,a,deer,or,perhaps,a,dead,horse,moving,swiftly,downstream
there,was,a,sound,too,a,low,rumble,at,the,edge,of,hearing,like,the,sound,a,dog,makes,just,before,he,growls
arya,squirmed,in,the,saddle,and,felt,the,links,of,the,hound’s,mail,digging,into,her,back
his,arms,encircled,her,on,the,left,the,burned,arm,he’d,donned,a,steel,vambrace,for,protection,but,she’d,seen,him,change,the,dressings,and,the,flesh,beneath,was,still,raw,and,seeping
if,the,burns,pained,him,though,sandor,clegane,gave,no,hint,of,it
is,this,the,blackwater,rush
they,had,ridden,so,far,in,rain,and,darkness,through,trackless,woods,and,nameless,villages,that,arya,had,lost,all,sense,of,where,they,were
it’s,a,river,we,need,to,cross,that’s,all,you,need,to,know
clegane,would,answer,her,from,time,to,time,but,he,had,warned,her,not,to,talk,back
he,had,given,her,a,lot,of,warnings,that,first,day
the,next,time,you,hit,me,i’ll,tie,your,hands,behind,your,back,he’d,said
the,next,time,you,try,and,run,off,i’ll,bind,your,feet,together
scream,or,shout,or,bite,me,again,and,i’ll,gag,you
we,can,ride,double,or,i,can,throw,you,across,the,back,of,the,horse,trussed,up,like,a,sow,for,slaughter
your,choice
she,had,chosen,to,ride,but,the,first,time,they,made,camp,she’d,waited,until,she,thought,he,was,asleep,and,found,a,big,jagged,rock,to,smash,his,ugly,head,in
quiet,as,a,shadow,she,told,herself,as,she,crept,toward,him,but,that,wasn’t,quiet,enough
the,hound,hadn’t,been,asleep,after,all
or,maybe,he’d,woken
whichever,it,was,his,eyes,opened,his,mouth,twitched,and,he,took,the,rock,away,from,her,as,if,she,were,a,baby
the,best,she,could,do,was,kick,him
i’ll,give,you,that,one,he,said,when,he,flung,the,rock,into,the,bushes
but,if,you’re,stupid,enough,to,try,again,i’ll,hurt,you
why,don’t,you,just,kill,me,like,you,did,mycah
arya,had,screamed,at,him
she,was,still,defiant,then,more,angry,than,scared
he,answered,by,grabbing,the,front,of,her,tunic,and,yanking,her,within,an,inch,of,his,burned,face
the,next,time,you,say,that,name,i’ll,beat,you,so,bad,you’ll,wish,i,killed,you
after,that,he,rolled,her,in,his,horse,blanket,every,night,when,he,went,to,sleep,and,tied,ropes,around,her,top,and,bottom,so,she,was,bound,up,as,tight,as,a,babe,in,swaddling,clothes
it,has,to,be,the,blackwater,arya,decided,as,she,watched,the,rain,lash,the,river
the,hound,was,joffrey’s,dog,he,was,taking,her,back,to,the,red,keep,to,hand,to,joffrey,and,the,queen
she,wished,that,the,sun,would,come,out,so,she,could,tell,which,way,they,were,going
the,more,she,looked,at,the,moss,on,the,trees,the,more,confused,she,got
the,blackwater,wasn’t,so,wide,at,king’s,landing,but,that,was,before,the,rains
the,fords,will,all,be,gone,sandor,clegane,said,and,i,wouldn’t,care,to,try,and,swim,over,neither
there’s,no,way,across,she,thought
lord,beric,will,catch,us,for,sure
clegane,had,pushed,his,big,black,stallion,hard,doubling,back,thrice,to,throw,off,pursuit,once,even,riding,half,a,mile,up,the,center,of,a,swollen,stream
but,arya,still,expected,to,see,the,outlaws,every,time,she,looked,back
she,had,tried,to,help,them,by,scratching,her,name,on,the,trunks,of,trees,when,she,went,in,the,bushes,to,make,water,but,the,fourth,time,she,did,it,he,caught,her,and,that,was,the,end,of,that
it,doesn’t,matter,arya,told,herself,thoros,will,find,me,in,his,flames
only,he,hadn’t
not,yet,anyway,and,once,they,crossed,the,river
harroway,town,shouldn’t,be,far,the,hound,said
where,lord,roote,stables,old,king,andahar’s,two-headed,water,horse
maybe,we’ll,ride,across
arya,had,never,heard,of,old,king,andahar
she’d,never,seen,a,horse,with,two,heads,either,especially,not,one,who,could,run,on,water,but,she,knew,better,than,to,ask
she,held,her,tongue,and,sat,stiff,as,the,hound,turned,the,stallion’s,head,and,trotted,along,the,ridgeline,following,the,river,downstream
at,least,the,rain,was,at,their,backs,this,way
she’d,had,enough,of,it,stinging,her,eyes,half-blind,and,washing,down,her,cheeks,like,she,was,crying
wolves,never,cry,she,reminded,herself,again
it,could,not,have,been,much,past,noon,but,the,sky,was,dark,as,dusk
they,had,not,seen,the,sun,in,more,days,than,she,could,count
arya,was,soaked,to,the,bone,saddle-sore,sniffling,and,achy
she,had,a,fever,too,and,sometimes,shivered,uncontrollably,but,when,she’d,told,the,hound,that,she,was,sick,he’d,only,snarled,at,her
wipe,your,nose,and,shut,your,mouth,he,told,her
half,the,time,he,slept,in,the,saddle,now,trusting,his,stallion,to,follow,whatever,rutted,farm,track,or,game,trail,they,were,on
the,horse,was,a,heavy,courser,almost,as,big,as,a,destrier,but,much,faster
stranger,the,hound,called,him
arya,had,tried,to,steal,him,once,when,clegane,was,taking,a,piss,against,a,tree,thinking,she,could,ride,off,before,he,could,catch,her
stranger,had,almost,bitten,her,face,off
he,was,gentle,as,an,old,gelding,with,his,master,but,otherwise,he,had,a,temper,as,black,as,he,was
she,had,never,known,a,horse,so,quick,to,bite,or,kick
they,rode,beside,the,river,for,hours,splashing,across,two,muddy,vassal,streams,before,they,reached,the,place,that,sandor,clegane,had,spoken,of
lord,harroway’s,town,he,said,and,then,when,he,saw,it,seven,hells
the,town,was,drowned,and,desolate
the,rising,waters,had,overflowed,the,riverbanks
all,that,remained,of,harroway,town,was,the,upper,story,of,a,daub-and-wattle,inn,the,seven-sided,dome,of,a,sunken,sept,two-thirds,of,a,stone,roundtower,some,moldy,thatch,roofs,and,a,forest,of,chimneys
but,there,was,smoke,coming,from,the,tower,arya,saw,and,below,one,arched,window,a,wide,flat-bottomed,boat,was,chained,up,tight
the,boat,had,a,dozen,oarlocks,and,a,pair,of,great,carved,wooden,horse,heads,mounted,fore,and,aft
the,two-headed,horse,she,realized
there,was,a,wooden,house,with,a,sod,roof,right,in,the,middle,of,the,deck,and,when,the,hound,cupped,his,hands,around,his,mouth,and,shouted,two,men,came,spilling,out
a,third,appeared,in,the,window,of,the,roundtower,clutching,a,loaded,crossbow
what,do,you,want
he,shouted,across,the,swirling,brown,waters
take,us,over,the,hound,shouted,back
the,men,in,the,boat,conferred,with,one,another
one,of,them,a,grizzled,grey-haired,man,with,thick,arms,and,a,bent,back,stepped,to,the,rail
it,will,cost,you
then,i’ll,pay
with,what
arya,wondered
the,outlaws,had,taken,clegane’s,gold,but,maybe,lord,beric,had,left,him,some,silver,and,copper
a,ferry,ride,shouldn’t,cost,more,than,a,few,coppers
the,ferrymen,were,talking,again
finally,the,bent-backed,one,turned,away,and,gave,a,shout
six,more,men,appeared,pulling,up,hoods,to,keep,the,rain,off,their,heads
still,more,squirmed,out,the,holdfast,window,and,leapt,down,onto,the,deck
half,of,them,looked,enough,like,the,bent-backed,man,to,be,his,kin
some,of,them,undid,the,chains,and,took,up,long,poles,while,the,others,slid,heavy,wide-bladed,oars,through,the,locks
the,ferry,swung,about,and,began,to,creep,slowly,toward,the,shallows,oars,stroking,smoothly,on,either,side
sandor,clegane,rode,down,the,hill,to,meet,it
when,the,aft,end,of,the,boat,slammed,into,the,hillside,the,ferrymen,opened,a,wide,door,beneath,the,carved,horse’s,head,and,extended,a,heavy,oaken,plank
stranger,balked,at,the,water’s,edge,but,the,hound,put,his,heels,into,the,courser’s,flank,and,urged,him,up,the,gangway
the,bent-backed,man,was,waiting,for,them,on,deck
wet,enough,for,you,ser
he,asked,smiling
the,hound’s,mouth,gave,a,twitch
i,need,your,boat,not,your,bloody,wit
he,dismounted,and,pulled,arya,down,beside,him
one,of,the,boatmen,reached,for,stranger’s,bridle
i,wouldn’t,clegane,said,as,the,horse,kicked
the,man,leapt,back,slipped,on,the,rain-slick,deck,and,crashed,onto,his,arse,cursing
the,ferryman,with,the,bent,back,wasn’t,smiling,any,longer
we,can,get,you,across,he,said,sourly
it,will,cost,you,a,gold,piece
another,for,the,horse
a,third,for,the,boy
three,dragons
clegane,gave,a,bark,of,laughter
for,three,dragons,i,should,own,the,bloody,ferry
last,year,might,be,you,could
but,with,this,river,i’ll,need,extra,hands,on,the,poles,and,oars,just,to,see,we,don’t,get,swept,a,hundred,miles,out,to,sea
here’s,your,choice
three,dragons,or,you,teach,that,hellhorse,how,to,walk,on,water
i,like,an,honest,brigand
have,it,your,way
three,dragons
when,you,put,us,ashore,safe,on,the,north,bank
i’ll,have,them,now,or,we,don’t,go
the,man,thrust,out,a,thick,callused,hand,palm,up
clegane,rattled,his,longsword,to,loosen,the,blade,in,the,scabbard
here’s,your,choice
gold,on,the,north,bank,or,steel,on,the,south
the,ferryman,looked,up,at,the,hound’s,face
arya,could,tell,that,he,didn’t,like,what,he,saw,there
he,had,a,dozen,men,behind,him,strong,men,with,oars,and,hardwood,poles,in,their,hands,but,none,of,them,were,rushing,forward,to,help,him
together,they,could,overwhelm,sandor,clegane,though,he’d,likely,kill,three,or,four,of,them,before,they,took,him,down
how,do,i,know,you’re,good,for,it
the,bent-backed,man,asked,after,a,moment
he’s,not,she,wanted,to,shout
instead,she,bit,her,lip
knight’s,honor,the,hound,said,unsmiling
he’s,not,even,a,knight
she,did,not,say,that,either
that,will,do
the,ferryman,spat
come,on,then,we,can,have,you,across,before,dark
tie,the,horse,up,i,don’t,want,him,spooking,when,we’re,under,way
there’s,a,brazier,in,the,cabin,if,you,and,your,son,want,to,get,warm
i’m,not,his,stupid,son
said,arya,furiously
that,was,even,worse,than,being,taken,for,a,boy
she,was,so,angry,that,she,might,have,told,them,who,she,really,was,only,sandor,clegane,grabbed,her,by,the,back,of,the,collar,and,hoisted,her,one-handed,off,the,deck
how,many,times,do,i,need,to,tell,you,to,shut,your,bloody,mouth
he,shook,her,so,hard,her,teeth,rattled,then,let,her,fall
get,in,there,and,get,dry,like,the,man,said
arya,did,as,she,was,told
the,big,iron,brazier,was,glowing,red,filling,the,room,with,a,sullen,suffocating,heat
it,felt,pleasant,to,stand,beside,it,to,warm,her,hands,and,dry,off,a,little,bit,but,as,soon,as,she,felt,the,deck,move,under,her,feet,she,slipped,back,out,through,the,forward,door
the,two-headed,horse,eased,slowly,through,the,shallows,picking,its,way,between,the,chimneys,and,rooftops,of,drowned,harroway
a,dozen,men,labored,at,the,oars,while,four,more,used,the,long,poles,to,push,off,whenever,they,came,too,close,to,a,rock,a,tree,or,a,sunken,house
the,bent-backed,man,had,the,rudder
rain,pattered,against,the,smooth,planks,of,the,deck,and,splashed,off,the,tall,carved,horseheads,fore,and,aft
arya,was,getting,soaked,again,but,she,didn’t,care
she,wanted,to,see
the,man,with,the,crossbow,still,stood,in,the,window,of,the,roundtower,she,saw
his,eyes,followed,her,as,the,ferry,slid,by,underneath
she,wondered,if,he,was,this,lord,roote,that,the,hound,had,mentioned
he,doesn’t,look,much,like,a,lord
but,then,she,didn’t,look,much,like,a,lady,either
once,they,were,beyond,the,town,and,out,in,the,river,proper,the,current,grew,much,stronger
through,the,grey,haze,of,rain,arya,could,make,out,a,tall,stone,pillar,on,the,far,shore,that,surely,marked,the,ferry,landing,but,no,sooner,had,she,seen,it,than,she,realized,that,they,were,being,pushed,away,from,it,downstream
the,oarsmen,were,rowing,more,vigorously,now,fighting,the,rage,of,the,river
leaves,and,broken,branches,swirled,past,as,fast,as,if,they’d,been,fired,from,a,scorpion
the,men,with,the,poles,leaned,out,and,shoved,away,anything,that,came,too,close
it,was,windier,out,here,too
whenever,she,turned,to,look,upstream,arya,got,a,face,full,of,blowing,rain
stranger,was,screaming,and,kicking,as,the,deck,moved,underfoot
if,i,jumped,over,the,side,the,river,would,wash,me,away,before,the,hound,even,knew,that,i,was,gone
she,looked,back,over,a,shoulder,and,saw,sandor,clegane,struggling,with,his,frightened,horse,trying,to,calm,him
she,would,never,have,a,better,chance,to,get,away,from,him
i,might,drown,though
jon,used,to,say,that,she,swam,like,a,fish,but,even,a,fish,might,have,trouble,in,this,river
still,drowning,might,be,better,than,king’s,landing
she,thought,about,joffrey,and,crept,up,to,the,prow
the,river,was,murky,brown,with,mud,and,lashed,by,rain,looking,more,like,soup,than,water
arya,wondered,how,cold,it,would,be
i,couldn’t,get,much,wetter,than,i,am,now
she,put,a,hand,on,the,rail
but,a,sudden,shout,snapped,her,head,about,before,she,could,leap
the,ferrymen,were,rushing,forward,poles,in,hand
for,a,moment,she,did,not,understand,what,was,happening
then,she,saw,it,an,uprooted,tree,huge,and,dark,coming,straight,at,them
a,tangle,of,roots,and,limbs,poked,up,out,of,the,water,as,it,came,like,the,reaching,arms,of,a,great,kraken
the,oarsmen,were,backing,water,frantically,trying,to,avoid,a,collision,that,could,capsize,them,or,stove,their,hull,in
the,old,man,had,wrenched,the,rudder,about,and,the,horse,at,the,prow,was,swinging,downstream,but,too,slowly
glistening,brown,and,black,the,tree,rushed,toward,them,like,a,battering,ram
it,could,not,have,been,more,than,ten,feet,from,their,prow,when,two,of,the,boatmen,somehow,caught,it,with,their,long,poles
one,snapped,and,the,long,splintering,craaaack,made,it,sound,as,if,the,ferry,were,breaking,up,beneath,them
but,the,second,man,managed,to,give,the,trunk,a,hard,shove,just,enough,to,deflect,it,away,from,them
the,tree,swept,past,the,ferry,with,inches,to,spare,its,branches,scrabbling,like,claws,against,the,horsehead
only,just,when,it,seemed,as,if,they,were,clear,one,of,the,monster’s,upper,limbs,dealt,them,a,glancing,thump
the,ferry,seemed,to,shudder,and,arya,slipped,landing,painfully,on,one,knee
the,man,with,the,broken,pole,was,not,so,lucky
she,heard,him,shout,as,he,stumbled,over,the,side
then,the,raging,brown,water,closed,over,him,and,he,was,gone,in,the,time,it,took,arya,to,climb,back,to,her,feet
one,of,the,other,boatmen,snatched,up,a,coil,of,rope,but,there,was,no,one,to,throw,it,to
maybe,he’ll,wash,up,someplace,downstream,arya,tried,to,tell,herself,but,the,thought,had,a,hollow,ring
she,had,lost,all,desire,to,go,swimming
when,sandor,clegane,shouted,at,her,to,get,back,inside,before,he,beat,her,bloody,she,went,meekly
the,ferry,was,fighting,to,turn,back,on,course,by,then,against,a,river,that,wanted,nothing,more,than,to,carry,it,down,to,the,sea
when,they,finally,came,ashore,it,was,a,good,two,miles,downriver,of,their,usual,landing
the,boat,slammed,into,the,bank,so,hard,that,another,pole,snapped,and,arya,almost,lost,her,feet,again
sandor,clegane,lifted,her,onto,stranger’s,back,as,if,she,weighed,no,more,than,a,doll
the,boatmen,stared,at,them,with,dull,exhausted,eyes,all,but,the,bent-backed,man,who,held,his,hand,out
six,dragons,he,demanded
three,for,the,passage,and,three,for,the,man,i,lost
sandor,clegane,rummaged,in,his,pouch,and,shoved,a,crumpled,wad,of,parchment,into,the,boatman’s,palm
there
take,ten
ten
the,ferryman,was,confused
what’s,this,now
a,dead,man’s,note,good,for,nine,thousand,dragons,or,nearabouts
the,hound,swung,up,into,the,saddle,behind,arya,and,smiled,down,unpleasantly
ten,of,it,is,yours
i’ll,be,back,for,the,rest,one,day,so,see,you,don’t,go,spending,it
the,man,squinted,down,at,the,parchment
writing
what,good’s,writing
you,promised,gold
knight’s,honor,you,said
knights,have,no,bloody,honor
time,you,learned,that,old,man
the,hound,gave,stranger,the,spur,and,galloped,off,through,the,rain
the,ferrymen,threw,curses,at,their,backs,and,one,or,two,threw,stones
clegane,ignored,rocks,and,words,alike,and,before,long,they,were,lost,in,the,gloom,of,the,trees,the,river,a,dwindling,roar,behind,them
the,ferry,won’t,cross,back,till,morning,he,said,and,that,lot,won’t,be,taking,paper,promises,from,the,next,fools,to,come,along
if,your,friends,are,chasing,us,they’re,going,to,need,to,be,bloody,strong,swimmers
arya,huddled,down,and,held,her,tongue
valar,morghulis,she,thought,sullenly
ser,ilyn,ser,meryn,king,joffrey,queen,cersei
dunsen,polliver,raff,the,sweetling,ser,gregor,and,the,tickler
and,the,hound,the,hound,the,hound
by,the,time,the,rain,stopped,and,the,clouds,broke,she,was,shivering,and,sneezing,so,badly,that,clegane,called,a,halt,for,the,night,and,even,tried,to,make,a,fire
the,wood,they,gathered,proved,too,wet,though
nothing,he,tried,was,enough,to,make,the,spark,catch
finally,he,kicked,it,all,apart,in,disgust
seven,bloody,hells,he,swore
i,hate,fires
they,sat,on,damp,rocks,beneath,an,oak,tree,listening,to,the,slow,patter,of,water,dripping,from,the,leaves,as,they,ate,a,cold,supper,of,hardbread,moldy,cheese,and,smoked,sausage
the,hound,sliced,the,meat,with,his,dagger,and,narrowed,his,eyes,when,he,caught,arya,looking,at,the,knife
don’t,even,think,about,it
i,wasn’t,she,lied
he,snorted,to,show,what,he,thought,of,that,but,he,gave,her,a,thick,slice,of,sausage
arya,worried,it,with,her,teeth,watching,him,all,the,while
i,never,beat,your,sister,the,hound,said
but,i’ll,beat,you,if,you,make,me
stop,trying,to,think,up,ways,to,kill,me
none,of,it,will,do,you,a,bit,of,good
she,had,nothing,to,say,to,that
she,gnawed,on,the,sausage,and,stared,at,him,coldly
hard,as,stone,she,thought
at,least,you,look,at,my,face
i’ll,give,you,that,you,little,she-wolf
how,do,you,like,it
i,don’t
it’s,all,burned,and,ugly
clegane,offered,her,a,chunk,of,cheese,on,the,point,of,his,dagger
you’re,a,little,fool
what,good,would,it,do,you,if,you,did,get,away
you’d,just,get,caught,by,someone,worse
i,would,not,she,insisted
there,is,no,one,worse
you,never,knew,my,brother
gregor,once,killed,a,man,for,snoring
his,own,man
when,he,grinned,the,burned,side,of,his,face,pulled,tight,twisting,his,mouth,in,a,queer,unpleasant,way
he,had,no,lips,on,that,side,and,only,the,stump,of,an,ear
i,did,so,know,your,brother
maybe,the,mountain,was,worse,now,that,arya,thought,about,it
him,and,dunsen,and,polliver,and,raff,the,sweetling,and,the,tickler
the,hound,seemed,surprised
and,how,would,ned,stark’s,precious,little,daughter,come,to,know,the,likes,of,them
gregor,never,brings,his,pet,rats,to,court
i,know,them,from,the,village

the,village,by,the,lake,where,they,caught,gendry,me,and,hot,pie

clegane’s,mouth,twitched
caught,you
my,brother,caught,you
that,made,him,laugh,a,sour,sound,part,rumble,and,part,snarl

he,couldn’t,have,or,he,would,have,dragged,you,back,kicking,and,screaming,to,king’s,landing,and,dumped,you,in,cersei’s,lap
oh,that’s,bloody,sweet
i’ll,be,sure,and,tell,him,that,before,i,cut,his,heart,out
it,wasn’t,the,first,time,he,had,talked,of,killing,the,mountain
but,he’s,your,brother,arya,said,dubiously
didn’t,you,ever,have,a,brother,you,wanted,to,kill
he,laughed,again
or,maybe,a,sister
he,must,have,seen,something,in,her,face,then,for,he,leaned,closer

that’s,it,isn’t,it
the,wolf,bitch,wants,to,kill,the,pretty,bird

where,do,you,think,we’re,going
the,scorn,in,his,voice,made,her,hesitate
back,to,king’s,landing,she,said

jon,the,mare,was,blown,but,jon,could,not,let,up,on,her
he,had,to,reach,the,wall,before,the,magnar
he,would,have,slept,in,the,saddle,if,he’d,had,one,lacking,that,it,was,hard,enough,to,stay,ahorse,while,awake
his,wounded,leg,grew,ever,more,painful
he,dare,not,rest,long,enough,to,let,it,heal
instead,he,ripped,it,open,anew,each,time,he,mounted,up
when,he,crested,a,rise,and,saw,the,brown,rutted,kingsroad,before,him,wending,its,way,north,through,hill,and,plain,he,patted,the,mare’s,neck,and,said,now,all,we,need,do,is,follow,the,road,girl
soon,the,wall
his,leg,had,gone,as,stiff,as,wood,by,then,and,fever,had,made,him,so,light-headed,that,twice,he,found,himself,riding,in,the,wrong,direction
soon,the,wall
he,pictured,his,friends,drinking,mulled,wine,in,the,common,hall

you,were,wrong,to,love,her,a,voice,whispered
you,were,wrong,to,leave,her,a,different,voice,insisted
he,wondered,if,his,father,had,been,torn,the,same,way,when,he’d,left,jon’s,mother,to,return,to,lady,catelyn
he,was,pledged,to,lady,stark,and,i,am,pledged,to,the,night’s,watch
he,almost,rode,through,mole’s,town,so,feverish,that,he,did,not,know,where,he,was
most,of,the,village,was,hidden,underground,only,a,handful,of,small,hovels,to,be,seen,by,the,light,of,the,waning,moon
the,brothel,was,a,shed,no,bigger,than,a,privy,its,red,lantern,creaking,in,the,wind,a,bloodshot,eye,peering,through,the,blackness
jon,dismounted,at,the,adjoining,stable,half-stumbling,from,the,mare’s,back,as,he,shouted,two,boys,awake
i,need,a,fresh,mount,with,saddle,and,bridle,he,told,them,in,a,tone,that,brooked,no,argument
they,brought,him,that,a,skin,of,wine,as,well,and,half,a,loaf,of,brown,bread

he,pulled,himself,onto,the,black,gelding,they’d,given,him,gritting,his,teeth,at,the,pain,in,his,leg,and,rode,hard,for,the,north
as,the,stars,began,to,fade,in,the,eastern,sky,the,wall,appeared,before,him,rising,above,the,trees,and,the,morning,mists
moonlight,glimmered,pale,against,the,ice
he,urged,the,gelding,on,following,the,muddy,slick,road,until,he,saw,the,stone,towers,and,timbered,halls,of,castle,black,huddled,like,broken,toys,beneath,the,great,cliff,of,ice
by,then,the,wall,glowed,pink,and,purple,with,the,first,light,of,dawn
no,sentries,challenged,him,as,he,rode,past,the,outbuildings
no,one,came,forth,to,bar,his,way

fingers,of,soot,streaked,the,lord,commander’s,tower,where,the,smoke,had,boiled,from,the,windows
mormont,had,moved,to,the,king’s,tower,after,the,fire,but,jon,saw,no,lights,there,either
from,the,ground,he,could,not,tell,if,there,were,sentries,walking,the,wall,seven,hundred,feet,above,but,he,saw,no,one,on,the,huge,switchback,stair,that,climbed,the,south,face,of,the,ice,like,some,great,wooden,thunderbolt
there,was,smoke,rising,from,the,chimney,of,the,armory,though,only,a,wisp,almost,invisible,against,the,grey,northern,sky,but,it,was,enough
jon,dismounted,and,limped,toward,it

a,deliberate,slight

there,was,something,of,the,vulture,about,lord,walder,and,rather,more,of,the,weasel
his,bald,head,spotted,with,age,thrust,out,from,his,scrawny,shoulders,on,a,long,pink,neck
loose,skin,dangled,beneath,his,receding,chin,his,eyes,were,runny,and,clouded,and,his,toothless,mouth,moved,constantly,sucking,at,the,empty,air,as,a,babe,sucks,at,his,mother’s,breast
the,eighth,lady,frey,stood,beside,lord,walder’s,high,seat
at,his,feet,sat,a,somewhat,younger,version,of,himself,a,stooped,thin,man,of,fifty,whose,costly,garb,of,blue,wool,and,grey,satin,was,strangely,accented,by,a,crown,and,collar,ornamented,with,tiny,brass,bells

it,was,a,question,she,dare,not,ask
frey,sons,daughters,children,grandchildren,husbands,wives,and,servants,crowded,the,rest,of,the,hall

my,legs,no,longer,work,as,they,did,though,that,which,hangs,between,’em,serves,well,enough,heh

the,old,man,either,did,not,hear,it,or,refused,to,pay,it,any,heed
fairer,than,my,own,get,heh

pretty,enough,catelyn,thought,but,so,small,and,she,comes,of,rosby,stock
the,rosbys,had,never,been,robust
she,much,preferred,the,frames,of,some,of,the,older,girls,in,the,hall,daughters,or,granddaughters,she,could,not,be,sure
they,had,a,crakehall,look,about,them,and,lord,walder’s,third,wife,had,been,of,that,house

edmure,echoed,him,along,with,the,greatjon,ser,marq,piper,and,the,others
they,drank,his,wine,and,ate,his,bread,and,butter
catelyn,tasted,the,wine,and,nibbled,at,some,bread,and,felt,much,the,better,for,it
now,we,should,be,safe,she,thought
knowing,how,petty,the,old,man,could,be,she,had,expected,their,rooms,to,be,bleak,and,cheerless
but,the,freys,had,made,more,than,ample,provision,for,them,it,seemed
the,bridal,chamber,was,large,and,richly,appointed,dominated,by,a,great,featherbed,with,corner,posts,carved,in,the,likeness,of,castle,towers
its,draperies,were,tully,red,and,blue,a,nice,courtesy
sweet-smelling,carpets,covered,a,plank,floor,and,a,tall,shuttered,window,opened,to,the,south
catelyn’s,own,room,was,smaller,but,handsomely,furnished,and,comfortable,with,a,fire,burning,in,the,hearth
lame,lothar,assured,them,that,robb,would,have,an,entire,suite,as,befit,a,king
if,there,is,anything,you,require,you,need,only,tell,one,of,the,guards
he,bowed,and,withdrew,limping,heavily,as,he,made,his,way,down,the,curving,steps
we,should,post,our,own,guards,catelyn,told,her,brother
she,would,rest,easier,with,stark,and,tully,men,outside,her,door
the,audience,with,lord,walder,had,not,been,as,painful,as,she,feared,yet,all,the,same,she,would,be,glad,to,be,done,with,this
a,few,more,days,and,robb,will,be,off,to,battle,and,me,to,a,comfortable,captivity,at,seagard
lord,jason,would,show,her,every,courtesy,she,had,no,doubt,but,the,prospect,still,depressed,her
she,could,hear,the,sounds,of,horses,below,as,the,long,column,of,mounted,men,wound,their,way,across,the,bridge,from,castle,to,castle
the,stones,rumbled,to,the,passage,of,heavy-laden,wayns
catelyn,went,to,the,window,and,gazed,out,to,watch,robb’s,host,emerge,from,the,eastern,twin
the,rain,seems,to,be,lessening
now,that,we’re,inside
edmure,stood,before,the,fire,letting,the,warmth,wash,over,him
what,did,you,make,of,roslin
too,small,and,delicate
childbirth,will,go,hard,on,her
but,her,brother,seemed,well,pleased,with,the,girl,so,all,she,said,was,sweet
i,believe,she,liked,me
why,was,she,crying
she’s,a,maid,on,the,eve,of,her,wedding
a,few,tears,are,to,be,expected
lysa,had,wept,lakes,the,morning,of,their,own,wedding,though,she,had,managed,to,be,dry-eyed,and,radiant,when,jon,arryn,swept,his,cream-and-blue,cloak,about,her,shoulders
she’s,prettier,than,i,dared,hope
edmure,raised,a,hand,before,she,could,speak
i,know,there,are,more,important,things,spare,me,the,sermon,septa
even,so
did,you,see,some,of,those,other,maids,frey,trotted,out
the,one,with,the,twitch
was,that,the,shaking,sickness
and,those,twins,had,more,craters,and,eruptions,on,their,faces,than,petyr,pimple
when,i,saw,that,lot,i,knew,roslin,would,be,bald,and,one-eyed,with,jinglebell’s,wits,and,black,walder’s,temper
but,she,seems,gentle,as,well,as,fair
he,looked,perplexed,why,would,the,old,weasel,refuse,to,let,me,choose,unless,he,meant,to,foist,off,someone,hideous
your,fondness,for,a,pretty,face,is,well,known,catelyn,reminded,him
perhaps,lord,walder,actually,wants,you,to,be,happy,with,your,bride
or,more,like,he,did,not,want,you,balking,over,a,boil,and,upsetting,all,his,plans
or,it,may,be,that,roslin,is,the,old,man’s,favorite
the,lord,of,riverrun,is,a,much,better,match,than,most,of,his,daughters,can,hope,for
true
her,brother,still,seemed,uncertain,however
is,it,possible,the,girl,is,barren
lord,walder,wants,his,grandson,to,inherit,riverrun
how,would,it,serve,him,to,give,you,a,barren,wife
it,rids,him,of,a,daughter,no,one,else,would,take
small,good,that,will,do,him
walder,frey,is,a,peevish,man,not,a,stupid,one
still
it,is,possible
yes,catelyn,conceded,reluctantly
there,are,illnesses,a,girl,can,have,in,childhood,that,leave,her,unable,to,conceive
there’s,no,reason,to,believe,that,lady,roslin,was,so,afflicted,though
she,looked,round,the,room
the,freys,have,received,us,more,kindly,than,i,had,anticipated,if,truth,be,told
edmure,laughed
a,few,barbed,words,and,some,unseemly,gloating
from,him,that’s,courtesy
i,expected,the,old,weasel,to,piss,in,our,wine,and,make,us,praise,the,vintage
the,jest,left,catelyn,strangely,disquieted
if,you,will,excuse,me,i,should,change,from,these,wet,clothes
as,you,wish
edmure,yawned
i,may,nap,an,hour
she,retreated,to,her,own,room
the,chest,of,clothes,she’d,brought,from,riverrun,had,been,carried,up,and,laid,at,the,foot,of,the,bed
after,she’d,undressed,and,hung,her,wet,clothing,by,the,fire,she,donned,a,warm,wool,dress,of,tully,red,and,blue,washed,and,brushed,her,hair,and,let,it,dry,and,went,in,search,of,freys
lord,walder’s,black,oak,throne,was,empty,when,she,entered,the,hall,but,some,of,his,sons,were,drinking,by,the,fire
lame,lothar,rose,clumsily,when,he,saw,her
lady,catelyn,i,thought,you,would,be,resting
how,may,i,be,of,service
are,these,your,brothers
she,asked
brothers,half-brothers,good,brothers,and,nephews
raymund,and,i,shared,a,mother
lord,lucias,vypren,is,my,half-sister,lythene’s,husband,and,ser,damon,is,their,son
my,half-brother,ser,hosteen,i,believe,you,know
and,this,is,ser,leslyn,haigh,and,his,sons,ser,harys,and,ser,donnel
well,met,sers
is,ser,perwyn,about
he,helped,escort,me,to,storm’s,end,and,back,when,robb,sent,me,to,speak,with,lord,renly
i,was,looking,forward,to,seeing,him,again
perwyn,is,away,lame,lothar,said
i,shall,give,him,your,regards
i,know,he,will,regret,having,missed,you
surely,he,will,return,in,time,for,lady,roslin’s,wedding
he,had,hoped,to,said,lame,lothar,but,with,this,rain
you,saw,how,the,rivers,ran,my,lady
i,did,indeed,said,catelyn
i,wonder,if,you,would,be,so,good,as,to,direct,me,to,your,maester
are,you,unwell,my,lady
asked,ser,hosteen,a,powerful,man,with,a,square,strong,jaw
a,woman’s,complaint
nothing,to,concern,you,ser
lothar,ever,gracious,escorted,her,from,the,hall,up,some,steps,and,across,a,covered,bridge,to,another,stair
you,should,find,maester,brenett,in,the,turret,on,the,top,my,lady
catelyn,half,expected,that,the,maester,would,be,yet,another,son,of,walder,frey’s,but,brenett,did,not,have,the,look
he,was,a,great,fat,man,bald,and,double-chinned,and,none,too,clean,to,judge,from,the,raven,droppings,that,stained,the,sleeves,of,his,robes,yet,he,seemed,amiable,enough
when,she,told,him,of,edmure’s,concerns,about,lady,roslin’s,fertility,he,chuckled
your,lord,brother,need,have,no,fear,lady,catelyn
she’s,small,i’ll,grant,you,and,narrow,in,the,hips,but,her,mother,was,the,same,and,lady,bethany,gave,lord,walder,a,child,every,year
how,many,lived,past,infancy
she,asked,bluntly
five
he,ticked,them,off,on,fingers,plump,as,sausages
ser,perwyn
ser,benfrey
maester,willamen,who,took,his,vows,last,year,and,now,serves,lord,hunter,in,the,vale
olyvar,who,squired,for,your,son
and,lady,roslin,the,youngest
four,boys,to,one,girl
lord,edmure,will,have,more,sons,than,he,knows,what,to,do,with
i,am,sure,that,will,please,him
so,the,girl,was,like,to,be,fertile,as,well,as,fair,of,face
that,should,put,edmure’s,mind,at,ease
lord,walder,had,left,her,brother,no,cause,for,complaint,so,far,as,she,could,see
catelyn,did,not,return,to,her,own,room,after,leaving,the,maester,instead,she,went,to,robb
she,found,robin,flint,and,ser,wendel,manderly,with,him,along,with,the,greatjon,and,his,son,who,was,still,called,the,smalljon,though,he,threatened,to,overtop,his,father
they,were,all,damp
another,man,still,wetter,stood,before,the,fire,in,a,pale,pink,cloak,trimmed,with,white,fur
lord,bolton,she,said
lady,catelyn,he,replied,his,voice,faint,it,is,a,pleasure,to,look,on,you,again,even,in,such,trying,times
you,are,kind,to,say,so
catelyn,could,feel,gloom,in,the,room
even,the,greatjon,seemed,somber,and,subdued
she,looked,at,their,grim,faces,and,said,what’s,happened
lannisters,on,the,trident,said,ser,wendel,unhappily
my,brother,is,taken,again
and,lord,bolton,has,brought,us,further,word,of,winterfell,robb,added
ser,rodrik,was,not,the,only,good,man,to,die
cley,cerwyn,and,leobald,tallhart,were,slain,as,well

the,ironmen,burned,both,castle,and,winter,town
some,of,your,people,were,taken,back,to,the,dreadfort,by,my,son,ramsay
your,bastard,was,accused,of,grievous,crimes,catelyn,reminded,him,sharply
of,murder,rape,and,worse
yes,roose,bolton,said
his,blood,is,tainted,that,cannot,be,denied
yet,he,is,a,good,fighter,as,cunning,as,he,is,fearless
when,the,ironmen,cut,down,ser,rodrik,and,leobald,tallhart,soon,after,it,fell,to,ramsay,to,lead,the,battle,and,he,did
he,swears,that,he,shall,not,sheathe,his,sword,so,long,as,a,single,greyjoy,remains,in,the,north
perhaps,such,service,might,atone,in,some,small,measure,for,whatever,crimes,his,bastard,blood,has,led,him,to,commit
he,shrugged
or,not
when,the,war,is,done,his,grace,must,weigh,and,judge
by,then,i,hope,to,have,a,trueborn,son,by,lady,walda
this,is,a,cold,man,catelyn,realized,not,for,the,first,time
did,ramsay,mention,theon,greyjoy
robb,demanded
was,he,slain,as,well,or,did,he,flee
roose,bolton,removed,a,ragged,strip,of,leather,from,the,pouch,at,his,belt
my,son,sent,this,with,his,letter
ser,wendel,turned,his,fat,face,away
robin,flint,and,smalljon,umber,exchanged,a,look,and,the,greatjon,snorted,like,a,bull
is,that
skin

the,skin,from,the,little,finger,of,theon,greyjoy’s,left,hand
my,son,is,cruel,i,confess,it
and,yet
what,is,a,little,skin,against,the,lives,of,two,young,princes
you,were,their,mother,my,lady
may,i,offer,you,this
small,token,of,revenge
part,of,catelyn,wanted,to,clutch,the,grisly,trophy,to,her,heart,but,she,made,herself,resist
put,it,away
please
flaying,theon,will,not,bring,my,brothers,back,robb,said
i,want,his,head,not,his,skin
he,is,balon,greyjoy’s,only,living,son,lord,bolton,said,softly,as,if,they,had,forgotten,and,now,rightful,king,of,the,iron,islands
a,captive,king,has,great,value,as,a,hostage
hostage
the,word,raised,catelyn’s,hackles
hostages,were,oft,exchanged
lord,bolton,i,hope,you,are,not,suggesting,that,we,free,the,man,who,killed,my,sons
whoever,wins,the,seastone,chair,will,want,theon,greyjoy,dead,bolton,pointed,out
even,in,chains,he,has,a,better,claim,than,any,of,his,uncles
hold,him,i,say,and,demand,concessions,from,the,ironborn,as,the,price,of,his,execution
robb,considered,that,reluctantly,but,in,the,end,he,nodded
yes
very,well
keep,him,alive,then
for,the,present
hold,him,secure,at,the,dreadfort,till,we’ve,retaken,the,north
catelyn,turned,back,to,roose,bolton

i,delayed,too,long,before,leaving,harrenhal

but,by,the,time,we,came,up,the,river,was,a,torrent
i,had,no,choice,but,to,ferry,my,men,across,in,small,boats,of,which,we,had,too,few
two-thirds,of,my,strength,was,on,the,north,side,when,the,lannisters,attacked,those,still,waiting,to,cross
norrey,locke,and,burley,men,chiefly,with,ser,wylis,manderly,and,his,white,harbor,knights,as,rear,guard
i,was,on,the,wrong,side,of,the,trident,powerless,to,help,them
ser,wylis,rallied,our,men,as,best,he,could,but,gregor,clegane,attacked,with,heavy,horse,and,drove,them,into,the,river
as,many,drowned,as,were,cut,down
more,fled,and,the,rest,were,taken,captive
gregor,clegane,was,always,ill,news,catelyn,reflected

or,was,the,mountain,coming,here

no
bolton’s,voice,was,soft,but,certain

robb,made,the,word,a,curse
robett,glover,will,answer,for,that,when,i,see,him,i,promise,you
a,folly,lord,bolton,agreed,but,glover,was,heedless,after,he,learned,that,deepwood,motte,had,fallen
grief,and,fear,will,do,that,to,a,man
duskendale,was,done,and,cold,it,was,the,battles,still,to,come,that,worried,catelyn
how,many,men,have,you,brought,my,son

he,looked,like,some,down-at-heels,farmer
a,big,farmer,though
and,under,the,roughspun,was,boiled,leather,and,oiled,mail,arya,knew
she,looked,like,a,farmer’s,son,or,maybe,a,swineherd
and,behind,them,were,four,squat,casks,of,salt,pork,and,one,of,pickled,pigs’,feet
the,riders,split,and,circled,them,for,a,look,before,they,came,up,close
clegane,drew,the,wayn,to,a,halt,and,waited,patiently,on,their,pleasure
the,knight,bore,spear,and,sword,while,his,squires,carried,longbows
the,badges,on,their,jerkins,were,smaller,versions,of,the,sigil,sewn,on,their,master’s,surcoat,a,black,pitchfork,on,a,golden,bar,sinister,upon,a,russet,field
arya,had,thought,of,revealing,herself,to,the,first,outriders,they,encountered,but,she,had,always,pictured,grey-cloaked,men,with,the,direwolf,on,their,breasts
she,might,have,risked,it,even,if,they’d,worn,the,umber,giant,or,the,glover,fist,but,she,did,not,know,this,pitchfork,knight,or,whom,he,served
the,closest,thing,to,a,pitchfork,she,had,ever,seen,at,winterfell,was,the,trident,in,the,hand,of,lord,manderly’s,merman
you,have,business,at,the,twins
the,knight,asked
salt,pork,for,the,wedding,feast,if,it,please,you,ser
the,hound,mumbled,his,reply,his,eyes,down,his,face,hidden
salt,pork,never,pleases,me
the,pitchfork,knight,gave,clegane,only,the,most,cursory,glance,and,paid,no,attention,at,all,to,arya,but,he,looked,long,and,hard,at,stranger
the,stallion,was,no,plow,horse,that,was,plain,at,a,glance
one,of,the,squires,almost,wound,up,in,the,mud,when,the,big,black,courser,bit,at,his,own,mount
how,did,you,come,by,this,beast
the,pitchfork,knight,demanded
m’lady,told,me,to,bring,him,ser,clegane,said,humbly
he’s,a,wedding,gift,for,young,lord,tully
what,lady
who,is,it,you,serve
old,lady,whent,ser
does,she,think,she,can,buy,harrenhal,back,with,a,horse
the,knight,asked
gods,is,there,any,fool,like,an,old,fool
yet,he,waved,them,down,the,road
go,on,with,you,then
aye,m’lord
the,hound,snapped,his,whip,again,and,the,old,drays,resumed,their,weary,trek
the,wheels,had,settled,deep,into,the,mud,during,the,halt,and,it,took,several,moments,for,the,team,to,pull,them,free,again
by,then,the,outriders,were,riding,off
clegane,gave,them,one,last,look,and,snorted
ser,donnel,haigh,he,said
i’ve,taken,more,horses,off,him,than,i,can,count
armor,as,well
once,i,near,killed,him,in,a,mêlée
how,come,he,didn’t,know,you,then
arya,asked
because,knights,are,fools,and,it,would,have,been,beneath,him,to,look,twice,at,some,poxy,peasant
he,gave,the,horses,a,lick,with,the,whip
keep,your,eyes,down,and,your,tone,respectful,and,say,ser,a,lot,and,most,knights,will,never,see,you
they,pay,more,mind,to,horses,than,to,smallfolk
he,might,have,known,stranger,if,he’d,ever,seen,me,ride,him
he,would,have,known,your,face,though
arya,had,no,doubt,of,that
sandor,clegane’s,burns,would,not,be,easy,to,forget,once,you,saw,them
he,couldn’t,hide,the,scars,behind,a,helm,either,not,so,long,as,the,helm,was,made,in,the,shape,of,a,snarling,dog
that,was,why,they’d,needed,the,wayn,and,the,pickled,pigs’,feet
i’m,not,going,to,be,dragged,before,your,brother,in,chains,the,hound,had,told,her,and,i’d,just,as,soon,not,have,to,cut,through,his,men,to,get,to,him
so,we,play,a,little,game
a,farmer,chance-met,on,the,kingsroad,had,provided,them,with,wayn,horses,garb,and,casks,though,not,willingly
the,hound,had,taken,them,at,swordpoint
when,the,farmer,cursed,him,for,a,robber,he,said,no,a,forager
be,grateful,you,get,to,keep,your,smallclothes
now,take,those,boots,off
or,i’ll,take,your,legs,off
your,choice
the,farmer,was,as,big,as,clegane,but,all,the,same,he,chose,to,give,up,his,boots,and,keep,his,legs
evenfall,found,them,still,trudging,toward,the,green,fork,and,lord,frey’s,twin,castles
i,am,almost,there,arya,thought
she,knew,she,ought,to,be,excited,but,her,belly,was,all,knotted,up,tight
maybe,that,was,just,the,fever,she’d,been,fighting,but,maybe,not
last,night,she’d,had,a,bad,dream,a,terrible,dream
she,couldn’t,remember,what,she’d,dreamed,of,now,but,the,feeling,had,lingered,all,day
if,anything,it,had,only,gotten,stronger
fear,cuts,deeper,than,swords
she,had,to,be,strong,now,the,way,her,father,told,her
there,was,nothing,between,her,and,her,mother,but,a,castle,gate,a,river,and,an,army
but,it,was,robb’s,army,so,there,was,no,real,danger,there
was,there
roose,bolton,was,one,of,them,though
the,leech,lord,as,the,outlaws,called,him
that,made,her,uneasy
she,had,fled,harrenhal,to,get,away,from,bolton,as,much,as,from,the,bloody,mummers,and,she’d,had,to,cut,the,throat,of,one,of,his,guards,to,escape
did,he,know,she’d,done,that
or,did,he,blame,gendry,or,hot,pie
would,he,have,told,her,mother
what,would,he,do,if,he,saw,her
he,probably,won’t,even,know,me
she,looked,more,like,a,drowned,rat,than,a,lord’s,cupbearer,these,days
a,drowned,boy,rat
the,hound,had,hacked,handfuls,of,her,hair,off,only,two,days,past
he,was,an,even,worse,barber,than,yoren,and,he’d,left,her,half,bald,on,one,side
robb,won’t,know,me,either,i,bet
or,even,mother
she,had,been,a,little,girl,the,last,time,she,saw,them,the,day,lord,eddard,stark,left,winterfell
they,heard,the,music,before,they,saw,the,castle,the,distant,rattle,of,drums,the,brazen,blare,of,horns,the,thin,skirling,of,pipes,faint,beneath,the,growl,of,the,river,and,the,sound,of,the,rain,beating,on,their,heads
we’ve,missed,the,wedding,the,hound,said,but,it,sounds,as,though,the,feast,is,still,going
i’ll,be,rid,of,you,soon
no,i’ll,be,rid,of,you,arya,thought
the,road,had,been,running,mostly,northwest,but,now,it,turned,due,west,between,an,apple,orchard,and,a,field,of,drowned,corn,beaten,down,by,the,rain
they,passed,the,last,of,the,apple,trees,and,crested,a,rise,and,the,castles,river,and,camps,all,appeared,at,once
there,were,hundreds,of,horses,and,thousands,of,men,most,of,them,milling,about,the,three,huge,feast,tents,that,stood,side,by,side,facing,the,castle,gates,like,three,great,canvas,longhalls
robb,had,made,his,camp,well,back,from,the,walls,on,higher,drier,ground,but,the,green,fork,had,overflown,its,bank,and,even,claimed,a,few,carelessly,placed,tents
the,music,from,the,castles,was,louder,here
the,sound,of,the,drums,and,horns,rolled,across,the,camp
the,musicians,in,the,nearer,castle,were,playing,a,different,song,than,the,ones,in,the,castle,on,the,far,bank,though,so,it,sounded,more,like,a,battle,than,a,song
they’re,not,very,good,arya,observed
the,hound,made,a,sound,that,might,have,been,a,laugh
there’s,old,deaf,women,in,lannisport,complaining,of,the,din,i’ll,warrant
i’d,heard,walder,frey’s,eyes,were,failing,but,no,one,mentioned,his,bloody,ears
arya,found,herself,wishing,it,were,day
if,the,sun,was,out,and,the,wind,was,blowing,she,would,have,been,able,to,see,the,banners,better
she,would,have,looked,for,the,direwolf,of,stark,or,maybe,the,cerwyn,battleaxe,or,the,glover,fist
but,in,the,gloom,of,night,all,the,colors,looked,grey
the,rain,had,dwindled,down,to,a,fine,drizzle,almost,a,mist,but,an,earlier,downpour,had,left,the,banners,wet,as,dishrags,sodden,and,unreadable
a,hedge,of,wagons,and,carts,had,been,drawn,up,along,the,perimeter,to,make,a,crude,wooden,wall,against,any,attack
that,was,where,the,guards,stopped,them
the,lantern,their,sergeant,carried,shed,enough,light,for,arya,to,see,that,his,cloak,was,a,pale,pink,spotted,with,red,teardrops
the,men,under,him,had,the,leech,lord’s,badge,sewn,over,their,hearts,the,flayed,man,of,the,dreadfort
sandor,clegane,gave,them,the,same,tale,he’d,used,on,the,outriders,but,the,bolton,sergeant,was,a,harder,sort,of,nut,than,ser,donnel,haigh,had,been
salt,pork’s,no,fit,meat,for,a,lord’s,wedding,feast,he,said,scornfully
got,pickled,pigs’,feet,too,ser
not,for,the,feast,you,don’t
the,feast’s,half,done
and,i’m,a,northman,not,some,milksuck,southron,knight
i,was,told,to,see,the,steward,or,the,cook

the,lordlings,are,not,to,be,disturbed
the,sergeant,considered,a,moment

he,pointed,with,a,mailed,hand
ale,makes,a,man,hungry,and,old,frey,won’t,miss,a,few,pigs’,feet
he,don’t,have,the,teeth,for,such,anyhow
ask,for,sedgekins,he’ll,know,what’s,to,be,done,with,you
he,barked,a,command,and,his,men,rolled,one,of,the,wagons,aside,for,them,to,enter
the,hound’s,whip,spurred,the,team,toward,the,tents
no,one,seemed,to,pay,them,any,mind
they,splashed,past,rows,of,brightly,colored,pavilions,their,walls,of,wet,silk,lit,up,like,magic,lanterns,by,lamps,and,braziers,inside,pink,and,gold,and,green,they,glimmered,striped,and,fretty,and,chequy,emblazoned,with,birds,and,beasts,chevrons,and,stars,wheels,and,weapons
arya,spotted,a,yellow,tent,with,six,acorns,on,its,panels,three,over,two,over,one
lord,smallwood,she,knew,remembering,acorn,hall,so,far,away,and,the,lady,who’d,said,she,was,pretty
but,for,every,shimmering,silk,pavilion,there,were,two,dozen,of,felt,or,canvas,opaque,and,dark
there,were,barracks,tents,too,big,enough,to,shelter,two,score,footsoldiers,though,even,those,were,dwarfed,by,the,three,great,feast,tents
the,drinking,had,been,going,on,for,hours,it,seemed
arya,heard,shouted,toasts,and,the,clash,of,cups,mixed,in,with,all,the,usual,camp,sounds,horses,whinnying,and,dogs,barking,wagons,rumbling,through,the,dark,laughter,and,curses,the,clank,and,clatter,of,steel,and,wood
the,music,grew,still,louder,as,they,approached,the,castle,but,under,that,was,a,deeper,darker,sound,the,river,the,swollen,green,fork,growling,like,a,lion,in,its,den
arya,twisted,and,turned,trying,to,look,everywhere,at,once,hoping,for,a,glimpse,of,a,direwolf,badge,for,a,tent,done,up,in,grey,and,white,for,a,face,she,knew,from,winterfell
all,she,saw,were,strangers
she,stared,at,a,man,relieving,himself,in,the,reeds,but,he,wasn’t,alebelly
she,saw,a,half-dressed,girl,burst,from,a,tent,laughing,but,the,tent,was,pale,blue,not,grey,like,she’d,thought,at,first,and,the,man,who,went,running,after,her,wore,a,treecat,on,his,doublet,not,a,wolf
beneath,a,tree,four,archers,were,slipping,waxed,strings,over,the,notches,of,their,longbows,but,they,were,not,her,father’s,archers
a,maester,crossed,their,path,but,he,was,too,young,and,thin,to,be,maester,luwin
arya,gazed,up,at,the,twins,their,high,tower,windows,glowing,softly,wherever,a,light,was,burning
through,the,haze,of,rain,the,castles,looked,spooky,and,mysterious,like,something,from,one,of,old,nan’s,tales,but,they,weren’t,winterfell
the,press,was,thickest,at,the,feast,tents
the,wide,flaps,were,tied,back,and,men,were,pushing,in,and,out,with,drinking,horns,and,tankards,in,their,hands,some,with,camp,followers
arya,glanced,inside,as,the,hound,drove,past,the,first,of,the,three,and,saw,hundreds,of,men,crowding,the,benches,and,jostling,around,the,casks,of,mead,and,ale,and,wine
there,was,hardly,room,to,move,inside,but,none,of,them,seemed,to,mind
at,least,they,were,warm,and,dry
cold,wet,arya,envied,them
some,were,even,singing
the,fine,misty,rain,was,steaming,all,around,the,door,from,the,heat,escaping,from,inside
here’s,to,lord,edmure,and,lady,roslin,she,heard,a,voice,shout
they,all,drank,and,someone,yelled,here’s,to,the,young,wolf,and,queen,jeyne
who,is,queen,jeyne
arya,wondered,briefly
the,only,queen,she,knew,was,cersei
firepits,had,been,dug,outside,the,feast,tents,sheltered,beneath,rude,canopies,of,woven,wood,and,hides,that,kept,the,rain,out,so,long,as,it,fell,straight,down
the,wind,was,blowing,off,the,river,though,so,the,drizzle,came,in,anyway,enough,to,make,the,fires,hiss,and,swirl
serving,men,were,turning,joints,of,meat,on,spits,above,the,flames
the,smells,made,arya’s,mouth,water
shouldn’t,we,stop

there’s,northmen,in,the,tents

catelyn,the,drums,were,pounding,pounding,pounding,and,her,head,with,them
pipes,wailed,and,flutes,trilled,from,the,musicians’,gallery,at,the,foot,of,the,hall,fiddles,screeched,horns,blew,the,skins,skirled,a,lively,tune,but,the,drumming,drove,them,all
the,sounds,echoed,off,the,rafters,whilst,the,guests,ate,drank,and,shouted,at,one,another,below
walder,frey,must,be,deaf,as,a,stone,to,call,this,music
catelyn,sipped,a,cup,of,wine,and,watched,jinglebell,prance,to,the,sounds,of,alysanne
at,least,she,thought,it,was,meant,to,be,alysanne
with,these,players,it,might,as,easily,have,been,the,bear,and,the,maiden,fair
outside,the,rain,still,fell,but,within,the,twins,the,air,was,thick,and,hot
a,fire,roared,in,the,hearth,and,rows,of,torches,burned,smokily,from,iron,sconces,on,the,walls
yet,most,of,the,heat,came,off,the,bodies,of,the,wedding,guests,jammed,in,so,thick,along,the,benches,that,every,man,who,tried,to,lift,his,cup,poked,his,neighbor,in,the,ribs
even,on,the,dais,they,were,closer,than,catelyn,would,have,liked
she,had,been,placed,between,ser,ryman,frey,and,roose,bolton,and,had,gotten,a,good,noseful,of,both
ser,ryman,drank,as,if,westeros,was,about,to,run,short,of,wine,and,sweated,it,all,out,under,his,arms
he,had,bathed,in,lemonwater,she,judged,but,no,lemon,could,mask,so,much,sour,sweat
roose,bolton,had,a,sweeter,smell,to,him,yet,no,more,pleasant
he,sipped,hippocras,in,preference,to,wine,or,mead,and,ate,but,little
catelyn,could,not,fault,him,for,his,lack,of,appetite
the,wedding,feast,began,with,a,thin,leek,soup,followed,by,a,salad,of,green,beans,onions,and,beets,river,pike,poached,in,almond,milk,mounds,of,mashed,turnips,that,were,cold,before,they,reached,the,table,jellied,calves’,brains,and,a,leche,of,stringy,beef
it,was,poor,fare,to,set,before,a,king,and,the,calves’,brains,turned,catelyn’s,stomach
yet,robb,ate,it,uncomplaining,and,her,brother,was,too,caught,up,with,his,bride,to,pay,much,attention
you,would,never,guess,edmure,complained,of,roslin,all,the,way,from,riverrun,to,the,twins
husband,and,wife,ate,from,a,single,plate,drank,from,a,single,cup,and,exchanged,chaste,kisses,between,sips
most,of,the,dishes,edmure,waved,away
she,could,not,blame,him,for,that
she,remembered,little,of,the,food,served,at,her,own,wedding,feast
did,i,even,taste,it
or,spend,the,whole,time,gazing,at,ned’s,face,wondering,who,he,was
poor,roslin’s,smile,had,a,fixed,quality,to,it,as,if,someone,had,sewn,it,onto,her,face
well,she,is,a,maid,wedded,but,the,bedding’s,yet,to,come
no,doubt,she’s,as,terrified,as,i,was
robb,was,seated,between,alyx,frey,and,fair,walda,two,of,the,more,nubile,frey,maidens
at,the,wedding,feast,i,hope,you,will,not,refuse,to,dance,with,my,daughters,walder,frey,had,said
it,would,please,an,old,man’s,heart
his,heart,should,be,well,pleased,then,robb,had,done,his,duty,like,a,king
he,had,danced,with,each,of,the,girls,with,edmure’s,bride,and,the,eighth,lady,frey,with,the,widow,ami,and,roose,bolton’s,wife,fat,walda,with,the,pimply,twins,serra,and,sarra,even,with,shirei,lord,walder’s,youngest,who,must,have,been,all,of,six
catelyn,wondered,whether,the,lord,of,the,crossing,would,be,satisfied,or,if,he,would,find,cause,for,complaint,in,all,the,other,daughters,and,granddaughters,who,had,not,had,a,turn,with,the,king
your,sisters,dance,very,well,she,said,to,ser,ryman,frey,trying,to,be,pleasant
they’re,aunts,and,cousins
ser,ryman,drank,a,swallow,of,wine,the,sweat,trickling,down,his,cheek,into,his,beard
a,sour,man,and,in,his,cups,catelyn,thought
the,late,lord,frey,might,be,niggardly,when,it,came,to,feeding,his,guests,but,he,did,not,stint,on,the,drink
the,ale,wine,and,mead,were,flowing,as,fast,as,the,river,outside
the,greatjon,was,already,roaring,drunk
lord,walder’s,son,merrett,was,matching,him,cup,for,cup,but,ser,whalen,frey,had,passed,out,trying,to,keep,up,with,the,two,of,them
catelyn,would,sooner,lord,umber,had,seen,fit,to,stay,sober,but,telling,the,greatjon,not,to,drink,was,like,telling,him,not,to,breathe,for,a,few,hours
smalljon,umber,and,robin,flint,sat,near,robb,to,the,other,side,of,fair,walda,and,alyx,respectively
neither,of,them,was,drinking,along,with,patrek,mallister,and,dacey,mormont,they,were,her,son’s,guards,this,evening
a,wedding,feast,was,not,a,battle,but,there,were,always,dangers,when,men,were,in,their,cups,and,a,king,should,never,be,unguarded
catelyn,was,glad,of,that,and,even,more,glad,of,the,swordbelts,hanging,on,pegs,along,the,walls
no,man,needs,a,longsword,to,deal,with,jellied,calves’,brains
everyone,thought,my,lord,would,choose,fair,walda,lady,walda,bolton,told,ser,wendel,shouting,to,be,heard,above,the,music
fat,walda,was,a,round,pink,butterball,of,a,girl,with,watery,blue,eyes,limp,yellow,hair,and,a,huge,bosom,yet,her,voice,was,a,fluttering,squeak
it,was,hard,to,picture,her,in,the,dreadfort,in,her,pink,lace,and,cape,of,vair
my,lord,grandfather,offered,roose,his,bride’s,weight,in,silver,as,a,dowry,though,so,my,lord,of,bolton,picked,me
the,girl’s,chins,jiggled,when,she,laughed
i,weigh,six,stone,more,than,fair,walda,but,that,was,the,first,time,i,was,glad,of,it
i’m,lady,bolton,now,and,my,cousin’s,still,a,maid,and,she’ll,be,nineteen,soon,poor,thing
the,lord,of,the,dreadfort,paid,the,chatter,no,mind,catelyn,saw
sometimes,he,tasted,a,bite,of,this,a,spoon,of,that,tearing,bread,from,the,loaf,with,short,strong,fingers,but,the,meal,could,not,distract,him
bolton,had,made,a,toast,to,lord,walder’s,grandsons,when,the,wedding,feast,began,pointedly,mentioning,that,walder,and,walder,were,in,the,care,of,his,bastard,son
from,the,way,the,old,man,had,squinted,at,him,his,mouth,sucking,at,the,air,catelyn,knew,he,had,heard,the,unspoken,threat
was,there,ever,a,wedding,less,joyful

catelyn,took,another,swallow,of,wine,and,allowed,a,page,to,refill,her,cup
a,few,more,hours,and,the,worst,will,be,over
by,this,hour,tomorrow,robb,would,be,off,to,another,battle,this,time,with,the,ironmen,at,moat,cailin

above,the,din,came,a,sudden,snarling,as,two,dogs,fell,upon,each,other,over,a,scrap,of,meat
they,rolled,across,the,floor,snapping,and,biting,as,a,howl,of,mirth,went,up
someone,doused,them,with,a,flagon,of,ale,and,they,broke,apart

unfortunately,the,fiddlers,and,drummers,and,flutists,up,above,were,playing,flowers,of,spring,which,suited,the,words,of,the,bear,and,the,maiden,fair,as,well,as,snails,might,suit,a,bowl,of,porridge
even,poor,jinglebell,covered,his,ears,at,the,cacophony

a,second,feast,for,knights,and,lords,of,somewhat,lesser,rank,was,roaring,along,in,the,other,castle,she,knew
lord,walder,had,exiled,his,baseborn,children,and,their,offspring,to,that,side,of,the,river,so,that,robb’s,northmen,had,taken,to,referring,to,it,as,the,bastard,feast
some,guests,were,no,doubt,stealing,off,to,see,if,the,bastards,were,having,a,better,time,than,they,were
some,might,even,be,venturing,as,far,as,the,camps
the,freys,had,provided,wagons,of,wine,ale,and,mead,so,the,common,soldiers,could,drink,to,the,wedding,of,riverrun,and,the,twins

a,dance,was,the,last,thing,she,needed,the,way,her,head,was,throbbing
no,doubt,one,of,lord,walder’s,daughters,would,be,pleased,to,partner,you
oh,no,doubt
his,smile,was,resigned
the,musicians,were,playing,iron,lances,by,then,while,the,greatjon,sang,the,lusty,lad
someone,should,acquaint,them,with,each,other,it,might,improve,the,harmony

the,servers,were,bringing,out,huge,silver,platters,piled,high,with,cuts,of,juicy,pink,lamb,the,most,appetizing,dish,they’d,seen,all,evening
and,robb,was,leading,dacey,mormont,in,a,dance
when,she,wore,a,dress,in,place,of,a,hauberk,lady,maege’s,eldest,daughter,was,quite,pretty,tall,and,willowy,with,a,shy,smile,that,made,her,long,face,light,up
it,was,pleasant,to,see,that,she,could,be,as,graceful,on,the,dance,floor,as,in,the,training,yard
catelyn,wondered,if,lady,maege,had,reached,the,neck,as,yet
she,had,taken,her,other,daughters,with,her,but,as,one,of,robb’s,battle,companions,dacey,had,chosen,to,remain,by,his,side

seated,betwixt,his,black,oak,towers,the,lord,of,the,crossing,clapped,his,spotted,hands,together
the,noise,they,made,was,so,faint,that,even,those,on,the,dais,scarce,heard,it,but,ser,aenys,and,ser,hosteen,saw,and,began,to,pound,their,cups,on,the,table
lame,lothar,joined,them,then,marq,piper,and,ser,danwell,and,ser,raymund
half,the,guests,were,soon,pounding
finally,even,the,mob,of,musicians,in,the,gallery,took,note
the,piping,drumming,and,fiddling,trailed,off,into,quiet
your,grace,lord,walder,called,out,to,robb,the,septon,has,prayed,his,prayers,some,words,have,been,said,and,lord,edmure’s,wrapped,my,sweetling,in,a,fish,cloak,but,they,are,not,yet,man,and,wife

to,bed
to,bed,with,them
roslin,had,gone,white
catelyn,wondered,whether,it,was,the,prospect,of,losing,her,maidenhead,that,frightened,the,girl,or,the,bedding,itself
with,so,many,siblings,she,was,not,like,to,be,a,stranger,to,the,custom,but,it,was,different,when,you,were,the,one,being,bedded
on,catelyn’s,own,wedding,night,jory,cassell,had,torn,her,gown,in,his,haste,to,get,her,out,of,it,and,drunken,desmond,grell,kept,apologizing,for,every,bawdy,joke,only,to,make,another

too,many,i,fear
robb,raised,a,hand
if,you,think,the,time,is,meet,lord,walder,by,all,means,let,us,bed,them
a,roar,of,approval,greeted,his,pronouncement
up,in,the,gallery,the,musicians,took,up,their,pipes,and,horns,and,fiddles,again,and,began,to,play,the,queen,took,off,her,sandal,the,king,took,off,his,crown

the,men,and,boys,surrounded,roslin,and,lifted,her,into,the,air,whilst,the,maids,and,mothers,in,the,hall,pulled,edmure,to,his,feet,and,began,tugging,at,his,clothing
he,was,laughing,and,shouting,bawdy,jokes,back,at,them,though,the,music,was,too,loud,for,catelyn,to,hear
she,heard,the,greatjon,though

she’s,crying,too,catelyn,realized,as,she,watched,ser,marq,piper,pull,off,one,of,the,bride’s,shoes

the,last,thing,she,felt,just,now,was,bawdy
edmure,would,forgive,her,absence,she,did,not,doubt,much,jollier,to,be,stripped,and,bedded,by,a,score,of,lusty,laughing,freys,than,by,a,sour,stricken,sister
as,man,and,maid,were,carried,from,the,hall,a,trail,of,clothing,behind,them,catelyn,saw,that,robb,had,also,remained
walder,frey,was,prickly,enough,to,see,some,insult,to,his,daughter,in,that
he,should,join,in,roslin’s,bedding,but,is,it,my,place,to,tell,him,so
she,tensed,until,she,saw,that,others,had,stayed,as,well
petyr,pimple,and,ser,whalen,frey,slept,on,their,heads,on,the,table

ser,wendel,manderly,was,lustily,attacking,a,leg,of,lamb
and,of,course,lord,walder,was,far,too,feeble,to,leave,his,seat,without,help
he,will,expect,robb,to,go,though
she,could,almost,hear,the,old,man,asking,why,his,grace,did,not,want,to,see,his,daughter,naked
the,drums,were,pounding,again,pounding,and,pounding,and,pounding
dacey,mormont,who,seemed,to,be,the,only,woman,left,in,the,hall,besides,catelyn,stepped,up,behind,edwyn,frey,and,touched,him,lightly,on,the,arm,as,she,said,something,in,his,ear

no,he,said,too,loudly
i’m,done,with,dancing,for,the,nonce

catelyn,got,slowly,to,her,feet
what,just,happened,there
doubt,gripped,her,heart,where,an,instant,before,had,been,only,weariness
it,is,nothing,she,tried,to,tell,herself,you,are,seeing,grumkins,in,the,woodpile,you,are,become,an,old,silly,woman,sick,with,grief,and,fear
but,something,must,have,shown,on,her,face
even,ser,wendel,manderly,took,note
is,something,amiss
he,asked,the,leg,of,lamb,in,his,hands
she,did,not,answer,him
instead,she,went,after,edwyn,frey
the,players,in,the,gallery,had,finally,gotten,both,king,and,queen,down,to,their,name-day,suits
with,scarcely,a,moment’s,respite,they,began,to,play,a,very,different,sort,of,song
no,one,sang,the,words,but,catelyn,knew,the,rains,of,castamere,when,she,heard,it
edwyn,was,hurrying,toward,a,door
she,hurried,faster,driven,by,the,music
six,quick,strides,and,she,caught,him
and,who,are,you,the,proud,lord,said,that,i,must,bow,so,low
she,grabbed,edwyn,by,the,arm,to,turn,him,and,went,cold,all,over,when,she,felt,the,iron,rings,beneath,his,silken,sleeve
catelyn,slapped,him,so,hard,she,broke,his,lip
olyvar,she,thought,and,perwyn,alesander,all,absent
and,roslin,wept
edwyn,frey,shoved,her,aside
the,music,drowned,all,other,sound,echoing,off,the,walls,as,if,the,stones,themselves,were,playing
robb,gave,edwyn,an,angry,look,and,moved,to,block,his,way
and,staggered,suddenly,as,a,quarrel,sprouted,from,his,side,just,beneath,the,shoulder
if,he,screamed,then,the,sound,was,swallowed,by,the,pipes,and,horns,and,fiddles
catelyn,saw,a,second,bolt,pierce,his,leg,saw,him,fall
up,in,the,gallery,half,the,musicians,had,crossbows,in,their,hands,instead,of,drums,or,lutes

in,a,coat,of,gold,or,a,coat,of,red,a,lion,still,has,claws

the,crossbows,took,donnel,locke,owen,norrey,and,half,a,dozen,more
young,ser,benfrey,had,seized,dacey,mormont,by,the,arm,but,catelyn,saw,her,grab,up,a,flagon,of,wine,with,her,other,hand,smash,it,full,in,his,face,and,run,for,the,door

slow,red,worms,crawled,along,her,arms,and,under,her,clothes

that,made,her,laugh,until,she,screamed
mad,someone,said,she’s,lost,her,wits,and,someone,else,said,make,an,end,and,a,hand,grabbed,her,scalp,just,as,she’d,done,with,jinglebell,and,she,thought,no,don’t,don’t,cut,my,hair,ned,loves,my,hair
then,the,steel,was,at,her,throat,and,its,bite,was,red,and,cold
arya,the,feast,tents,were,behind,them,now
they,squished,over,wet,clay,and,torn,grass,out,of,the,light,and,back,into,the,gloom
ahead,loomed,the,castle,gatehouse
she,could,see,torches,moving,on,the,walls,their,flames,dancing,and,blowing,in,the,wind
the,light,shone,dully,against,the,wet,mail,and,helms
more,torches,were,moving,on,the,dark,stone,bridge,that,joined,the,twins,a,column,of,them,streaming,from,the,west,bank,to,the,east
the,castle’s,not,closed,arya,said,suddenly
the,sergeant,had,said,it,would,be,but,he,was,wrong
the,portcullis,was,being,drawn,upward,even,as,she,watched,and,the,drawbridge,had,already,been,lowered,to,span,the,swollen,moat
she,had,been,afraid,that,lord,frey’s,guardsmen,would,refuse,to,let,them,in
for,half,a,heartbeat,she,chewed,her,lip,too,anxious,to,smile
the,hound,reined,up,so,suddenly,that,she,almost,fell,off,the,wayn
seven,bloody,buggering,hells,arya,heard,him,curse,as,their,left,wheel,began,to,sink,in,soft,mud
the,wayn,tilted,slowly
get,down,clegane,roared,at,her,slamming,the,heel,of,his,hand,into,her,shoulder,to,knock,her,sideways
she,landed,light,the,way,syrio,had,taught,her,and,bounced,up,at,once,with,a,face,full,of,mud
why,did,you,do,that
she,screamed
the,hound,had,leapt,down,as,well
he,tore,the,seat,off,the,front,of,the,wayn,and,reached,in,for,the,swordbelt,he’d,hidden,beneath,it
it,was,only,then,that,she,heard,the,riders,pouring,out,the,castle,gate,in,a,river,of,steel,and,fire,the,thunder,of,their,destriers,crossing,the,drawbridge,almost,lost,beneath,the,drumming,from,the,castles
men,and,mounts,wore,plate,armor,and,one,in,every,ten,carried,a,torch
the,rest,had,axes,longaxes,with,spiked,heads,and,heavy,bone-crushing,armor-smashing,blades
somewhere,far,off,she,heard,a,wolf,howling
it,wasn’t,very,loud,compared,to,the,camp,noise,and,the,music,and,the,low,ominous,growl,of,the,river,running,wild,but,she,heard,it,all,the,same
only,maybe,it,wasn’t,her,ears,that,heard,it
the,sound,shivered,through,arya,like,a,knife,sharp,with,rage,and,grief
more,and,more,riders,were,emerging,from,the,castle,a,column,four,wide,with,no,end,to,it,knights,and,squires,and,freeriders,torches,and,longaxes
and,there,was,noise,coming,from,behind,as,well
when,arya,looked,around,she,saw,that,there,were,only,two,of,the,huge,feast,tents,where,once,there,had,been,three
the,one,in,the,middle,had,collapsed
for,a,moment,she,did,not,understand,what,she,was,seeing
then,the,flames,went,licking,up,from,the,fallen,tent,and,now,the,other,two,were,collapsing,heavy,oiled,cloth,settling,down,on,the,men,beneath
a,flight,of,fire,arrows,streaked,through,the,air
the,second,tent,took,fire,and,then,the,third
the,screams,grew,so,loud,she,could,hear,words,through,the,music
dark,shapes,moved,in,front,of,the,flames,the,steel,of,their,armor,shining,orange,from,afar
a,battle,arya,knew
it’s,a,battle
and,the,riders
she,had,no,more,time,to,watch,the,tents,then
with,the,river,overflowing,its,banks,the,dark,swirling,waters,at,the,end,of,the,drawbridge,reached,as,high,as,a,horse’s,belly,but,the,riders,splashed,through,them,all,the,same,spurred,on,by,the,music
for,once,the,same,song,was,coming,from,both,castles
i,know,this,song,arya,realized,suddenly
tom,o’,sevens,had,sung,it,for,them,that,rainy,night,the,outlaws,had,sheltered,in,the,brewhouse,with,the,brothers
and,who,are,you,the,proud,lord,said,that,i,must,bow,so,low
the,frey,riders,were,struggling,through,the,mud,and,reeds,but,some,of,them,had,seen,the,wayn
she,watched,as,three,riders,left,the,main,column,pounding,through,the,shallows
only,a,cat,of,a,different,coat,that’s,all,the,truth,i,know
clegane,cut,stranger,loose,with,a,single,slash,of,his,sword,and,leapt,onto,his,back
the,courser,knew,what,was,wanted,of,him
he,pricked,up,his,ears,and,wheeled,toward,the,charging,destriers
in,a,coat,of,gold,or,a,coat,of,red,a,lion,still,has,claws
and,mine,are,long,and,sharp,my,lord,as,long,and,sharp,as,yours
arya,had,prayed,a,hundred,hundred,times,for,the,hound,to,die,but,now
there,was,a,rock,in,her,hand,slimy,with,mud,and,she,didn’t,even,remember,picking,it,up
who,do,i,throw,it,at
she,jumped,at,the,clash,of,metal,as,clegane,turned,aside,the,first,longaxe
while,he,was,engaged,with,the,first,man,the,second,circled,behind,him,and,aimed,a,blow,for,the,small,of,his,back
stranger,was,wheeling,so,the,hound,took,only,a,glancing,blow,enough,to,rip,a,great,gash,in,his,baggy,peasant’s,blouse,and,expose,the,mail,below
he,is,one,against,three
arya,still,clutched,her,rock
they’re,sure,to,kill,him
she,thought,of,mycah,the,butcher’s,boy,who,had,been,her,friend,so,briefly
then,she,saw,the,third,rider,coming,her,way
arya,moved,behind,the,wayn
fear,cuts,deeper,than,swords
she,could,hear,drums,and,warhorns,and,pipes,stallions,trumpeting,the,shriek,of,steel,on,steel,but,all,the,sounds,seemed,so,far,away
there,was,only,the,oncoming,horseman,and,the,longaxe,in,his,hand
he,wore,a,surcoat,over,his,armor,and,she,saw,the,two,towers,that,marked,him,for,a,frey
she,did,not,understand
her,uncle,was,marrying,lord,frey’s,daughter,the,freys,were,her,brother’s,friends
don’t
she,screamed,as,he,rode,around,the,wayn,but,he,paid,no,mind
when,he,charged,arya,threw,the,rock,the,way,she’d,once,thrown,a,crabapple,at,gendry
she’d,gotten,gendry,right,between,the,eyes,but,this,time,her,aim,was,off,and,the,stone,caromed,sideways,off,his,temple
it,was,enough,to,break,his,charge,but,no,more
she,retreated,darting,across,the,muddy,ground,on,the,balls,of,her,feet,putting,the,wayn,between,them,once,more
the,knight,followed,at,a,trot,only,darkness,behind,his,eyeslit
she,hadn’t,even,dented,his,helm
they,went,round,once,twice,a,third,time
the,knight,cursed,her
you,can’t,run,for,the,axehead,caught,him,square,in,the,back,of,the,head,crashing,through,his,helm,and,the,skull,beneath,and,sending,him,flying,face,first,from,his,saddle
behind,him,was,the,hound,still,mounted,on,stranger
how,did,you,get,an,axe
she,almost,asked,before,she,saw
one,of,the,other,freys,was,trapped,beneath,his,dying,horse,drowning,in,a,foot,of,water
the,third,man,was,sprawled,on,his,back,unmoving
he,hadn’t,worn,a,gorget,and,a,foot,of,broken,sword,jutted,from,beneath,his,chin
get,my,helm,clegane,growled,at,her
it,was,stuffed,at,the,bottom,of,a,sack,of,dried,apples,in,the,back,of,the,wayn,behind,the,pickled,pigs’,feet
arya,upended,the,sack,and,tossed,it,to,him
he,snatched,it,one-handed,from,the,air,and,lowered,it,over,his,head,and,where,the,man,had,sat,only,a,steel,dog,remained,snarling,at,the,fires
my,brother
dead,he,shouted,back,at,her
do,you,think,they’d,slaughter,his,men,and,leave,him,alive
he,turned,his,head,back,toward,the,camp
look
look,damn,you
the,camp,had,become,a,battlefield
no,a,butcher’s,den
the,flames,from,the,feasting,tents,reached,halfway,up,the,sky
some,of,the,barracks,tents,were,burning,too,and,half,a,hundred,silk,pavilions
everywhere,swords,were,singing
and,now,the,rains,weep,o’er,his,hall,with,not,a,soul,to,hear
she,saw,two,knights,ride,down,a,running,man
a,wooden,barrel,came,crashing,onto,one,of,the,burning,tents,and,burst,apart,and,the,flames,leapt,twice,as,high
a,catapult,she,knew
the,castle,was,flinging,oil,or,pitch,or,something
come,with,me
sandor,clegane,reached,down,a,hand
we,have,to,get,away,from,here,and,now
stranger,tossed,his,head,impatiently,his,nostrils,flaring,at,the,scent,of,blood
the,song,was,done
there,was,only,one,solitary,drum,its,slow,monotonous,beats,echoing,across,the,river,like,the,pounding,of,some,monstrous,heart
the,black,sky,wept,the,river,grumbled,men,cursed,and,died
arya,had,mud,in,her,teeth,and,her,face,was,wet
rain
it’s,only,rain
that’s,all,it,is
we’re,here,she,shouted
her,voice,sounded,thin,and,scared,a,little,girl’s,voice
robb’s,just,in,the,castle,and,my,mother
the,gate’s,even,open
there,were,no,more,freys,riding,out
i,came,so,far
we,have,to,go,get,my,mother
stupid,little,bitch
fires,glinted,off,the,snout,of,his,helm,and,made,the,steel,teeth,shine
you,go,in,there,you,won’t,come,out
maybe,frey,will,let,you,kiss,your,mother’s,corpse
maybe,we,can,save,her
maybe,you,can
i’m,not,done,living,yet
he,rode,toward,her,crowding,her,back,toward,the,wayn
stay,or,go,she-wolf
live,or,die
your,arya,spun,away,from,him,and,darted,for,the,gate
the,portcullis,was,coming,down,but,slowly
i,have,to,run,faster
the,mud,slowed,her,though,and,then,the,water
run,fast,as,a,wolf
the,drawbridge,had,begun,to,lift,the,water,running,off,it,in,a,sheet,the,mud,falling,in,heavy,clots
faster
she,heard,loud,splashing,and,looked,back,to,see,stranger,pounding,after,her,sending,up,gouts,of,water,with,every,stride
she,saw,the,longaxe,too,still,wet,with,blood,and,brains
and,arya,ran
not,for,her,brother,now,not,even,for,her,mother,but,for,herself
she,ran,faster,than,she,had,ever,run,before,her,head,down,and,her,feet,churning,up,the,river,she,ran,from,him,as,mycah,must,have,run
his,axe,took,her,in,the,back,of,the,head
tyrion,they,supped,alone,as,they,did,so,often
the,pease,are,overcooked,his,wife,ventured,once
no,matter,he,said
so,is,the,mutton
it,was,a,jest,but,sansa,took,it,for,criticism
i,am,sorry,my,lord
why
some,cook,should,be,sorry
not,you
the,pease,are,not,your,province,sansa
i
i,am,sorry,that,my,lord,husband,is,displeased
any,displeasure,i’m,feeling,has,naught,to,do,with,pease
i,have,joffrey,and,my,sister,to,displease,me,and,my,lord,father,and,three,hundred,bloody,dornishmen
he,had,settled,prince,oberyn,and,his,lords,in,a,cornerfort,facing,the,city,as,far,from,the,tyrells,as,he,could,put,them,without,evicting,them,from,the,red,keep,entirely
it,was,not,nearly,far,enough
already,there,had,been,a,brawl,in,a,flea,bottom,pot-shop,that,left,one,tyrell,man-at-arms,dead,and,two,of,lord,gargalen’s,scalded,and,an,ugly,confrontation,in,the,yard,when,mace,tyrell’s,wizened,little,mother,called,ellaria,sand,the,serpent’s,whore
every,time,he,chanced,to,see,oberyn,martell,the,prince,asked,when,the,justice,would,be,served
overcooked,pease,were,the,least,of,tyrion’s,troubles,but,he,saw,no,point,in,burdening,his,young,wife,with,any,of,that
sansa,had,enough,griefs,of,her,own
the,pease,suffice,he,told,her,curtly
they,are,green,and,round,what,more,can,one,expect,of,pease
here,i’ll,have,another,serving,if,it,please,my,lady
he,beckoned,and,podrick,payne,spooned,so,many,pease,onto,his,plate,that,tyrion,lost,sight,of,his,mutton
that,was,stupid,he,told,himself
now,i,have,to,eat,them,all,or,she’ll,be,sorry,all,over,again
the,supper,ended,in,a,strained,silence,as,so,many,of,their,suppers,did
afterward,as,pod,was,removing,the,cups,and,platters,sansa,asked,tyrion,for,leave,to,visit,the,godswood
as,you,wish
he,had,become,accustomed,to,his,wife’s,nightly,devotions
she,prayed,at,the,royal,sept,as,well,and,often,lit,candles,to,mother,maid,and,crone
tyrion,found,all,this,piety,excessive,if,truth,be,told,but,in,her,place,he,might,want,the,help,of,the,gods,as,well
i,confess,i,know,little,of,the,old,gods,he,said,trying,to,be,pleasant
perhaps,someday,you,might,enlighten,me
i,could,even,accompany,you
no,sansa,said,at,once
you
you,are,kind,to,offer,but
there,are,no,devotions,my,lord
no,priests,or,songs,or,candles
only,trees,and,silent,prayer
you,would,be,bored
no,doubt,you’re,right
she,knows,me,better,than,i,thought
though,the,sound,of,rustling,leaves,might,be,a,pleasant,change,from,some,septon,droning,on,about,the,seven,aspects,of,grace
tyrion,waved,her,off
i,won’t,intrude
dress,warmly,my,lady,the,wind,is,brisk,out,there
he,was,tempted,to,ask,what,she,prayed,for,but,sansa,was,so,dutiful,she,might,actually,tell,him,and,he,didn’t,think,he,wanted,to,know
he,went,back,to,work,after,she,left,trying,to,track,some,golden,dragons,through,the,labyrinth,of,littlefinger’s,ledgers
petyr,baelish,had,not,believed,in,letting,gold,sit,about,and,grow,dusty,that,was,for,certain,but,the,more,tyrion,tried,to,make,sense,of,his,accounts,the,more,his,head,hurt
it,was,all,very,well,to,talk,of,breeding,dragons,instead,of,locking,them,up,in,the,treasury,but,some,of,these,ventures,smelled,worse,than,week-old,fish
i,wouldn’t,have,been,so,quick,to,let,joffrey,fling,the,antler,men,over,the,walls,if,i’d,known,how,many,of,the,bloody,bastards,had,taken,loans,from,the,crown
he,would,have,to,send,bronn,to,find,their,heirs,but,he,feared,that,would,prove,as,fruitful,as,trying,to,squeeze,silver,from,a,silverfish
when,the,summons,from,his,lord,father,arrived,it,was,the,first,time,tyrion,could,ever,recall,being,pleased,to,see,ser,boros,blount
he,closed,the,ledgers,gratefully,blew,out,the,oil,lamp,tied,a,cloak,around,his,shoulders,and,waddled,across,the,castle,to,the,tower,of,the,hand
the,wind,was,brisk,just,as,he’d,warned,sansa,and,there,was,a,smell,of,rain,in,the,air
perhaps,when,lord,tywin,was,done,with,him,he,should,go,to,the,godswood,and,fetch,her,home,before,she,got,soaked
but,all,that,went,straight,out,of,his,head,when,he,entered,the,hand’s,solar,to,find,cersei,ser,kevan,and,grand,maester,pycelle,gathered,about,lord,tywin,and,the,king
joffrey,was,almost,bouncing,and,cersei,was,savoring,a,smug,little,smile,though,lord,tywin,looked,as,grim,as,ever
i,wonder,if,he,could,smile,even,if,he,wanted,to
what’s,happened
tyrion,asked
his,father,offered,him,a,roll,of,parchment
someone,had,flattened,it,but,it,still,wanted,to,curl
roslin,caught,a,fine,fat,trout,the,message,read
her,brothers,gave,her,a,pair,of,wolf,pelts,for,her,wedding
tyrion,turned,it,over,to,inspect,the,broken,seal
the,wax,was,silvery-grey,and,pressed,into,it,were,the,twin,towers,of,house,frey
does,the,lord,of,the,crossing,imagine,he’s,being,poetic
or,is,this,meant,to,confound,us
tyrion,snorted
the,trout,would,be,edmure,tully,the,pelts
he’s,dead
joffrey,sounded,so,proud,and,happy,you,might,have,thought,he’d,skinned,robb,stark,himself
first,greyjoy,and,now,stark
tyrion,thought,of,his,child,wife,praying,in,the,godswood,even,now
praying,to,her,father’s,gods,to,bring,her,brother,victory,and,keep,her,mother,safe,no,doubt
the,old,gods,paid,no,more,heed,to,prayer,than,the,new,ones,it,would,seem
perhaps,he,should,take,comfort,in,that
kings,are,falling,like,leaves,this,autumn,he,said
it,would,seem,our,little,war,is,winning,itself
wars,do,not,win,themselves,tyrion,cersei,said,with,poisonous,sweetness
our,lord,father,won,this,war
nothing,is,won,so,long,as,we,have,enemies,in,the,field,lord,tywin,warned,them
the,river,lords,are,no,fools,the,queen,argued
without,the,northmen,they,cannot,hope,to,stand,against,the,combined,power,of,highgarden,casterly,rock,and,dorne
surely,they,will,choose,submission,rather,than,destruction
most,agreed,lord,tywin

jason,mallister,and,tytos,blackwood,will,fight,on,for,honor’s,sake,but,the,freys,can,keep,the,mallisters,penned,up,at,seagard,and,with,the,right,inducement,jonos,bracken,can,be,persuaded,to,change,his,allegiance,and,attack,the,blackwoods

gregor,clegane
it,appeared,as,if,his,lord,father,meant,to,mine,the,mountain,for,every,last,nugget,of,ore,before,turning,him,over,to,dornish,justice
the,brave,companions,would,end,as,heads,on,spikes,and,littlefinger,would,stroll,into,harrenhal,without,so,much,as,a,spot,of,blood,on,those,fine,clothes,of,his
he,wondered,if,petyr,baelish,had,reached,the,vale,yet
if,the,gods,are,good,he,ran,into,a,storm,at,sea,and,sank

no
tyrion’s,voice,was,hoarse
sansa,is,no,longer,yours,to,torment
understand,that,monster
joffrey,sneered
you’re,the,monster,uncle
am,i
tyrion,cocked,his,head
perhaps,you,should,speak,more,softly,to,me,then
monsters,are,dangerous,beasts,and,just,now,kings,seem,to,be,dying,like,flies
i,could,have,your,tongue,out,for,saying,that,the,boy,king,said,reddening
i’m,the,king
cersei,put,a,protective,hand,on,her,son’s,shoulder
let,the,dwarf,make,all,the,threats,he,likes,joff
i,want,my,lord,father,and,my,uncle,to,see,what,he,is
lord,tywin,ignored,that,it,was,joffrey,he,addressed
aerys,also,felt,the,need,to,remind,men,that,he,was,king
and,he,was,passing,fond,of,ripping,tongues,out,as,well
you,could,ask,ser,ilyn,payne,about,that,though,you’ll,get,no,reply
ser,ilyn,never,dared,provoke,aerys,the,way,your,imp,provokes,joff,said,cersei
you,heard,him
monster’,he,said
to,the,king’s,grace
and,he,threatened,him
be,quiet,cersei
joffrey,when,your,enemies,defy,you,you,must,serve,them,steel,and,fire
when,they,go,to,their,knees,however,you,must,help,them,back,to,their,feet
elsewise,no,man,will,ever,bend,the,knee,to,you
and,any,man,who,must,say,i,am,the,king’,is,no,true,king,at,all
aerys,never,understood,that,but,you,will
when,i’ve,won,your,war,for,you,we,will,restore,the,king’s,peace,and,the,king’s,justice
the,only,head,that,need,concern,you,is,margaery,tyrell’s,maidenhead
joffrey,had,that,sullen,sulky,look,he,got
cersei,had,him,firmly,by,the,shoulder,but,perhaps,she,should,have,had,him,by,the,throat
the,boy,surprised,them,all
instead,of,scuttling,safely,back,under,his,rock,joff,drew,himself,up,defiantly,and,said,you,talk,about,aerys,grandfather,but,you,were,scared,of,him
oh,my,hasn’t,this,gotten,interesting
tyrion,thought
lord,tywin,studied,his,grandchild,in,silence,gold,flecks,shining,in,his,pale,green,eyes
joffrey,apologize,to,your,grandfather,said,cersei
he,wrenched,free,of,her
why,should,i
everyone,knows,it’s,true
my,father,won,all,the,battles
he,killed,prince,rhaegar,and,took,the,crown,while,your,father,was,hiding,under,casterly,rock
the,boy,gave,his,grandfather,a,defiant,look
a,strong,king,acts,boldly,he,doesn’t,just,talk
thank,you,for,that,wisdom,your,grace,lord,tywin,said,with,a,courtesy,so,cold,it,was,like,to,freeze,their,ears,off
ser,kevan,i,can,see,the,king,is,tired
please,see,him,safely,back,to,his,bedchamber
pycelle,perhaps,some,gentle,potion,to,help,his,grace,sleep,restfully
dreamwine,my,lord
i,don’t,want,any,dreamwine,joffrey,insisted
lord,tywin,would,have,paid,more,heed,to,a,mouse,squeaking,in,the,corner
dreamwine,will,serve
cersei,tyrion,remain
ser,kevan,took,joffrey,firmly,by,the,arm,and,marched,him,out,the,door,where,two,of,the,kingsguard,were,waiting
grand,maester,pycelle,scurried,after,them,as,fast,as,his,shaky,old,legs,could,take,him
tyrion,remained,where,he,was
father,i,am,sorry,cersei,said,when,the,door,was,shut
joff,has,always,been,willful,i,did,warn,you
there,is,a,long,league’s,worth,of,difference,between,willful,and,stupid
a,strong,king,acts,boldly,’,who,told,him,that
not,me,i,promise,you,said,cersei
most,like,it,was,something,he,heard,robert,say
the,part,about,you,hiding,under,casterly,rock,does,sound,like,robert
tyrion,didn’t,want,lord,tywin,forgetting,that,bit
yes,i,recall,now,cersei,said,robert,often,told,joff,that,a,king,must,be,bold
and,what,were,you,telling,him,pray
i,did,not,fight,a,war,to,seat,robert,the,second,on,the,iron,throne
you,gave,me,to,understand,the,boy,cared,nothing,for,his,father
why,would,he
robert,ignored,him
he,would,have,beat,him,if,i’d,allowed,it
that,brute,you,made,me,marry,once,hit,the,boy,so,hard,he,knocked,out,two,of,his,baby,teeth,over,some,mischief,with,a,cat
i,told,him,i’d,kill,him,in,his,sleep,if,he,ever,did,it,again,and,he,never,did,but,sometimes,he,would,say,things
it,appears,things,needed,to,be,said
lord,tywin,waved,two,fingers,at,her,a,brusque,dismissal
go
she,went,seething
not,robert,the,second,tyrion,said
aerys,the,third
the,boy,is,thirteen
there,is,time,yet
lord,tywin,paced,to,the,window
that,was,unlike,him,he,was,more,upset,than,he,wished,to,show
he,requires,a,sharp,lesson
tyrion,had,gotten,his,own,sharp,lesson,at,thirteen
he,felt,almost,sorry,for,his,nephew
on,the,other,hand,no,one,deserved,it,more
enough,of,joffrey,he,said
wars,are,won,with,quills,and,ravens,wasn’t,that,what,you,said
i,must,congratulate,you
how,long,have,you,and,walder,frey,been,plotting,this
i,mislike,that,word,lord,tywin,said,stiffly
and,i,mislike,being,left,in,the,dark
there,was,no,reason,to,tell,you
you,had,no,part,in,this
was,cersei,told
tyrion,demanded,to,know
no,one,was,told,save,those,who,had,a,part,to,play
and,they,were,only,told,as,much,as,they,needed,to,know
you,ought,to,know,that,there,is,no,other,way,to,keep,a,secret,here,especially
my,object,was,to,rid,us,of,a,dangerous,enemy,as,cheaply,as,i,could,not,to,indulge,your,curiosity,or,make,your,sister,feel,important
he,closed,the,shutters,frowning
you,have,a,certain,cunning,tyrion,but,the,plain,truth,is,you,talk,too,much
that,loose,tongue,of,yours,will,be,your,undoing
you,should,have,let,joff,tear,it,out,suggested,tyrion
you,would,do,well,not,to,tempt,me,lord,tywin,said
i’ll,hear,no,more,of,this
i,have,been,considering,how,best,to,appease,oberyn,martell,and,his,entourage
oh
is,this,something,i’m,allowed,to,know,or,should,i,leave,so,you,can,discuss,it,with,yourself
his,father,ignored,the,sally
prince,oberyn’s,presence,here,is,unfortunate
his,brother,is,a,cautious,man,a,reasoned,man,subtle,deliberate,even,indolent,to,a,degree
he,is,a,man,who,weighs,the,consequences,of,every,word,and,every,action
but,oberyn,has,always,been,half-mad
is,it,true,he,tried,to,raise,dorne,for,viserys
no,one,speaks,of,it,but,yes
ravens,flew,and,riders,rode,with,what,secret,messages,i,never,knew
jon,arryn,sailed,to,sunspear,to,return,prince,lewyn’s,bones,sat,down,with,prince,doran,and,ended,all,the,talk,of,war
but,robert,never,went,to,dorne,thereafter,and,prince,oberyn,seldom,left,it
well,he’s,here,now,with,half,the,nobility,of,dorne,in,his,tail,and,he,grows,more,impatient,every,day,said,tyrion
perhaps,i,should,show,him,the,brothels,of,king’s,landing,that,might,distract,him
a,tool,for,every,task,isn’t,that,how,it,works
my,tool,is,yours,father
never,let,it,be,said,that,house,lannister,blew,its,trumpets,and,i,did,not,respond
lord,tywin’s,mouth,tightened
very,droll
shall,i,have,them,sew,you,a,suit,of,motley,and,a,little,hat,with,bells,on,it
if,i,wear,it,do,i,have,leave,to,say,anything,i,want,about,his,grace,king,joffrey
lord,tywin,seated,himself,again,and,said,i,was,made,to,suffer,my,father’s,follies
i,will,not,suffer,yours
enough
very,well,as,you,ask,so,pleasantly
the,red,viper,is,not,going,to,be,pleasant,i,fear
nor,will,he,content,himself,with,ser,gregor’s,head,alone
all,the,more,reason,not,to,give,it,to,him
not,to

tyrion,was,shocked
i,thought,we,were,agreed,that,the,woods,were,full,of,beasts
lesser,beasts
lord,tywin’s,fingers,laced,together,under,his,chin
ser,gregor,has,served,us,well
no,other,knight,in,the,realm,inspires,such,terror,in,our,enemies
oberyn,knows,that,gregor,was,the,one,who
he,knows,nothing
he,has,heard,tales
stable,gossip,and,kitchen,calumnies
he,has,no,crumb,of,proof
ser,gregor,is,certainly,not,about,to,confess,to,him
i,mean,to,keep,him,well,away,for,so,long,as,the,dornishmen,are,in,king’s,landing
and,when,oberyn,demands,the,justice,he’s,come,for
i,will,tell,him,that,ser,amory,lorch,killed,elia,and,her,children,lord,tywin,said,calmly
so,will,you,if,he,asks
ser,amory,lorch,is,dead,tyrion,said,flatly
precisely
vargo,hoat,had,ser,amory,torn,apart,by,a,bear,after,the,fall,of,harrenhal
that,ought,to,be,sufficiently,grisly,to,appease,even,oberyn,martell
you,may,call,that,justice
it,is,justice
it,was,ser,amory,who,brought,me,the,girl’s,body,if,you,must,know
he,found,her,hiding,under,her,father’s,bed,as,if,she,believed,rhaegar,could,still,protect,her
princess,elia,and,the,babe,were,in,the,nursery,a,floor,below
well,it’s,a,tale,and,ser,amory’s,not,like,to,deny,it
what,will,you,tell,oberyn,when,he,asks,who,gave,lorch,his,orders
ser,amory,acted,on,his,own,in,the,hope,of,winning,favor,from,the,new,king
robert’s,hatred,for,rhaegar,was,scarcely,a,secret
it,might,serve,tyrion,had,to,concede,but,the,snake,will,not,be,happy
far,be,it,from,me,to,question,your,cunning,father,but,in,your,place,i,do,believe,i’d,have,let,robert,baratheon,bloody,his,own,hands
lord,tywin,stared,at,him,as,if,he,had,lost,his,wits
you,deserve,that,motley,then
we,had,come,late,to,robert’s,cause
it,was,necessary,to,demonstrate,our,loyalty
when,i,laid,those,bodies,before,the,throne,no,man,could,doubt,that,we,had,forsaken,house,targaryen,forever
and,robert’s,relief,was,palpable
as,stupid,as,he,was,even,he,knew,that,rhaegar’s,children,had,to,die,if,his,throne,was,ever,to,be,secure
yet,he,saw,himself,as,a,hero,and,heroes,do,not,kill,children
his,father,shrugged
i,grant,you,it,was,done,too,brutally
elia,need,not,have,been,harmed,at,all,that,was,sheer,folly
by,herself,she,was,nothing
then,why,did,the,mountain,kill,her
because,i,did,not,tell,him,to,spare,her
i,doubt,i,mentioned,her,at,all
i,had,more,pressing,concerns
ned,stark’s,van,was,rushing,south,from,the,trident,and,i,feared,it,might,come,to,swords,between,us
and,it,was,in,aerys,to,murder,jaime,with,no,more,cause,than,spite
that,was,the,thing,i,feared,most
that,and,what,jaime,himself,might,do
he,closed,a,fist
nor,did,i,yet,grasp,what,i,had,in,gregor,clegane,only,that,he,was,huge,and,terrible,in,battle
the,rape
even,you,will,not,accuse,me,of,giving,that,command,i,would,hope
ser,amory,was,almost,as,bestial,with,rhaenys
i,asked,him,afterward,why,it,had,required,half,a,hundred,thrusts,to,kill,a,girl,of
two
three
he,said,she’d,kicked,him,and,would,not,stop,screaming
if,lorch,had,half,the,wits,the,gods,gave,a,turnip,he,would,have,calmed,her,with,a,few,sweet,words,and,used,a,soft,silk,pillow
his,mouth,twisted,in,distaste
the,blood,was,in,him
but,not,in,you,father
there,is,no,blood,in,tywin,lannister
was,it,a,soft,silk,pillow,that,slew,robb,stark
it,was,to,be,an,arrow,at,edmure,tully’s,wedding,feast
the,boy,was,too,wary,in,the,field
he,kept,his,men,in,good,order,and,surrounded,himself,with,outriders,and,bodyguards
so,lord,walder,slew,him,under,his,own,roof,at,his,own,table
tyrion,made,a,fist
what,of,lady,catelyn
slain,as,well,i’d,say
a,pair,of,wolfskins
frey,had,intended,to,keep,her,captive,but,perhaps,something,went,awry
so,much,for,guest,right
the,blood,is,on,walder,frey’s,hands,not,mine
walder,frey,is,a,peevish,old,man,who,lives,to,fondle,his,young,wife,and,brood,over,all,the,slights,he’s,suffered
i,have,no,doubt,he,hatched,this,ugly,chicken,but,he,would,never,have,dared,such,a,thing,without,a,promise,of,protection
i,suppose,you,would,have,spared,the,boy,and,told,lord,frey,you,had,no,need,of,his,allegiance
that,would,have,driven,the,old,fool,right,back,into,stark’s,arms,and,won,you,another,year,of,war
explain,to,me,why,it,is,more,noble,to,kill,ten,thousand,men,in,battle,than,a,dozen,at,dinner
when,tyrion,had,no,reply,to,that,his,father,continued
the,price,was,cheap,by,any,measure
the,crown,shall,grant,riverrun,to,ser,emmon,frey,once,the,blackfish,yields
lancel,and,daven,must,marry,frey,girls,joy,is,to,wed,one,of,lord,walder’s,natural,sons,when,she’s,old,enough,and,roose,bolton,becomes,warden,of,the,north,and,takes,home,arya,stark
arya,stark
tyrion,cocked,his,head
and,bolton
i,might,have,known,frey,would,not,have,the,stomach,to,act,alone
but,arya
varys,and,ser,jacelyn,searched,for,her,for,more,than,half,a,year
arya,stark,is,surely,dead
so,was,renly,until,the,blackwater
what,does,that,mean
perhaps,littlefinger,succeeded,where,you,and,varys,failed
lord,bolton,will,wed,the,girl,to,his,bastard,son
we,shall,allow,the,dreadfort,to,fight,the,ironborn,for,a,few,years,and,see,if,he,can,bring,stark’s,other,bannermen,to,heel
come,spring,all,of,them,should,be,at,the,end,of,their,strength,and,ready,to,bend,the,knee
the,north,will,go,to,your,son,by,sansa,stark
if,you,ever,find,enough,manhood,in,you,to,breed,one
lest,you,forget,it,is,not,only,joffrey,who,must,needs,take,a,maidenhead
i,had,not,forgotten,though,i’d,hoped,you,had
and,when,do,you,imagine,sansa,will,be,at,her,most,fertile
tyrion,asked,his,father,in,tones,that,dripped,acid
before,or,after,i,tell,her,how,we,murdered,her,mother,and,her,brother
davos,for,a,moment,it,seemed,as,though,the,king,had,not,heard
stannis,showed,no,pleasure,at,the,news,no,anger,no,disbelief,not,even,relief
he,stared,at,his,painted,table,with,teeth,clenched,hard
you,are,certain
he,asked
i,am,not,seeing,the,body,no,your,kingliness,said,salladhor,saan
yet,in,the,city,the,lions,prance,and,dance
the,red,wedding,the,smallfolk,are,calling,it
they,swear,lord,frey,had,the,boy’s,head,hacked,off,sewed,the,head,of,his,direwolf,in,its,place,and,nailed,a,crown,about,his,ears
his,lady,mother,was,slain,as,well,and,thrown,naked,in,the,river
at,a,wedding,thought,davos
as,he,sat,at,his,slayer’s,board,a,guest,beneath,his,roof
these,freys,are,cursed
he,could,smell,the,burning,blood,again,and,hear,the,leech,hissing,and,spitting,on,the,brazier’s,hot,coals
it,was,the,lord’s,wrath,that,slew,him,ser,axell,florent,declared
it,was,the,hand,of,r’hllor

the,ruby,at,melisandre’s,throat,shone,redly
his,ways,are,mysterious,but,no,man,may,withstand,his,fiery,will

they,said,stannis,was,ensorceled,that,melisandre,had,turned,him,away,from,the,seven,to,bow,before,some,demon,out,of,shadow,and
worst,sin,of,all
that,she,and,her,god,had,failed,him
and,there,were,knights,and,lordlings,who,felt,the,same

the,bastard,of,nightsong,had,commanded,the,rearguard,that,allowed,stannis,to,reach,the,safety,of,salladhor,saan’s,galleys,but,he,worshiped,the,warrior,with,a,faith,as,fierce,as,he,was
king’s,men,not,queen’s,men
but,it,would,not,do,to,boast,of,them
a,certain,lysene,pirate,once,told,me,that,a,good,smuggler,stays,out,of,sight,davos,replied,carefully

pylos,meant,it,kindly,but,his,assurances,rang,hollow
it,is,not,at,all,the,same
davos,had,protested
a,kingdom’s,not,a,ship
and,a,good,thing,or,this,kingdom,would,be,sinking
i,know,wood,and,rope,and,water,yes,but,how,will,that,serve,me,now
where,do,i,find,the,wind,to,blow,king,stannis,to,his,throne

that,is,what,he,has,in,me
the,king’s,hand,should,be,a,highborn,lord,someone,wise,and,learned,a,battle,commander,or,a,great,knight
ser,ryam,redwyne,was,the,greatest,knight,of,his,day,and,one,of,the,worst,hands,ever,to,serve,a,king

how,can,i,read,history,when,i,cannot,read

there,is,no,magic,needed,nor,high,birth,i,am,teaching,the,art,to,your,son,at,the,king’s,command
let,me,teach,you,as,well
it,was,a,kindly,offer,and,not,one,that,davos,could,refuse
and,so,every,day,he,repaired,to,the,maester’s,chambers,high,atop,sea,dragon,tower,to,frown,over,scrolls,and,parchments,and,great,leather,tomes,and,try,to,puzzle,out,a,few,more,words
his,efforts,often,gave,him,headaches,and,made,him,feel,as,big,a,fool,as,patchface,besides
his,son,devan,was,not,yet,twelve,yet,he,was,well,ahead,of,his,father,and,for,princess,shireen,and,edric,storm,reading,seemed,as,natural,as,breathing
when,it,came,to,books,davos,was,more,a,child,than,any,of,them
yet,he,persisted
he,was,the,king’s,hand,now,and,a,king’s,hand,should,read
the,narrow,twisting,steps,of,sea,dragon,tower,had,been,a,sore,trial,to,maester,cressen,after,he,broke,his,hip
davos,still,found,himself,missing,the,old,man
he,thought,stannis,must,as,well
pylos,seemed,clever,and,diligent,and,well-meaning,but,he,was,so,young,and,the,king,did,not,confide,in,him,as,he,had,in,cressen
the,old,man,had,been,with,stannis,so,long
until,he,ran,afoul,of,melisandre,and,died,for,it
at,the,top,of,the,steps,davos,heard,a,soft,jingle,of,bells,that,could,only,herald,patchface
the,princess’s,fool,was,waiting,outside,the,maester’s,door,for,her,like,a,faithful,hound
dough-soft,and,slump-shouldered,his,broad,face,tattooed,in,a,motley,pattern,of,red,and,green,squares,patchface,wore,a,helm,made,of,a,rack,of,deer,antlers,strapped,to,a,tin,bucket
a,dozen,bells,hung,from,the,tines,and,rang,when,he,moved
which,meant,constantly,since,the,fool,seldom,stood,still
he,jingled,and,jangled,his,way,everywhere,he,went,small,wonder,that,pylos,had,exiled,him,from,shireen’s,lessons
under,the,sea,the,old,fish,eat,the,young,fish,the,fool,muttered,at,davos
he,bobbed,his,head,and,his,bells,clanged,and,chimed,and,sang
i,know,i,know,oh,oh,oh
up,here,the,young,fish,teach,the,old,fish,said,davos,who,never,felt,so,ancient,as,when,he,sat,down,to,try,and,read
it,might,have,been,different,if,aged,maester,cressen,had,been,the,one,teaching,him,but,pylos,was,young,enough,to,be,his,son
he,found,the,maester,seated,at,his,long,wooden,table,covered,with,books,and,scrolls,across,from,the,three,children
princess,shireen,sat,between,the,two,boys
even,now,davos,could,take,great,pleasure,in,the,sight,of,his,own,blood,keeping,company,with,a,princess,and,a,king’s,bastard
devan,will,be,a,lord,now,not,merely,a,knight
the,lord,of,the,rainwood
davos,took,more,pride,in,that,than,in,wearing,the,title,himself
he,reads,too
he,reads,and,he,writes,as,if,he,had,been,born,to,it
pylos,had,naught,but,praise,for,his,diligence,and,the,master-at-arms,said,devan,was,showing,promise,with,sword,and,lance,as,well
and,he,is,a,godly,lad,too
my,brothers,have,ascended,to,the,hall,of,light,to,sit,beside,the,lord,devan,had,said,when,his,father,told,him,how,his,four,elder,brothers,had,died
i,will,pray,for,them,at,the,nightfires,and,for,you,as,well,father,so,you,might,walk,in,the,light,of,the,lord,till,the,end,of,your,days
good,morrow,to,you,father,the,boy,greeted,him
he,looks,so,much,like,dale,did,at,his,age,davos,thought
his,eldest,had,never,dressed,so,fine,as,devan,in,his,squire’s,raiment,to,be,sure,but,they,shared,the,same,square,plain,face,the,same,forthright,brown,eyes,the,same,thin,brown,flyaway,hair
devan’s,cheeks,and,chin,were,dusted,with,blond,hair,a,fuzz,that,would,have,shamed,a,proper,peach,though,the,boy,was,fiercely,proud,of,his,beard
just,as,dale,was,proud,of,his,once
devan,was,the,oldest,of,the,three,children,at,the,table
yet,edric,storm,was,three,inches,taller,and,broader,in,the,chest,and,shoulders
he,was,his,father’s,son,in,that,nor,did,he,ever,miss,a,morning’s,work,with,sword,and,shield
those,old,enough,to,have,known,robert,and,renly,as,children,said,that,the,bastard,boy,had,more,of,their,look,than,stannis,had,ever,shared,the,coal-black,hair,the,deep,blue,eyes,the,mouth,the,jaw,the,cheekbones
only,his,ears,reminded,you,that,his,mother,had,been,a,florent
yes,good,morrow,my,lord,edric,echoed
the,boy,could,be,fierce,and,proud,but,the,maesters,and,castellans,and,masters-at-arms,who’d,raised,him,had,schooled,him,well,in,courtesy
do,you,come,from,my,uncle
how,fares,his,grace
well,davos,lied
if,truth,be,told,the,king,had,a,haggard,haunted,look,about,him,but,he,saw,no,need,to,burden,the,boy,with,his,fears
i,hope,i,have,not,disturbed,your,lesson
we,had,just,finished,my,lord,maester,pylos,said
we,were,reading,about,king,daeron,the,first
princess,shireen,was,a,sad,sweet,gentle,child,far,from,pretty
stannis,had,given,her,his,square,jaw,and,selyse,her,florent,ears,and,the,gods,in,their,cruel,wisdom,had,seen,fit,to,compound,her,homeliness,by,afflicting,her,with,greyscale,in,the,cradle
the,disease,had,left,one,cheek,and,half,her,neck,grey,and,cracked,and,hard,though,it,had,spared,both,her,life,and,her,sight
he,went,to,war,and,conquered,dorne
the,young,dragon,they,called,him
he,worshiped,false,gods,said,devan,but,he,was,a,great,king,otherwise,and,very,brave,in,battle
he,was,agreed,edric,storm,but,my,father,was,braver
the,young,dragon,never,won,three,battles,in,a,day
the,princess,looked,at,him,wide-eyed
did,uncle,robert,win,three,battles,in,a,day
the,bastard,nodded
it,was,when,he’d,first,come,home,to,call,his,banners
lords,grandison,cafferen,and,fell,planned,to,join,their,strength,at,summerhall,and,march,on,storm’s,end,but,he,learned,their,plans,from,an,informer,and,rode,at,once,with,all,his,knights,and,squires
as,the,plotters,came,up,on,summerhall,one,by,one,he,defeated,each,of,them,in,turn,before,they,could,join,up,with,the,others
he,slew,lord,fell,in,single,combat,and,captured,his,son,silveraxe
devan,looked,to,pylos
is,that,how,it,happened
i,said,so,didn’t,i
edric,storm,said,before,the,maester,could,reply
he,smashed,all,three,of,them,and,fought,so,bravely,that,lord,grandison,and,lord,cafferen,became,his,men,afterward,and,silveraxe,too
no,one,ever,beat,my,father
edric,you,ought,not,boast,maester,pylos,said
king,robert,suffered,defeats,like,any,other,man
lord,tyrell,bested,him,at,ashford,and,he,lost,many,a,tourney,tilt,as,well
he,won,more,than,he,lost,though
and,he,killed,prince,rhaegar,on,the,trident
that,he,did,the,maester,agreed
but,now,i,must,give,my,attention,to,lord,davos,who,has,waited,so,patiently
we,will,read,more,of,king,daeron’s,conquest,of,dorne,on,the,morrow
princess,shireen,and,the,boys,said,their,farewells,courteously
when,they,had,taken,their,leaves,maester,pylos,moved,closer,to,davos
my,lord,perhaps,you,would,like,to,try,a,bit,of,conquest,of,dorne,as,well
he,slid,the,slender,leather-bound,book,across,the,table
king,daeron,wrote,with,an,elegant,simplicity,and,his,history,is,rich,with,blood,battle,and,bravery
your,son,is,quite,engrossed
my,son,is,not,quite,twelve
i,am,the,king’s,hand

as,you,wish,my,lord
maester,pylos,rummaged,about,his,table,unrolling,and,then,discarding,various,scraps,of,parchment
there,are,no,new,letters
perhaps,an,old,one
davos,enjoyed,a,good,story,as,well,as,any,man,but,stannis,had,not,named,him,hand,for,his,enjoyment,he,felt
his,first,duty,was,to,help,his,king,rule,and,for,that,he,must,needs,understand,the,words,the,ravens,brought
the,best,way,to,learn,a,thing,was,to,do,it,he,had,found,sails,or,scrolls,it,made,no,matter
this,might,serve,our,purpose
pylos,passed,him,a,letter
davos,flattened,down,the,little,square,of,crinkled,parchment,and,squinted,at,the,tiny,crabbed,letters
reading,was,hard,on,the,eyes,that,much,he,had,learned,early
sometimes,he,wondered,if,the,citadel,offered,a,champion’s,purse,to,the,maester,who,wrote,the,smallest,hand
pylos,had,laughed,at,the,notion,but

this,is,from,the,night’s,watch
maester,has,king,stannis,seen,this,letter
i,brought,it,to,lord,alester,when,it,first,arrived

that,was,true,enough

something,my,wife,said,once
davos,drummed,his,shortened,fingers,against,the,tabletop
the,first,time,he,had,seen,the,wall,he,had,been,younger,than,devan,serving,aboard,the,cobblecat,under,roro,uhoris,a,tyroshi,known,up,and,down,the,narrow,sea,as,the,blind,bastard,though,he,was,neither,blind,nor,baseborn
roro,had,sailed,past,skagos,into,the,shivering,sea,visiting,a,hundred,little,coves,that,had,never,seen,a,trading,ship,before
he,brought,steel,swords,axes,helms,good,chainmail,hauberks,to,trade,for,furs,ivory,amber,and,obsidian
when,the,cobblecat,turned,back,south,her,holds,were,stuffed,but,in,the,bay,of,seals,three,black,galleys,came,out,to,herd,her,into,eastwatch
they,lost,their,cargo,and,the,bastard,lost,his,head,for,the,crime,of,trading,weapons,to,the,wildlings
davos,had,traded,at,eastwatch,in,his,smuggling,days
the,black,brothers,made,hard,enemies,but,good,customers,for,a,ship,with,the,right,cargo
but,while,he,might,have,taken,their,coin,he,had,never,forgotten,how,the,blind,bastard’s,head,had,rolled,across,the,cobblecat’s,deck
i,met,some,wildlings,when,i,was,a,boy,he,told,maester,pylos

i,am,the,hand,of,the,king,yes
stannis,might,be,the,king,of,westeros,in,name,but,in,truth,he,was,the,king,of,the,painted,table
he,held,dragonstone,and,storm’s,end,and,had,an,ever-more-uneasy,alliance,with,salladhor,saan,but,that,was,all
how,could,the,watch,have,looked,to,him,for,help

it,was,not,as,though,stannis,held,the,north
his,grace,could,scarcely,be,expected,to,defend,people,who,refused,to,acknowledge,him,as,king

atop,the,king’s,tower,jon,snow,leaned,on,the,padded,crutch,that,maester,aemon,had,given,him,and,watched,the,grey,plume,rise
styr,had,lost,all,hope,of,taking,castle,black,unawares,when,jon,escaped,him,yet,even,so,he,need,not,have,warned,of,his,approach,so,bluntly
you,may,kill,us,he,reflected,but,no,one,will,be,butchered,in,their,beds
that,much,i,did,at,least
his,leg,still,hurt,like,blazes,when,he,put,his,weight,on,it
he’d,needed,clydas,to,help,him,don,his,fresh-washed,blacks,and,lace,up,his,boots,that,morning,and,by,the,time,they,were,done,he’d,wanted,to,drown,himself,in,the,milk,of,the,poppy
instead,he,had,settled,for,half,a,cup,of,dreamwine,a,chew,of,willow,bark,and,the,crutch
the,beacon,was,burning,on,weatherback,ridge,and,the,night’s,watch,had,need,of,every,man

your,leg’s,healed,is,it

the,pointy,end

noye,rubbed,the,bristle,on,his,chin
might,be,you’ll,do
we’ll,put,you,on,a,tower,with,a,longbow,but,if,you,bloody,well,fall,off,don’t,come,crying,to,me
he,could,see,the,kingsroad,wending,its,way,south,through,stony,brown,fields,and,over,windswept,hills
the,magnar,would,be,coming,up,that,road,before,the,day,was,done,his,thenns,marching,behind,him,with,axes,and,spears,in,their,hands,and,their,bronze-and-leather,shields,on,their,backs
grigg,the,goat,quort,big,boil,and,the,rest,will,be,coming,as,well
and,ygritte
the,wildlings,had,never,been,his,friends,he,had,not,allowed,them,to,be,his,friends,but,her
he,could,feel,the,throb,of,pain,where,her,arrow,had,gone,through,the,meat,and,muscle,of,his,thigh
he,remembered,the,old,man’s,eyes,too,and,the,black,blood,rushing,from,his,throat,as,the,storm,cracked,overhead
but,he,remembered,the,grotto,best,of,all,the,look,of,her,naked,in,the,torchlight,the,taste,of,her,mouth,when,it,opened,under,his
ygritte,stay,away
go,south,and,raid,go,hide,in,one,of,those,roundtowers,you,liked,so,well
you’ll,find,nothing,here,but,death
across,the,yard,one,of,the,bowmen,on,the,roof,of,the,old,flint,barracks,had,unlaced,his,breeches,and,was,pissing,through,a,crenel
mully,he,knew,from,the,man’s,greasy,orange,hair
men,in,black,cloaks,were,visible,on,other,roofs,and,tower,tops,as,well,though,nine,of,every,ten,happened,to,be,made,of,straw
the,scarecrow,sentinels,donal,noye,called,them
only,we’re,the,crows,jon,mused,and,most,of,us,were,scared,enough
whatever,you,called,them,the,straw,soldiers,had,been,maester,aemon’s,notion
they,had,more,breeches,and,jerkins,and,tunics,in,the,storerooms,than,they’d,had,men,to,fill,them,so,why,not,stuff,some,with,straw,drape,a,cloak,around,their,shoulders,and,set,them,to,standing,watches
noye,had,placed,them,on,every,tower,and,in,half,the,windows
some,were,even,clutching,spears,or,had,crossbows,cocked,under,their,arms
the,hope,was,that,the,thenns,would,see,them,from,afar,and,decide,that,castle,black,was,too,well,defended,to,attack
jon,had,six,scarecrows,sharing,the,roof,of,the,king’s,tower,with,him,along,with,two,actual,breathing,brothers
deaf,dick,follard,sat,in,a,crenel,methodically,cleaning,and,oiling,the,mechanism,of,his,crossbow,to,make,sure,the,wheel,turned,smoothly,while,the,oldtown,boy,wandered,restlessly,around,the,parapets,fussing,with,the,clothes,on,straw,men
maybe,he,thinks,they,will,fight,better,if,they’re,posed,just,right
or,maybe,this,waiting,is,fraying,his,nerves,the,way,it’s,fraying,mine
the,boy,claimed,to,be,eighteen,older,than,jon,but,he,was,green,as,summer,grass,for,all,that
satin,they,called,him,even,in,the,wool,and,mail,and,boiled,leather,of,the,night’s,watch,the,name,he’d,gotten,in,the,brothel,where,he’d,been,born,and,raised
he,was,pretty,as,a,girl,with,his,dark,eyes,soft,skin,and,raven’s,ringlets
half,a,year,at,castle,black,had,toughened,up,his,hands,however,and,noye,said,he,was,passable,with,a,crossbow
whether,he,had,the,courage,to,face,what,was,coming,though
jon,used,the,crutch,to,limp,across,the,tower,top
the,king’s,tower,was,not,the,castle’s,tallest,the,high,slim,crumbling,lance,held,that,honor,though,othell,yarwyck,had,been,heard,to,say,it,might,topple,any,day
nor,was,the,king’s,tower,strongest,the,tower,of,guards,beside,the,kingsroad,would,be,a,tougher,nut,to,crack
but,it,was,tall,enough,strong,enough,and,well,placed,beside,the,wall,overlooking,the,gate,and,the,foot,of,the,wooden,stair
the,first,time,he,had,seen,castle,black,with,his,own,eyes,jon,had,wondered,why,anyone,would,be,so,foolish,as,to,build,a,castle,without,walls
how,could,it,be,defended
it,can’t,his,uncle,told,him
that,is,the,point
the,night’s,watch,is,pledged,to,take,no,part,in,the,quarrels,of,the,realm
yet,over,the,centuries,certain,lords,commander,more,proud,than,wise,forgot,their,vows,and,near,destroyed,us,all,with,their,ambitions
lord,commander,runcel,hightower,tried,to,bequeathe,the,watch,to,his,bastard,son
lord,commander,rodrik,flint,thought,to,make,himself,king-beyond-the-wall
tristan,mudd,mad,marq,rankenfell,robin,hill
did,you,know,that,six,hundred,years,ago,the,commanders,at,snowgate,and,the,nightfort,went,to,war,against,each,other
and,when,the,lord,commander,tried,to,stop,them,they,joined,forces,to,murder,him
the,stark,in,winterfell,had,to,take,a,hand
and,both,their,heads
which,he,did,easily,because,their,strongholds,were,not,defensible
the,night’s,watch,had,nine,hundred,and,ninety-six,lords,commander,before,jeor,mormont,most,of,them,men,of,courage,and,honor
but,we,have,had,cowards,and,fools,as,well,our,tyrants,and,our,madmen
we,survive,because,the,lords,and,kings,of,the,seven,kingdoms,know,that,we,pose,no,threat,to,them,no,matter,who,should,lead,us
our,only,foes,are,to,the,north,and,to,the,north,we,have,the,wall
only,now,those,foes,have,gotten,past,the,wall,to,come,up,from,the,south,jon,reflected,and,the,lords,and,kings,of,the,seven,kingdoms,have,forgotten,us
we,are,caught,between,the,hammer,and,the,anvil
without,a,wall,castle,black,could,not,be,held,donal,noye,knew,that,as,well,as,any
the,castle,does,them,no,good,the,armorer,told,his,little,garrison
kitchens,common,hall,stables,even,the,towers
let,them,take,it,all
we’ll,empty,the,armory,and,move,what,stores,we,can,to,the,top,of,the,wall,and,make,our,stand,around,the,gate
so,castle,black,had,a,wall,of,sorts,at,last,a,crescent-shaped,barricade,ten,feet,high,made,of,stores,casks,of,nails,and,barrels,of,salt,mutton,crates,bales,of,black,broadcloth,stacked,logs,sawn,timbers,fire-hardened,stakes,and,sacks,and,sacks,of,grain
the,crude,rampart,enclosed,the,two,things,most,worth,defending,the,gate,to,the,north,and,the,foot,of,the,great,wooden,switchback,stair,that,clawed,and,climbed,its,way,up,the,face,of,the,wall,like,a,drunken,thunderbolt,supported,by,wooden,beams,as,big,as,tree,trunks,driven,deep,into,the,ice
the,last,few,moles,were,still,making,the,long,climb,jon,saw,urged,on,by,his,brothers
grenn,was,carrying,a,little,boy,in,his,arms,while,pyp,two,flights,below,let,an,old,man,lean,upon,his,shoulder
the,oldest,villagers,still,waited,below,for,the,cage,to,make,its,way,back,down,to,them
he,saw,a,mother,pulling,along,two,children,one,on,either,hand,as,an,older,boy,ran,past,her,up,the,steps
two,hundred,feet,above,them,sky,blue,su,and,lady,meliana,who,was,no,lady,all,her,friends,agreed,stood,on,a,landing,looking,south
they,had,a,better,view,of,the,smoke,than,he,did,no,doubt
jon,wondered,about,the,villagers,who,had,chosen,not,to,flee
there,were,always,a,few,too,stubborn,or,too,stupid,or,too,brave,to,run,a,few,who,preferred,to,fight,or,hide,or,bend,the,knee
maybe,the,thenns,would,spare,them
the,thing,to,do,would,be,to,take,the,attack,to,them,he,thought
with,fifty,rangers,well,mounted,we,could,cut,them,apart,on,the,road
they,did,not,have,fifty,rangers,though,nor,half,as,many,horses
the,garrison,had,not,returned,and,there,was,no,way,to,know,just,where,they,were,or,even,whether,the,riders,that,noye,had,sent,out,had,reached,them
we,are,the,garrison,jon,told,himself,and,look,at,us
the,brothers,bowen,marsh,had,left,behind,were,old,men,cripples,and,green,boys,just,as,donal,noye,had,warned,him
he,could,see,some,wrestling,barrels,up,the,steps,others,on,the,barricade,stout,old,kegs,as,slow,as,ever,spare,boot,hopping,along,briskly,on,his,carved,wooden,leg,half-mad,easy,who,fancied,himself,florian,the,fool,reborn,dornish,dilly,red,alyn,of,the,rosewood,young,henly,well,past,fifty,old,henly,well,past,seventy,hairy,hal,spotted,pate,of,maidenpool
a,couple,of,them,saw,jon,looking,down,from,atop,the,king’s,tower,and,waved,up,at,him
others,turned,away
they,still,think,me,a,turncloak
that,was,a,bitter,draft,to,drink,but,jon,could,not,blame,them
he,was,a,bastard,after,all
everyone,knew,that,bastards,were,wanton,and,treacherous,by,nature,having,been,born,of,lust,and,deceit
and,he,had,made,as,many,enemies,as,friends,at,castle,black
rast,for,one
jon,had,once,threatened,to,have,ghost,rip,his,throat,out,unless,he,stopped,tormenting,samwell,tarly,and,rast,did,not,forget,things,like,that
he,was,raking,dry,leaves,into,piles,under,the,stairs,just,now,but,every,so,often,he,stopped,long,enough,to,give,jon,a,nasty,look
no,donal,noye,roared,at,three,of,the,mole’s,town,men,down,below
the,pitch,goes,to,the,hoist,the,oil,up,the,steps,crossbow,bolts,to,the,fourth,fifth,and,sixth,landings,spears,to,first,and,second

the,casks,of,meat,are,for,the,barricade
now,you,poxy,plow,pushers,now
he,has,a,lord’s,voice,jon,thought
his,father,had,always,said,that,in,battle,a,captain’s,lungs,were,as,important,as,his,sword,arm
it,does,not,matter,how,brave,or,brilliant,a,man,is,if,his,commands,cannot,be,heard,lord,eddard,told,his,sons,so,robb,and,he,used,to,climb,the,towers,of,winterfell,to,shout,at,each,other,across,the,yard
donal,noye,could,have,drowned,out,both,of,them
the,moles,all,went,in,terror,of,him,and,rightfully,so,since,he,was,always,threatening,to,rip,their,heads,off
three-quarters,of,the,village,had,taken,jon’s,warning,to,heart,and,come,to,castle,black,for,refuge

but,there,were,only,three,and,soon,enough,the,wildling,tide,washed,over,them,and,their,blood,dripped,down,the,steps
a,man,is,never,so,vulnerable,in,battle,as,when,he,flees,lord,eddard,had,told,jon,once
a,running,man,is,like,a,wounded,animal,to,a,soldier

there,were,a,dozen,fire,arrows,too
the,oldtown,boy,thrust,one,torch,into,the,fire,until,it,was,blazing,brightly,and,brought,the,rest,back,under,his,arm,unlit
he,looked,frightened,again,as,well,he,might
jon,was,frightened,too
it,was,then,that,he,saw,styr
the,magnar,was,climbing,up,the,barricade,over,the,gutted,corn,sacks,and,smashed,barrels,and,the,bodies,of,friends,and,foe,alike

up,above,a,warhorn,sounded,long,and,low
not,from,the,top,of,the,wall,but,from,the,ninth,landing,some,two,hundred,feet,up,where,donal,noye,was,standing

the,black,brothers,at,least,had,known,the,plan,but,the,villagers,had,not

all,jon,had,to,do,was,watch

the,nightfort,had,figured,in,some,of,old,nan’s,scariest,stories
it,was,here,that,night’s,king,had,reigned,before,his,name,was,wiped,from,the,memory,of,man
this,was,where,the,rat,cook,had,served,the,andal,king,his,prince-and-bacon,pie,where,the,seventy-nine,sentinels,stood,their,watch,where,brave,young,danny,flint,had,been,raped,and,murdered
this,was,the,castle,where,king,sherrit,had,called,down,his,curse,on,the,andals,of,old,where,the,’prentice,boys,had,faced,the,thing,that,came,in,the,night,where,blind,symeon,star-eyes,had,seen,the,hellhounds,fighting
mad,axe,had,once,walked,these,yards,and,climbed,these,towers,butchering,his,brothers,in,the,dark
all,that,had,happened,hundreds,and,thousands,of,years,ago,to,be,sure,and,some,maybe,never,happened,at,all
maester,luwin,always,said,that,old,nan’s,stories,shouldn’t,be,swallowed,whole
but,once,his,uncle,came,to,see,father,and,bran,asked,about,the,nightfort
benjen,stark,never,said,the,tales,were,true,but,he,never,said,they,weren’t,he,only,shrugged,and,said,we,left,the,nightfort,two,hundred,years,ago,as,if,that,was,an,answer
bran,forced,himself,to,look,around
the,morning,was,cold,but,bright,the,sun,shining,down,from,a,hard,blue,sky,but,he,did,not,like,the,noises
the,wind,made,a,nervous,whistling,sound,as,it,shivered,through,the,broken,towers,the,keeps,groaned,and,settled,and,he,could,hear,rats,scrabbling,under,the,floor,of,the,great,hall
the,rat,cook’s,children,running,from,their,father
the,yards,were,small,forests,where,spindly,trees,rubbed,their,bare,branches,together,and,dead,leaves,scuttled,like,roaches,across,patches,of,old,snow
there,were,trees,growing,where,the,stables,had,been,and,a,twisted,white,weirwood,pushing,up,through,the,gaping,hole,in,the,roof,of,the,domed,kitchen
even,summer,was,not,at,ease,here
bran,slipped,inside,his,skin,just,for,an,instant,to,get,the,smell,of,the,place
he,did,not,like,that,either
and,there,was,no,way,through
bran,had,told,them,there,wouldn’t,be
he,had,told,them,and,told,them,but,jojen,reed,had,insisted,on,seeing,for,himself
he,had,had,a,green,dream,he,said,and,his,green,dreams,did,not,lie
they,don’t,open,any,gates,either,thought,bran
the,gate,the,nightfort,guarded,had,been,sealed,since,the,day,the,black,brothers,had,loaded,up,their,mules,and,garrons,and,departed,for,deep,lake,its,iron,portcullis,lowered,the,chains,that,raised,it,carried,off,the,tunnel,packed,with,stone,and,rubble,all,frozen,together,until,they,were,as,impenetrable,as,the,wall,itself
we,should,have,followed,jon,bran,said,when,he,saw,it
he,thought,of,his,bastard,brother,often,since,the,night,that,summer,had,watched,him,ride,off,through,the,storm
we,should,have,found,the,kingsroad,and,gone,to,castle,black
we,dare,not,my,prince,jojen,said
i’ve,told,you,why
but,there,are,wildlings
they,killed,some,man,and,they,wanted,to,kill,jon,too
jojen,there,were,a,hundred,of,them
so,you,said
we,are,four
you,helped,your,brother,if,that,was,him,in,truth,but,it,almost,cost,you,summer
i,know,said,bran,miserably
the,direwolf,had,killed,three,of,them,maybe,more,but,there,had,been,too,many
when,they,formed,a,tight,ring,around,the,tall,earless,man,he,had,tried,to,slip,away,through,the,rain,but,one,of,their,arrows,had,come,flashing,after,him,and,the,sudden,stab,of,pain,had,driven,bran,out,of,the,wolf’s,skin,and,back,into,his,own
after,the,storm,finally,died,they,had,huddled,in,the,dark,without,a,fire,talking,in,whispers,if,they,talked,at,all,listening,to,hodor’s,heavy,breathing,and,wondering,if,the,wildlings,might,try,and,cross,the,lake,in,the,morning
bran,had,reached,out,for,summer,time,and,time,again,but,the,pain,he,found,drove,him,back,the,way,a,red-hot,kettle,makes,you,pull,your,hand,back,even,when,you,mean,to,grab,it
only,hodor,slept,that,night,muttering,hodor,hodor,as,he,tossed,and,turned
bran,was,terrified,that,summer,was,off,dying,in,the,darkness
please,you,old,gods,he,prayed,you,took,winterfell,and,my,father,and,my,legs,please,don’t,take,summer,too
and,watch,over,jon,snow,too,and,make,the,wildlings,go,away
no,weirwoods,grew,on,that,stony,island,in,the,lake,yet,somehow,the,old,gods,must,have,heard
the,wildlings,took,their,sweet,time,about,departing,the,next,morning,stripping,the,bodies,of,their,dead,and,the,old,man,they’d,killed,even,pulling,a,few,fish,from,the,lake,and,there,was,a,scary,moment,when,three,of,them,found,the,causeway,and,started,to,walk,out
but,the,path,turned,and,they,didn’t,and,two,of,them,nearly,drowned,before,the,others,pulled,them,out
the,tall,bald,man,yelled,at,them,his,words,echoing,across,the,water,in,some,tongue,that,even,jojen,did,not,know,and,a,little,while,later,they,gathered,up,their,shields,and,spears,and,marched,off,north,by,east,the,same,way,jon,had,gone
bran,wanted,to,leave,too,to,look,for,summer,but,the,reeds,said,no
we,will,stay,another,night,said,jojen,put,some,leagues,between,us,and,the,wildlings
you,don’t,want,to,meet,them,again,do,you
late,that,afternoon,summer,returned,from,wherever,he’d,been,hiding,dragging,his,back,leg
he,ate,parts,of,the,bodies,in,the,inn,driving,off,the,crows,then,swam,out,to,the,island
meera,had,drawn,the,broken,arrow,from,his,leg,and,rubbed,the,wound,with,the,juice,of,some,plants,she,found,growing,around,the,base,of,the,tower
the,direwolf,was,still,limping,but,a,little,less,each,day,it,seemed,to,bran
the,gods,had,heard
maybe,we,should,try,another,castle,meera,said,to,her,brother
maybe,we,could,get,through,the,gate,somewhere,else
i,could,go,scout,if,you,wanted,i’d,make,better,time,by,myself
bran,shook,his,head
if,you,go,east,there’s,deep,lake,then,queensgate
west,is,icemark
but,they’ll,be,the,same,only,smaller
all,the,gates,are,sealed,except,the,ones,at,castle,black,eastwatch,and,the,shadow,tower
hodor,said,hodor,to,that,and,the,reeds,exchanged,a,look
at,least,i,should,climb,to,the,top,of,the,wall,meera,decided
maybe,i’ll,see,something,up,there
what,could,you,hope,to,see
jojen,asked
something,said,meera,and,for,once,she,was,adamant
it,should,be,me
bran,raised,his,head,to,look,up,at,the,wall,and,imagined,himself,climbing,inch,by,inch,squirming,his,fingers,into,cracks,in,the,ice,and,kicking,footholds,with,his,toes
that,made,him,smile,in,spite,of,everything,the,dreams,and,the,wildlings,and,jon,and,everything
he,had,climbed,the,walls,of,winterfell,when,he,was,little,and,all,the,towers,too,but,none,of,them,had,been,so,high,and,they,were,only,stone
the,wall,could,look,like,stone,all,grey,and,pitted,but,then,the,clouds,would,break,and,the,sun,would,hit,it,differently,and,all,at,once,it,would,transform,and,stand,there,white,and,blue,and,glittering
it,was,the,end,of,the,world,old,nan,always,said
on,the,other,side,were,monsters,and,giants,and,ghouls,but,they,could,not,pass,so,long,as,the,wall,stood,strong
i,want,to,stand,on,top,with,meera,bran,thought
i,want,to,stand,on,top,and,see
but,he,was,a,broken,boy,with,useless,legs,so,all,he,could,do,was,watch,from,below,as,meera,went,up,in,his,stead
she,wasn’t,really,climbing,the,way,he,used,to,climb
she,was,only,walking,up,some,steps,that,the,night’s,watch,had,hewn,hundreds,and,thousands,of,years,ago
he,remembered,maester,luwin,saying,the,nightfort,was,the,only,castle,where,the,steps,had,been,cut,from,the,ice,of,the,wall,itself
or,maybe,it,had,been,uncle,benjen
the,newer,castles,had,wooden,steps,or,stone,ones,or,long,ramps,of,earth,and,gravel
ice,is,too,treacherous
it,was,his,uncle,who’d,told,him,that
he,said,that,the,outer,surface,of,the,wall,wept,icy,tears,sometimes,though,the,core,inside,stayed,frozen,hard,as,rock
the,steps,must,have,melted,and,refrozen,a,thousand,times,since,the,last,black,brothers,left,the,castle,and,every,time,they,did,they,shrunk,a,little,and,got,smoother,and,rounder,and,more,treacherous
and,smaller
it’s,almost,like,the,wall,was,swallowing,them,back,into,itself
meera,reed,was,very,surefooted,but,even,so,she,was,going,slowly,moving,from,nub,to,nub
in,two,places,where,the,steps,were,hardly,there,at,all,she,got,down,on,all,fours
it,will,be,worse,when,she,comes,down,bran,thought,watching
even,so,he,wished,it,was,him,up,there
when,she,reached,the,top,crawling,up,the,icy,knobs,that,were,all,that,remained,of,the,highest,steps,meera,vanished,from,his,sight
when,will,she,come,down
bran,asked,jojen
when,she,is,ready
she,will,want,to,have,a,good,look
at,the,wall,and,what’s,beyond
we,should,do,the,same,down,here
hodor
said,hodor,doubtfully
we,might,find,something,jojen,insisted
or,something,might,find,us
bran,couldn’t,say,it,though,he,did,not,want,jojen,to,think,he,was,craven
so,they,went,exploring,jojen,reed,leading,bran,in,his,basket,on,hodor’s,back,summer,padding,by,their,side
once,the,direwolf,bolted,through,a,dark,door,and,returned,a,moment,later,with,a,grey,rat,between,his,teeth
the,rat,cook,bran,thought,but,it,was,the,wrong,color,and,only,as,big,as,a,cat
the,rat,cook,was,white,and,almost,as,huge,as,a,sow
there,were,a,lot,of,dark,doors,in,the,nightfort,and,a,lot,of,rats
bran,could,hear,them,scurrying,through,the,vaults,and,cellars,and,the,maze,of,pitch-black,tunnels,that,connected,them
jojen,wanted,to,go,poking,around,down,there,but,hodor,said,hodor,to,that,and,bran,said,no
there,were,worse,things,than,rats,down,in,the,dark,beneath,the,nightfort
this,seems,an,old,place,jojen,said,as,they,walked,down,a,gallery,where,the,sunlight,fell,in,dusty,shafts,through,empty,windows
twice,as,old,as,castle,black,bran,said,remembering
it,was,the,first,castle,on,the,wall,and,the,largest
but,it,had,also,been,the,first,abandoned,all,the,way,back,in,the,time,of,the,old,king
even,then,it,had,been,three-quarters,empty,and,too,costly,to,maintain
good,queen,alysanne,had,suggested,that,the,watch,replace,it,with,a,smaller,newer,castle,at,a,spot,only,seven,miles,east,where,the,wall,curved,along,the,shore,of,a,beautiful,green,lake
deep,lake,had,been,paid,for,by,the,queen’s,jewels,and,built,by,the,men,the,old,king,had,sent,north,and,the,black,brothers,had,abandoned,the,nightfort,to,the,rats
that,was,two,centuries,past,though
now,deep,lake,stood,as,empty,as,the,castle,it,had,replaced,and,the,nightfort
there,are,ghosts,here,bran,said
hodor,had,heard,all,the,stories,before,but,jojen,might,not,have
old,ghosts,from,before,the,old,king,even,before,aegon,the,dragon,seventy-nine,deserters,who,went,south,to,be,outlaws
one,was,lord,ryswell’s,youngest,son,so,when,they,reached,the,barrowlands,they,sought,shelter,at,his,castle,but,lord,ryswell,took,them,captive,and,returned,them,to,the,nightfort
the,lord,commander,had,holes,hewn,in,the,top,of,the,wall,and,he,put,the,deserters,in,them,and,sealed,them,up,alive,in,the,ice
they,have,spears,and,horns,and,they,all,face,north
the,seventy-nine,sentinels,they’re,called
they,left,their,posts,in,life,so,in,death,their,watch,goes,on,forever
years,later,when,lord,ryswell,was,old,and,dying,he,had,himself,carried,to,the,nightfort,so,he,could,take,the,black,and,stand,beside,his,son
he’d,sent,him,back,to,the,wall,for,honor’s,sake,but,he,loved,him,still,so,he,came,to,share,his,watch
they,spent,half,the,day,poking,through,the,castle
some,of,the,towers,had,fallen,down,and,others,looked,unsafe,but,they,climbed,the,bell,tower,the,bells,were,gone,and,the,rookery,the,birds,were,gone
beneath,the,brewhouse,they,found,a,vault,of,huge,oaken,casks,that,boomed,hollowly,when,hodor,knocked,on,them
they,found,a,library,the,shelves,and,bins,had,collapsed,the,books,were,gone,and,rats,were,everywhere
they,found,a,dank,and,dim-lit,dungeon,with,cells,enough,to,hold,five,hundred,captives,but,when,bran,grabbed,hold,of,one,of,the,rusted,bars,it,broke,off,in,his,hand
only,one,crumbling,wall,remained,of,the,great,hall,the,bathhouse,seemed,to,be,sinking,into,the,ground,and,a,huge,thornbush,had,conquered,the,practice,yard,outside,the,armory,where,black,brothers,had,once,labored,with,spear,and,shield,and,sword
the,armory,and,the,forge,still,stood,however,though,cobwebs,rats,and,dust,had,taken,the,places,of,blades,bellows,and,anvil
sometimes,summer,would,hear,sounds,that,bran,seemed,deaf,to,or,bare,his,teeth,at,nothing,the,fur,on,the,back,of,his,neck,bristling
but,the,rat,cook,never,put,in,an,appearance,nor,the,seventy-nine,sentinels,nor,mad,axe
bran,was,much,relieved
maybe,it,is,only,a,ruined,empty,castle
by,the,time,meera,returned,the,sun,was,only,a,sword’s,breath,above,the,western,hills
what,did,you,see
her,brother,jojen,asked,her
i,saw,the,haunted,forest,she,said,in,a,wistful,tone
hills,rising,wild,as,far,as,the,eye,can,see,covered,with,trees,that,no,axe,has,ever,touched
i,saw,the,sunlight,glinting,off,a,lake,and,clouds,sweeping,in,from,the,west
i,saw,patches,of,old,snow,and,icicles,long,as,pikes
i,even,saw,an,eagle,circling
i,think,he,saw,me,too
i,waved,at,him
did,you,see,a,way,down
asked,jojen
she,shook,her,head
no
it’s,a,sheer,drop,and,the,ice,is,so,smooth
i,might,be,able,to,make,the,descent,if,i,had,a,good,rope,and,an,axe,to,chop,out,handholds,but

but,not,us,jojen,finished
no,his,sister,agreed
are,you,sure,this,is,the,place,you,saw,in,your,dream
maybe,we,have,the,wrong,castle
no
this,is,the,castle
there,is,a,gate,here
yes,thought,bran,but,it’s,blocked,by,stone,and,ice
as,the,sun,began,to,set,the,shadows,of,the,towers,lengthened,and,the,wind,blew,harder,sending,gusts,of,dry,dead,leaves,rattling,through,the,yards
the,gathering,gloom,put,bran,in,mind,of,another,of,old,nan’s,stories,the,tale,of,night’s,king
he,had,been,the,thirteenth,man,to,lead,the,night’s,watch,she,said,a,warrior,who,knew,no,fear
and,that,was,the,fault,in,him,she,would,add,for,all,men,must,know,fear
a,woman,was,his,downfall,a,woman,glimpsed,from,atop,the,wall,with,skin,as,white,as,the,moon,and,eyes,like,blue,stars
fearing,nothing,he,chased,her,and,caught,her,and,loved,her,though,her,skin,was,cold,as,ice,and,when,he,gave,his,seed,to,her,he,gave,his,soul,as,well
he,brought,her,back,to,the,nightfort,and,proclaimed,her,a,queen,and,himself,her,king,and,with,strange,sorceries,he,bound,his,sworn,brothers,to,his,will
for,thirteen,years,they,had,ruled,night’s,king,and,his,corpse,queen,till,finally,the,stark,of,winterfell,and,joramun,of,the,wildlings,had,joined,to,free,the,watch,from,bondage
after,his,fall,when,it,was,found,he,had,been,sacrificing,to,the,others,all,records,of,night’s,king,had,been,destroyed,his,very,name,forbidden
some,say,he,was,a,bolton,old,nan,would,always,end
some,say,a,magnar,out,of,skagos,some,say,umber,flint,or,norrey
some,would,have,you,think,he,was,a,woodfoot,from,them,who,ruled,bear,island,before,the,ironmen,came
he,never,was
he,was,a,stark,the,brother,of,the,man,who,brought,him,down
she,always,pinched,bran,on,the,nose,then,he,would,never,forget,it
he,was,a,stark,of,winterfell,and,who,can,say
mayhaps,his,name,was,brandon
mayhaps,he,slept,in,this,very,bed,in,this,very,room
no,bran,thought,but,he,walked,in,this,castle,where,we’ll,sleep,tonight
he,did,not,like,that,notion,very,much,at,all
night’s,king,was,only,a,man,by,light,of,day,old,nan,would,always,say,but,the,night,was,his,to,rule
and,it’s,getting,dark
the,reeds,decided,that,they,would,sleep,in,the,kitchens,a,stone,octagon,with,a,broken,dome
it,looked,to,offer,better,shelter,than,most,of,the,other,buildings,even,though,a,crooked,weirwood,had,burst,up,through,the,slate,floor,beside,the,huge,central,well,stretching,slantwise,toward,the,hole,in,the,roof,its,bone-white,branches,reaching,for,the,sun
it,was,a,queer,kind,of,tree,skinnier,than,any,other,weirwood,that,bran,had,ever,seen,and,faceless,as,well,but,it,made,him,feel,as,if,the,old,gods,were,with,him,here,at,least
that,was,the,only,thing,he,liked,about,the,kitchens,though
the,roof,was,mostly,there,so,they’d,be,dry,if,it,rained,again,but,he,didn’t,think,they,would,ever,get,warm,here
you,could,feel,the,cold,seeping,up,through,the,slate,floor
bran,did,not,like,the,shadows,either,or,the,huge,brick,ovens,that,surrounded,them,like,open,mouths,or,the,rusted,meat,hooks,or,the,scars,and,stains,he,saw,in,the,butcher’s,block,along,one,wall
that,was,where,the,rat,cook,chopped,the,prince,to,pieces,he,knew,and,he,baked,the,pie,in,one,of,these,ovens
the,well,was,the,thing,he,liked,the,least,though
it,was,a,good,twelve,feet,across,all,stone,with,steps,built,into,its,side,circling,down,and,down,into,darkness
the,walls,were,damp,and,covered,with,niter,but,none,of,them,could,see,the,water,at,the,bottom,not,even,meera,with,her,sharp,hunter’s,eyes
maybe,it,doesn’t,have,a,bottom,bran,said,uncertainly
hodor,peered,over,the,knee-high,lip,of,the,well,and,said,hodor
the,word,echoed,down,the,well,hodorhodorhodorhodor,fainter,and,fainter,hodorhodorhodorhodor,until,it,was,less,than,a,whisper
hodor,looked,startled
then,he,laughed,and,bent,to,scoop,a,broken,piece,of,slate,off,the,floor
hodor,don’t
said,bran,but,too,late
hodor,tossed,the,slate,over,the,edge
you,shouldn’t,have,done,that
you,don’t,know,what’s,down,there
you,might,have,hurt,something,or
or,woken,something,up
hodor,looked,at,him,innocently
hodor
far,far,far,below,they,heard,the,sound,as,the,stone,found,water
it,wasn’t,a,splash,not,truly
it,was,more,a,gulp,as,if,whatever,was,below,had,opened,a,quivering,gelid,mouth,to,swallow,hodor’s,stone
faint,echoes,traveled,up,the,well,and,for,a,moment,bran,thought,he,heard,something,moving,thrashing,about,in,the,water
maybe,we,shouldn’t,stay,here,he,said,uneasily
by,the,well
asked,meera
or,in,the,nightfort
yes,said,bran
she,laughed,and,sent,hodor,out,to,gather,wood
summer,went,too
it,was,almost,dark,by,then,and,the,direwolf,wanted,to,hunt
hodor,returned,alone,with,both,arms,full,of,deadwood,and,broken,branches
jojen,reed,took,his,flint,and,knife,and,set,about,lighting,a,fire,while,meera,boned,the,fish,she’d,caught,at,the,last,stream,they’d,crossed
bran,wondered,how,many,years,had,passed,since,there,had,last,been,a,supper,cooked,in,the,kitchens,of,the,nightfort
he,wondered,who,had,cooked,it,too,though,maybe,it,was,better,not,to,know
when,the,flames,were,blazing,nicely,meera,put,the,fish,on
at,least,it’s,not,a,meat,pie
the,rat,cook,had,cooked,the,son,of,the,andal,king,in,a,big,pie,with,onions,carrots,mushrooms,lots,of,pepper,and,salt,a,rasher,of,bacon,and,a,dark,red,dornish,wine
then,he,served,him,to,his,father,who,praised,the,taste,and,had,a,second,slice
afterward,the,gods,transformed,the,cook,into,a,monstrous,white,rat,who,could,only,eat,his,own,young
he,had,roamed,the,nightfort,ever,since,devouring,his,children,but,still,his,hunger,was,not,sated
it,was,not,for,murder,that,the,gods,cursed,him,old,nan,said,nor,for,serving,the,andal,king,his,son,in,a,pie
a,man,has,a,right,to,vengeance
but,he,slew,a,guest,beneath,his,roof,and,that,the,gods,cannot,forgive
we,should,sleep,jojen,said,solemnly,after,they,were,full
the,fire,was,burning,low
he,stirred,it,with,a,stick
perhaps,i’ll,have,another,green,dream,to,show,us,the,way
hodor,was,already,curled,up,and,snoring,lightly
from,time,to,time,he,thrashed,beneath,his,cloak,and,whimpered,something,that,might,have,been,hodor
bran,wriggled,closer,to,the,fire
the,warmth,felt,good,and,the,soft,crackling,of,flames,soothed,him,but,sleep,would,not,come
outside,the,wind,was,sending,armies,of,dead,leaves,marching,across,the,courtyards,to,scratch,faintly,at,the,doors,and,windows
the,sounds,made,him,think,of,old,nan’s,stories
he,could,almost,hear,the,ghostly,sentinels,calling,to,each,other,atop,the,wall,and,winding,their,ghostly,warhorns
pale,moonlight,slanted,down,through,the,hole,in,the,dome,painting,the,branches,of,the,weirwood,as,they,strained,up,toward,the,roof
it,looked,as,if,the,tree,was,trying,to,catch,the,moon,and,drag,it,down,into,the,well
old,gods,bran,prayed,if,you,hear,me,don’t,send,a,dream,tonight
or,if,you,do,make,it,a,good,dream
the,gods,made,no,answer
bran,made,himself,close,his,eyes
maybe,he,even,slept,some,or,maybe,he,was,just,drowsing,floating,the,way,you,do,when,you,are,half,awake,and,half,asleep,trying,not,to,think,about,mad,axe,or,the,rat,cook,or,the,thing,that,came,in,the,night
then,he,heard,the,noise
his,eyes,opened
what,was,that
he,held,his,breath
did,i,dream,it
was,i,having,a,stupid,nightmare
he,didn’t,want,to,wake,meera,and,jojen,for,a,bad,dream,but
there
a,soft,scuffling,sound,far,off
leaves,it’s,leaves,rattling,off,the,walls,outside,and,rustling,together
or,the,wind,it,could,be,the,wind
the,sound,wasn’t,coming,from,outside,though
bran,felt,the,hairs,on,his,arm,start,to,rise
the,sound’s,inside,it’s,in,here,with,us,and,it’s,getting,louder
he,pushed,himself,up,onto,an,elbow,listening
there,was,wind,and,blowing,leaves,as,well,but,this,was,something,else
footsteps
someone,was,coming,this,way
something,was,coming,this,way
it,wasn’t,the,sentinels,he,knew
the,sentinels,never,left,the,wall
but,there,might,be,other,ghosts,in,the,nightfort,ones,even,more,terrible
he,remembered,what,old,nan,had,said,of,mad,axe,how,he,took,his,boots,off,and,prowled,the,castle,halls,barefoot,in,the,dark,with,never,a,sound,to,tell,you,where,he,was,except,for,the,drops,of,blood,that,fell,from,his,axe,and,his,elbows,and,the,end,of,his,wet,red,beard
or,maybe,it,wasn’t,mad,axe,at,all,maybe,it,was,the,thing,that,came,in,the,night
the,’prentice,boys,all,saw,it,old,nan,said,but,afterward,when,they,told,their,lord,commander,every,description,had,been,different
and,three,died,within,the,year,and,the,fourth,went,mad,and,a,hundred,years,later,when,the,thing,had,come,again,the,’prentice,boys,were,seen,shambling,along,behind,it,all,in,chains
that,was,only,a,story,though
he,was,just,scaring,himself
there,was,no,thing,that,comes,in,the,night,maester,luwin,had,said,so
if,there,had,ever,been,such,a,thing,it,was,gone,from,the,world,now,like,giants,and,dragons
it’s,nothing,bran,thought
but,the,sounds,were,louder,now
it’s,coming,from,the,well,he,realized
that,made,him,even,more,afraid
something,was,coming,up,from,under,the,ground,coming,up,out,of,the,dark
hodor,woke,it,up
he,woke,it,up,with,that,stupid,piece,of,slate,and,now,it’s,coming
it,was,hard,to,hear,over,hodor’s,snores,and,the,thumping,of,his,own,heart
was,that,the,sound,blood,made,dripping,from,an,axe
or,was,it,the,faint,far-off,rattling,of,ghostly,chains
bran,listened,harder
footsteps
it,was,definitely,footsteps,each,one,a,little,louder,than,the,one,before
he,couldn’t,tell,how,many,though
the,well,made,the,sounds,echo
he,didn’t,hear,any,dripping,or,chains,either,but,there,was,something,else
a,high,thin,whimpering,sound,like,someone,in,pain,and,heavy,muffled,breathing
but,the,footsteps,were,loudest
the,footsteps,were,coming,closer
bran,was,too,frightened,to,shout
the,fire,had,burned,down,to,a,few,faint,embers,and,his,friends,were,all,asleep
he,almost,slipped,his,skin,and,reached,out,for,his,wolf,but,summer,might,be,miles,away
he,couldn’t,leave,his,friends,helpless,in,the,dark,to,face,whatever,was,coming,up,out,of,the,well
i,told,them,not,to,come,here,he,thought,miserably
i,told,them,there,were,ghosts
i,told,them,that,we,should,go,to,castle,black
the,footfalls,sounded,heavy,to,bran,slow,ponderous,scraping,against,the,stone
it,must,be,huge
mad,axe,had,been,a,big,man,in,old,nan’s,story,and,the,thing,that,came,in,the,night,had,been,monstrous
back,in,winterfell,sansa,had,told,him,that,the,demons,of,the,dark,couldn’t,touch,him,if,he,hid,beneath,his,blanket
he,almost,did,that,now,before,he,remembered,that,he,was,a,prince,and,almost,a,man,grown
bran,wriggled,across,the,floor,dragging,his,dead,legs,behind,him,until,he,could,reach,out,and,touch,meera,on,the,foot
she,woke,at,once
he,had,never,known,anyone,to,wake,as,quick,as,meera,reed,or,to,be,so,alert,so,fast
bran,pressed,a,finger,to,his,mouth,so,she’d,know,not,to,speak
she,heard,the,sound,at,once,he,could,see,that,on,her,face,the,echoing,footfalls,the,faint,whimpering,the,heavy,breathing
meera,rose,to,her,feet,without,a,word,and,reclaimed,her,weapons
with,her,three-pronged,frog,spear,in,her,right,hand,and,the,folds,of,her,net,dangling,from,her,left,she,slipped,barefoot,toward,the,well
jojen,dozed,on,oblivious,while,hodor,muttered,and,thrashed,in,restless,sleep
she,kept,to,the,shadows,as,she,moved,stepped,around,the,shaft,of,moonlight,as,quiet,as,a,cat
bran,was,watching,her,all,the,while,and,even,he,could,barely,see,the,faint,sheen,of,her,spear
i,can’t,let,her,fight,the,thing,alone,he,thought
summer,was,far,away,but

he,slipped,his,skin,and,reached,for,hodor
it,was,not,like,sliding,into,summer
that,was,so,easy,now,that,bran,hardly,thought,about,it
this,was,harder,like,trying,to,pull,a,left,boot,on,your,right,foot
it,fit,all,wrong,and,the,boot,was,scared,too,the,boot,didn’t,know,what,was,happening,the,boot,was,pushing,the,foot,away
he,tasted,vomit,in,the,back,of,hodor’s,throat,and,that,was,almost,enough,to,make,him,flee
instead,he,squirmed,and,shoved,sat,up,gathered,his,legs,under,him,his,huge,strong,legs,and,rose
i’m,standing
he,took,a,step
i’m,walking
it,was,such,a,strange,feeling,that,he,almost,fell
he,could,see,himself,on,the,cold,stone,floor,a,little,broken,thing,but,he,wasn’t,broken,now
he,grabbed,hodor’s,longsword
the,breathing,was,as,loud,as,a,blacksmith’s,bellows
from,the,well,came,a,wail,a,piercing,creech,that,went,through,him,like,a,knife
a,huge,black,shape,heaved,itself,up,into,the,darkness,and,lurched,toward,the,moonlight,and,the,fear,rose,up,in,bran,so,thick,that,before,he,could,even,think,of,drawing,hodor’s,sword,the,way,he’d,meant,to,he,found,himself,back,on,the,floor,again,with,hodor,roaring,hodor,hodor,hodor,the,way,he,had,in,the,lake,tower,whenever,the,lightning,flashed
but,the,thing,that,came,in,the,night,was,screaming,too,and,thrashing,wildly,in,the,folds,of,meera’s,net
bran,saw,her,spear,dart,out,of,the,darkness,to,snap,at,it,and,the,thing,staggered,and,fell,struggling,with,the,net

it,was,jojen,who,fed,the,sticks,to,the,fire,and,blew,on,them,until,the,flames,leapt,up,crackling
then,there,was,light,and,bran,saw,the,pale,thin-faced,girl,by,the,lip,of,the,well,all,bundled,up,in,furs,and,skins,beneath,an,enormous,black,cloak,trying,to,shush,the,screaming,baby,in,her,arms

the,lance,is,too,long,ser,jorah,said
all,belwas,needs,do,is,avoid,the,point
instead,of,trying,to,spit,him,so,prettily,the,fool,should,ride,right,over,him
oznak,zo,pahl,charged,a,third,time,and,now,dany,could,see,plainly,that,he,was,riding,past,belwas,the,way,a,westerosi,knight,might,ride,at,an,opponent,in,a,tilt,rather,than,at,him,like,a,dothraki,riding,down,a,foe
the,flat,level,ground,allowed,the,charger,to,get,up,a,good,speed,but,it,also,made,it,easy,for,the,eunuch,to,dodge,the,cumbersome,fourteen-foot,lance
meereen’s,pink-and-white,hero,tried,to,anticipate,this,time,and,swung,his,lance,sideways,at,the,last,second,to,catch,strong,belwas,when,he,dodged
but,the,eunuch,had,anticipated,too,and,this,time,he,dropped,down,instead,of,spinning,sideways
the,lance,passed,harmlessly,over,his,head
and,suddenly,belwas,was,rolling,and,bringing,the,razor-sharp,arakh,around,in,a,silver,arc
they,heard,the,charger,scream,as,the,blade,bit,into,his,legs,and,then,the,horse,was,falling,the,hero,tumbling,from,the,saddle
a,sudden,silence,swept,along,the,brick,parapets,of,meereen
now,it,was,dany’s,people,who,were,screaming,and,cheering
oznak,leapt,clear,of,his,horse,and,managed,to,draw,his,sword,before,strong,belwas,was,on,him

she,thought,of,daario
if,ever,there,was,a,man,who,could,rape,a,woman,with,his,eyes
to,be,sure,she,was,just,as,guilty
dany,found,herself,stealing,looks,at,the,tyroshi,when,her,captains,came,to,council,and,sometimes,at,night,she,remembered,the,way,his,gold,tooth,glittered,when,he,smiled
that,and,his,eyes
his,bright,blue,eyes
on,the,road,from,yunkai,daario,had,brought,her,a,flower,or,a,sprig,of,some,plant,every,evening,when,he,made,his,report
to,help,her,learn,the,land,he,said
waspwillow,dusky,roses,wild,mint,lady’s,lace,daggerleaf,broom,prickly,ben,harpy’s,gold
he,tried,to,spare,me,the,sight,of,the,dead,children,too
he,should,not,have,done,that,but,he,meant,it,kindly
and,daario,naharis,made,her,laugh,which,ser,jorah,never,did
dany,tried,to,imagine,what,it,would,be,like,if,she,allowed,daario,to,kiss,her,the,way,jorah,had,kissed,her,on,the,ship
the,thought,was,exciting,and,disturbing,both,at,once
it,is,too,great,a,risk
the,tyroshi,sellsword,was,not,a,good,man,no,one,needed,to,tell,her,that
under,the,smiles,and,the,jests,he,was,dangerous,even,cruel
sallor,and,prendahl,had,woken,one,morning,as,his,partners,that,very,night,he’d,given,her,their,heads
khal,drogo,could,be,cruel,as,well,and,there,was,never,a,man,more,dangerous
she,had,come,to,love,him,all,the,same
could,i,love,daario
what,would,it,mean,if,i,took,him,into,my,bed
would,that,make,him,one,of,the,heads,of,the,dragon
ser,jorah,would,be,angry,she,knew,but,he,was,the,one,who’d,said,she,had,to,take,two,husbands
perhaps,i,should,marry,them,both,and,be,done,with,it
but,these,were,foolish,thoughts
she,had,a,city,to,take,and,dreaming,of,kisses,and,some,sellsword’s,bright,blue,eyes,would,not,help,her,breach,the,walls,of,meereen
i,am,the,blood,of,the,dragon,dany,reminded,herself

the,grove,of,burnt,olive,trees,in,which,she’d,raised,her,pavilion,stood,beside,the,sea,between,the,dothraki,camp,and,that,of,the,unsullied
when,the,horses,had,been,saddled,dany,and,her,companions,set,out,along,the,shoreline,away,from,the,city
even,so,she,could,feel,meereen,at,her,back,mocking,her
when,she,looked,over,one,shoulder,there,it,stood,the,afternoon,sun,blazing,off,the,bronze,harpy,atop,the,great,pyramid
inside,meereen,the,slavers,would,soon,be,reclining,in,their,fringed,tokars,to,feast,on,lamb,and,olives,unborn,puppies,honeyed,dormice,and,other,such,delicacies,whilst,outside,her,children,went,hungry
a,sudden,wild,anger,filled,her
i,will,bring,you,down,she,swore
as,they,rode,past,the,stakes,and,pits,that,surrounded,the,eunuch,encampment,dany,could,hear,grey,worm,and,his,sergeants,running,one,company,through,a,series,of,drills,with,shield,shortsword,and,heavy,spear
another,company,was,bathing,in,the,sea,clad,only,in,white,linen,breechclouts
the,eunuchs,were,very,clean,she,had,noticed
some,of,her,sellswords,smelled,as,if,they,had,not,washed,or,changed,their,clothes,since,her,father,lost,the,iron,throne,but,the,unsullied,bathed,each,evening,even,if,they’d,marched,all,day
when,no,water,was,available,they,cleansed,themselves,with,sand,the,dothraki,way
the,eunuchs,knelt,as,she,passed,raising,clenched,fists,to,their,breasts
dany,returned,the,salute
the,tide,was,coming,in,and,the,surf,foamed,about,the,feet,of,her,silver
she,could,see,her,ships,standing,out,to,sea
balerion,floated,nearest,the,great,cog,once,known,as,saduleon,her,sails,furled
further,out,were,the,galleys,meraxes,and,vhagar,formerly,joso’s,prank,and,summer,sun
they,were,magister,illyrio’s,ships,in,truth,not,hers,at,all,and,yet,she,had,given,them,new,names,with,hardly,a,thought
dragon,names,and,more,in,old,valyria,before,the,doom,balerion,meraxes,and,vhagar,had,been,gods
south,of,the,ordered,realm,of,stakes,pits,drills,and,bathing,eunuchs,lay,the,encampments,of,her,freedmen,a,far,noisier,and,more,chaotic,place
dany,had,armed,the,former,slaves,as,best,she,could,with,weapons,from,astapor,and,yunkai,and,ser,jorah,had,organized,the,fighting,men,into,four,strong,companies,yet,she,saw,no,one,drilling,here
they,passed,a,driftwood,fire,where,a,hundred,people,had,gathered,to,roast,the,carcass,of,a,horse
she,could,smell,the,meat,and,hear,the,fat,sizzling,as,the,spit,boys,turned,but,the,sight,only,made,her,frown
children,ran,behind,their,horses,skipping,and,laughing
instead,of,salutes,voices,called,to,her,on,every,side,in,a,babble,of,tongues
some,of,the,freedmen,greeted,her,as,mother,while,others,begged,for,boons,or,favors
some,prayed,for,strange,gods,to,bless,her,and,some,asked,her,to,bless,them,instead
she,smiled,at,them,turning,right,and,left,touching,their,hands,when,they,raised,them,letting,those,who,knelt,reach,up,to,touch,her,stirrup,or,her,leg
many,of,the,freedmen,believed,there,was,good,fortune,in,her,touch
if,it,helps,give,them,courage,let,them,touch,me,she,thought
there,are,hard,trials,yet,ahead
dany,had,stopped,to,speak,to,a,pregnant,woman,who,wanted,the,mother,of,dragons,to,name,her,baby,when,someone,reached,up,and,grabbed,her,left,wrist
turning,she,glimpsed,a,tall,ragged,man,with,a,shaved,head,and,a,sunburnt,face
not,so,hard,she,started,to,say,but,before,she,could,finish,he’d,yanked,her,bodily,from,the,saddle
the,ground,came,up,and,knocked,the,breath,from,her,as,her,silver,whinnied,and,backed,away
stunned,dany,rolled,to,her,side,and,pushed,herself,onto,one,elbow

and,then,she,saw,the,sword
there’s,the,treacherous,sow,he,said
i,knew,you’d,come,to,get,your,feet,kissed,one,day
his,head,was,bald,as,a,melon,his,nose,red,and,peeling,but,she,knew,that,voice,and,those,pale,green,eyes
i’m,going,to,start,by,cutting,off,your,teats
dany,was,dimly,aware,of,missandei,shouting,for,help
a,freedman,edged,forward,but,only,a,step
one,quick,slash,and,he,was,on,his,knees,blood,running,down,his,face

who’s,next
i,am
arstan,whitebeard,leapt,from,his,horse,and,stood,over,her,the,salt,wind,riffling,through,his,snowy,hair,both,hands,on,his,tall,hardwood,staff

the,titan’s,bastard,staggered,back,into,the,surf,spitting,blood,and,broken,teeth,from,the,ruin,of,his,mouth

the,old,man,jerked,back,cat-quick

the,moves,were,so,fast,she,could,hardly,follow
missandei,was,pulling,dany,to,her,feet,when,she,heard,a,crack
she,thought,arstan’s,staff,had,snapped,until,she,saw,the,jagged,bone,jutting,from,mero’s,calf
as,he,fell,the,titan’s,bastard,twisted,and,lunged,sending,his,point,straight,at,the,old,man’s,chest
whitebeard,swept,the,blade,aside,almost,contemptuously,and,smashed,the,other,end,of,his,staff,against,the,big,man’s,temple
mero,went,sprawling,blood,bubbling,from,his,mouth,as,the,waves,washed,over,him
a,moment,later,the,freedmen,washed,over,him,too,knives,and,stones,and,angry,fists,rising,and,falling,in,a,frenzy
dany,turned,away,sickened
she,was,more,frightened,now,than,when,it,had,been,happening
he,would,have,killed,me
your,grace

i,am,an,old,man,and,shamed
he,should,never,have,gotten,close,enough,to,seize,you
i,was,lax
i,did,not,know,him,without,his,beard,and,hair
no,more,than,i,did
dany,took,a,deep,breath,to,stop,her,shaking
enemies,everywhere
take,me,back,to,my,tent

by,the,time,mormont,arrived,she,was,huddled,in,her,lion,pelt,drinking,a,cup,of,spice,wine

and,the,meereenese,have,a,dozen,fire,hulks,tied,up,beneath,the,ramparts,she,cut,him,off
you,might,have,warned,me,that,the,titan’s,bastard,had,escaped

i,saw,no,need,to,frighten,you,your,grace
i,have,offered,a,reward,for,his,head,pay,it,to,whitebeard
mero,has,been,with,us,all,the,way,from,yunkai
he,shaved,his,beard,off,and,lost,himself,amongst,the,freedmen,waiting,for,a,chance,for,vengeance

ser,jorah,gave,the,old,man,a,long,look
a,squire,with,a,stick,slew,mero,of,braavos,is,that,the,way,of,it
a,stick,dany,confirmed,but,no,longer,a,squire
ser,jorah,it’s,my,wish,that,arstan,be,knighted
no
the,loud,refusal,was,surprise,enough
stranger,still,it,came,from,both,men,at,once
ser,jorah,drew,his,sword
the,titan’s,bastard,was,a,nasty,piece,of,work
and,good,at,killing
who,are,you,old,man
a,better,knight,than,you,ser,arstan,said,coldly
knight
dany,was,confused

now
he,bowed,his,head
at,qarth,when,you,asked,my,name,i,said,i,was,called,arstan
that,much,was,true
many,men,had,called,me,by,that,name,while,belwas,and,i,were,making,our,way,east,to,find,you
but,it,is,not,my,true,name
she,was,more,confused,than,angry
he,has,played,me,false,just,as,jorah,warned,me,yet,he,saved,my,life,just,now

but,when,he,took,the,cloak,that,the,white,bull,had,draped,about,my,shoulders,and,sent,men,to,kill,me,that,selfsame,day,it,was,as,though,he’d,ripped,a,caul,off,my,eyes
that,was,when,i,knew,i,must,find,my,true,king,and,die,in,his,service,i,can,grant,that,wish,ser,jorah,said,darkly

he,did,not,wait,for,an,answer
your,grace,i,am,sorry,i,misled,you
it,was,the,only,way,to,keep,the,lannisters,from,learning,that,i,had,joined,you
you,are,watched,as,your,brother,was
lord,varys,reported,every,move,viserys,made,for,years
whilst,i,sat,on,the,small,council,i,heard,a,hundred,such,reports
and,since,the,day,you,wed,khal,drogo,there,has,been,an,informer,by,your,side,selling,your,secrets,trading,whispers,to,the,spider,for,gold,and,promises

there’s,no,informer

how,could,you
what,did,the,usurper,promise,you

drogon,beat,the,air,with,black,wings,and,rhaegal,twisted,his,head,back,and,belched,flame
i,should,say,the,word,and,burn,the,two,of,them

what,does,roast,liar,smell,like
as,foul,as,brown,ben’s,sewers
go
ser,barristan,rose,stiff,and,slow
for,the,first,time,he,looked,his,age
where,shall,we,go,your,grace
to,hell,to,serve,king,robert
dany,felt,hot,tears,on,her,cheeks

the,others,can,have,you,both
go,go,away,forever,both,of,you,the,next,time,i,see,your,faces,i’ll,have,your,traitors’,heads,off
she,could,not,say,the,words,though
they,betrayed,me
but,they,saved,me
but,they,lied
you,go
my,bear,my,fierce,strong,bear,what,will,i,do,without,him
and,the,old,man,my,brother’s,friend
you,go
go
where
and,then,she,knew
tyrion,tyrion,dressed,himself,in,darkness,listening,to,his,wife’s,soft,breathing,from,the,bed,they,shared
she,dreams,he,thought,when,sansa,murmured,something,softly,a,name,perhaps,though,it,was,too,faint,to,say,and,turned,onto,her,side
as,man,and,wife,they,shared,a,marriage,bed,but,that,was,all
even,her,tears,she,hoards,to,herself
he,had,expected,anguish,and,anger,when,he,told,her,of,her,brother’s,death,but,sansa’s,face,had,remained,so,still,that,for,a,moment,he,feared,she,had,not,understood
it,was,only,later,with,a,heavy,oaken,door,between,them,that,he,heard,her,sobbing
tyrion,had,considered,going,to,her,then,to,offer,what,comfort,he,could
no,he,had,to,remind,himself,she,will,not,look,for,solace,from,a,lannister
the,most,he,could,do,was,to,shield,her,from,the,uglier,details,of,the,red,wedding,as,they,came,down,from,the,twins
sansa,did,not,need,to,hear,how,her,brother’s,body,had,been,hacked,and,mutilated,he,decided,nor,how,her,mother’s,corpse,had,been,dumped,naked,into,the,green,fork,in,a,savage,mockery,of,house,tully’s,funeral,customs
the,last,thing,the,girl,needed,was,more,fodder,for,her,nightmares
it,was,not,enough,though
he,had,wrapped,his,cloak,around,her,shoulders,and,sworn,to,protect,her,but,that,was,as,cruel,a,jape,as,the,crown,the,freys,had,placed,atop,the,head,of,robb,stark’s,direwolf,after,they’d,sewn,it,onto,his,headless,corpse
sansa,knew,that,as,well
the,way,she,looked,at,him,her,stiffness,when,she,climbed,into,their,bed
when,he,was,with,her,never,for,an,instant,could,he,forget,who,he,was,or,what,he,was
no,more,than,she,did
she,still,went,nightly,to,the,godswood,to,pray,and,tyrion,wondered,if,she,were,praying,for,his,death
she,had,lost,her,home,her,place,in,the,world,and,everyone,she,had,ever,loved,or,trusted
winter,is,coming,warned,the,stark,words,and,truly,it,had,come,for,them,with,a,vengeance
but,it,is,high,summer,for,house,lannister
so,why,am,i,so,bloody,cold
he,pulled,on,his,boots,fastened,his,cloak,with,a,lion’s,head,brooch,and,slipped,out,into,the,torchlit,hall
there,was,this,much,to,be,said,for,his,marriage,it,had,allowed,him,to,escape,maegor’s,holdfast
now,that,he,had,a,wife,and,household,his,lord,father,had,agreed,that,more,suitable,accommodations,were,required,and,lord,gyles,had,found,himself,abruptly,dispossessed,of,his,spacious,apartments,atop,the,kitchen,keep
and,splendid,apartments,they,were,too,with,a,large,bedchamber,and,adequate,solar,a,bath,and,dressing,room,for,his,wife,and,small,adjoining,chambers,for,pod,and,sansa’s,maids
even,bronn’s,cell,by,the,stair,had,a,window,of,sorts
well,more,an,arrow,slit,but,it,lets,in,light
the,castle’s,main,kitchen,was,just,across,the,courtyard,true,but,tyrion,found,those,sounds,and,smells,infinitely,preferable,to,sharing,maegor’s,with,his,sister
the,less,he,had,to,see,of,cersei,the,happier,he,was,like,to,be
tyrion,could,hear,brella’s,snoring,as,he,passed,her,cell
shae,complained,of,that,but,it,seemed,a,small,enough,price,to,pay
varys,had,suggested,the,woman,to,him,in,former,days,she,had,run,lord,renly’s,household,in,the,city,which,had,given,her,a,deal,of,practice,at,being,blind,deaf,and,mute
lighting,a,taper,he,made,his,way,back,to,the,servants’,steps,and,descended
the,floors,below,his,own,were,still,and,he,heard,no,footsteps,but,his,own
down,he,went,to,the,ground,floor,and,beyond,to,emerge,in,a,gloomy,cellar,with,a,vaulted,stone,ceiling
much,of,the,castle,was,connected,underground,and,the,kitchen,keep,was,no,exception
tyrion,waddled,along,a,long,dark,passageway,until,he,found,the,door,he,wanted,and,pushed,through
within,the,dragon,skulls,were,waiting,and,so,was,shae
i,thought,m’lord,had,forgotten,me
her,dress,was,draped,over,a,black,tooth,near,as,tall,as,she,was,and,she,stood,within,the,dragon’s,jaws,nude
balerion,he,thought
or,was,it,vhagar
one,dragon,skull,looked,much,like,another
just,the,sight,of,her,made,him,hard
come,out,of,there
i,won’t
she,smiled,her,wickedest,smile
m’lord,will,pluck,me,from,the,dragon’s,jaws,i,know
but,when,he,waddled,closer,she,leaned,forward,and,blew,out,the,taper
shae
he,reached,but,she,spun,and,slipped,free
you,have,to,catch,me
her,voice,came,from,his,left
m’lord,must,have,played,monsters,and,maidens,when,he,was,little
are,you,calling,me,a,monster
no,more,than,i’m,a,maiden
she,was,behind,him,her,steps,soft,against,the,floor
you,need,to,catch,me,all,the,same
he,did,finally,but,only,because,she,let,herself,be,caught
by,the,time,she,slipped,into,his,arms,he,was,flushed,and,out,of,breath,from,stumbling,into,dragon,skulls
all,that,was,forgotten,in,an,instant,when,he,felt,her,small,breasts,pressed,against,his,face,in,the,dark,her,stiff,little,nipples,brushing,lightly,over,his,lips,and,the,scar,where,his,nose,had,been
tyrion,pulled,her,down,onto,the,floor
my,giant,she,breathed,as,he,entered,her
my,giant’s,come,to,save,me
after,as,they,lay,entwined,amongst,the,dragon,skulls,he,rested,his,head,against,her,inhaling,the,smooth,clean,smell,of,her,hair
we,should,go,back,he,said,reluctantly
it,must,be,near,dawn
sansa,will,be,waking
you,should,give,her,dreamwine,shae,said,like,lady,tanda,does,with,lollys
a,cup,before,she,goes,to,sleep,and,we,could,fuck,in,bed,beside,her,without,her,waking
she,giggled
maybe,we,should,some,night
would,m’lord,like,that
her,hand,found,his,shoulder,and,began,to,knead,the,muscles,there
your,neck,is,hard,as,stone
what,troubles,you
tyrion,could,not,see,his,fingers,in,front,of,his,face,but,he,ticked,his,woes,off,on,them,all,the,same
my,wife
my,sister
my,nephew
my,father
the,tyrells
he,had,to,move,to,his,other,hand

the,red,viper,of,dorne
he,had,come,to,his,last,finger
the,face,that,stares,back,out,of,the,water,when,i,wash,shae,kissed,his,maimed,scarred,nose
a,brave,face
a,kind,and,good,face
i,wish,i,could,see,it,now
all,the,sweet,innocence,of,the,world,was,in,her,voice
innocence
fool,she’s,a,whore,all,she,knows,of,men,is,the,bit,between,their,legs
fool,fool
better,you,than,me
tyrion,sat
we,have,a,long,day,before,us,both,of,us
you,shouldn’t,have,blown,out,that,taper
how,are,we,to,find,our,clothing
she,laughed
maybe,we’ll,have,to,go,naked
and,if,we’re,seen,my,lord,father,will,hang,you
hiring,shae,as,one,of,sansa’s,maids,had,given,him,an,excuse,to,be,seen,talking,with,her,but,tyrion,did,not,delude,himself,that,they,were,safe
varys,had,warned,him
i,gave,shae,a,false,history,but,it,was,meant,for,lollys,and,lady,tanda
your,sister,is,of,a,more,suspicious,mind
if,she,should,ask,me,what,i,know
you,will,tell,her,some,clever,lie
no
i,will,tell,her,that,the,girl,is,a,common,camp,follower,that,you,acquired,before,the,battle,on,the,green,fork,and,brought,to,king’s,landing,against,your,lord,father’s,express,command
i,will,not,lie,to,the,queen
you,have,lied,to,her,before
shall,i,tell,her,that
the,eunuch,sighed
that,cuts,more,deeply,than,a,knife,my,lord
i,have,served,you,loyally,but,i,must,also,serve,your,sister,when,i,can
how,long,do,you,think,she,would,let,me,live,if,i,were,of,no,further,use,to,her,whatsoever
i,have,no,fierce,sellsword,to,protect,me,no,valiant,brother,to,avenge,me,only,some,little,birds,who,whisper,in,my,ear
with,those,whisperings,i,must,buy,my,life,anew,each,day
pardon,me,if,i,do,not,weep,for,you
i,shall,but,you,must,pardon,me,if,i,do,not,weep,for,shae
i,confess,i,do,not,understand,what,there,is,in,her,to,make,a,clever,man,like,you,act,such,a,fool
you,might,if,you,were,not,a,eunuch
is,that,the,way,of,it
a,man,may,have,wits,or,a,bit,of,meat,between,his,legs,but,not,both
varys,tittered
perhaps,i,should,be,grateful,i,was,cut,then
the,spider,was,right
tyrion,groped,through,the,dragon-haunted,darkness,for,his,smallclothes,feeling,wretched
the,risk,he,was,taking,left,him,tight,as,a,drumhead,and,there,was,guilt,as,well
the,others,can,take,my,guilt,he,thought,as,he,slipped,his,tunic,over,his,head
why,should,i,be,guilty
my,wife,wants,no,part,of,me,and,most,especially,not,the,part,that,seems,to,want,her
perhaps,he,ought,to,tell,her,about,shae
it,was,not,as,though,he,was,the,first,man,ever,to,keep,a,concubine
sansa’s,own,oh-so-honorable,father,had,given,her,a,bastard,brother
for,all,he,knew,his,wife,might,be,thrilled,to,learn,that,he,was,fucking,shae,so,long,as,it,spared,her,his,unwelcome,touch
no,i,dare,not
vows,or,no,his,wife,could,not,be,trusted
she,might,be,maiden,between,the,legs,but,she,was,hardly,innocent,of,betrayal,she,had,once,spilled,her,own,father’s,plans,to,cersei
and,girls,her,age,were,not,known,for,keeping,secrets
the,only,safe,course,was,to,rid,himself,of,shae
i,might,send,her,to,chataya,tyrion,reflected,reluctantly
in,chataya’s,brothel,shae,would,have,all,the,silks,and,gems,she,could,wish,for,and,the,gentlest,highborn,patrons
it,would,be,a,better,life,by,far,than,the,one,she,had,been,living,when,he’d,found,her
or,if,she,was,tired,of,earning,her,bread,on,her,back,he,might,arrange,a,marriage,for,her
bronn,perhaps
the,sellsword,had,never,balked,at,eating,off,his,master’s,plate,and,he,was,a,knight,now,a,better,match,than,she,could,elsewise,hope,for
or,ser,tallad
tyrion,had,noticed,that,one,gazing,wistfully,at,shae,more,than,once
why,not
he’s,tall,strong,not,hard,to,look,upon,every,inch,the,gifted,young,knight
of,course,tallad,knew,shae,only,as,a,pretty,young,lady’s,maid,in,service,at,the,castle
if,he,wed,her,and,then,learned,she,was,a,whore
m’lord,where,are,you
did,the,dragons,eat,you,up
no
here
he,groped,at,a,dragon,skull
i,have,found,a,shoe,but,i,believe,it’s,yours
m’lord,sounds,very,solemn
have,i,displeased,you
no,he,said,too,curtly

she,was,alone,in,the,world,now
her,lord,husband,was,not,beside,her,but,she,was,used,to,that
tyrion,was,a,bad,sleeper,and,often,rose,before,the,dawn
usually,she,found,him,in,the,solar,hunched,beside,a,candle,lost,in,some,old,scroll,or,leatherbound,book
sometimes,the,smell,of,the,morning,bread,from,the,ovens,took,him,to,the,kitchens,and,sometimes,he,would,climb,up,to,the,roof,garden,or,wander,all,alone,down,traitor’s,walk
she,threw,back,the,shutters,and,shivered,as,gooseprickles,rose,along,her,arms
there,were,clouds,massing,in,the,eastern,sky,pierced,by,shafts,of,sunlight
they,look,like,two,huge,castles,afloat,in,the,morning,sky

wispy,banners,swirled,from,atop,their,towers,and,reached,for,the,fast-fading,stars
the,sun,was,coming,up,behind,them,and,she,watched,them,go,from,black,to,grey,to,a,thousand,shades,of,rose,and,gold,and,crimson
soon,the,wind,mushed,them,together,and,there,was,only,one,castle,where,there,had,been,two
she,heard,the,door,open,as,her,maids,brought,the,hot,water,for,her,bath
they,were,both,new,to,her,service,tyrion,said,the,women,who’d,tended,to,her,previously,had,all,been,cersei’s,spies,just,as,sansa,had,always,suspected

sansa,let,shae,pull,her,shift,up,over,her,head,and,climbed,into,the,big,wooden,tub
she,was,tempted,to,ask,for,a,cup,of,wine,to,calm,her,nerves
the,wedding,was,to,be,at,midday,in,the,great,sept,of,baelor,across,the,city
and,come,evenfall,the,feast,would,be,held,in,the,throne,room,a,thousand,guests,and,seventy-seven,courses,with,singers,and,jugglers,and,mummers

it’s,a,new,century,my,lady
the,three,hundredth,year,since,aegon’s,conquest
the,dwarf,took,a,cup,of,red,from,podrick,and,raised,it,high
to,aegon
what,a,fortunate,fellow
two,sisters,two,wives,and,three,big,dragons,what,more,could,a,man,ask,for
he,wiped,his,mouth,with,the,back,of,his,hand
the,imp’s,clothing,was,soiled,and,unkempt,sansa,noticed,it,looked,as,though,he’d,slept,in,it
will,you,be,changing,into,fresh,garb,my,lord
your,new,doublet,is,very,handsome
the,doublet,is,handsome,yes

i,would,not,want,to,shame,my,lady,wife
when,the,imp,returned,a,short,time,later,he,was,presentable,enough,and,even,a,little,taller
podrick,payne,had,changed,as,well,and,looked,almost,a,proper,squire,for,once,although,a,rather,large,red,pimple,in,the,fold,beside,his,nose,spoiled,the,effect,of,his,splendid,purple,white,and,gold,raiment
he,is,such,a,timid,boy
sansa,had,been,wary,of,tyrion’s,squire,at,first,he,was,a,payne,cousin,to,ser,ilyn,payne,who,had,taken,her,father’s,head,off
however,she’d,soon,come,to,realize,that,pod,was,as,frightened,of,her,as,she,was,of,his,cousin
whenever,she,spoke,to,him,he,turned,the,most,alarming,shade,of,red
are,purple,gold,and,white,the,colors,of,house,payne,podrick
she,asked,him,politely
no

with,gold,coins
in,the,checks

both
he,studied,her,feet
there’s,a,tale,behind,those,coins,said,tyrion
no,doubt,pod,will,confide,it,to,your,toes,one,day
just,now,we,are,expected,at,the,queen’s,ballroom,however
shall,we
sansa,was,tempted,to,beg,off
i,could,tell,him,that,my,tummy,was,upset,or,that,my,moon’s,blood,had,come
she,wanted,nothing,more,than,to,crawl,back,in,bed,and,pull,the,drapes
i,must,be,brave,like,robb,she,told,herself,as,she,took,her,lord,husband,stiffly,by,the,arm
in,the,queen’s,ballroom,they,broke,their,fast,on,honeycakes,baked,with,blackberries,and,nuts,gammon,steaks,bacon,fingerfish,crisped,in,breadcrumbs,autumn,pears,and,a,dornish,dish,of,onions,cheese,and,chopped,eggs,cooked,up,with,fiery,peppers
nothing,like,a,hearty,breakfast,to,whet,one’s,appetite,for,the,seventy-seven-course,feast,to,follow,tyrion,commented,as,their,plates,were,filled
there,were,flagons,of,milk,and,flagons,of,mead,and,flagons,of,a,light,sweet,golden,wine,to,wash,it,down
musicians,strolled,among,the,tables,piping,and,fluting,and,fiddling,while,ser,dontos,galloped,about,on,his,broomstick,horse,and,moon,boy,made,farting,sounds,with,his,cheeks,and,sang,rude,songs,about,the,guests
tyrion,scarce,touched,his,food,sansa,noticed,though,he,drank,several,cups,of,the,wine
for,herself,she,tried,a,little,of,the,dornish,eggs,but,the,peppers,burned,her,mouth
otherwise,she,only,nibbled,at,the,fruit,and,fish,and,honeycakes
every,time,joffrey,looked,at,her,her,tummy,got,so,fluttery,that,she,felt,as,though,she’d,swallowed,a,bat
when,the,food,had,been,cleared,away,the,queen,solemnly,presented,joff,with,the,wife’s,cloak,that,he,would,drape,over,margaery’s,shoulders
it,is,the,cloak,i,donned,when,robert,took,me,for,his,queen,the,same,cloak,my,mother,lady,joanna,wore,when,wed,to,my,lord,father
sansa,thought,it,looked,threadbare,if,truth,be,told,but,perhaps,because,it,was,so,used
then,it,was,time,for,gifts
it,was,traditional,in,the,reach,to,give,presents,to,bride,and,groom,on,the,morning,of,their,wedding,on,the,morrow,they,would,receive,more,presents,as,a,couple,but,today’s,tokens,were,for,their,separate,persons
from,jalabhar,xho,joffrey,received,a,great,bow,of,golden,wood,and,quiver,of,long,arrows,fletched,with,green,and,scarlet,feathers,from,lady,tanda,a,pair,of,supple,riding,boots,from,ser,kevan,a,magnificent,red,leather,jousting,saddle,a,red,gold,brooch,wrought,in,the,shape,of,a,scorpion,from,the,dornishman,prince,oberyn,silver,spurs,from,ser,addam,marbrand,a,red,silk,tourney,pavilion,from,lord,mathis,rowan
lord,paxter,redwyne,brought,forth,a,beautiful,wooden,model,of,the,war,galley,of,two,hundred,oars,being,built,even,now,on,the,arbor
if,it,please,your,grace,she,will,be,called,king,joffrey’s,valor,he,said,and,joff,allowed,that,he,was,very,pleased,indeed
i,will,make,it,my,flagship,when,i,sail,to,dragonstone,to,kill,my,traitor,uncle,stannis,he,said
he,plays,the,gracious,king,today
joffrey,could,be,gallant,when,it,suited,him,sansa,knew,but,it,seemed,to,suit,him,less,and,less
indeed,all,his,courtesy,vanished,at,once,when,tyrion,presented,him,with,their,own,gift,a,huge,old,book,called,lives,of,four,kings,bound,in,leather,and,gorgeously,illuminated
the,king,leafed,through,it,with,no,interest
and,what,is,this,uncle
a,book
sansa,wondered,if,joffrey,moved,those,fat,wormy,lips,of,his,when,he,read
grand,maester,kaeth’s,history,of,the,reigns,of,daeron,the,young,dragon,baelor,the,blessed,aegon,the,unworthy,and,daeron,the,good,her,small,husband,answered
a,book,every,king,should,read,your,grace,said,ser,kevan
my,father,had,no,time,for,books
joffrey,shoved,the,tome,across,the,table
if,you,read,less,uncle,imp,perhaps,lady,sansa,would,have,a,baby,in,her,belly,by,now
he,laughed
and,when,the,king,laughs,the,court,laughs,with,him
don’t,be,sad,sansa,once,i’ve,gotten,queen,margaery,with,child,i’ll,visit,your,bedchamber,and,show,my,little,uncle,how,it’s,done
sansa,reddened
she,glanced,nervously,at,tyrion,afraid,of,what,he,might,say
this,could,turn,as,nasty,as,the,bedding,had,at,their,own,feast
but,for,once,the,dwarf,filled,his,mouth,with,wine,instead,of,words
lord,mace,tyrell,came,forward,to,present,his,gift,a,golden,chalice,three,feet,tall,with,two,ornate,curved,handles,and,seven,faces,glittering,with,gemstones
seven,faces,for,your,grace’s,seven,kingdoms,the,bride’s,father,explained
he,showed,them,how,each,face,bore,the,sigil,of,one,of,the,great,houses,ruby,lion,emerald,rose,onyx,stag,silver,trout,blue,jade,falcon,opal,sun,and,pearl,direwolf
a,splendid,cup,said,joffrey,but,we’ll,need,to,chip,the,wolf,off,and,put,a,squid,in,its,place,i,think
sansa,pretended,that,she,had,not,heard
margaery,and,i,shall,drink,deep,at,the,feast,good,father
joffrey,lifted,the,chalice,above,his,head,for,everyone,to,admire
the,damned,thing’s,as,tall,as,i,am,tyrion,muttered,in,a,low,voice
half,a,chalice,and,joff,will,be,falling,down,drunk
good,she,thought
perhaps,he’ll,break,his,neck
lord,tywin,waited,until,last,to,present,the,king,with,his,own,gift,a,longsword
its,scabbard,was,made,of,cherrywood,gold,and,oiled,red,leather,studded,with,golden,lions’,heads
the,lions,had,ruby,eyes,she,saw
the,ballroom,fell,silent,as,joffrey,unsheathed,the,blade,and,thrust,the,sword,above,his,head
red,and,black,ripples,in,the,steel,shimmered,in,the,morning,light
magnificent,declared,mathis,rowan
a,sword,to,sing,of,sire,said,lord,redwyne
a,king’s,sword,said,ser,kevan,lannister
king,joffrey,looked,as,if,he,wanted,to,kill,someone,right,then,and,there,he,was,so,excited
he,slashed,at,the,air,and,laughed
a,great,sword,must,have,a,great,name,my,lords
what,shall,i,call,it
sansa,remembered,lion’s,tooth,the,sword,arya,had,flung,into,the,trident,and,hearteater,the,one,he’d,made,her,kiss,before,the,battle
she,wondered,if,he’d,want,margaery,to,kiss,this,one
the,guests,were,shouting,out,names,for,the,new,blade
joff,dismissed,a,dozen,before,he,heard,one,he,liked
widow’s,wail
he,cried
yes
it,shall,make,many,a,widow,too
he,slashed,again
and,when,i,face,my,uncle,stannis,it,will,break,his,magic,sword,clean,in,two
joff,tried,a,downcut,forcing,ser,balon,swann,to,take,a,hasty,step,backward

valyrian,steel,is,perilously,sharp
i,remember
joffrey,brought,widow’s,wail,down,in,a,savage,twohanded,slice,onto,the,book,that,tyrion,had,given,him
the,heavy,leather,cover,parted,at,a,stroke
sharp
i,told,you,i,am,no,stranger,to,valyrian,steel
it,took,him,half,a,dozen,further,cuts,to,hack,the,thick,tome,apart,and,the,boy,was,breathless,by,the,time,he,was,done
sansa,could,feel,her,husband,struggling,with,his,fury,as,ser,osmund,kettleblack,shouted,i,pray,you,never,turn,that,wicked,edge,on,me,sire
see,that,you,never,give,me,cause,ser
joffrey,flicked,a,chunk,of,lives,of,four,kings,off,the,table,at,swordpoint,then,slid,widow’s,wail,back,into,its,scabbard
your,grace,ser,garlan,tyrell,said
perhaps,you,did,not,know
in,all,of,westeros,there,were,but,four,copies,of,that,book,illuminated,in,kaeth’s,own,hand
now,there,are,three
joffrey,undid,his,old,swordbelt,to,don,his,new,one
you,and,lady,sansa,owe,me,a,better,present,uncle,imp
this,one,is,all,chopped,to,pieces
tyrion,was,staring,at,his,nephew,with,his,mismatched,eyes
perhaps,a,knife,sire
to,match,your,sword
a,dagger,of,the,same,fine,valyrian,steel
with,a,dragonbone,hilt,say
joff,gave,him,a,sharp,look
you
yes,a,dagger,to,match,my,sword,good
he,nodded
a
a,gold,hilt,with,rubies,in,it
dragonbone,is,too,plain
as,you,wish,your,grace
tyrion,drank,another,cup,of,wine
he,might,have,been,all,alone,in,his,solar,for,all,the,attention,he,paid,sansa
but,when,the,time,came,to,leave,for,the,wedding,he,took,her,by,the,hand
as,they,were,crossing,the,yard,prince,oberyn,of,dorne,fell,in,beside,them,his,black-haired,paramour,on,his,arm
sansa,glanced,at,the,woman,curiously
she,was,baseborn,and,unwed,and,had,borne,two,bastard,daughters,for,the,prince,but,she,did,not,fear,to,look,even,the,queen,in,the,eye
shae,had,told,her,that,this,ellaria,worshiped,some,lysene,love,goddess
she,was,almost,a,whore,when,he,found,her,m’lady,her,maid,confided,and,now,she’s,near,a,princess
sansa,had,never,been,this,close,to,the,dornishwoman,before
she,is,not,truly,beautiful,she,thought,but,something,about,her,draws,the,eye
i,once,had,the,great,good,fortune,to,see,the,citadel’s,copy,of,lives,of,four,kings,prince,oberyn,was,telling,her,lord,husband
the,illuminations,were,wondrous,to,behold,but,kaeth,was,too,kind,by,half,to,king,viserys
tyrion,gave,him,a,sharp,look
too,kind
he,scants,viserys,shamefully,in,my,view
it,should,have,been,lives,of,five,kings
the,prince,laughed
viserys,hardly,reigned,a,fortnight
he,reigned,more,than,a,year,said,tyrion
oberyn,gave,a,shrug
a,year,or,a,fortnight,what,does,it,matter
he,poisoned,his,own,nephew,to,gain,the,throne,and,then,did,nothing,once,he,had,it
baelor,starved,himself,to,death,fasting,said,tyrion
his,uncle,served,him,loyally,as,hand,as,he,had,served,the,young,dragon,before,him
viserys,might,only,have,reigned,a,year,but,he,ruled,for,fifteen,while,daeron,warred,and,baelor,prayed
he,made,a,sour,face
and,if,he,did,remove,his,nephew,can,you,blame,him
someone,had,to,save,the,realm,from,baelor’s,follies
sansa,was,shocked
but,baelor,the,blessed,was,a,great,king
he,walked,the,boneway,barefoot,to,make,peace,with,dorne,and,rescued,the,dragonknight,from,a,snakepit
the,vipers,refused,to,strike,him,because,he,was,so,pure,and,holy
prince,oberyn,smiled
if,you,were,a,viper,my,lady,would,you,want,to,bite,a,bloodless,stick,like,baelor,the,blessed
i’d,sooner,save,my,fangs,for,someone,juicier
my,prince,is,playing,with,you,lady,sansa,said,the,woman,ellaria,sand
the,septons,and,singers,like,to,say,that,the,snakes,did,not,bite,baelor,but,the,truth,is,very,different
he,was,bitten,half,a,hundred,times,and,should,have,died,from,it
if,he,had,viserys,would,have,reigned,a,dozen,years,said,tyrion,and,the,seven,kingdoms,might,have,been,better,served
some,believe,baelor,was,deranged,by,all,that,venom
yes,said,prince,oberyn,but,i’ve,seen,no,snakes,in,this,red,keep,of,yours
so,how,do,you,account,for,joffrey
i,prefer,not,to
tyrion,inclined,his,head,stiffly
if,you,will,excuse,us
our,litter,awaits
the,dwarf,helped,sansa,up,inside,and,clambered,awkwardly,after,her
close,the,curtains,my,lady,if,you’d,be,so,good
must,we,my,lord
sansa,did,not,want,to,be,shut,behind,the,curtains
the,day,is,so,lovely
the,good,people,of,king’s,landing,are,like,to,throw,dung,at,the,litter,if,they,see,me,inside,it
do,us,both,a,kindness,my,lady
close,the,curtains
she,did,as,he,bid,her
they,sat,for,a,time,as,the,air,grew,warm,and,stuffy,around,them
i,was,sorry,about,your,book,my,lord,she,made,herself,say
it,was,joffrey’s,book
he,might,have,learned,a,thing,or,two,if,he’d,read,it
he,sounded,distracted
i,should,have,known,better
i,should,have,seen
a,good,many,things
perhaps,the,dagger,will,please,him,more
when,the,dwarf,grimaced,his,scar,tightened,and,twisted
the,boy’s,earned,himself,a,dagger,wouldn’t,you,say
thankfully,tyrion,did,not,wait,for,her,reply
joff,quarreled,with,your,brother,robb,at,winterfell
tell,me,was,there,ill,feeling,between,bran,and,his,grace,as,well
bran
the,question,confused,her
before,he,fell,you,mean
she,had,to,try,and,think,back
it,was,all,so,long,ago
bran,was,a,sweet,boy
everyone,loved,him
he,and,tommen,fought,with,wooden,swords,i,remember,but,just,for,play
tyrion,lapsed,back,into,moody,silence
sansa,heard,the,distant,clank,of,chains,from,outside,the,portcullis,was,being,drawn,up
a,moment,later,there,was,a,shout,and,their,litter,swayed,into,motion
deprived,of,the,passing,scenery,she,chose,to,stare,at,her,folded,hands,uncomfortably,aware,of,her,husand’s,mismatched,eyes
why,is,he,looking,at,me,that,way
you,loved,your,brothers,much,as,i,love,jaime
is,this,some,lannister,trap,to,make,me,speak,treason
my,brothers,were,traitors,and,they’ve,gone,to,traitors’,graves
it,is,treason,to,love,a,traitor
her,little,husband,snorted

tyrion,the,new,crown,that,his,father,had,given,the,faith,stood,twice,as,tall,as,the,one,the,mob,had,smashed,a,glory,of,crystal,and,spun,gold
rainbow,light,flashed,and,shimmered,every,time,the,high,septon,moved,his,head,but,tyrion,had,to,wonder,how,the,man,could,bear,the,weight
and,even,he,had,to,concede,that,joffrey,and,margaery,made,a,regal,couple,as,they,stood,side-by-side,between,the,towering,gilded,statues,of,the,father,and,the,mother
the,bride,was,lovely,in,ivory,silk,and,myrish,lace,her,skirts,decorated,with,floral,patterns,picked,out,in,seed,pearls
as,renly’s,widow,she,might,have,worn,the,baratheon,colors,gold,and,black,yet,she,came,to,them,a,tyrell,in,a,maiden’s,cloak,made,of,a,hundred,cloth-of-gold,roses,sewn,to,green,velvet
he,wondered,if,she,really,was,a,maiden
not,that,joffrey,is,like,to,know,the,difference
the,king,looked,near,as,splendid,as,his,bride,in,his,doublet,of,dusky,rose,beneath,a,cloak,of,deep,crimson,velvet,blazoned,with,his,stag,and,lion
the,crown,rested,easily,on,his,curls,gold,on,gold
i,saved,that,bloody,crown,for,him
tyrion,shifted,his,weight,uncomfortably,from,one,foot,to,the,other
he,could,not,stand,still
too,much,wine
he,should,have,thought,to,relieve,himself,before,they,set,out,from,the,red,keep
the,sleepless,night,he’d,spent,with,shae,was,making,itself,felt,too,but,most,of,all,he,wanted,to,strangle,his,bloody,royal,nephew
i,am,no,stranger,to,valyrian,steel,the,boy,had,boasted
the,septons,were,always,going,on,about,how,the,father,above,judges,us,all
if,the,father,would,be,so,good,as,to,topple,over,and,crush,joff,like,a,dung,beetle,i,might,even,believe,it
he,ought,to,have,seen,it,long,ago
jaime,would,never,send,another,man,to,do,his,killing,and,cersei,was,too,cunning,to,use,a,knife,that,could,be,traced,back,to,her,but,joff,arrogant,vicious,stupid,little,wretch,that,he,was
he,remembered,a,cold,morning,when,he’d,climbed,down,the,steep,exterior,steps,from,winterfell’s,library,to,find,prince,joffrey,jesting,with,the,hound,about,killing,wolves
send,a,dog,to,kill,a,wolf,he,said
even,joffrey,was,not,so,foolish,as,to,command,sandor,clegane,to,slay,a,son,of,eddard,stark,however,the,hound,would,have,gone,to,cersei
instead,the,boy,found,his,catspaw,among,the,unsavory,lot,of,freeriders,merchants,and,camp,followers,who’d,attached,themselves,to,the,king’s,party,as,they,made,their,way,north
some,poxy,lackwit,willing,to,risk,his,life,for,a,prince’s,favor,and,a,little,coin
tyrion,wondered,whose,idea,it,had,been,to,wait,until,robert,left,winterfell,before,opening,bran’s,throat
joff’s,most,like
no,doubt,he,thought,it,was,the,height,of,cunning
the,prince’s,own,dagger,had,a,jeweled,pommel,and,inlaid,goldwork,on,the,blade,tyrion,seemed,to,recall
at,least,joff,had,not,been,stupid,enough,to,use,that
instead,he,went,poking,among,his,father’s,weapons
robert,baratheon,was,a,man,of,careless,generosity,and,would,have,given,his,son,any,dagger,he,wanted
but,tyrion,guessed,that,the,boy,had,just,taken,it
robert,had,come,to,winterfell,with,a,long,tail,of,knights,and,retainers,a,huge,wheelhouse,and,a,baggage,train
no,doubt,some,diligent,servant,had,made,certain,that,the,king’s,weapons,went,with,him,in,case,he,should,desire,any,of,them
the,blade,joff,chose,was,nice,and,plain
no,goldwork,no,jewels,in,the,hilt,no,silver,inlay,on,the,blade
king,robert,never,wore,it,had,likely,forgotten,he,owned,it
yet,the,valyrian,steel,was,deadly,sharp
sharp,enough,to,slice,through,skin,flesh,and,muscle,in,one,quick,stroke
i,am,no,stranger,to,valyrian,steel
but,he,had,been,hadn’t,he
else,he,would,never,have,been,so,foolish,as,to,pick,littlefinger’s,knife
the,why,of,it,still,eluded,him
simple,cruelty,perhaps
his,nephew,had,that,in,abundance
it,was,all,tyrion,could,do,not,to,retch,up,all,the,wine,he’d,drunk,piss,in,his,breeches,or,both
he,squirmed,uncomfortably
he,ought,to,have,held,his,tongue,at,breakfast
the,boy,knows,i,know,now
my,big,mouth,will,be,the,death,of,me,i,swear,it
the,seven,vows,were,made,the,seven,blessings,invoked,and,the,seven,promises,exchanged
when,the,wedding,song,had,been,sung,and,the,challenge,had,gone,unanswered,it,was,time,for,the,exchange,of,cloaks
tyrion,shifted,his,weight,from,one,stunted,leg,to,the,other,trying,to,see,between,his,father,and,his,uncle,kevan
if,the,gods,are,just,joff,will,make,a,hash,of,this
he,made,certain,not,to,look,at,sansa,lest,his,bitterness,show,in,his,eyes
you,might,have,knelt,damn,you
would,it,have,been,so,bloody,hard,to,bend,those,stiff,stark,knees,of,yours,and,let,me,keep,a,little,dignity
mace,tyrell,removed,his,daughter’s,maiden,cloak,tenderly,while,joffrey,accepted,the,folded,bride’s,cloak,from,his,brother,tommen,and,shook,it,out,with,a,flourish
the,boy,king,was,as,tall,at,thirteen,as,his,bride,was,at,sixteen,he,would,not,require,a,fool’s,back,to,climb,upon
he,draped,margaery,in,the,crimson-and-gold,and,leaned,close,to,fasten,it,at,her,throat
and,that,easily,she,passed,from,her,father’s,protection,to,her,husband’s
but,who,will,protect,her,from,joff
tyrion,glanced,at,the,knight,of,flowers,standing,with,the,other,kingsguard
you,had,best,keep,your,sword,well,honed,ser,loras
with,this,kiss,i,pledge,my,love
joffrey,declared,in,ringing,tones
when,margaery,echoed,the,words,he,pulled,her,close,and,kissed,her,long,and,deep
rainbow,lights,danced,once,more,about,the,high,septon’s,crown,as,he,solemnly,declared,joffrey,of,the,houses,baratheon,and,lannister,and,margaery,of,house,tyrell,to,be,one,flesh,one,heart,one,soul
good,that’s,done,with
now,let’s,get,back,to,the,bloody,castle,so,i,can,have,a,piss
ser,loras,and,ser,meryn,led,the,procession,from,the,sept,in,their,white,scale,armor,and,snowy,cloaks
then,came,prince,tommen,scattering,rose,petals,from,a,basket,before,the,king,and,queen
after,the,royal,couple,followed,queen,cersei,and,lord,tyrell,then,the,bride’s,mother,arm-in-arm,with,lord,tywin
the,queen,of,thorns,tottered,after,them,with,one,hand,on,ser,kevan,lannister’s,arm,and,the,other,on,her,cane,her,twin,guardsmen,close,behind,her,in,case,she,fell
next,came,ser,garlan,tyrell,and,his,lady,wife,and,finally,it,was,their,turn
my,lady
tyrion,offered,sansa,his,arm
she,took,it,dutifully,but,he,could,feel,her,stiffness,as,they,walked,up,the,aisle,together
she,never,once,looked,down,at,him
he,heard,them,cheering,outside,even,before,he,reached,the,doors
the,mob,loved,margaery,so,much,they,were,even,willing,to,love,joffrey,again
she,had,belonged,to,renly,the,handsome,young,prince,who,had,loved,them,so,well,he,had,come,back,from,beyond,the,grave,to,save,them
and,the,bounty,of,highgarden,had,come,with,her,flowing,up,the,roseroad,from,the,south
the,fools,didn’t,seem,to,remember,that,it,had,been,mace,tyrell,who,closed,the,roseroad,to,begin,with,and,made,the,bloody,famine
they,stepped,out,into,the,crisp,autumn,air
i,feared,we’d,never,escape,tyrion,quipped
sansa,had,no,choice,but,to,look,at,him,then
i
yes,my,lord
as,you,say

littlefinger,was,the,clever,one
joffrey,and,margaery,stood,surrounded,by,kingsguard,atop,the,steps,that,fronted,on,the,broad,marble,plaza
ser,addam,and,his,gold,cloaks,held,back,the,crowd,while,the,statue,of,king,baelor,the,blessed,gazed,down,on,them,benevolently
tyrion,had,no,choice,but,to,queue,up,with,the,rest,to,offer,congratulations
he,kissed,margaery’s,fingers,and,wished,her,every,happiness
thankfully,there,were,others,behind,them,waiting,their,turn,so,they,did,not,need,to,linger,long
their,litter,had,been,sitting,in,the,sun,and,it,was,very,warm,inside,the,curtains
as,they,lurched,into,motion,tyrion,reclined,on,an,elbow,while,sansa,sat,staring,at,her,hands
she,is,just,as,comely,as,the,tyrell,girl
her,hair,was,a,rich,autumn,auburn,her,eyes,a,deep,tully,blue
grief,had,given,her,a,haunted,vulnerable,look,if,anything,it,had,only,made,her,more,beautiful
he,wanted,to,reach,her,to,break,through,the,armor,of,her,courtesy
was,that,what,made,him,speak
or,just,the,need,to,distract,himself,from,the,fullness,in,his,bladder
i,had,been,thinking,that,when,the,roads,are,safe,again,we,might,journey,to,casterly,rock
far,from,joffrey,and,my,sister
the,more,he,thought,about,what,joff,had,done,to,lives,of,four,kings,the,more,it,troubled,him
there,was,a,message,there,oh,yes
it,would,please,me,to,show,you,the,golden,gallery,and,the,lion’s,mouth,and,the,hall,of,heroes,where,jaime,and,i,played,as,boys

her,own,eyes,were,big,and,blue,and,empty
i,shall,go,wherever,my,lord,husband,wishes

what,a,pathetic,little,man,you,are

when,have,you,ever,made,a,woman,smile,but,with,gold
no,it,was,a,foolish,notion
only,a,lannister,can,love,the,rock
yes,my,lord
as,you,wish
tyrion,could,hear,the,commons,shouting,out,king,joffrey’s,name
in,three,years,that,cruel,boy,will,be,a,man,ruling,in,his,own,right
and,every,dwarf,with,half,his,wits,will,be,a,long,way,from,king’s,landing
oldtown,perhaps
or,even,the,free,cities
he,had,always,had,a,yen,to,see,the,titan,of,braavos
perhaps,that,would,please,sansa
gently,he,spoke,of,braavos,and,met,a,wall,of,sullen,courtesy,as,icy,and,unyielding,as,the,wall,he,had,walked,once,in,the,north
it,made,him,weary
then,and,now
they,passed,the,rest,of,the,journey,in,silence
after,a,while,tyrion,found,himself,hoping,that,sansa,would,say,something,anything,the,merest,word,but,she,never,spoke
when,the,litter,halted,in,the,castle,yard,he,let,one,of,the,grooms,help,her,down
we,will,be,expected,at,the,feast,an,hour,hence,my,lady
i,will,join,you,shortly

across,the,yard,he,could,hear,margaery’s,breathless,laugh,as,joffrey,swept,her,from,the,saddle
the,boy,will,be,as,tall,and,strong,as,jaime,one,day,he,thought,and,i’ll,still,be,a,dwarf,beneath,his,feet

of,all,those,at,the,high,table,only,sansa,stark,was,not,smiling
he,could,have,loved,her,for,that,but,if,truth,be,told,the,stark,girl’s,eyes,were,far,away,as,if,she,had,not,even,seen,the,ludicrous,riders,loping,toward,her
the,dwarfs,are,not,to,blame,tyrion,decided

and,come,the,morrow,i,will,find,whoever,planned,this,little,diversion,and,arrange,for,a,different,sort,of,thanks
when,the,dwarfs,reined,up,beneath,the,dais,to,salute,the,king,the,wolf,knight,dropped,his,shield
as,he,leaned,over,to,grab,for,it,the,stag,knight,lost,control,of,his,heavy,lance,and,slammed,him,across,the,back
the,wolf,knight,fell,off,his,pig,and,his,lance,tumbled,over,and,boinked,his,foe,on,the,head

the,knights,waited,for,it,to,die,circled,around,each,other,trading,colorful,insults,and,were,about,to,separate,for,another,joust,when,the,dog,threw,its,rider,to,the,floor,and,mounted,the,sow
the,huge,pig,squealed,in,distress,while,the,wedding,guests,squealed,with,laughter,especially,when,the,stag,knight,leapt,onto,the,wolf,knight,let,down,his,wooden,breeches,and,started,to,pump,away,frantically,at,the,other’s,nether,portions

we,have,a,champion
the,hall,began,to,quiet,when,it,was,seen,that,the,king,was,speaking
the,dwarfs,untangled,no,doubt,anticipating,the,royal,thanks
not,a,true,champion,though,said,joff
a,true,champion,defeats,all,challengers

the,hall,was,a,torchlit,blur,of,leering,faces
he,twisted,his,face,into,the,most,hideous,mockery,of,a,smile,the,seven,kingdoms,had,ever,seen

the,dwarf,hopped,back,to,the,floor,well,satisfied,and,by,the,time,he,looked,back,ser,osmund,and,ser,meryn,were,helping,joff,climb,down,as,well
when,he,noticed,cersei,glaring,at,him,tyrion,blew,her,a,kiss
it,was,a,relief,when,the,musicians,began,to,play
the,tiny,jousters,led,dog,and,sow,from,the,hall,the,guests,returned,to,their,trenchers,of,brawn,and,tyrion,called,for,another,cup,of,wine

as,they,drew,closer,she,saw,the,ship’s,figurehead,a,merman,with,a,golden,crown,blowing,on,a,great,seashell,horn
she,heard,a,voice,cry,out,and,the,galley,swung,slowly,about

when,he,saw,the,city,before,him,its,watchtowers,dark,against,the,gathering,dusk,jaime,lannister,cantered,up,to,steelshanks,walton,behind,nage,with,the,peace,banner
what’s,that,awful,stink

they,were,supposed,to,tear,their,hair,out,by,the,roots,to,curse,the,gods,and,swear,red,vengeance
so,why,was,it,that,he,felt,so,little
the,boy,lived,and,died,believing,robert,baratheon,his,sire
jaime,had,seen,him,born,that,was,true,though,more,for,cersei,than,the,child

the,boy,had,been,a,squalling,pink,thing,who,demanded,too,much,of,cersei’s,time,cersei’s,love,and,cersei’s,breasts
robert,was,welcome,to,him
and,now,he’s,dead
he,pictured,joff,lying,still,and,cold,with,a,face,black,from,poison,and,still,felt,nothing
perhaps,he,was,the,monster,they,claimed
if,the,father,above,came,down,to,offer,him,back,his,son,or,his,hand,jaime,knew,which,he,would,choose
he,had,a,second,son,after,all,and,seed,enough,for,many,more
if,cersei,wants,another,child,i’ll,give,her,one
and,this,time,i’ll,hold,him,and,the,others,take,those,who,do,not,like,it
robert,was,rotting,in,his,grave,and,jaime,was,sick,of,lies

she,looked,more,comfortable,dressed,as,a,man,but,nothing,would,ever,make,her,look,handsome

we’ll,all,be,happier,if,you,keep,your,mouth,shut,and,your,visor,down
that,much,brienne,could,do,but,her,sullen,silences,soon,began,to,fray,his,good,humor,almost,as,much,as,qyburn’s,endless,attempts,to,be,ingratiating

but,would,there,be,fewer,still,on,the,morrow
or,more
the,voice,of,ser,axell,florent,rang,loud,as,a,trumpet
he,stood,barrelchested,and,bandy-legged,the,firelight,washing,his,face,like,a,monstrous,orange,tongue
davos,wondered,if,ser,axell,would,thank,him,after

it’s,time
stannis,melisandre,and,the,queen’s,men,would,be,at,their,prayers,an,hour,or,more
the,red,priests,lit,their,fires,every,day,at,sunset,to,thank,r’hllor,for,the,day,just,ending,and,beg,him,to,send,his,sun,back,on,the,morrow,to,banish,the,gathering,darkness

that,was,all,he,was,at,the,end,of,the,day,davos,the,smuggler
his,maimed,hand,rose,to,his,throat,for,his,luck,and,found,nothing

his,companions,kept,pace,matching,their,strides,to,his,own
the,bastard,of,nightsong,had,a,pox-ravaged,face,and,an,air,of,tattered,chivalry,ser,gerald,gower,was,broad,bluff,and,blond,ser,andrew,estermont,stood,a,head,taller,with,a,spade-shaped,beard,and,shaggy,brown,eyebrows
they,were,all,good,men,in,their,own,ways,davos,thought
and,they,will,all,be,dead,men,soon,if,this,night’s,work,goes,badly
fire,is,a,living,thing,the,red,woman,told,him,when,he,asked,her,to,teach,him,how,to,see,the,future,in,the,flames
it,is,always,moving,always,changing
like,a,book,whose,letters,dance,and,shift,even,as,you,try,to,read,them
it,takes,years,of,training,to,see,the,shapes,beyond,the,flames,and,more,years,still,to,learn,to,tell,the,shapes,of,what,will,be,from,what,may,be,or,what,was
even,then,it,comes,hard,hard
you,do,not,understand,that,you,men,of,the,sunset,lands
davos,asked,her,then,how,it,was,that,ser,axell,had,learned,the,trick,of,it,so,quickly,but,to,that,she,only,smiled,enigmatically,and,said,any,cat,may,stare,into,a,fire,and,see,red,mice,at,play
he,had,not,lied,to,his,king’s,men,about,that,or,any,of,it
the,red,woman,may,see,what,we,intend,he,warned,them
we,should,start,by,killing,her,then,urged,lewys,the,fishwife
i,know,a,place,where,we,could,waylay,her,four,of,us,with,sharp,swords
you’d,doom,us,all,said,davos
maester,cressen,tried,to,kill,her,and,she,knew,at,once
from,her,flames,i’d,guess
it,seems,to,me,that,she,is,very,quick,to,sense,any,threat,to,her,own,person,but,surely,she,cannot,see,everything
if,we,ignore,her,perhaps,we,might,escape,her,notice
there,is,no,honor,in,hiding,and,sneaking,objected,ser,triston,of,tally,hill,who,had,been,a,sunglass,man,before,lord,guncer,went,to,melisandre’s,fires

the,young,maester,smiled
that’s,so
go,now
davos,had,been,uncertain,of,pylos
perhaps,he,resented,him,for,taking,old,cressen’s,place
but,now,he,could,only,admire,the,man’s,courage
this,could,mean,his,life,as,well
outside,the,maester’s,chambers,ser,gerald,gower,waited,by,the,steps

as,they,made,their,descent,he,asked,where,are,we,going,lord,davos

do,you,know,how,angry,that,will,make,him
have,you,ever,seen,your,uncle,angry
he,pulled,off,his,glove,and,showed,the,boy,the,four,fingers,that,stannis,had,shortened
i,have
it,was,all,lies,there,had,been,no,anger,in,stannis,baratheon,when,he,cut,the,ends,off,his,onion,knight’s,fingers,only,an,iron,sense,of,justice
but,edric,storm,had,not,been,born,then,and,could,not,know,that
and,the,threat,had,the,desired,effect
he,should,not,have,done,that,the,boy,said,but,he,let,davos,take,him,by,the,hand,and,draw,him,down,the,steps
the,bastard,of,nightsong,joined,them,at,the,cellar,door
they,walked,quickly,across,a,shadowed,yard,and,down,some,steps,under,the,stone,tail,of,a,frozen,dragon
lewys,the,fishwife,and,omer,blackberry,waited,at,the,postern,gate,two,guards,bound,and,trussed,at,their,feet
the,boat
davos,asked,them
it’s,there,lewys,said
four,oarsmen
the,galley,is,anchored,just,past,the,point
mad,prendos
davos,chuckled
a,ship,named,after,a,madman
yes,that’s,fitting
salla,had,a,streak,of,the,pirate’s,black,humor
he,went,to,one,knee,before,edric,storm
i,must,leave,you,now,he,said
there’s,a,boat,waiting,to,row,you,out,to,a,galley
then,it’s,off,across,the,sea
you,are,robert’s,son,so,i,know,you,will,be,brave,no,matter,what,happens
i,will
only
the,boy,hesitated
think,of,this,as,an,adventure,my,lord
davos,tried,to,sound,hale,and,cheerful
it’s,the,start,of,your,life’s,great,adventure
may,the,warrior,defend,you
and,may,the,father,judge,you,justly,lord,davos
the,boy,went,with,his,cousin,ser,andrew,out,the,postern,gate
the,others,followed,all,but,the,bastard,of,nightsong
may,the,father,judge,me,justly,davos,thought,ruefully
but,it,was,the,king’s,judgment,that,concerned,him,now
these,two
asked,ser,rolland,of,the,guards,when,he,had,closed,and,barred,the,gate
drag,them,into,a,cellar,said,davos
you,can,cut,them,free,when,edric’s,safely,under,way
the,bastard,gave,a,curt,nod
there,were,no,more,words,to,say,the,easy,part,was,done
davos,pulled,his,glove,on,wishing,he,had,not,lost,his,luck
he,had,been,a,better,man,and,a,braver,one,with,that,bag,of,bones,around,his,neck
he,ran,his,shortened,fingers,through,thinning,brown,hair,and,wondered,if,it,needed,to,be,cut
he,must,look,presentable,when,he,stood,before,the,king
dragonstone,had,never,seemed,so,dark,and,fearsome
he,walked,slowly,his,footsteps,echoing,off,black,walls,and,dragons
stone,dragons,who,will,never,wake,i,pray
the,stone,drum,loomed,huge,ahead,of,him
the,guards,at,the,door,uncrossed,their,spears,as,he,approached
not,for,the,onion,knight,but,for,the,king’s,hand
davos,was,the,hand,going,in,at,least
he,wondered,what,he,would,be,coming,out
if,i,ever,do
the,steps,seemed,longer,and,steeper,than,before,or,perhaps,it,was,just,that,he,was,tired
the,mother,never,made,me,for,tasks,like,this
he,had,risen,too,high,and,too,fast,and,up,here,on,the,mountain,the,air,was,too,thin,for,him,to,breathe
as,a,boy,he’d,dreamed,of,riches,but,that,was,long,ago
later,grown,all,he,had,wanted,was,a,few,acres,of,good,land,a,hall,to,grow,old,in,a,better,life,for,his,sons
the,blind,bastard,used,to,tell,him,that,a,clever,smuggler,did,not,overreach,nor,draw,too,much,attention,to,himself
a,few,acres,a,timbered,roof,a,ser,before,my,name,i,should,have,been,content
if,he,survived,this,night,he,would,take,devan,and,sail,home,to,cape,wrath,and,his,gentle,marya
we,will,grieve,together,for,our,dead,sons,raise,the,living,ones,to,be,good,men,and,speak,no,more,of,kings
the,chamber,of,the,painted,table,was,dark,and,empty,when,davos,entered,the,king,would,still,be,at,the,nightfire,with,melisandre,and,the,queen’s,men
he,knelt,and,made,a,fire,in,the,hearth,to,drive,the,chill,from,the,round,chamber,and,chase,the,shadows,back,into,their,corners
then,he,went,around,the,room,to,each,window,in,turn,opening,the,heavy,velvet,curtains,and,unlatching,the,wooden,shutters
the,wind,came,in,strong,with,the,smell,of,salt,and,sea,and,pulled,at,his,plain,brown,cloak
at,the,north,window,he,leaned,against,the,sill,for,a,breath,of,the,cold,night,air,hoping,to,catch,a,glimpse,of,mad,prendos,raising,sail,but,the,sea,seemed,black,and,empty,as,far,as,the,eye,could,see
is,she,gone,already
he,could,only,pray,that,she,was,and,the,boy,with,her
a,half,moon,was,sliding,in,and,out,amongst,thin,high,clouds,and,davos,could,see,familiar,stars
there,was,the,galley,sailing,west,there,the,crone’s,lantern,four,bright,stars,that,enclosed,a,golden,haze
the,clouds,hid,most,of,the,ice,dragon,all,but,the,bright,blue,eye,that,marked,due,north
the,sky,is,full,of,smugglers’,stars
they,were,old,friends,those,stars,davos,hoped,that,meant,good,luck
but,when,he,lowered,his,gaze,from,the,sky,to,the,castle,ramparts,he,was,not,so,certain
the,wings,of,the,stone,dragons,cast,great,black,shadows,in,the,light,from,the,nightfire
he,tried,to,tell,himself,that,they,were,no,more,than,carvings,cold,and,lifeless
this,was,their,place,once
a,place,of,dragons,and,dragonlords,the,seat,of,house,targaryen
the,targaryens,were,the,blood,of,old,valyria

the,cell,was,dark,the,bed,hard,beneath,him

grey,like,bran’s,wolf
had,the,thenns,hunted,him,down,and,killed,him,after,queenscrown
if,so,bran,was,lost,to,him,for,good,and,all
jon,was,trying,to,make,sense,of,that,when,the,horn,blew
the,horn,of,winter,he,thought,still,confused,from,sleep
but,mance,never,found,joramun’s,horn,so,that,couldn’t,be
a,second,blast,followed,as,long,and,deep,as,the,first
jon,had,to,get,up,and,go,to,the,wall,he,knew,but,it,was,so,hard
he,shoved,aside,his,furs,and,sat
the,pain,in,his,leg,seemed,duller,nothing,he,could,not,stand
he,had,slept,in,his,breeches,and,tunic,and,smallclothes,for,the,added,warmth,so,he,had,only,to,pull,on,his,boots,and,don,leather,and,mail,and,cloak
the,horn,blew,again,two,long,blasts,so,he,slung,longclaw,over,one,shoulder,found,his,crutch,and,hobbled,down,the,steps
it,was,the,black,of,night,outside,bitter,cold,and,overcast
his,brothers,were,spilling,out,of,towers,and,keeps,buckling,their,swordbelts,and,walking,toward,the,wall
jon,looked,for,pyp,and,grenn,but,could,not,find,them
perhaps,one,of,them,was,the,sentry,blowing,the,horn
it,is,mance,he,thought
he,has,come,at,last
that,was,good
we,will,fight,a,battle,and,then,we’ll,rest
alive,or,dead,we’ll,rest
where,the,stair,had,been,only,an,immense,tangle,of,charred,wood,and,broken,ice,remained,below,the,wall
the,winch,raised,them,up,now,but,the,cage,was,only,big,enough,for,ten,men,at,a,time,and,it,was,already,on,its,way,up,by,the,time,jon,arrived

they,were,young,nine,and,eight,and,five,but,no,one,else,seemed,to,want,them
as,they,waited,for,the,cage,to,come,back,clydas,brought,them,cups,of,hot,mulled,wine,while,three-finger,hobb,passed,out,chunks,of,black,bread
jon,took,a,heel,from,him,and,gnawed,on,it
is,it,mance,rayder
satin,asked,anxiously
we,can,hope,so
there,were,worse,things,than,wildlings,in,the,dark
jon,remembered,the,words,the,wildling,king,had,spoken,on,the,fist,of,the,first,men,as,they,stood,amidst,that,pink,snow
when,the,dead,walk,walls,and,stakes,and,swords,mean,nothing
you,cannot,fight,the,dead,jon,snow
no,man,knows,that,half,so,well,as,me
just,thinking,of,it,made,the,wind,seem,a,little,colder
finally,the,cage,came,clanking,back,down,swaying,at,the,end,of,the,long,chain,and,they,crowded,in,silently,and,shut,the,door
mully,yanked,the,bell,rope,three,times
a,moment,later,they,began,to,rise,by,fits,and,starts,at,first,then,more,smoothly
no,one,spoke
at,the,top,the,cage,swung,sideways,and,they,clambered,out,one,by,one
horse,gave,jon,a,hand,down,onto,the,ice
the,cold,hit,him,in,the,teeth,like,a,fist
a,line,of,fires,burned,along,the,top,of,the,wall,contained,in,iron,baskets,on,poles,taller,than,a,man
the,cold,knife,of,the,wind,stirred,and,swirled,the,flames,so,the,lurid,orange,light,was,always,shifting
bundles,of,quarrels,arrows,spears,and,scorpion,bolts,stood,ready,on,every,hand
rocks,were,piled,ten,feet,high,big,wooden,barrels,of,pitch,and,lamp,oil,lined,up,beside,them
bowen,marsh,had,left,castle,black,well,supplied,in,everything,save,men
the,wind,was,whipping,at,the,black,cloaks,of,the,scarecrow,sentinels,who,stood,along,the,ramparts,spears,in,hand
i,hope,it,wasn’t,one,of,them,who,blew,the,horn,jon,said,to,donal,noye,when,he,limped,up,beside,him
did,you,hear,that
noye,asked
there,was,the,wind,and,horses,and,something,else
a,mammoth,jon,said
that,was,a,mammoth
the,armorer’s,breath,was,frosting,as,it,blew,from,his,broad,flat,nose
north,of,the,wall,was,a,sea,of,darkness,that,seemed,to,stretch,forever
jon,could,make,out,the,faint,red,glimmer,of,distant,fires,moving,through,the,wood
it,was,mance,certain,as,sunrise
the,others,did,not,light,torches
how,do,we,fight,them,if,we,can’t,see,them

he,roared
barrels,of,pitch,were,loaded,hastily,into,the,slings,and,set,afire,with,a,torch
the,wind,fanned,the,flames,to,a,brisk,red,fury
now
noye,bellowed
the,counterweights,plunged,downward,the,throwing,arms,rose,to,thud,against,the,padded,crossbars
the,burning,pitch,went,tumbling,through,the,darkness,casting,an,eerie,flickering,light,upon,the,ground,below
jon,caught,a,glimpse,of,mammoths,moving,ponderously,through,the,half-light,and,just,as,quickly,lost,them,again
a,dozen,maybe,more
the,barrels,struck,the,earth,and,burst
they,heard,a,deep,bass,trumpeting,and,a,giant,roared,something,in,the,old,tongue,his,voice,an,ancient,thunder,that,sent,shivers,up,jon’s,spine
again
noye,shouted,and,the,trebuchets,were,loaded,once,more
two,more,barrels,of,burning,pitch,went,crackling,through,the,gloom,to,come,crashing,down,amongst,the,foe
this,time,one,of,them,struck,a,dead,tree,enveloping,it,in,flame
not,a,dozen,mammoths,jon,saw,a,hundred

careful,he,reminded,himself,it,is,a,long,way,down
red,alyn,sounded,his,sentry’s,horn,once,more,aaaaahoooooooooooooooooooooooooo,aaaaahoooooooooooooooooooo
and,now,the,wildlings,answered,not,with,one,horn,but,with,a,dozen,and,with,drums,and,pipes,as,well
we,are,come,they,seemed,to,say,we,are,come,to,break,your,wall,to,take,your,lands,and,steal,your,daughters
the,wind,howled,the,trebuchets,creaked,and,thumped,the,barrels,flew
behind,the,giants,and,the,mammoths,jon,saw,men,advancing,on,the,wall,with,bows,and,axes
were,there,twenty,or,twenty,thousand
in,the,dark,there,was,no,way,to,tell
this,is,a,battle,of,blind,men,but,mance,has,a,few,thousand,more,of,them,than,we,do
the,gate
pyp,cried,out
they’re,at,the,gate
the,wall,was,too,big,to,be,stormed,by,any,conventional,means,too,high,for,ladders,or,siege,towers,too,thick,for,battering,rams
no,catapult,could,throw,a,stone,large,enough,to,breach,it,and,if,you,tried,to,set,it,on,fire,the,icemelt,would,quench,the,flames
you,could,climb,over,as,the,raiders,did,near,greyguard,but,only,if,you,were,strong,and,fit,and,sure-handed,and,even,then,you,might,end,up,like,jarl,impaled,on,a,tree
they,must,take,the,gate,or,they,cannot,pass
but,the,gate,was,a,crooked,tunnel,through,the,ice,smaller,than,any,castle,gate,in,the,seven,kingdoms,so,narrow,that,rangers,must,lead,their,garrons,through,single,file
three,iron,grates,closed,the,inner,passage,each,locked,and,chained,and,protected,by,a,murder,hole
the,outer,door,was,old,oak,nine,inches,thick,and,studded,with,iron,not,easy,to,break,through

the,sounds,below,changed,to,shouts,and,screams,sweet,music,to,their,ears
yet,still,the,drums,beat,on,the,trebuchets,shuddered,and,thumped,and,the,sound,of,skinpipes,came,wafting,through,the,night,like,the,songs,of,strange,fierce,birds

i’m,wounded,and,i,stand,accused,of,desertion
his,mouth,had,gone,bone,dry

afterward,it,would,seem,to,jon,snow,as,if,he’d,dreamt,that,night
side,by,side,with,the,straw,soldiers,with,longbows,or,crossbows,clutched,in,half-frozen,hands,his,archers,launched,a,hundred,flights,of,arrows,against,men,they,never,saw
from,time,to,time,a,wildling,arrow,came,flying,back,in,answer
he,sent,men,to,the,smaller,catapults,and,filled,the,air,with,jagged,rocks,the,size,of,a,giant’s,fist,but,the,darkness,swallowed,them,as,a,man,might,swallow,a,handful,of,nuts
mammoths,trumpeted,in,the,gloom,strange,voices,called,out,in,stranger,tongues,and,septon,cellador,prayed,so,loudly,and,drunkenly,for,the,dawn,to,come,that,jon,was,tempted,to,chuck,him,over,the,edge,himself
they,heard,a,mammoth,dying,at,their,feet,and,saw,another,lurch,burning,through,the,woods,trampling,down,men,and,trees,alike
the,wind,blew,cold,and,colder

the,left-hand,trebuchet,kept,throwing,but,the,wildlings,had,quickly,learned,to,shun,the,place,where,its,loads,were,landing
we,should,have,twenty,trebuchets,not,two,and,they,should,be,mounted,on,sledges,and,turntables,so,we,could,move,them
it,was,a,futile,thought
he,might,as,well,wish,for,another,thousand,men,and,maybe,a,dragon,or,three
donal,noye,did,not,return,nor,any,of,them,who’d,gone,down,with,him,to,hold,that,black,cold,tunnel

he,could,see,a,glow,behind,them,but,perhaps,he,was,only,dreaming
he,notched,another,arrow
then,the,rising,sun,broke,through,to,send,pale,lances,of,light,across,the,battleground
jon,found,himself,holding,his,breath,as,he,looked,out,over,the,half-mile,swath,of,cleared,land,that,lay,between,the,wall,and,the,edge,of,the,forest
in,half,a,night,they,had,turned,it,into,a,wasteland,of,blackened,grass,bubbling,pitch,shattered,stone,and,corpses
the,carcass,of,the,burned,mammoth,was,already,drawing,crows
there,were,giants,dead,on,the,ground,as,well,but,behind,them

he,was,chilled,and,feverish,and,suddenly,the,weight,of,the,longbow,was,too,much
the,battle,with,the,magnar,had,been,nothing,he,realized,and,the,night,fight,less,than,nothing,only,a,probe,a,dagger,in,the,dark,to,try,and,catch,them,unprepared

if,the,gate,still,stood,below,a,few,kisses,from,that,thing,would,soon,turn,it,into,splinters
on,either,side,of,the,giants,came,a,wave,of,horsemen,in,boiled,leather,harness,with,fire-hardened,lances,a,mass,of,running,archers,hundreds,of,foot,with,spears,slings,clubs,and,leathern,shields

i,want,a,fire,a,hot,meal,a,warm,bed,and,something,to,make,my,leg,stop,hurting,he,told,himself
but,first,he,had,to,check,the,tunnel,and,find,what,had,become,of,donal,noye
after,the,battle,with,the,thenns,it,had,taken,them,almost,a,day,to,clear,the,ice,and,broken,beams,away,from,the,inner,gate
spotted,pate,and,kegs,and,some,of,the,other,builders,had,argued,heatedly,that,they,ought,just,leave,the,debris,there,another,obstacle,for,mance
that,would,have,meant,abandoning,the,defense,of,the,tunnel,though,and,noye,was,having,none,of,it
with,men,in,the,murder,holes,and,archers,and,spears,behind,each,inner,grate,a,few,determined,brothers,could,hold,off,a,hundred,times,as,many,wildlings,and,clog,the,way,with,corpses
he,did,not,mean,to,give,mance,rayder,free,passage,through,the,ice
so,with,pick,and,spade,and,ropes,they,had,moved,the,broken,steps,aside,and,dug,back,down,to,the,gate

the,ice,pressed,close,around,them,and,he,could,feel,the,cold,seeping,into,his,bones,the,weight,of,the,wall,above,his,head
it,felt,like,walking,down,the,gullet,of,an,ice,dragon
the,tunnel,took,a,twist,and,then,another

they,walked,farther,turned,again,and,saw,light,ahead,faint,and,pale,through,the,ice
that’s,bad,jon,knew,at,once

the,outer,door,of,studded,oak,had,been,hacked,and,broken,and,finally,torn,off,its,hinges,and,one,of,the,giants,had,crawled,in,through,the,splinters

the,two,crossbows,had,gotten,off,a,dozen,quarrels,as,the,giant,struggled,toward,them
then,the,spearmen,must,have,come,to,the,fore,stabbing,through,the,bars
still,the,giant,found,the,strength,to,reach,through,twist,the,head,off,spotted,pate,seize,the,iron,gate,and,wrench,the,bars,apart

it,was,too,cold,and,dark,inside,the,tunnel,and,the,stench,of,blood,and,death,was,suffocating
jon,gave,the,lantern,back,to,clydas,squeezed,around,the,bodies,and,through,the,twisted,bars,and,walked,toward,the,daylight,to,see,what,lay,beyond,the,splintered,door
the,huge,carcass,of,a,dead,mammoth,partially,blocked,the,way
one,of,the,beast’s,tusks,snagged,his,cloak,and,tore,it,as,he,edged,past

when,she,bared,her,teeth,even,men,would,run,from,her,her,belly,was,never,empty,long,and,her,fur,kept,her,warm,even,when,the,wind,was,blowing,cold
and,her,brothers,and,sisters,were,with,her,many,and,more,of,them,fierce,and,terrible,and,hers
they,would,never,leave,her
but,if,her,nights,were,full,of,wolves,her,days,belonged,to,the,dog
sandor,clegane,made,her,get,up,every,morning,whether,she,wanted,to,or,not
he,would,curse,at,her,in,his,raspy,voice,or,yank,her,to,her,feet,and,shake,her
once,he,dumped,a,helm,full,of,cold,water,all,over,her,head
she,bounced,up,sputtering,and,shivering,and,tried,to,kick,him,but,he,only,laughed
dry,off,and,feed,the,bloody,horses,he,told,her,and,she,did
they,had,two,now,stranger,and,a,sorrel,palfrey,mare,arya,had,named,craven,because,sandor,said,she’d,likely,run,off,from,the,twins,the,same,as,them
they’d,found,her,wandering,riderless,through,a,field,the,morning,after,the,slaughter
she,was,a,good,enough,horse,but,arya,could,not,love,a,coward
stranger,would,have,fought
still,she,tended,the,mare,as,best,she,knew
it,was,better,than,riding,double,with,the,hound
and,craven,might,have,been,a,coward,but,she,was,young,and,strong,as,well
arya,thought,that,she,might,be,able,to,outrun,stranger,if,it,came,to,it
the,hound,no,longer,watched,her,as,closely,as,he,had
sometimes,he,did,not,seem,to,care,whether,she,stayed,or,went,and,he,no,longer,bound,her,up,in,a,cloak,at,night
one,night,i’ll,kill,him,in,his,sleep,she,told,herself,but,she,never,did
one,day,i’ll,ride,away,on,craven,and,he,won’t,be,able,to,catch,me,she,thought,but,she,never,did,that,either
where,would,she,go
winterfell,was,gone
her,grandfather’s,brother,was,at,riverrun,but,he,didn’t,know,her,no,more,than,she,knew,him
maybe,lady,smallwood,would,take,her,in,at,acorn,hall,but,maybe,she,wouldn’t
besides,arya,wasn’t,even,sure,she,could,find,acorn,hall,again
sometimes,she,thought,she,might,go,back,to,sharna’s,inn,if,the,floods,hadn’t,washed,it,away
she,could,stay,with,hot,pie,or,maybe,lord,beric,would,find,her,there
anguy,would,teach,her,to,use,a,bow,and,she,could,ride,with,gendry,and,be,an,outlaw,like,wenda,the,white,fawn,in,the,songs
but,that,was,just,stupid,like,something,sansa,might,dream
hot,pie,and,gendry,had,left,her,just,as,soon,as,they,could,and,lord,beric,and,the,outlaws,only,wanted,to,ransom,her,just,like,the,hound
none,of,them,wanted,her,around
they,were,never,my,pack,not,even,hot,pie,and,gendry
i,was,stupid,to,think,so,just,a,stupid,little,girl,and,no,wolf,at,all
so,she,stayed,with,the,hound
they,rode,every,day,never,sleeping,twice,in,the,same,place,avoiding,towns,and,villages,and,castles,as,best,they,could
once,she,asked,sandor,clegane,where,they,were,going
away,he,said
that’s,all,you,need,to,know
you’re,not,worth,spit,to,me,now,and,i,don’t,want,to,hear,your,whining
i,should,have,let,you,run,into,that,bloody,castle
you,should,have,she,agreed,thinking,of,her,mother
you’d,be,dead,if,i,had
you,ought,to,thank,me
you,ought,to,sing,me,a,pretty,little,song,the,way,your,sister,did
did,you,hit,her,with,an,axe,too
i,hit,you,with,the,flat,of,the,axe,you,stupid,little,bitch
if,i’d,hit,you,with,the,blade,there’d,still,be,chunks,of,your,head,floating,down,the,green,fork
now,shut,your,bloody,mouth
if,i,had,any,sense,i’d,give,you,to,the,silent,sisters
they,cut,the,tongues,out,of,girls,who,talk,too,much
that,wasn’t,fair,of,him,to,say
aside,from,that,one,time,arya,hardly,talked,at,all
whole,days,passed,when,neither,of,them,said,anything
she,was,too,empty,to,talk,and,the,hound,was,too,angry
she,could,feel,the,fury,in,him,she,could,see,it,on,his,face,the,way,his,mouth,would,tighten,and,twist,the,looks,he,gave,her
whenever,he,took,his,axe,to,chop,some,wood,for,a,fire,he,would,slide,into,a,cold,rage,hacking,savagely,at,the,tree,or,the,deadfall,or,the,broken,limb,until,they,had,twenty,times,as,much,kindling,and,firewood,as,they’d,needed
sometimes,he,would,be,so,sore,and,tired,afterward,that,he,would,lie,down,and,go,right,to,sleep,without,even,lighting,a,fire
arya,hated,it,when,that,happened,and,hated,him,too
those,were,the,nights,when,she,stared,the,longest,at,the,axe
it,looks,awfully,heavy,but,i,bet,i,could,swing,it
she,wouldn’t,hit,him,with,the,flat,either
sometimes,in,their,wanderings,they,glimpsed,other,people,farmers,in,their,fields,swineherds,with,their,pigs,a,milkmaid,leading,a,cow,a,squire,carrying,a,message,down,a,rutted,road
she,never,wanted,to,speak,to,them,either
it,was,as,if,they,lived,in,some,distant,land,and,spoke,a,queer,alien,tongue,they,had,nothing,to,do,with,her,or,her,with,them
besides,it,wasn’t,safe,to,be,seen
from,time,to,time,columns,of,horsemen,passed,down,the,winding,farm,roads,the,twin,towers,of,frey,flying,before,them
hunting,for,stray,northmen,the,hound,said,when,they,had,passed
any,time,you,hear,hooves,get,your,head,down,fast,it’s,not,like,to,be,a,friend
one,day,in,an,earthen,hollow,made,by,the,roots,of,a,fallen,oak,they,came,face,to,face,with,another,survivor,of,the,twins
the,badge,on,his,breast,showed,a,pink,maiden,dancing,in,a,swirl,of,silk,and,he,told,them,he,was,ser,marq,piper’s,man,a,bowman,though,he’d,lost,his,bow
his,left,shoulder,was,all,twisted,and,swollen,where,it,met,his,arm,a,blow,from,a,mace,he,said,it,had,broken,his,shoulder,and,smashed,his,chainmail,deep,into,his,flesh
a,northman,it,was,he,wept
his,badge,was,a,bloody,man,and,he,saw,mine,and,made,a,jape,red,man,and,pink,maiden,maybe,they,should,get,together
i,drank,to,his,lord,bolton,he,drank,to,ser,marq,and,we,drank,together,to,lord,edmure,and,lady,roslin,and,the,king,in,the,north
and,then,he,killed,me
his,eyes,were,fever,bright,when,he,said,that,and,arya,could,tell,that,it,was,true
his,shoulder,was,swollen,grotesquely,and,pus,and,blood,had,stained,his,whole,left,side
there,was,a,stink,to,him,too
he,smells,like,a,corpse
the,man,begged,them,for,a,drink,of,wine
if,i’d,had,any,wine,i’d,have,drunk,it,myself,the,hound,told,him
i,can,give,you,water,and,the,gift,of,mercy
the,archer,looked,at,him,a,long,while,before,he,said,you’re,joffrey’s,dog
my,own,dog,now
do,you,want,the,water
aye
the,man,swallowed
and,the,mercy
please
they,had,passed,a,small,pond,a,short,ways,back
sandor,gave,arya,his,helm,and,told,her,to,fill,it,so,she,trudged,back,to,the,water’s,edge
mud,squished,over,the,toe,of,her,boots
she,used,the,dog’s,head,as,a,pail
water,ran,out,through,the,eyeholes,but,the,bottom,of,the,helm,still,held,a,lot
when,she,came,back,the,archer,turned,his,face,up,and,she,poured,the,water,into,his,mouth
he,gulped,it,down,as,fast,as,she,could,pour,and,what,he,couldn’t,gulp,ran,down,his,cheeks,into,the,brown,blood,that,crusted,his,whiskers,until,pale,pink,tears,dangled,from,his,beard
when,the,water,was,gone,he,clutched,the,helm,and,licked,the,steel
good,he,said
i,wish,it,was,wine,though
i,wanted,wine
me,too
the,hound,eased,his,dagger,into,the,man’s,chest,almost,tenderly,the,weight,of,his,body,driving,the,point,through,his,surcoat,ringmail,and,the,quilting,beneath
as,he,slid,the,blade,back,out,and,wiped,it,on,the,dead,man,he,looked,at,arya
that’s,where,the,heart,is,girl
that’s,how,you,kill,a,man
that’s,one,way
will,we,bury,him
why
sandor,said
he,don’t,care,and,we’ve,got,no,spade
leave,him,for,the,wolves,and,wild,dogs
your,brothers,and,mine
he,gave,her,a,hard,look
first,we,rob,him,though
there,were,two,silver,stags,in,the,archer’s,purse,and,almost,thirty,coppers
his,dagger,had,a,pretty,pink,stone,in,the,hilt
the,hound,hefted,the,knife,in,his,hand,then,flipped,it,toward,arya
she,caught,it,by,the,hilt,slid,it,through,her,belt,and,felt,a,little,better
it,wasn’t,needle,but,it,was,steel
the,dead,man,had,a,quiver,of,arrows,too,but,arrows,weren’t,much,good,without,a,bow
his,boots,were,too,big,for,arya,and,too,small,for,the,hound,so,those,they,left
she,took,his,kettle,helm,as,well,even,though,it,came,down,almost,past,her,nose,so,she,had,to,tilt,it,back,to,see
he,must,have,had,a,horse,as,well,or,he,wouldn’t,have,got,away,clegane,said,peering,about,but,it’s,bloody,well,gone,i’d,say
no,telling,how,long,he’s,been,here
by,the,time,they,found,themselves,in,the,foothills,of,the,mountains,of,the,moon,the,rains,had,mostly,stopped
arya,could,see,the,sun,and,moon,and,stars,and,it,seemed,to,her,that,they,were,heading,eastward
where,are,we,going
she,asked,again
this,time,the,hound,answered,her
you,have,an,aunt,in,the,eyrie
might,be,she’ll,want,to,ransom,your,scrawny,arse,though,the,gods,know,why
once,we,find,the,high,road,we,can,follow,it,all,the,way,to,the,bloody,gate
aunt,lysa
the,thought,left,arya,feeling,empty
it,was,her,mother,she,wanted,not,her,mother’s,sister
she,didn’t,know,her,mother’s,sister,any,more,than,she,knew,her,great,uncle,blackfish
we,should,have,gone,into,the,castle
they,didn’t,really,know,that,her,mother,was,dead,or,robb,either
it,wasn’t,like,they’d,seen,them,die,or,anything
maybe,lord,frey,had,just,taken,them,captive
maybe,they,were,chained,up,in,his,dungeon,or,maybe,the,freys,were,taking,them,to,king’s,landing,so,joffrey,could,chop,their,heads,off
they,didn’t,know
we,should,go,back,she,suddenly,decided
we,should,go,back,to,the,twins,and,get,my,mother
she,can’t,be,dead
we,have,to,help,her
i,thought,your,sister,was,the,one,with,a,head,full,of,songs,the,hound,growled
frey,might,have,kept,your,mother,alive,to,ransom,that’s,true
but,there’s,no,way,in,seven,hells,i’m,going,to,pluck,her,out,of,his,castle,all,by,my,bloody,self
not,by,yourself
i’d,come,too
he,made,a,sound,that,was,almost,a,laugh
that,will,scare,the,piss,out,of,the,old,man
you’re,just,afraid,to,die
she,said,scornfully
now,clegane,did,laugh
death,don’t,scare,me
only,fire
now,be,quiet,or,i’ll,cut,your,tongue,out,myself,and,save,the,silent,sisters,the,bother
it’s,the,vale,for,us
arya,didn’t,think,he’d,really,cut,her,tongue,out,he,was,just,saying,that,the,way,pinkeye,used,to,say,he’d,beat,her,bloody
all,the,same,she,wasn’t,going,to,try,him
sandor,clegane,was,no,pinkeye
pinkeye,didn’t,cut,people,in,half,or,hit,them,with,axes
not,even,with,the,flat,of,axes
that,night,she,went,to,sleep,thinking,of,her,mother,and,wondering,if,she,should,kill,the,hound,in,his,sleep,and,rescue,lady,catelyn,herself
when,she,closed,her,eyes,she,saw,her,mother’s,face,against,the,back,of,her,eyelids
she’s,so,close,i,could,almost,smell,her

and,then,she,could,smell,her
the,scent,was,faint,beneath,the,other,smells,beneath,moss,and,mud,and,water,and,the,stench,of,rotting,reeds,and,rotting,men
she,padded,slowly,through,the,soft,ground,to,the,river’s,edge,lapped,up,a,drink,the,lifted,her,head,to,sniff
the,sky,was,grey,and,thick,with,cloud,the,river,green,and,full,of,floating,things
dead,men,clogged,the,shallows,some,still,moving,as,the,water,pushed,them,others,washed,up,on,the,banks
her,brothers,and,sisters,swarmed,around,them,tearing,at,the,rich,ripe,flesh
the,crows,were,there,too,screaming,at,the,wolves,and,filling,the,air,with,feathers
their,blood,was,hotter,and,one,of,her,sisters,had,snapped,at,one,as,it,took,flight,and,caught,it,by,the,wing
it,made,her,want,a,crow,herself
she,wanted,to,taste,the,blood,to,hear,the,bones,crunch,between,her,teeth,to,fill,her,belly,with,warm,flesh,instead,of,cold
she,was,hungry,and,the,meat,was,all,around,but,she,knew,she,could,not,eat
the,scent,was,stronger,now
she,pricked,her,ears,up,and,listened,to,the,grumbles,of,her,pack,the,shriek,of,angry,crows,the,whirr,of,wings,and,sound,of,running,water
somewhere,far,off,she,could,hear,horses,and,the,calls,of,living,men,but,they,were,not,what,mattered
only,the,scent,mattered
she,sniffed,the,air,again
there,it,was,and,now,she,saw,it,too,something,pale,and,white,drifting,down,the,river,turning,where,it,brushed,against,a,snag
the,reeds,bowed,down,before,it
she,splashed,noisily,through,the,shallows,and,threw,herself,into,the,deeper,water,her,legs,churning
the,current,was,strong,but,she,was,stronger
she,swam,following,her,nose
the,river,smells,were,rich,and,wet,but,those,were,not,the,smells,that,pulled,her
she,paddled,after,the,sharp,red,whisper,of,cold,blood,the,sweet,cloying,stench,of,death
she,chased,them,as,she,had,often,chased,a,red,deer,through,the,trees,and,in,the,end,she,ran,them,down,and,her,jaw,closed,around,a,pale,white,arm
she,shook,it,to,make,it,move,but,there,was,only,death,and,blood,in,her,mouth
by,now,she,was,tiring,and,it,was,all,she,could,do,to,pull,the,body,back,to,shore
as,she,dragged,it,up,the,muddy,bank,one,of,her,little,brothers,came,prowling,his,tongue,lolling,from,his,mouth
she,had,to,snarl,to,drive,him,off,or,else,he,would,have,fed
only,then,did,she,stop,to,shake,the,water,from,her,fur
the,white,thing,lay,facedown,in,the,mud,her,dead,flesh,wrinkled,and,pale,cold,blood,trickling,from,her,throat
rise,she,thought
rise,and,eat,and,run,with,us
the,sound,of,horses,turned,her,head
men
they,were,coming,from,downwind,so,she,had,not,smelled,them,but,now,they,were,almost,here
men,on,horses,with,flapping,black,and,yellow,and,pink,wings,and,long,shiny,claws,in,hand
some,of,her,younger,brothers,bared,their,teeth,to,defend,the,food,they’d,found,but,she,snapped,at,them,until,they,scattered
that,was,the,way,of,the,wild
deer,and,hares,and,crows,fled,before,wolves,and,wolves,fled,from,men
she,abandoned,the,cold,white,prize,in,the,mud,where,she,had,dragged,it,and,ran,and,felt,no,shame
when,morning,came,the,hound,did,not,need,to,shout,at,arya,or,shake,her,awake
she,had,woken,before,him,for,a,change,and,even,watered,the,horses
they,broke,their,fast,in,silence,until,sandor,said,this,thing,about,your,mother
it,doesn’t,matter,arya,said,in,a,dull,voice
i,know,she’s,dead
i,saw,her,in,a,dream
the,hound,looked,at,her,a,long,time,then,nodded
no,more,was,said,of,it
they,rode,on,toward,the,mountains
in,the,higher,hills,they,came,upon,a,tiny,isolated,village,surrounded,by,grey-green,sentinels,and,tall,blue,soldier,pines,and,clegane,decided,to,risk,going,in
we,need,food,he,said,and,a,roof,over,our,heads
they’re,not,like,to,know,what,happened,at,the,twins,and,with,any,luck,they,won’t,know,me
the,villagers,were,building,a,wooden,palisade,around,their,homes,and,when,they,saw,the,breadth,of,the,hound’s,shoulders,they,offered,them,food,and,shelter,and,even,coin,for,work
if,there’s,wine,as,well,i’ll,do,it,he,growled,at,them
in,the,end,he,settled,for,ale,and,drank,himself,to,sleep,each,night
his,dream,of,selling,arya,to,lady,arryn,died,there,in,the,hills,though
there’s,frost,above,us,and,snow,in,the,high,passes,the,village,elder,said
if,you,don’t,freeze,or,starve,the,shadowcats,will,get,you,or,the,cave,bears
there’s,the,clans,as,well
the,burned,men,are,fearless,since,timett,one-eye,came,back,from,the,war
and,half,a,year,ago,gunthor,son,of,gurn,led,the,stone,crows,down,on,a,village,not,eight,miles,from,here
they,took,every,woman,and,every,scrap,of,grain,and,killed,half,the,men
they,have,steel,now,good,swords,and,mail,hauberks,and,they,watch,the,high,road,the,stone,crows,the,milk,snakes,the,sons,of,the,mist,all,of,them
might,be,you’d,take,a,few,with,you,but,in,the,end,they’d,kill,you,and,make,off,with,your,daughter
i’m,not,his,daughter,arya,might,have,shouted,if,she,hadn’t,felt,so,tired
she,was,no,one’s,daughter,now
she,was,no,one
not,arya,not,weasel,not,nan,nor,arry,nor,squab,not,even,lumpyhead
she,was,only,some,girl,who,ran,with,a,dog,by,day,and,dreamed,of,wolves,by,night
it,was,quiet,in,the,village
they,had,beds,stuffed,with,straw,and,not,too,many,lice,the,food,was,plain,but,filling,and,the,air,smelled,of,pines
all,the,same,arya,soon,decided,that,she,hated,it
the,villagers,were,cowards
none,of,them,would,even,look,at,the,hound’s,face,at,least,not,for,long
some,of,the,women,tried,to,put,her,in,a,dress,and,make,her,do,needlework,but,they,weren’t,lady,smallwood,and,she,was,having,none,of,it
and,there,was,one,girl,who,took,to,following,her,the,village,elder’s,daughter
she,was,of,an,age,with,arya,but,just,a,child,she,cried,if,she,skinned,a,knee,and,carried,a,stupid,cloth,doll,with,her,everywhere,she,went
the,doll,was,made,up,to,look,like,a,man-at-arms,sort,of,so,the,girl,called,him,ser,soldier,and,bragged,how,he,kept,her,safe
go,away,arya,told,her,half,a,hundred,times
just,leave,me,be
she,wouldn’t,though,so,finally,arya,took,the,doll,away,from,her,ripped,it,open,and,pulled,the,rag,stuffing,out,of,its,belly,with,a,finger
now,he,really,looks,like,a,soldier
she,said,before,she,threw,the,doll,in,a,brook
after,that,the,girl,stopped,pestering,her,and,arya,spent,her,days,grooming,craven,and,stranger,or,walking,in,the,woods
sometimes,she,would,find,a,stick,and,practice,her,needlework,but,then,she,would,remember,what,had,happened,at,the,twins,and,smash,it,against,a,tree,until,it,broke
might,be,we,should,stay,here,awhile,the,hound,told,her,after,a,fortnight
he,was,drunk,on,ale,but,more,brooding,than,sleepy
we’d,never,reach,the,eyrie,and,the,freys,will,still,be,hunting,survivors,in,the,riverlands
sounds,like,they,need,swords,here,with,these,clansmen,raiding
we,can,rest,up,maybe,find,a,way,to,get,a,letter,to,your,aunt
arya’s,face,darkened,when,she,heard,that
she,didn’t,want,to,stay,but,there,was,nowhere,to,go,either
the,next,morning,when,the,hound,went,off,to,chop,down,trees,and,haul,logs,she,crawled,back,into,bed
but,when,the,work,was,done,and,the,tall,wooden,palisade,was,finished,the,village,elder,made,it,plain,that,there,was,no,place,for,them
come,winter,we,will,be,hard,pressed,to,feed,our,own,he,explained
and,you
a,man,like,you,brings,blood,with,him
sandor’s,mouth,tightened
so,you,do,know,who,i,am
aye
we,don’t,get,travelers,here,that’s,so,but,we,go,to,market,and,to,fairs
we,know,about,king,joffrey’s,dog
when,these,stone,crows,come,calling,you,might,be,glad,to,have,a,dog
might,be
the,man,hesitated,then,gathered,up,his,courage
but,they,say,you,lost,your,belly,for,fighting,at,the,blackwater
they,say,i,know,what,they,say
sandor’s,voice,sounded,like,two,woodsaws,grinding,together
pay,me,and,we’ll,be,gone
when,they,left,the,hound,had,a,pouch,full,of,coppers,a,skin,of,sour,ale,and,a,new,sword
it,was,a,very,old,sword,if,truth,be,told,though,new,to,him
he,swapped,its,owner,the,longaxe,he’d,taken,at,the,twins,the,one,he’d,used,to,raise,the,lump,on,arya’s,head
the,ale,was,gone,in,less,than,a,day,but,clegane,sharpened,the,sword,every,night,cursing,the,man,he’d,swapped,with,for,every,nick,and,spot,of,rust
if,he,lost,his,belly,for,fighting,why,does,he,care,if,his,sword,is,sharp
it,was,not,a,question,arya,dared,ask,him,but,she,thought,on,it,a,lot
was,that,why,he’d,run,from,the,twins,and,carried,her,off
back,in,the,riverlands,they,found,that,the,rains,had,ebbed,away,and,the,flood,waters,had,begun,to,recede
the,hound,turned,south,back,toward,the,trident
we’ll,make,for,riverrun,he,told,arya,as,they,roasted,a,hare,he’d,killed
maybe,the,blackfish,wants,to,buy,himself,a,she-wolf
he,doesn’t,know,me
he,won’t,even,know,i’m,really,me
arya,was,tired,of,making,for,riverrun
she,had,been,making,for,riverrun,for,years,it,seemed,without,ever,getting,there
every,time,she,made,for,riverrun,she,ended,up,someplace,worse
he,won’t,give,you,any,ransom
he’ll,probably,just,hang,you
he’s,free,to,try
he,turned,the,spit
he,doesn’t,talk,like,he’s,lost,his,belly,for,fighting
i,know,where,we,could,go,arya,said
she,still,had,one,brother,left
jon,will,want,me,even,if,no,one,else,does
he’ll,call,me,little,sister,and,muss,my,hair
it,was,a,long,way,though,and,she,didn’t,think,she,could,get,there,by,herself
she,hadn’t,even,been,able,to,reach,riverrun
we,could,go,to,the,wall
sandor’s,laugh,was,half,a,growl
the,little,wolf,bitch,wants,to,join,the,night’s,watch,does,she
my,brother’s,on,the,wall,she,said,stubbornly
his,mouth,gave,a,twitch
the,wall’s,a,thousand,leagues,from,here
we’d,need,to,fight,through,the,bloody,freys,just,to,reach,the,neck
there’s,lizard,lions,in,those,swamps,that,eat,wolves,every,day,for,breakfast
and,if,we,did,reach,the,north,with,our,skins,intact,there’s,ironborn,in,half,the,castles,and,thousands,of,bloody,buggering,northmen,as,well
are,you,scared,of,them
she,asked
have,you,lost,your,belly,for,fighting
for,a,moment,she,thought,he,was,going,to,hit,her
by,then,the,hare,was,brown,though,skin,crackling,and,grease,popping,as,it,dripped,down,into,the,cookfire
sandor,took,it,off,the,stick,ripped,it,apart,with,his,big,hands,and,tossed,half,of,it,into,arya’s,lap
there’s,nothing,wrong,with,my,belly,he,said,as,he,pulled,off,a,leg,but,i,don’t,give,a,rat’s,arse,for,you,or,your,brother

tyrion,tyrion,ser,kevan,lannister,said,wearily,if,you,are,indeed,innocent,of,joffrey’s,death,you,should,have,no,difficulty,proving,it,at,trial
tyrion,turned,from,the,window
who,is,to,judge,me
justice,belongs,to,the,throne
the,king,is,dead,but,your,father,remains,hand
since,it,is,his,own,son,who,stands,accused,and,his,grandson,who,was,the,victim,he,has,asked,lord,tyrell,and,prince,oberyn,to,sit,in,judgment,with,him
tyrion,was,scarcely,reassured
mace,tyrell,had,been,joffrey’s,goodfather,however,briefly,and,the,red,viper,was

the,bitch,checks,my,moves,before,i,make,them
a,pity,she,didn’t,choose,a,kettleblack

i,shall,need,to,sleep,on,this
i,need,to,speak,with,bronn,and,soon
he,didn’t,want,to,think,about,what,this,was,like,to,cost,him
bronn,had,a,lofty,notion,of,what,his,skin,was,worth
does,cersei,have,witnesses,against,me
more,every,day
then,i,must,have,witnesses,of,my,own
tell,me,who,you,would,have,and,ser,addam,will,send,the,watch,to,bring,them,to,the,trial
i,would,sooner,find,them,myself

but,you,shall,not,leave,this,tower,except,to,go,to,trial
tyrion,would,not,demean,himself,by,begging
will,you,permit,my,squire,to,come,and,go
the,boy,podrick,payne
certainly,if,that,is,your,wish
i,shall,send,him,to,you
do,so
sooner,would,be,better,than,later,and,now,would,be,better,than,sooner
he,waddled,to,the,writing,table
but,when,he,heard,the,door,open,he,turned,back,and,said,uncle
ser,kevan,paused
yes
i,did,not,do,this
i,wish,i,could,believe,that,tyrion
when,the,door,closed,tyrion,lannister,pulled,himself,up,into,the,chair,sharpened,a,quill,and,pulled,a,blank,parchment
who,will,speak,for,me
he,dipped,his,quill,in,the,inkpot
the,sheet,was,still,maiden,when,podrick,payne,appeared,sometime,later
my,lord,the,boy,said
tyrion,put,down,the,quill

yes,my,lord
i,mean,no
i,won’t

he,went
he,had,not,returned,by,sunset,nor,by,moonrise
tyrion,fell,asleep,in,the,window,seat,to,wake,stiff,and,sore,at,dawn
a,serving,man,brought,porridge,and,apples,to,break,his,fast,with,a,horn,of,ale
he,ate,at,the,table,the,blank,parchment,before,him
an,hour,later,the,serving,man,returned,for,the,bowl
have,you,seen,my,squire
tyrion,asked,him
the,man,shook,his,head
sighing,he,turned,back,to,the,table,and,dipped,the,quill,again
sansa,he,wrote,upon,the,parchment
he,sat,staring,at,the,name,his,teeth,clenched,so,hard,they,hurt
assuming,joffrey,had,not,simply,choked,to,death,on,a,bit,of,food,which,even,tyrion,found,hard,to,swallow,sansa,must,have,poisoned,him
joff,practically,put,his,cup,down,in,her,lap,and,he’d,given,her,ample,reason
any,doubts,tyrion,might,have,had,vanished,when,his,wife,did
one,flesh,one,heart,one,soul
his,mouth,twisted
she,wasted,no,time,proving,how,much,those,vows,meant,to,her,did,she
well,what,did,you,expect,dwarf
and,yet
where,would,sansa,have,gotten,poison
he,could,not,believe,the,girl,had,acted,alone,in,this
do,i,really,want,to,find,her
would,the,judges,believe,that,tyrion’s,child,bride,had,poisoned,a,king,without,her,husband’s,knowledge
i,wouldn’t
cersei,would,insist,that,they,had,done,the,deed,together
even,so,he,gave,the,parchment,to,his,uncle,the,next,day
ser,kevan,frowned,at,it
lady,sansa,is,your,only,witness
i,will,think,of,others,in,time
best,think,of,them,now
the,judges,mean,to,begin,the,trial,three,days,hence
that’s,too,soon
you,have,me,shut,up,here,under,guard,how,am,i,to,find,witnesses,to,my,innocence
your,sister’s,had,no,difficulty,finding,witnesses,to,your,guilt
ser,kevan,rolled,up,the,parchment
ser,addam,has,men,hunting,for,your,wife
varys,has,offered,a,hundred,stags,for,word,of,her,whereabouts,and,a,hundred,dragons,for,the,girl,herself
if,the,girl,can,be,found,she,will,be,found,and,i,shall,bring,her,to,you
i,see,no,harm,in,husband,and,wife,sharing,the,same,cell,and,giving,comfort,to,one,another
you,are,too,kind
have,you,seen,my,squire
i,sent,him,to,you,yesterday
did,he,not,come
he,came,tyrion,admitted,and,then,he,went
i,shall,send,him,to,you,again
but,it,was,the,next,morning,before,podrick,payne,returned
he,stepped,inside,the,room,hesitantly,with,fear,written,all,over,his,face
bronn,came,in,behind,him
the,sellsword,knight,wore,a,jerkin,studded,with,silver,and,a,heavy,riding,cloak,with,a,pair,of,fine-tooled,leather,gloves,thrust,through,his,swordbelt
one,look,at,bronn’s,face,gave,tyrion,a,queasy,feeling,in,the,pit,of,his,stomach
it,took,you,long,enough
the,boy,begged,or,i,wouldn’t,have,come,at,all
i,am,expected,at,castle,stokeworth,for,supper
stokeworth
tyrion,hopped,from,the,bed
and,pray,what,is,there,for,you,in,stokeworth
a,bride
bronn,smiled,like,a,wolf,contemplating,a,lost,lamb
i’m,to,wed,lollys,the,day,after,next
lollys
perfect,bloody,perfect
lady,tanda’s,lackwit,daughter,gets,a,knightly,husband,and,a,father,of,sorts,for,the,bastard,in,her,belly,and,ser,bronn,of,the,blackwater,climbs,another,rung
it,had,cersei’s,stinking,fingers,all,over,it
my,bitch,sister,has,sold,you,a,lame,horse
the,girl’s,dim-witted
if,i,wanted,wits,i’d,marry,you
lollys,is,big,with,another,man’s,child
and,when,she,pops,him,out,i’ll,get,her,big,with,mine
she’s,not,even,heir,to,stokeworth,tyrion,pointed,out
she,has,an,elder,sister
falyse
a,married,sister
married,ten,years,and,still,barren,said,bronn
her,lord,husband,shuns,her,bed
it’s,said,he,prefers,virgins
he,could,prefer,goats,and,it,wouldn’t,matter
the,lands,will,still,pass,to,his,wife,when,lady,tanda,dies
unless,falyse,should,die,before,her,mother
tyrion,wondered,whether,cersei,had,any,notion,of,the,sort,of,serpent,she’d,given,lady,tanda,to,suckle
and,if,she,does,would,she,care
why,are,you,here,then
bronn,shrugged
you,once,told,me,that,if,anyone,ever,asked,me,to,sell,you,out,you’d,double,the,price
yes
is,it,two,wives,you,want,or,two,castles
one,of,each,would,serve
but,if,you,want,me,to,kill,gregor,clegane,for,you,it,had,best,be,a,damned,big,castle
the,seven,kingdoms,were,full,of,highborn,maidens,but,even,the,oldest,poorest,and,ugliest,spinster,in,the,realm,would,balk,at,wedding,such,lowborn,scum,as,bronn
unless,she,was,soft,of,body,and,soft,of,head,with,a,fatherless,child,in,her,belly,from,having,been,raped,half,a,hundred,times
lady,tanda,had,been,so,desperate,to,find,a,husband,for,lollys,that,she,had,even,pursued,tyrion,for,a,time,and,that,had,been,before,half,of,king’s,landing,enjoyed,her
no,doubt,cersei,had,sweetened,the,offer,somehow,and,bronn,was,a,knight,now,which,made,him,a,suitable,match,for,a,younger,daughter,of,a,minor,house
i,find,myself,woefully,short,of,both,castles,and,highborn,maidens,at,the,moment,tyrion,admitted
but,i,can,offer,you,gold,and,gratitude,as,before
i,have,gold
what,can,i,buy,with,gratitude
you,might,be,surprised
a,lannister,pays,his,debts
your,sister,is,a,lannister,too
my,lady,wife,is,heir,to,winterfell
should,i,emerge,from,this,with,my,head,still,on,my,shoulders,i,may,one,day,rule,the,north,in,her,name
i,could,carve,you,out,a,big,piece,of,it
if,and,when,and,might,be,said,bronn
and,it’s,bloody,cold,up,there
lollys,is,soft,warm,and,close
i,could,be,poking,her,two,nights,hence
not,a,prospect,i,would,relish
is,that,so
bronn,grinned
admit,it,imp
given,a,choice,between,fucking,lollys,and,fighting,the,mountain,you’d,have,your,breeches,down,and,cock,up,before,a,man,could,blink
he,knows,me,too,bloody,well
tyrion,tried,a,different,tack
i’d,heard,that,ser,gregor,was,wounded,on,the,red,fork,and,again,at,duskendale
the,wounds,are,bound,to,slow,him
bronn,looked,annoyed
he,was,never,fast
only,freakish,big,and,freakish,strong
i’ll,grant,you,he’s,quicker,than,you’d,expect,for,a,man,that,size
he,has,a,monstrous,long,reach,and,doesn’t,seem,to,feel,blows,the,way,a,normal,man,would
does,he,frighten,you,so,much
asked,tyrion,hoping,to,provoke,him
if,he,didn’t,frighten,me,i’d,be,a,bloody,fool
bronn,gave,a,shrug
might,be,i,could,take,him
dance,around,him,until,he,was,so,tired,of,hacking,at,me,that,he,couldn’t,lift,his,sword
get,him,off,his,feet,somehow
when,they’re,flat,on,their,backs,it,don’t,matter,how,tall,they,are
even,so,it’s,chancy
one,misstep,and,i’m,dead
why,should,i,risk,it
i,like,you,well,enough,ugly,little,whoreson,that,you,are
but,if,i,fight,your,battle,i,lose,either,way
either,the,mountain,spills,my,guts,or,i,kill,him,and,lose,stokeworth
i,sell,my,sword,i,don’t,give,it,away
i’m,not,your,bloody,brother
no,said,tyrion,sadly
you’re,not
he,waved,a,hand
begone,then
run,to,stokeworth,and,lady,lollys
may,you,find,more,joy,in,your,marriage,bed,than,i,ever,found,in,mine
bronn,hesitated,at,the,door
what,will,you,do,imp
kill,gregor,myself
won’t,that,make,for,a,jolly,song
i,hope,i,hear,them,sing,it
bronn,grinned,one,last,time,and,walked,out,of,the,door,the,castle,and,his,life
pod,shuffled,his,feet
i’m,sorry
why
is,it,your,fault,that,bronn’s,an,insolent,black-hearted,rogue
he’s,always,been,an,insolent,black-hearted,rogue
that’s,what,i,liked,about,him
tyrion,poured,himself,a,cup,of,wine,and,took,it,to,the,window,seat
outside,the,day,was,grey,and,rainy,but,the,prospect,was,still,more,cheerful,than,his
he,could,send,podrick,payne,questing,after,shagga,he,supposed,but,there,were,so,many,hiding,places,in,the,deep,of,the,kingswood,that,outlaws,often,evaded,capture,for,decades
and,pod,sometimes,has,difficulty,finding,the,kitchens,when,i,send,him,down,for,cheese
timett,son,of,timett,would,likely,be,back,in,the,mountains,of,the,moon,by,now
and,despite,what,he’d,told,bronn,going,up,against,ser,gregor,clegane,in,his,own,person,would,be,a,bigger,farce,than,joffrey’s,jousting,dwarfs
he,did,not,intend,to,die,with,gales,of,laughter,ringing,in,his,ears
so,much,for,trial,by,combat
ser,kevan,paid,him,another,call,later,that,day,and,again,the,day,after
sansa,had,not,been,found,his,uncle,informed,him,politely
nor,the,fool,ser,dontos,who’d,vanished,the,same,night
did,tyrion,have,any,more,witnesses,he,wished,to,summon
he,did,not
how,do,i,bloody,well,prove,i,didn’t,poison,the,wine,when,a,thousand,people,saw,me,fill,joff’s,cup
he,did,not,sleep,at,all,that,night
instead,he,lay,in,the,dark,staring,up,at,the,canopy,and,counting,his,ghosts
he,saw,tysha,smiling,as,she,kissed,him,saw,sansa,naked,and,shivering,in,fear
he,saw,joffrey,clawing,his,throat,the,blood,running,down,his,neck,as,his,face,turned,black
he,saw,cersei’s,eyes,bronn’s,wolfish,smile,shae’s,wicked,grin
even,thought,of,shae,could,not,arouse,him
he,fondled,himself,thinking,that,perhaps,if,he,woke,his,cock,and,satisfied,it,he,might,rest,more,easily,afterward,but,it,was,no,good
and,then,it,was,dawn,and,time,for,his,trial,to,begin
it,was,not,ser,kevan,who,came,for,him,that,morning,but,ser,addam,marbrand,with,a,dozen,gold,cloaks
tyrion,had,broken,his,fast,on,boiled,eggs,burned,bacon,and,fried,bread,and,dressed,in,his,finest
ser,addam,he,said
i,had,thought,my,father,might,send,the,kingsguard,to,escort,me,to,trial
i,am,still,a,member,of,the,royal,family,am,i,not
you,are,my,lord,but,i,fear,that,most,of,the,kingsguard,stand,witness,against,you
lord,tywin,felt,it,would,not,be,proper,for,them,to,serve,as,your,guards
gods,forbid,we,do,anything,improper
please,lead,on
he,was,to,be,tried,in,the,throne,room,where,joffrey,had,died
as,ser,addam,marched,him,through,the,towering,bronze,doors,and,down,the,long,carpet,he,felt,the,eyes,upon,him
hundreds,had,crowded,in,to,see,him,judged
at,least,he,hoped,that,was,why,they,had,come
for,all,i,know,they’re,all,witnesses,against,me
he,spied,queen,margaery,up,in,the,gallery,pale,and,beautiful,in,her,mourning
twice,wed,and,twice,widowed,and,only,sixteen
her,mother,stood,tall,to,one,side,of,her,her,grandmother,small,on,the,other,with,her,ladies,in,waiting,and,her,father’s,household,knights,packing,the,rest,of,the,gallery
the,dais,still,stood,beneath,the,empty,iron,throne,though,all,but,one,table,had,been,removed
behind,it,sat,stout,lord,mace,tyrell,in,a,gold,mantle,over,green,and,slender,prince,oberyn,martell,in,flowing,robes,of,striped,orange,yellow,and,scarlet
lord,tywin,lannister,sat,between,them
perhaps,there’s,hope,for,me,yet
the,dornishman,and,the,highgardener,despised,each,other
if,i,can,find,a,way,to,use,that
the,high,septon,began,with,a,prayer,asking,the,father,above,to,guide,them,to,justice
when,he,was,done,the,father,below,leaned,forward,to,say,tyrion,did,you,kill,king,joffrey
he,would,not,waste,a,heartbeat
no
well,that’s,a,relief,said,oberyn,martell,dryly
did,sansa,stark,do,it,then
lord,tyrell,demanded
i,would,have,if,i’d,been,her
yet,wherever,sansa,was,and,whatever,her,part,in,this,might,have,been,she,remained,his,wife
he,had,wrapped,the,cloak,of,his,protection,about,her,shoulders,though,he’d,had,to,stand,on,a,fool’s,back,to,do,it
the,gods,killed,joffrey
he,choked,on,his,pigeon,pie
lord,tyrell,reddened
you,would,blame,the,bakers
them,or,the,pigeons
just,leave,me,out,of,it
tyrion,heard,nervous,laughter,and,knew,he’d,made,a,mistake
guard,your,tongue,you,little,fool,before,it,digs,your,grave
there,are,witnesses,against,you,lord,tywin,said
we,shall,hear,them,first
then,you,may,present,your,own,witnesses
you,are,to,speak,only,with,our,leave
there,was,naught,that,tyrion,could,do,but,nod
ser,addam,had,told,it,true,the,first,man,ushered,in,was,ser,balon,swann,of,the,kingsguard
lord,hand,he,began,after,the,high,septon,had,sworn,him,to,speak,only,truth,i,had,the,honor,to,fight,beside,your,son,on,the,bridge,of,ships
he,is,a,brave,man,for,all,his,size,and,i,will,not,believe,he,did,this,thing
a,murmur,went,through,the,hall,and,tyrion,wondered,what,mad,game,cersei,was,playing
why,offer,a,witness,that,believes,me,innocent
he,soon,learned
ser,balon,spoke,reluctantly,of,how,he,had,pulled,tyrion,away,from,joffrey,on,the,day,of,the,riot
he,did,strike,his,grace,that’s,so
it,was,a,fit,of,wroth,no,more
a,summer,storm
the,mob,near,killed,us,all

when,did,i,make,so,many,enemies

at,least,galyeon,of,cuy,had,not,set,his,account,to,music,or,else,there,might,have,been,seventy-seven,bloody,verses,to,it
when,his,uncle,called,that,night,after,supper,his,manner,was,cold,and,distant

not,as,such,no
unless,you’ve,found,my,wife
his,uncle,shook,his,head
it,would,seem,the,trial,is,going,very,badly,for,you
oh,do,you,think,so
i,hadn’t,noticed

varys,has,not,come
nor,will,he
on,the,morrow,he,testifies,against,you
lovely
i,see
he,shifted,in,his,seat
i,am,curious
you,were,always,a,fair,man,uncle
what,convinced,you
why,steal,pycelle’s,poisons,if,not,to,use,them
ser,kevan,said,bluntly
and,lady,merryweather,saw,nothing
there,was,nothing,to,see
but,how,do,i,prove,that
how,do,i,prove,anything,penned,up,here
perhaps,the,time,has,come,for,you,to,confess
even,through,the,thick,stone,walls,of,the,red,keep,tyrion,could,hear,the,steady,wash,of,rain
say,that,again,uncle
i,could,swear,you,urged,me,to,confess
if,you,were,to,admit,your,guilt,before,the,throne,and,repent,of,your,crime,your,father,would,withhold,the,sword
you,would,be,permitted,to,take,the,black
tyrion,laughed,in,his,face
those,were,the,same,terms,cersei,offered,eddard,stark
we,all,know,how,that,ended
your,father,had,no,part,in,that
that,much,was,true,at,least
castle,black,teems,with,murderers,thieves,and,rapists,tyrion,said,but,i,don’t,recall,meeting,many,regicides,while,i,was,there
you,expect,me,to,believe,that,if,i,admit,to,being,a,kinslayer,and,kingslayer,my,father,will,simply,nod,forgive,me,and,pack,me,off,to,the,wall,with,some,warm,woolen,smallclothes
he,hooted,rudely
naught,was,said,of,forgiveness,ser,kevan,said,sternly
a,confession,would,put,this,matter,to,rest
it,is,for,that,reason,your,father,sends,me,with,this,offer
thank,him,kindly,for,me,uncle,said,tyrion,but,tell,him,i,am,not,presently,in,a,confessing,mood
were,i,you,i’d,change,my,mood
your,sister,wants,your,head,and,lord,tyrell,at,least,is,inclined,to,give,it,to,her
so,one,of,my,judges,has,already,condemned,me,without,hearing,a,word,in,my,defense
it,was,no,more,than,he,expected
will,i,still,be,allowed,to,speak,and,present,witnesses
you,have,no,witnesses,his,uncle,reminded,him
tyrion,if,you,are,guilty,of,this,enormity,the,wall,is,a,kinder,fate,than,you,deserve
and,if,you,are,blameless
there,is,fighting,in,the,north,i,know,but,even,so,it,will,be,a,safer,place,for,you,than,king’s,landing,whatever,the,outcome,of,this,trial
the,mob,is,convinced,of,your,guilt
were,you,so,foolish,as,to,venture,out,into,the,streets,they,would,tear,you,limb,from,limb
i,can,see,how,much,that,prospect,upsets,you
you,are,my,brother’s,son
you,might,remind,him,of,that
do,you,think,he,would,allow,you,to,take,the,black,if,you,were,not,his,own,blood,and,joanna’s
tywin,seems,a,hard,man,to,you,i,know,but,he,is,no,harder,than,he’s,had,to,be
our,own,father,was,gentle,and,amiable,but,so,weak,his,bannermen,mocked,him,in,their,cups
some,saw,fit,to,defy,him,openly
other,lords,borrowed,our,gold,and,never,troubled,to,repay,it
at,court,they,japed,of,toothless,lions
even,his,mistress,stole,from,him
a,woman,scarcely,one,step,above,a,whore,and,she,helped,herself,to,my,mother’s,jewels
it,fell,to,tywin,to,restore,house,lannister,to,its,proper,place
just,as,it,fell,to,him,to,rule,this,realm,when,he,was,no,more,than,twenty
he,bore,that,heavy,burden,for,twenty,years,and,all,it,earned,him,was,a,mad,king’s,envy
instead,of,the,honor,he,deserved,he,was,made,to,suffer,slights,beyond,count,yet,he,gave,the,seven,kingdoms,peace,plenty,and,justice
he,is,a,just,man
you,would,be,wise,to,trust,him
tyrion,blinked,in,astonishment
ser,kevan,had,always,been,solid,stolid,pragmatic,he,had,never,heard,him,speak,with,such,fervor,before
you,love,him
he,is,my,brother
i
i,will,think,on,what,you’ve,said
think,carefully,then
and,quickly
he,thought,of,little,else,that,night,but,come,morning,was,no,closer,to,deciding,if,his,father,could,be,trusted
a,servant,brought,him,porridge,and,honey,to,break,his,fast,but,all,he,could,taste,was,bile,at,the,thought,of,confession
they,will,call,me,kinslayer,till,the,end,of,my,days
for,a,thousand,years,or,more,if,i,am,remembered,at,all,it,will,be,as,the,monstrous,dwarf,who,poisoned,his,young,nephew,at,his,wedding,feast
the,thought,made,him,so,bloody,angry,that,he,flung,the,bowl,and,spoon,across,the,room,and,left,a,smear,of,porridge,on,the,wall
ser,addam,marbrand,looked,at,it,curiously,when,he,came,to,escort,tyrion,to,trial,but,had,the,good,grace,not,to,inquire
lord,varys,the,herald,said,master,of,whisperers
powdered,primped,and,smelling,of,rosewater,the,spider,rubbed,his,hands,one,over,the,other,all,the,time,he,spoke
washing,my,life,away,tyrion,thought,as,he,listened,to,the,eunuch’s,mournful,account,of,how,the,imp,had,schemed,to,part,joffrey,from,the,hound’s,protection,and,spoken,with,bronn,of,the,benefits,of,having,tommen,as,king
half-truths,are,worth,more,than,outright,lies
and,unlike,the,others,varys,had,documents,parchments,painstakingly,filled,with,notes,details,dates,whole,conversations
so,much,material,that,its,recitation,took,all,day,and,so,much,of,it,damning
varys,confirmed,tyrion’s,midnight,visit,to,grand,maester,pycelle’s,chambers,and,the,theft,of,his,poisons,and,potions,confirmed,the,threat,he’d,made,to,cersei,the,night,of,their,supper,confirmed,every,bloody,thing,but,the,poisoning,itself
when,prince,oberyn,asked,him,how,he,could,possibly,know,all,this,not,having,been,present,at,any,of,these,events,the,eunuch,only,giggled,and,said,my,little,birds,told,me
knowing,is,their,purpose,and,mine
how,do,i,question,a,little,bird
thought,tyrion
i,should,have,had,the,eunuch’s,head,off,my,first,day,in,king’s,landing
damn,him
and,damn,me,for,whatever,trust,i,put,in,him
have,we,heard,it,all
lord,tywin,asked,his,daughter,as,varys,left,the,hall
almost,said,cersei
i,beg,your,leave,to,bring,one,final,witness,before,you,on,the,morrow
as,you,wish,lord,tywin,said
oh,good,thought,tyrion,savagely
after,this,farce,of,a,trial,execution,will,almost,come,as,a,relief
that,night,as,he,sat,by,his,window,drinking,he,heard,voices,outside,his,door
ser,kevan,come,for,my,answer,he,thought,at,once,but,it,was,not,his,uncle,who,entered
tyrion,rose,to,give,prince,oberyn,a,mocking,bow
are,judges,permitted,to,visit,the,accused
princes,are,permitted,to,go,where,they,will
or,so,i,told,your,guards
the,red,viper,took,a,seat
my,father,will,be,displeased,with,you
the,happiness,of,tywin,lannister,has,never,been,high,on,my,list,of,concerns
is,it,dornish,wine,you’re,drinking
from,the,arbor
oberyn,made,a,face

did,you,poison,him
no
did,you
the,prince,smiled
do,all,dwarfs,have,tongues,like,yours
someone,is,going,to,cut,it,out,one,of,these,days
you,are,not,the,first,to,tell,me,that
perhaps,i,should,cut,it,out,myself,it,seems,to,make,no,end,of,trouble
so,i’ve,seen
i,think,i,may,drink,some,of,lord,redwyne’s,grape,juice,after,all
as,you,like
tyrion,served,him,a,cup
the,man,took,a,sip,sloshed,it,about,in,his,mouth,and,swallowed
it,will,serve,for,the,moment
i,will,send,you,up,some,strong,dornish,wine,on,the,morrow
he,took,another,sip
i,have,turned,up,that,golden-haired,whore,i,was,hoping,for
so,you,found,chataya’s
at,chataya’s,i,bedded,the,black-skinned,girl
alayaya,i,believe,she,is,called
exquisite,despite,the,stripes,on,her,back
but,the,whore,i,referred,to,is,your,sister
has,she,seduced,you,yet
tyrion,asked,unsurprised
oberyn,laughed,aloud
no,but,she,will,if,i,meet,her,price
the,queen,has,even,hinted,at,marriage
her,grace,needs,another,husband,and,who,better,than,a,prince,of,dorne
ellaria,believes,i,should,accept
just,the,thought,of,cersei,in,our,bed,makes,her,wet,the,randy,wench
and,we,should,not,even,need,to,pay,the,dwarf’s,penny
all,your,sister,requires,from,me,is,one,head,somewhat,overlarge,and,missing,a,nose
and
said,tyrion,waiting
by,way,of,answer,prince,oberyn,swirled,his,wine,and,said,when,the,young,dragon,conquered,dorne,so,long,ago,he,left,the,lord,of,highgarden,to,rule,us,after,the,submission,of,sunspear
this,tyrell,moved,with,his,tail,from,keep,to,keep,chasing,rebels,and,making,certain,that,our,knees,stayed,bent
he,would,arrive,in,force,take,a,castle,for,his,own,stay,a,moon’s,turn,and,ride,on,to,the,next,castle
it,was,his,custom,to,turn,the,lords,out,of,their,own,chambers,and,take,their,beds,for,himself
one,night,he,found,himself,beneath,a,heavy,velvet,canopy
a,sash,hung,down,near,the,pillows,should,he,wish,to,summon,a,wench
he,had,a,taste,for,dornish,women,this,lord,tyrell,and,who,can,blame,him
so,he,pulled,upon,the,sash,and,when,he,did,the,canopy,above,him,split,open,and,a,hundred,red,scorpions,fell,down,upon,his,head
his,death,lit,a,fire,that,soon,swept,across,dorne,undoing,all,the,young,dragon’s,victories,in,a,fortnight
the,kneeling,men,stood,up,and,we,were,free,again
i,know,the,tale,said,tyrion
what,of,it
just,this
if,i,should,ever,find,a,sash,beside,my,own,bed,and,pull,on,it,i,would,sooner,have,the,scorpions,fall,upon,me,than,the,queen,in,all,her,naked,beauty
tyrion,grinned
we,have,that,much,in,common,then
to,be,sure,i,have,much,to,thank,your,sister,for
if,not,for,her,accusation,at,the,feast,it,might,well,be,you,judging,me,instead,of,me,judging,you
the,prince’s,eyes,were,dark,with,amusement
who,knows,more,of,poison,than,the,red,viper,of,dorne,after,all
who,has,better,reason,to,want,to,keep,the,tyrells,far,from,the,crown
and,with,joffrey,in,his,grave,by,dornish,law,the,iron,throne,should,pass,next,to,his,sister,myrcella,who,as,it,happens,is,betrothed,to,mine,own,nephew,thanks,to,you
dornish,law,does,not,apply
tyrion,had,been,so,ensnared,in,his,own,troubles,that,he’d,never,stopped,to,consider,the,succession
my,father,will,crown,tommen,count,on,that
he,may,indeed,crown,tommen,here,in,king’s,landing
which,is,not,to,say,that,my,brother,may,not,crown,myrcella,down,in,sunspear
will,your,father,make,war,on,your,niece,on,behalf,of,your,nephew
will,your,sister
he,gave,a,shrug
perhaps,i,should,marry,queen,cersei,after,all,on,the,condition,that,she,support,her,daughter,over,her,son
do,you,think,she,would
never,tyrion,wanted,to,say,but,the,word,caught,in,his,throat
cersei,always,resented,being,excluded,from,power,on,account,of,her,sex
if,dornish,law,applied,in,the,west,she,would,be,the,heir,to,casterly,rock,in,her,own,right
she,and,jaime,were,twins,but,cersei,had,come,first,into,the,world,and,that,was,all,it,took
by,championing,myrcella’s,cause,she,would,be,championing,her,own
i,do,not,know,how,my,sister,would,choose,between,tommen,and,myrcella,he,admitted
it,makes,no,matter
my,father,will,never,give,her,that,choice
your,father,said,prince,oberyn,may,not,live,forever
something,about,the,way,he,said,it,made,the,hairs,on,the,back,of,tyrion’s,neck,bristle
suddenly,he,was,mindful,of,elia,again,and,all,that,oberyn,had,said,as,they,crossed,the,field,of,ashes
he,wants,the,head,that,spoke,the,words,not,just,the,hand,that,swung,the,sword
it,is,not,wise,to,speak,such,treasons,in,the,red,keep,my,prince
the,little,birds,are,listening
let,them
is,it,treason,to,say,a,man,is,mortal
valar,morghulis,was,how,they,said,it,in,valyria,of,old
all,men,must,die
and,the,doom,came,and,proved,it,true
the,dornishman,went,to,the,window,to,gaze,out,into,the,night
it,is,being,said,that,you,have,no,witnesses,for,us
i,was,hoping,one,look,at,this,sweet,face,of,mine,would,be,enough,to,persuade,you,all,of,my,innocence

what,was,cersei,thinking,when,she,gave,this,one,a,white,cloak
at,least,kettleblack,would,likely,know,how,to,use,a,sword,and,shield

there,is,only,one,question,i,would,put,to,you
you,served,us,loyally,it’s,true
but,varys,tells,me,that,your,brother,rode,with,renly,and,then,stannis,whilst,your,lord,father,chose,not,to,call,his,banners,at,all,and,remained,behind,the,walls,of,stonehelm,all,through,the,fighting
my,father,is,an,old,man,my,lord
well,past,forty
his,fighting,days,are,done
and,your,brother
donnel,was,wounded,in,the,battle,and,yielded,to,ser,elwood,harte
he,was,ransomed,afterward,and,pledged,his,fealty,to,king,joffrey,as,did,many,other,captives
so,he,did,said,jaime
even,so
renly,stannis,joffrey,tommen,how,did,he,come,to,omit,balon,greyjoy,and,robb,stark
he,might,have,been,the,first,knight,in,the,realm,to,swear,fealty,to,all,six,kings

you,have,my,word
it’s,not,ser,donnel,the,constant,who,concerns,me
it’s,you
jaime,leaned,forward
what,will,you,do,if,brave,ser,donnel,gives,his,sword,to,yet,another,usurper,and,one,day,comes,storming,into,the,throne,room
and,there,you,stand,all,in,white,between,your,king,and,your,blood
what,will,you,do
i
my,lord,that,will,never,happen
it,happened,to,me,jaime,said

you,have,no,answer
my,lord
ser,balon,drew,himself,up
on,my,sword,on,my,honor,on,my,father’s,name,i,swear
i,shall,not,do,as,you,did
jaime,laughed
good
return,to,your,duties
and,tell,ser,donnel,to,add,a,weathervane,to,his,shield
and,then,he,was,alone,with,the,knight,of,flowers
slim,as,a,sword,lithe,and,fit,ser,loras,tyrell,wore,a,snowy,linen,tunic,and,white,wool,breeches,with,a,gold,belt,around,his,waist,and,a,gold,rose,clasping,his,fine,silk,cloak
his,hair,was,a,soft,brown,tumble,and,his,eyes,were,brown,as,well,and,bright,with,insolence
he,thinks,this,is,a,tourney,and,his,tilt,has,just,been,called
seventeen,and,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,said,jaime
you,must,be,proud
prince,aemon,the,dragonknight,was,seventeen,when,he,was,named
did,you,know,that
yes,my,lord
and,did,you,know,that,i,was,fifteen
that,as,well,my,lord
he,smiled
jaime,hated,that,smile
i,was,better,than,you,ser,loras
i,was,bigger,i,was,stronger,and,i,was,quicker
and,now,you’re,older,the,boy,said
my,lord
he,had,to,laugh
this,is,too,absurd
tyrion,would,mock,me,unmercifully,if,he,could,hear,me,now,comparing,cocks,with,this,green,boy
older,and,wiser,ser
you,should,learn,from,me
as,you,learned,from,ser,boros,and,ser,meryn
that,arrow,hit,too,close,to,the,mark
i,learned,from,the,white,bull,and,barristan,the,bold,jaime,snapped
i,learned,from,ser,arthur,dayne,the,sword,of,the,morning,who,could,have,slain,all,five,of,you,with,his,left,hand,while,he,was,taking,with,a,piss,with,the,right
i,learned,from,prince,lewyn,of,dorne,and,ser,oswell,whent,and,ser,jonothor,darry,good,men,every,one
dead,men,every,one
he’s,me,jaime,realized,suddenly
i,am,speaking,to,myself,as,i,was,all,cocksure,arrogance,and,empty,chivalry
this,is,what,it,does,to,you,to,be,too,good,too,young
as,in,a,swordfight,sometimes,it,is,best,to,try,a,different,stroke
it’s,said,you,fought,magnificently,in,the,battle
almost,as,well,as,lord,renly’s,ghost,beside,you
a,sworn,brother,has,no,secrets,from,his,lord,commander
tell,me,ser
who,was,wearing,renly’s,armor
for,a,moment,loras,tyrell,looked,as,though,he,might,refuse,but,in,the,end,he,remembered,his,vows
my,brother,he,said,sullenly
renly,was,taller,than,me,and,broader,in,the,chest
his,armor,was,too,loose,on,me,but,it,suited,garlan,well
was,the,masquerade,your,notion,or,his
lord,littlefinger,suggested,it
he,said,it,would,frighten,stannis’s,ignorant,men-at-arms
and,so,it,did
and,some,knights,and,lordlings,too
well,you,gave,the,singers,something,to,make,rhymes,about,i,suppose,that’s,not,to,be,despised
what,did,you,do,with,renly
i,buried,him,with,mine,own,hands,in,a,place,he,showed,me,once,when,i,was,a,squire,at,storm’s,end
no,one,shall,ever,find,him,there,to,disturb,his,rest
he,looked,at,jaime,defiantly
i,will,defend,king,tommen,with,all,my,strength,i,swear,it
i,will,give,my,life,for,his,if,need,be
but,i,will,never,betray,renly,by,word,or,deed
he,was,the,king,that,should,have,been
he,was,the,best,of,them
the,best,dressed,perhaps,jaime,thought,but,for,once,he,did,not,say,it
the,arrogance,had,gone,out,of,ser,loras,the,moment,he,began,to,speak,of,renly
he,answered,truly
he,is,proud,and,reckless,and,full,of,piss,but,he,is,not,false
not,yet
as,you,say
one,more,thing,and,you,may,return,to,your,duties
yes,my,lord
i,still,have,brienne,of,tarth,in,a,tower,cell
the,boy’s,mouth,hardened
a,black,cell,would,be,better
you,are,certain,that’s,what,she,deserves
she,deserves,death
i,told,renly,that,a,woman,had,no,place,in,the,rainbow,guard
she,won,the,mêlée,with,a,trick
i,seem,to,recall,another,knight,who,was,fond,of,tricks
he,once,rode,a,mare,in,heat,against,a,foe,mounted,on,a,bad-tempered,stallion
what,sort,of,trickery,did,brienne,use
ser,loras,flushed
she,leapt
it,makes,no,matter
she,won,i,grant,her,that
his,grace,put,a,rainbow,cloak,around,her,shoulders
and,she,killed,him,or,let,him,die
a,large,difference,there
the,difference,between,my,crime,and,the,shame,of,boros,blount
she,had,sworn,to,protect,him
ser,emmon,cuy,ser,robar,royce,ser,parmen,crane,they’d,sworn,as,well
how,could,anyone,have,hurt,him,with,her,inside,his,tent,and,the,others,just,outside
unless,they,were,part,of,it
there,were,five,of,you,at,the,wedding,feast,jaime,pointed,out
how,could,joffrey,die
unless,you,were,part,of,it
ser,loras,drew,himself,up,stiffly
there,was,nothing,we,could,have,done
the,wench,says,the,same
she,grieves,for,renly,as,you,do
i,promise,you,i,never,grieve,for,aerys
brienne’s,ugly,and,pighead,stubborn
but,she,lacks,the,wits,to,be,a,liar,and,she,is,loyal,past,the,point,of,sense
she,swore,an,oath,to,bring,me,to,king’s,landing,and,here,i,sit
this,hand,i,lost
well,that,was,my,doing,as,much,as,hers
considering,all,she,did,to,protect,me,i,have,no,doubt,that,she,would,have,fought,for,renly,had,there,been,a,foe,to,fight
but,a,shadow
jaime,shook,his,head
draw,your,sword,ser,loras
show,me,how,you’d,fight,a,shadow
i,should,like,to,see,that
ser,loras,made,no,move,to,rise
she,fled,he,said
she,and,catelyn,stark,they,left,him,in,his,blood,and,ran
why,would,they,if,it,was,not,their,work
he,stared,at,the,table
renly,gave,me,the,van
otherwise,it,would,have,been,me,helping,him,don,his,armor
he,often,entrusted,that,task,to,me
we,had
we,had,prayed,together,that,night
i,left,him,with,her
ser,parmen,and,ser,emmon,were,guarding,the,tent,and,ser,robar,royce,was,there,as,well
ser,emmon,swore,brienne,had
although
yes
jaime,prompted,sensing,a,doubt
the,gorget,was,cut,through
one,clean,stroke,through,a,steel,gorget
renly’s,armor,was,the,best,the,finest,steel
how,could,she,do,that
i,tried,myself,and,it,was,not,possible
she’s,freakish,strong,for,a,woman,but,even,the,mountain,would,have,needed,a,heavy,axe
and,why,armor,him,and,then,cut,his,throat
he,gave,jaime,a,confused,look
if,not,her,though
how,could,it,be,a,shadow
ask,her
jaime,came,to,a,decision
go,to,her,cell
ask,your,questions,and,hear,her,answers
if,you,are,still,convinced,that,she,murdered,lord,renly,i,will,see,that,she,answers,for,it
the,choice,will,be,yours
accuse,her,or,release,her
all,i,ask,is,that,you,judge,her,fairly,on,your,honor,as,a,knight
ser,loras,stood
i,shall
on,my,honor
we,are,done,then
the,younger,man,started,for,the,door
but,there,he,turned,back
renly,thought,she,was,absurd
a,woman,dressed,in,man’s,mail,pretending,to,be,a,knight
if,he’d,ever,seen,her,in,pink,satin,and,myrish,lace,he,would,not,have,complained
i,asked,him,why,he,kept,her,close,if,he,thought,her,so,grotesque
he,said,that,all,his,other,knights,wanted,things,of,him,castles,or,honors,or,riches,but,all,that,brienne,wanted,was,to,die,for,him
when,i,saw,him,all,bloody,with,her,fled,and,the,three,of,them,unharmed
if,she’s,innocent,then,robar,and,emmon
he,could,not,seem,to,say,the,words
jaime,had,not,stopped,to,consider,that,aspect,of,it
i,would,have,done,the,same,ser,the,lie,came,easy,but,ser,loras,seemed,grateful,for,it
when,he,was,gone,the,lord,commander,sat,alone,in,the,white,room,wondering
the,knight,of,flowers,had,been,so,mad,with,grief,for,renly,that,he,had,cut,down,two,of,his,own,sworn,brothers,but,it,had,never,occurred,to,jaime,to,do,the,same,with,the,five,who,had,failed,joffrey
he,was,my,son,my,secret,son
what,am,i,if,i,do,not,lift,the,hand,i,have,left,to,avenge,mine,own,blood,and,seed
he,ought,to,kill,ser,boros,at,least,just,to,be,rid,of,him
he,looked,at,his,stump,and,grimaced
i,must,do,something,about,that
if,the,late,ser,jacelyn,bywater,could,wear,an,iron,hand,he,should,have,a,gold,one
cersei,might,like,that
a,golden,hand,to,stroke,her,golden,hair,and,hold,her,hard,against,me
his,hand,could,wait,though
there,were,other,things,to,tend,to,first
there,were,other,debts,to,pay
sansa,the,ladder,to,the,forecastle,was,steep,and,splintery,so,sansa,accepted,a,hand,up,from,lothor,brune
ser,lothor,she,had,to,remind,herself,the,man,had,been,knighted,for,his,valor,in,the,battle,of,the,blackwater
though,no,proper,knight,would,wear,those,patched,brown,breeches,and,scuffed,boots,nor,that,cracked,and,waterstained,leather,jerkin
a,square-faced,stocky,man,with,a,squashed,nose,and,a,mat,of,nappy,grey,hair,brune,spoke,seldom
he,is,stronger,than,he,looks,though
she,could,tell,by,the,ease,with,which,he,lifted,her,as,if,she,weighed,nothing,at,all
off,the,bow,of,the,merling,king,stretched,a,bare,and,stony,strand,windswept,treeless,and,uninviting
even,so,it,made,a,welcome,sight
they,had,been,a,long,while,clawing,their,way,back,on,course
the,last,storm,had,swept,them,out,of,sight,of,land,and,sent,such,waves,crashing,over,the,sides,of,the,galley,that,sansa,had,been,certain,they,were,all,going,to,drown
two,men,had,been,swept,overboard,she,had,heard,old,oswell,saying,and,another,had,fallen,from,the,mast,and,broken,his,neck
she,had,seldom,ventured,out,on,deck,herself
her,little,cabin,was,dank,and,cold,but,sansa,had,been,sick,for,most,of,the,voyage
sick,with,terror,sick,with,fever,or,seasick
she,could,keep,nothing,down,and,even,sleep,came,hard
whenever,she,closed,her,eyes,she,saw,joffrey,tearing,at,his,collar,clawing,at,the,soft,skin,of,his,throat,dying,with,flakes,of,pie,crust,on,his,lips,and,wine,stains,on,his,doublet
and,the,wind,keening,in,the,lines,reminded,her,of,the,terrible,thin,sucking,sound,he’d,made,as,he,fought,to,draw,in,air
sometimes,she,dreamed,of,tyrion,as,well
he,did,nothing,she,told,littlefinger,once,when,he,paid,a,visit,to,her,cabin,to,see,if,she,were,feeling,any,better
he,did,not,kill,joffrey,true,but,the,dwarf’s,hands,are,far,from,clean
he,had,a,wife,before,you,did,you,know,that
he,told,me
and,did,he,tell,you,that,when,he,grew,bored,with,her,he,made,a,gift,of,her,to,his,father’s,guardsmen
he,might,have,done,the,same,to,you,in,time
shed,no,tears,for,the,imp,my,lady
the,wind,ran,salty,fingers,through,her,hair,and,sansa,shivered
even,this,close,to,shore,the,rolling,of,the,ship,made,her,tummy,queasy
she,desperately,needed,a,bath,and,a,change,of,clothes
i,must,look,as,haggard,as,a,corpse,and,smell,of,vomit
lord,petyr,came,up,beside,her,cheerful,as,ever
good,morrow
the,salt,air,is,bracing,don’t,you,think
it,always,sharpens,my,appetite
he,put,a,sympathetic,arm,about,her,shoulders
are,you,quite,well
you,look,so,pale
it’s,only,my,tummy
the,seasickness
a,little,wine,will,be,good,for,that
we’ll,get,you,a,cup,as,soon,as,we’re,ashore

we’ll,put,ashore,in,a,boat

the,fingers,were,a,dismal,place,she’d,heard,and,there,was,something,forlorn,and,desolate,about,the,little,tower
couldn’t,i,stay,on,the,ship,until,we,make,sail,for,white,harbor
from,here,the,king,turns,east,for,braavos

so,silent,my,lady
said,petyr

the,two,old,men,waded,out,up,to,their,thighs,to,lift,sansa,from,the,boat,so,she,would,not,get,her,skirts,wet
oswell,and,lothor,splashed,their,way,ashore,as,did,littlefinger,himself
he,gave,the,old,woman,a,kiss,on,the,cheek,and,grinned,at,the,younger,one

lord,petyr,made,a,face
come,let’s,see,if,my,hall,is,as,dreary,as,i,recall
he,led,them,up,the,strand,over,rocks,slick,with,rotting,seaweed
a,handful,of,sheep,were,wandering,about,the,base,of,the,flint,tower,grazing,on,the,thin,grass,that,grew,between,the,sheepfold,and,thatched,stable
sansa,had,to,step,carefully,there,were,pellets,everywhere
within,the,tower,seemed,even,smaller
an,open,stone,stair,wound,round,the,inside,wall,from,undercroft,to,roof
each,floor,was,but,a,single,room
the,servants,lived,and,slept,in,the,kitchen,at,ground,level,sharing,the,space,with,a,huge,brindled,mastiff,and,a,half-dozen,sheepdogs
above,that,was,a,modest,hall,and,higher,still,the,bedchamber
there,were,no,windows,but,arrowslits,were,embedded,in,the,outer,wall,at,intervals,along,the,curve,of,the,stair
above,the,hearth,hung,a,broken,longsword,and,a,battered,oaken,shield,its,paint,cracked,and,flaking
the,device,painted,on,the,shield,was,one,sansa,did,not,know,a,grey,stone,head,with,fiery,eyes,upon,a,light,green,field
my,grandfather’s,shield,petyr,explained,when,he,saw,her,gazing,at,it
his,own,father,was,born,in,braavos,and,came,to,the,vale,as,a,sellsword,in,the,hire,of,lord,corbray,so,my,grandfather,took,the,head,of,the,titan,as,his,sigil,when,he,was,knighted
it’s,very,fierce,said,sansa
rather,too,fierce,for,an,amiable,fellow,like,me,said,petyr
i,much,prefer,my,mockingbird
oswell,made,two,more,trips,out,to,the,merling,king,to,offload,provisions
among,the,loads,he,brought,ashore,were,several,casks,of,wine
petyr,poured,sansa,a,cup,as,promised
here,my,lady,that,should,help,your,tummy,i,would,hope
having,solid,ground,beneath,her,feet,had,helped,already,but,sansa,dutifully,lifted,the,goblet,with,both,hands,and,took,a,sip
the,wine,was,very,fine,an,arbor,vintage,she,thought
it,tasted,of,oak,and,fruit,and,hot,summer,nights,the,flavors,blossoming,in,her,mouth,like,flowers,opening,to,the,sun
she,only,prayed,that,she,could,keep,it,down
lord,petyr,was,being,so,kind,she,did,not,want,to,spoil,it,all,by,retching,on,him
he,was,studying,her,over,his,own,goblet,his,bright,grey-green,eyes,full,of
was,it,amusement
or,something,else
sansa,was,not,certain
grisel,he,called,to,the,old,woman,bring,some,food,up
nothing,too,heavy,my,lady,has,a,tender,tummy
some,fruit,might,serve,perhaps
oswell’s,brought,some,oranges,and,pomegranates,from,the,king
yes,m’lord
might,i,have,a,hot,bath,as,well
asked,sansa
i’ll,have,kella,draw,some,water,m’lady
sansa,took,another,sip,of,wine,and,tried,to,think,of,some,polite,conversation,but,lord,petyr,saved,her,the,effort
when,grisel,and,the,other,servants,had,gone,he,said,lysa,will,not,come,alone
before,she,arrives,we,must,be,clear,on,who,you,are
who,i
i,don’t,understand
varys,has,informers,everywhere
if,sansa,stark,should,be,seen,in,the,vale,the,eunuch,will,know,within,a,moon’s,turn,and,that,would,create,unfortunate
complications
it,is,not,safe,to,be,a,stark,just,now
so,we,shall,tell,lysa’s,people,that,you,are,my,natural,daughter
natural
sansa,was,aghast
you,mean,a,bastard
well,you,can,scarcely,be,my,trueborn,daughter
i’ve,never,taken,a,wife,that’s,well,known
what,should,you,be,called
i
i,could,call,myself,after,my,mother
catelyn
a,bit,too,obvious
but,after,my,mother,that,would,serve
alayne
do,you,like,it
alayne,is,pretty
sansa,hoped,she,would,remember
but,couldn’t,i,be,the,trueborn,daughter,of,some,knight,in,your,service
perhaps,he,died,gallantly,in,the,battle,and
i,have,no,gallant,knights,in,my,service,alayne
such,a,tale,would,draw,unwanted,questions,as,a,corpse,draws,crows
it,is,rude,to,pry,into,the,origins,of,a,man’s,natural,children,however
he,cocked,his,head
so,who,are,you
alayne
stone,would,it,be
when,he,nodded,she,said,but,who,is,my,mother
kella
please,no,she,said,mortified
i,was,teasing
your,mother,was,a,gentlewoman,of,braavos,daughter,of,a,merchant,prince
we,met,in,gulltown,when,i,had,charge,of,the,port
she,died,giving,you,birth,and,entrusted,you,to,the,faith
i,have,some,devotional,books,you,can,look,over
learn,to,quote,from,them
nothing,discourages,unwanted,questions,as,much,as,a,flow,of,pious,bleating
in,any,case,at,your,flowering,you,decided,you,did,not,wish,to,be,a,septa,and,wrote,to,me
that,was,the,first,i,knew,of,your,existence
he,fingered,his,beard
do,you,think,you,can,remember,all,that
i,hope
it,will,be,like,playing,a,game,won’t,it
are,you,fond,of,games,alayne
the,new,name,would,take,some,getting,used,to
games
i
i,suppose,it,would,depend
grisel,reappeared,before,he,could,say,more,balancing,a,large,platter
she,set,it,down,between,them
there,were,apples,and,pears,and,pomegranates,some,sad-looking,grapes,a,huge,blood,orange
the,old,woman,had,brought,a,round,of,bread,as,well,and,a,crock,of,butter
petyr,cut,a,pomegranate,in,two,with,his,dagger,offering,half,to,sansa
you,should,try,and,eat,my,lady
thank,you,my,lord
pomegranate,seeds,were,so,messy,sansa,chose,a,pear,instead,and,took,a,small,delicate,bite
it,was,very,ripe
the,juice,ran,down,her,chin
lord,petyr,loosened,a,seed,with,the,point,of,his,dagger
you,must,miss,your,father,terribly,i,know
lord,eddard,was,a,brave,man,honest,and,loyal
but,quite,a,hopeless,player
he,brought,the,seed,to,his,mouth,with,the,knife
in,king’s,landing,there,are,two,sorts,of,people
the,players,and,the,pieces
and,i,was,a,piece
she,dreaded,the,answer
yes,but,don’t,let,that,trouble,you
you’re,still,half,a,child
every,man’s,a,piece,to,start,with,and,every,maid,as,well
even,some,who,think,they,are,players
he,ate,another,seed
cersei,for,one
she,thinks,herself,sly,but,in,truth,she,is,utterly,predictable
her,strength,rests,on,her,beauty,birth,and,riches
only,the,first,of,those,is,truly,her,own,and,it,will,soon,desert,her
i,pity,her,then
she,wants,power,but,has,no,notion,what,to,do,with,it,when,she,gets,it
everyone,wants,something,alayne
and,when,you,know,what,a,man,wants,you,know,who,he,is,and,how,to,move,him
as,you,moved,ser,dontos,to,poison,joffrey
it,had,to,have,been,dontos,she,had,concluded
littlefinger,laughed
ser,dontos,the,red,was,a,skin,of,wine,with,legs
he,could,never,have,been,trusted,with,a,task,of,such,enormity
he,would,have,bungled,it,or,betrayed,me
no,all,dontos,had,to,do,was,lead,you,from,the,castle
and,make,certain,you,wore,your,silver,hair,net
the,black,amethysts
but
if,not,dontos,who
do,you,have,other
pieces
you,could,turn,king’s,landing,upside,down,and,not,find,a,single,man,with,a,mockingbird,sewn,over,his,heart,but,that,does,not,mean,i,am,friendless
petyr,went,to,the,steps
oswell,come,up,here,and,let,the,lady,sansa,have,a,look,at,you
the,old,man,appeared,a,few,moments,later,grinning,and,bowing
sansa,eyed,him,uncertainly
what,am,i,supposed,to,see
do,you,know,him
asked,petyr
no
look,closer
she,studied,the,old,man’s,lined,windburnt,face,hook,nose,white,hair,and,huge,knuckly,hands
there,was,something,familiar,about,him,yet,sansa,had,to,shake,her,head
i,don’t
i,never,saw,oswell,before,i,got,into,his,boat,i’m,certain
oswell,grinned,showing,a,mouth,of,crooked,teeth
no,but,m’lady,might,of,met,my,three,sons
it,was,the,three,sons,and,that,smile,too
kettleblack
sansa’s,eyes,went,wide
you’re,a,kettleblack
aye,m’lady,as,it,please,you
she’s,beside,herself,with,joy
lord,petyr,dismissed,him,with,a,wave,and,returned,to,the,pomegranate,again,as,oswell,shuffled,down,the,steps
tell,me,alayne,which,is,more,dangerous,the,dagger,brandished,by,an,enemy,or,the,hidden,one,pressed,to,your,back,by,someone,you,never,even,see
the,hidden,dagger
there’s,a,clever,girl
he,smiled,his,thin,lips,bright,red,from,the,pomegranate,seeds
when,the,imp,sent,off,her,guards,the,queen,had,ser,lancel,hire,sellswords,for,her
lancel,found,her,the,kettleblacks,which,delighted,your,little,lord,husband,since,the,lads,were,in,his,pay,through,his,man,bronn
he,chuckled
but,it,was,me,who,told,oswell,to,get,his,sons,to,king’s,landing,when,i,learned,that,bronn,was,looking,for,swords
three,hidden,daggers,alayne,now,perfectly,placed
so,one,of,the,kettleblacks,put,the,poison,in,joff,s,cup
ser,osmund,had,been,near,the,king,all,night,she,remembered
did,i,say,that
lord,petyr,cut,the,blood,orange,in,two,with,his,dagger,and,offered,half,to,sansa
the,lads,are,far,too,treacherous,to,be,part,of,any,such,scheme
and,osmund,has,become,especially,unreliable,since,he,joined,the,kingsguard
that,white,cloak,does,things,to,a,man,i,find
even,a,man,like,him
he,tilted,his,chin,back,and,squeezed,the,blood,orange,so,the,juice,ran,down,into,his,mouth
i,love,the,juice,but,i,loathe,the,sticky,fingers,he,complained,wiping,his,hands
clean,hands,sansa
whatever,you,do,make,certain,your,hands,are,clean
sansa,spooned,up,some,juice,from,her,own,orange
but,if,it,wasn’t,the,kettleblacks,and,it,wasn’t,ser,dontos
you,weren’t,even,in,the,city,and,it,couldn’t,have,been,tyrion
no,more,guesses,sweetling
she,shook,her,head
i,don’t
petyr,smiled
i,will,wager,you,that,at,some,point,during,the,evening,someone,told,you,that,your,hair,net,was,crooked,and,straightened,it,for,you
sansa,raised,a,hand,to,her,mouth
you,cannot,mean
she,wanted,to,take,me,to,highgarden,to,marry,me,to,her,grandson
gentle,pious,good-hearted,willas,tyrell
be,grateful,you,were,spared,he,would,have,bored,you,spitless
the,old,woman,is,not,boring,though,i’ll,grant,her,that
a,fearsome,old,harridan,and,not,near,as,frail,as,she,pretends
when,i,came,to,highgarden,to,dicker,for,margaery’s,hand,she,let,her,lord,son,bluster,while,she,asked,pointed,questions,about,joffrey’s,nature
i,praised,him,to,the,skies,to,be,sure
whilst,my,men,spread,disturbing,tales,amongst,lord,tyrell’s,servants
that,is,how,the,game,is,played
i,also,planted,the,notion,of,ser,loras,taking,the,white
not,that,i,suggested,it,that,would,have,been,too,crude
but,men,in,my,party,supplied,grisly,tales,about,how,the,mob,had,killed,ser,preston,greenfield,and,raped,the,lady,lollys,and,slipped,a,few,silvers,to,lord,tyrell’s,army,of,singers,to,sing,of,ryam,redwyne,serwyn,of,the,mirror,shield,and,prince,aemon,the,dragonknight
a,harp,can,be,as,dangerous,as,a,sword,in,the,right,hands
mace,tyrell,actually,thought,it,was,his,own,idea,to,make,ser,loras’s,inclusion,in,the,kingsguard,part,of,the,marriage,contract
who,better,to,protect,his,daughter,than,her,splendid,knightly,brother
and,it,relieved,him,of,the,difficult,task,of,trying,to,find,lands,and,a,bride,for,a,third,son,never,easy,and,doubly,difficult,in,ser,loras’s,case
be,that,as,it,may
lady,olenna,was,not,about,to,let,joff,harm,her,precious,darling,granddaughter,but,unlike,her,son,she,also,realized,that,under,all,his,flowers,and,finery,ser,loras,is,as,hot-tempered,as,jaime,lannister
toss,joffrey,margaery,and,loras,in,a,pot,and,you’ve,got,the,makings,for,kingslayer,stew
the,old,woman,understood,something,else,as,well
her,son,was,determined,to,make,margaery,a,queen,and,for,that,he,needed,a,king
but,he,did,not,need,joffrey
we,shall,have,another,wedding,soon,wait,and,see
margaery,will,marry,tommen
she’ll,keep,her,queenly,crown,and,her,maidenhead,neither,of,which,she,especially,wants,but,what,does,that,matter
the,great,western,alliance,will,be,preserved
for,a,time,at,least
margaery,and,tommen
sansa,did,not,know,what,to,say
she,had,liked,margaery,tyrell,and,her,small,sharp,grandmother,as,well
she,thought,wistfully,of,highgarden,with,its,courtyards,and,musicians,and,the,pleasure,barges,on,the,mander,a,far,cry,from,this,bleak,shore
at,least,i,am,safe,here
joffrey,is,dead,he,cannot,hurt,me,anymore,and,i,am,only,a,bastard,girl,now
alayne,stone,has,no,husband,and,no,claim
and,her,aunt,would,soon,be,here,as,well
the,long,nightmare,of,king’s,landing,was,behind,her,and,her,mockery,of,a,marriage,as,well
she,could,make,herself,a,new,home,here,just,as,petyr,said
it,was,eight,long,days,until,lysa,arryn,arrived
on,five,of,them,it,rained,while,sansa,sat,bored,and,restless,by,the,fire,beside,the,old,blind,dog
he,was,too,sick,and,toothless,to,walk,guard,with,bryen,anymore,and,mostly,all,he,did,was,sleep,but,when,she,patted,him,he,whined,and,licked,her,hand,and,after,that,they,were,fast,friends
when,the,rains,let,up,petyr,walked,with,her,around,his,holdings,which,took,less,than,half,a,day
he,owned,a,lot,of,rocks,just,as,he,had,said
there,was,one,place,where,the,tide,came,jetting,up,out,of,a,blowhole,to,shoot,thirty,feet,into,the,air,and,another,where,someone,had,chiseled,the,seven-pointed,star,of,the,new,gods,upon,a,boulder
petyr,said,that,marked,one,of,the,places,the,andals,had,landed,when,they,came,across,the,sea,to,wrest,the,vale,from,the,first,men
farther,inland,a,dozen,families,lived,in,huts,of,piled,stone,beside,a,peat,bog
mine,own,smallfolk,petyr,said,though,only,the,oldest,seemed,to,know,him
there,was,a,hermit’s,cave,on,his,land,as,well,but,no,hermit
he’s,dead,now,but,when,i,was,a,boy,my,father,took,me,to,see,him
the,man,had,not,washed,in,forty,years,so,you,can,imagine,how,he,smelled,but,supposedly,he,had,the,gift,of,prophecy
he,groped,me,a,bit,and,said,i,would,be,a,great,man,and,for,that,my,father,gave,him,a,skin,of,wine
petyr,snorted
i,would,have,told,him,the,same,thing,for,half,a,cup
finally,on,a,grey,windy,afternoon,bryen,came,running,back,to,the,tower,with,his,dogs,barking,at,his,heels,to,announce,that,riders,were,approaching,from,the,southwest
lysa,lord,petyr,said
come,alayne,let,us,greet,her

thick,auburn,tresses,fell,down,past,her,waist,but,beneath,the,costly,velvet,gown,and,jeweled,bodice,her,body,sagged,and,bulged
her,face,was,pink,and,painted,her,breasts,heavy,her,limbs,thick
she,was,taller,than,littlefinger,and,heavier,nor,did,she,show,any,grace,in,the,clumsy,way,she,climbed,down,off,her,horse
petyr,knelt,to,kiss,her,fingers
the,king’s,small,council,commanded,me,to,woo,and,win,you,my,lady
do,you,think,you,might,have,me,for,your,lord,and,husband

but,just,now,i,am,more,interested,in,what,i,might,do,with,you,my,lady
all,the,sternness,melted,off,her,aunt’s,round,pink,face,and,for,a,moment,sansa,thought,lysa,arryn,was,about,to,cry

yet,there,is,much,to,be,gained,from,a,great,public,wedding,with,all,the,vale,no
she,stamped,a,foot
i,want,you,now,this,very,night
and,i,must,warn,you,after,all,these,years,of,silence,and,whisperings,i,mean,to,scream,when,you,love,me
i,am,going,to,scream,so,loud,they’ll,hear,me,in,the,eyrie
perhaps,i,could,bed,you,now,and,wed,you,later
the,lady,lysa,giggled,like,a,girl
oh,petyr,baelish,you,are,so,wicked
no,i,say,no,i,am,the,lady,of,the,eyrie,and,i,command,you,to,wed,me,this,very,moment
petyr,gave,a,shrug
as,my,lady,commands,then
i,am,helpless,before,you,as,ever
they,said,their,vows,within,the,hour,standing,beneath,a,sky-blue,canopy,as,the,sun,sank,in,the,west
afterward,trestle,tables,were,set,up,beneath,the,small,flint,tower,and,they,feasted,on,quail,venison,and,roast,boar,washing,it,down,with,a,fine,light,mead
torches,were,lit,as,dusk,crept,in
lysa’s,singer,played,the,vow,unspoken,and,seasons,of,my,love,and,two,hearts,that,beat,as,one
several,younger,knights,even,asked,sansa,to,dance
her,aunt,danced,as,well,her,skirts,whirling,when,petyr,spun,her,in,his,arms
mead,and,marriage,had,taken,years,off,lady,lysa
she,laughed,at,everything,so,long,as,she,held,her,husband’s,hand,and,her,eyes,seemed,to,glow,whenever,she,looked,at,him
when,it,was,time,for,the,bedding,her,knights,carried,her,up,to,the,tower,stripping,her,as,they,went,and,shouting,bawdy,jests
tyrion,spared,me,that,sansa,remembered
it,would,not,have,been,so,bad,being,undressed,for,a,man,she,loved,by,friends,who,loved,them,both
by,joffrey,though
she,shuddered
her,aunt,had,brought,only,three,ladies,with,her,so,they,pressed,sansa,to,help,them,undress,lord,petyr,and,march,him,up,to,his,marriage,bed
he,submitted,with,good,grace,and,a,wicked,tongue,giving,as,good,as,he,got
by,the,time,they,had,gotten,him,into,the,tower,and,out,of,his,clothes,the,other,women,were,flushed,with,laces,unlaced,kirtles,crooked,and,skirts,in,disarray
but,littlefinger,only,smiled,at,sansa,as,they,marched,him,up,to,the,bedchamber,where,his,lady,wife,was,waiting
lady,lysa,and,lord,petyr,had,the,third-story,bedchamber,to,themselves,but,the,tower,was,small
and,true,to,her,word,her,aunt,screamed
it,had,begun,to,rain,outside,driving,the,feasters,into,the,hall,one,floor,below,so,they,heard,most,every,word
petyr,her,aunt,moaned
oh,petyr,petyr,sweet,petyr,oh,oh,oh
there,petyr,there
that’s,where,you,belong
lady,lysa’s,singer,launched,into,a,bawdy,version,of,milady’s,supper,but,even,his,singing,and,playing,could,not,drown,out,lysa’s,cries
make,me,a,baby,petyr,she,screamed,make,me,another,sweet,little,baby
oh,petyr,my,precious,my,precious,peeeeeetyr
her,last,shriek,was,so,loud,that,it,set,the,dogs,to,barking,and,two,of,her,aunt’s,ladies,could,scarce,contain,their,mirth
sansa,went,down,the,steps,and,out,into,the,night
a,light,rain,was,falling,on,the,remains,of,the,feast,but,the,air,smelled,fresh,and,clean
the,memory,of,her,own,wedding,night,with,tyrion,was,much,with,her
in,the,dark,i,am,the,knight,of,flowers,he,had,said
i,could,be,good,to,you
but,that,was,only,another,lannister,lie
a,dog,can,smell,a,lie,you,know,the,hound,had,told,her,once
she,could,almost,hear,the,rough,rasp,of,his,voice
look,around,you,and,take,a,good,whiff
they’re,all,liars,here,and,every,one,better,than,you
she,wondered,what,had,become,of,sandor,clegane
did,he,know,that,they’d,killed,joffrey
would,he,care
he,had,been,the,prince’s,sworn,shield,for,years
she,stayed,outside,for,a,long,time
when,at,last,she,sought,her,own,bed,wet,and,chilled,only,the,dim,glow,of,a,peat,fire,lit,the,darkened,hall
there,was,no,sound,from,above
the,young,singer,sat,in,a,corner,playing,a,slow,song,to,himself
one,of,her,aunt’s,maids,was,kissing,a,knight,in,lord,petyr’s,chair,their,hands,busy,beneath,each,other’s,clothing
several,men,had,drunk,themselves,to,sleep,and,one,was,in,the,privy,being,noisily,sick
sansa,found,bryen’s,old,blind,dog,in,her,little,alcove,beneath,the,steps,and,lay,down,next,to,him
he,woke,and,licked,her,face
you,sad,old,hound,she,said,ruffling,his,fur

the,old,dog,raised,his,head,and,growled,but,the,singer,gave,him,a,cuff,and,sent,him,slinking,off,whimpering

i,will,not,sing,them,though
they,were,poor,things,unworthy,of,such,beauty
he,sat,on,her,bed,and,put,his,hand,on,her,leg
let,me,sing,to,you,with,my,body,instead
she,caught,a,whiff,of,his,breath
you’re,drunk

i,am,on,fire
his,hand,slipped,up,to,her,thigh

you,will,thank,the,gods,you,did
i’ll,have,you,singing,louder,than,the,lady,lysa
sansa,jerked,away,from,him,frightened
if,you,don’t,leave,me,my,au,my,father,will,hang,you
lord,petyr

he,chuckled
lady,lysa,loves,me,well,and,i,am,lord,robert’s,favorite
if,your,father,offends,me,i,will,destroy,him,with,a,verse
he,put,a,hand,on,her,breast,and,squeezed
let’s,get,you,out,of,these,wet,clothes
you,wouldn’t,want,them,ripped,i,know
come,sweet,lady,heed,your,heart,sansa,heard,the,soft,sound,of,steel,on,leather
singer,a,rough,voice,said,best,go,if,you,want,to,sing,again
the,light,was,dim,but,she,saw,a,faint,glimmer,of,a,blade
the,singer,saw,it,too
find,your,own,wench,the,knife,flashed,and,he,cried,out
you,cut,me
i’ll,do,worse,if,you,don’t,go
and,quick,as,that,marillion,was,gone
the,other,remained,looming,over,sansa,in,the,darkness
lord,petyr,said,watch,out,for,you
it,was,lothor,brune’s,voice,she,realized
not,the,hound’s,no,how,could,it,be
of,course,it,had,to,be,lothor
that,night,sansa,scarcely,slept,at,all,but,tossed,and,turned,just,as,she,had,aboard,the,merling,king
she,dreamt,of,joffrey,dying,but,as,he,clawed,at,his,throat,and,the,blood,ran,down,across,his,fingers,she,saw,with,horror,that,it,was,her,brother,robb
and,she,dreamed,of,her,wedding,night,too,of,tyrion’s,eyes,devouring,her,as,she,undressed
only,then,he,was,bigger,than,tyrion,had,any,right,to,be,and,when,he,climbed,into,the,bed,his,face,was,scarred,only,on,one,side
i’ll,have,a,song,from,you,he,rasped,and,sansa,woke,and,found,the,old,blind,dog,beside,her,once,again
i,wish,that,you,were,lady,she,said
come,the,morning,grisel,climbed,up,to,the,bedchamber,to,serve,the,lord,and,lady,a,tray,of,morning,bread,with,butter,honey,fruit,and,cream
she,returned,to,say,that,alayne,was,wanted
sansa,was,still,drowsy,from,sleep
it,took,her,a,moment,to,remember,that,she,was,alayne
lady,lysa,was,still,abed,but,lord,petyr,was,up,and,dressed
your,aunt,wishes,to,speak,with,you,he,told,sansa,as,he,pulled,on,a,boot
i’ve,told,her,who,you,are
gods,be,good

petyr,yanked,on,the,other,boot
i’ve,had,about,as,much,home,as,i,can,stomach
we’ll,leave,for,the,eyrie,this,afternoon
he,kissed,his,lady,wife,and,licked,a,smear,of,honey,off,her,lips,then,headed,down,the,steps
sansa,stood,by,the,foot,of,the,bed,while,her,aunt,ate,a,pear,and,studied,her
i,see,it,now,the,lady,lysa,said,as,she,set,the,core,aside
you,look,so,much,like,catelyn
it’s,kind,of,you,to,say,so
it,was,not,meant,as,flattery
if,truth,be,told,you,look,too,much,like,catelyn
something,must,be,done
we,shall,darken,your,hair,before,we,bring,you,back,to,the,eyrie,i,think
darken,my,hair
if,it,please,you,aunt,lysa
you,must,not,call,me,that
no,word,of,your,presence,here,must,be,allowed,to,reach,king’s,landing
i,do,not,mean,to,have,my,son,endangered
she,nibbled,the,corner,of,a,honeycomb
i,have,kept,the,vale,out,of,this,war
our,harvest,has,been,plentiful,the,mountains,protect,us,and,the,eyrie,is,impregnable
even,so,it,would,not,do,to,draw,lord,tywin’s,wroth,down,upon,us
lysa,set,the,comb,down,and,licked,honey,from,her,fingers
you,were,wed,to,tyrion,lannister,petyr,says
that,vile,dwarf
they,made,me,marry,him
i,never,wanted,it
no,more,than,i,did,her,aunt,said
jon,arryn,was,no,dwarf,but,he,was,old
you,may,not,think,so,to,see,me,now,but,on,the,day,we,wed,i,was,so,lovely,i,put,your,mother,to,shame
but,all,jon,desired,was,my,father’s,swords,to,aid,his,darling,boys
i,should,have,refused,him,but,he,was,such,an,old,man,how,long,could,he,live
half,his,teeth,were,gone,and,his,breath,smelled,like,bad,cheese
i,cannot,abide,a,man,with,foul,breath
petyr’s,breath,is,always,fresh
he,was,the,first,man,i,ever,kissed,you,know
my,father,said,he,was,too,lowborn,but,i,knew,how,high,he’d,rise
jon,gave,him,the,customs,for,gulltown,to,please,me,but,when,he,increased,the,incomes,tenfold,my,lord,husband,saw,how,clever,he,was,and,gave,him,other,appointments,even,brought,him,to,king’s,landing,to,be,master,of,coin
that,was,hard,to,see,him,every,day,and,still,be,wed,to,that,old,cold,man
jon,did,his,duty,in,the,bedchamber,but,he,could,no,more,give,me,pleasure,than,he,could,give,me,children
his,seed,was,old,and,weak
all,my,babies,died,but,robert,three,girls,and,two,boys
all,my,sweet,little,babies,dead,and,that,old,man,just,went,on,and,on,with,his,stinking,breath
so,you,see,i,have,suffered,too
lady,lysa,sniffed
you,do,know,that,your,poor,mother,is,dead
tyrion,told,me,said,sansa
he,said,the,freys,murdered,her,at,the,twins,with,robb
tears,welled,suddenly,in,lady,lysa’s,eyes
we,are,women,alone,now,you,and,i,are,you,afraid,child
be,brave
i,would,never,turn,away,cat’s,daughter
we,are,bound,by,blood
she,beckoned,sansa,closer
you,may,come,kiss,my,cheek,alayne
dutifully,she,approached,and,knelt,beside,the,bed
her,aunt,was,drenched,in,sweet,scent,though,under,that,was,a,sour,milky,smell
her,cheek,tasted,of,paint,and,powder
as,sansa,stepped,back,lady,lysa,caught,her,wrist
now,tell,me,she,said,sharply
are,you,with,child
the,truth,now,i,will,know,if,you,lie
no,she,said,startled,by,the,question
you,are,a,woman,flowered,are,you,not
yes
sansa,knew,the,truth,of,her,flowering,could,not,be,long,hidden,in,the,eyrie
tyrion,didn’t
he,never
she,could,feel,the,blush,creeping,up,her,cheeks
i,am,still,a,maid
was,the,dwarf,incapable
no
he,was,only
he,was
kind
she,could,not,say,that,not,here,not,to,this,aunt,who,hated,him,so
he
he,had,whores,my,lady
he,told,me,so
whores
lysa,released,her,wrist
of,course,he,did
what,woman,would,bed,such,a,creature,but,for,gold
i,should,have,killed,the,imp,when,he,was,in,my,power,but,he,tricked,me
he,is,full,of,low,cunning,that,one
his,sellsword,slew,my,good,ser,vardis,egen
catelyn,should,not,have,brought,him,here,i,told,her,that
she,made,off,with,our,uncle,too
that,was,wrong,of,her
the,blackfish,was,my,knight,of,the,gate,and,since,he,left,us,the,mountain,clans,are,growing,very,bold
petyr,will,soon,set,all,that,to,rights,though
i,shall,make,him,lord,protector,of,the,vale
her,aunt,smiled,for,the,first,time,almost,warmly
he,may,not,look,as,tall,or,strong,as,some,but,he,is,worth,more,than,all,of,them
trust,in,him,and,do,as,he,says
i,shall,aunt
my,lady
lady,lysa,seemed,pleased,by,that
i,knew,that,boy,joffrey
he,used,to,call,my,robert,cruel,names,and,once,he,slapped,him,with,a,wooden,sword
a,man,will,tell,you,poison,is,dishonorable,but,a,woman’s,honor,is,different
the,mother,shaped,us,to,protect,our,children,and,our,only,dishonor,is,in,failure
you’ll,know,that,when,you,have,a,child
a,child
said,sansa,uncertainly
lysa,waved,a,hand,negligently
not,for,many,years
you,are,too,young,to,be,a,mother
one,day,you,shall,want,children,though
just,as,you,will,want,to,marry
i
i,am,married,my,lady
yes,but,soon,a,widow
be,glad,the,imp,preferred,his,whores
it,would,not,be,fitting,for,my,son,to,take,that,dwarf’s,leavings,but,as,he,never,touched,you
how,would,you,like,to,marry,your,cousin,the,lord,robert
the,thought,made,sansa,weary
all,she,knew,of,robert,arryn,was,that,he,was,a,little,boy,and,sickly
it,is,not,me,she,wants,her,son,to,marry,it,is,my,claim
no,one,will,ever,marry,me,for,love
but,lying,came,easy,to,her,now
i
can,scarcely,wait,to,meet,him,my,lady
but,he,is,still,a,child,is,he,not
he,is,eight
and,not,robust
but,such,a,good,boy,so,bright,and,clever
he,will,be,a,great,man,alayne
the,seed,is,strong,my,lord,husband,said,before,he,died
his,last,words
the,gods,sometimes,let,us,glimpse,the,future,as,we,lay,dying
i,see,no,reason,why,you,should,not,be,wed,as,soon,as,we,know,that,your,lannister,husband,is,dead
a,secret,wedding,to,be,sure
the,lord,of,the,eyrie,could,scarcely,be,thought,to,have,married,a,bastard,that,would,not,be,fitting
the,ravens,should,bring,us,the,word,from,king’s,landing,once,the,imp’s,head,rolls
you,and,robert,can,be,wed,the,next,day,won’t,that,be,joyous
it,will,be,good,for,him,to,have,a,little,companion
he,played,with,vardis,egen’s,boy,when,we,first,returned,to,the,eyrie,and,my,steward’s,sons,as,well,but,they,were,much,too,rough,and,i,had,no,choice,but,to,send,them,away
do,you,read,well,alayne
septa,mordane,was,good,enough,to,say,so
robert,has,weak,eyes,but,he,loves,to,be,read,to,lady,lysa,confided
he,likes,stories,about,animals,the,best
do,you,know,the,little,song,about,the,chicken,who,dressed,as,a,fox
i,sing,him,that,all,the,time,he,never,grows,tired,of,it
and,he,likes,to,play,hopfrog,and,spin-the-sword,and,come-into-my-castle,but,you,must,always,let,him,win
that’s,only,proper,don’t,you,think
he,is,the,lord,of,the,eyrie,after,all,you,must,never,forget,that
you,are,well,born,and,the,starks,of,winterfell,were,always,proud,but,winterfell,has,fallen,and,you,are,really,just,a,beggar,now,so,put,that,pride,aside
gratitude,will,better,become,you,in,your,present,circumstances
yes,and,obedience
my,son,will,have,a,grateful,and,obedient,wife
jon,day,and,night,the,axes,rang
jon,could,not,remember,the,last,time,he,had,slept
when,he,closed,his,eyes,he,dreamed,of,fighting,when,he,woke,he,fought
even,in,the,king’s,tower,he,could,hear,the,ceaseless,thunk,of,bronze,and,flint,and,stolen,steel,biting,into,wood,and,it,was,louder,when,he,tried,to,rest,in,the,warming,shed,atop,the,wall
mance,had,sledgehammers,at,work,as,well,and,long,saws,with,teeth,of,bone,and,flint
once,as,he,was,drifting,off,into,an,exhausted,sleep,there,came,a,great,cracking,from,the,haunted,forest,and,a,sentinel,tree,came,crashing,down,in,a,cloud,of,dirt,and,needles
he,was,awake,when,owen,came,to,him,lying,restless,under,a,pile,of,furs,on,the,floor,of,the,warming,shed
lord,snow,said,owen,shaking,his,shoulder,the,dawn
he,gave,jon,a,hand,to,help,pull,him,back,onto,his,feet
others,were,waking,as,well,jostling,one,another,as,they,pulled,on,their,boots,and,buckled,their,swordbelts,in,the,close,confines,of,the,shed
no,one,spoke
they,were,all,too,tired,for,talk
few,of,them,ever,left,the,wall,these,days
it,took,too,long,to,ride,up,and,down,in,the,cage
castle,black,had,been,abandoned,to,maester,aemon,ser,wynton,stout,and,a,few,others,too,old,or,ill,to,fight
i,had,a,dream,that,the,king,had,come,owen,said,happily
maester,aemon,sent,a,raven,and,king,robert,came,with,all,his,strength
i,dreamed,i,saw,his,golden,banners
jon,made,himself,smile
that,would,be,a,welcome,sight,to,see,owen
ignoring,the,twinge,of,pain,in,his,leg,he,swept,a,black,fur,cloak,about,his,shoulders,gathered,up,his,crutch,and,went,out,onto,the,wall,to,face,another,day
a,gust,of,wind,sent,icy,tendrils,wending,through,his,long,brown,hair
half,a,mile,north,the,wildling,encampments,were,stirring,their,campfires,sending,up,smoky,fingers,to,scratch,against,the,pale,dawn,sky
along,the,edge,of,the,forest,they,had,raised,their,tents,of,hide,and,fur,even,a,crude,longhall,of,logs,and,woven,branches,there,were,horselines,to,the,east,mammoths,to,the,west,and,men,everywhere,sharpening,their,swords,putting,points,on,crude,spears,donning,makeshift,armor,of,hide,and,horn,and,bone
for,every,man,that,he,could,see,jon,knew,there,were,a,score,unseen,in,the,wood
the,brush,gave,them,some,shelter,from,the,elements,and,hid,them,from,the,eyes,of,the,hated,crows
already,their,archers,were,stealing,forward,pushing,their,rolling,mantlets
here,come,our,breakfast,arrows,pyp,announced,cheerfully,as,he,did,every,morning
it’s,good,that,he,can,make,a,jape,of,it,jon,thought
someone,has,to
three,days,ago,one,of,those,breakfast,arrows,had,caught,red,alyn,of,the,rosewood,in,the,leg
you,could,still,see,his,body,at,the,foot,of,the,wall,if,you,cared,to,lean,out,far,enough
jon,had,to,think,that,it,was,better,for,them,to,smile,at,pyp’s,jest,than,to,brood,over,alyn’s,corpse
the,mantlets,were,slanting,wooden,shields,wide,enough,for,five,of,the,free,folk,to,hide,behind
the,archers,pushed,them,close,then,knelt,behind,them,to,loose,their,arrows,through,slits,in,the,wood
the,first,time,the,wildlings,rolled,them,out,jon,had,called,for,fire,arrows,and,set,a,half-dozen,ablaze,but,after,that,mance,started,covering,them,with,raw,hides
all,the,fire,arrows,in,the,world,couldn’t,make,them,catch,now

it,makes,it,seem,as,if,there’s,more,of,us,he,said
more,of,us,with,arrows,in,our,bellies,grenn,complained,but,the,custom,did,seem,to,give,his,brothers,heart,so,jon,let,the,names,stand,and,the,wagering,continue
on,the,edge,of,the,wall,an,ornate,brass,myrish,eye,stood,on,three,spindly,legs
maester,aemon,had,once,used,it,to,peer,at,the,stars,before,his,own,eyes,had,failed,him
jon,swung,the,tube,down,to,have,a,look,at,the,foe
even,at,this,distance,there,was,no,mistaking,mance,rayder’s,huge,white,tent,sewn,together,from,the,pelts,of,snow,bears
the,myrish,lenses,brought,the,wildlings,close,enough,for,him,to,make,out,faces
of,mance,himself,he,saw,no,sign,this,morning,but,his,woman,dalla,was,outside,tending,the,fire,while,her,sister,val,milked,a,she-goat,beside,the,tent
dalla,looked,so,big,it,was,a,wonder,she,could,move
the,child,must,be,coming,very,soon,jon,thought
he,swiveled,the,eye,east,and,searched,amongst,the,tents,and,trees,till,he,found,the,turtle
that,will,be,coming,very,soon,as,well
the,wildlings,had,skinned,one,of,the,dead,mammoths,during,the,night,and,they,were,lashing,the,raw,bloody,hide,over,the,turtle’s,roof,one,more,layer,on,top,of,the,sheepskins,and,pelts
the,turtle,had,a,rounded,top,and,eight,huge,wheels,and,under,the,hides,was,a,stout,wooden,frame
when,the,wildlings,had,begun,knocking,it,together,satin,thought,they,were,building,a,ship
not,far,wrong
the,turtle,was,a,hull,turned,upside,down,and,opened,fore,and,aft,a,longhall,on,wheels
it’s,done,isn’t,it
asked,grenn
near,enough
jon,shoved,away,the,eye
it,will,come,today,most,like
did,you,fill,the,barrels
every,one
they,froze,hard,during,the,night,pyp,checked
grenn,had,changed,a,great,deal,from,the,big,clumsy,red-necked,boy,jon,had,first,befriended
he,had,grown,half,a,foot,his,chest,and,shoulders,had,thickened,and,he,had,not,cut,his,hair,nor,trimmed,his,beard,since,the,fist,of,the,first,men
it,made,him,look,as,huge,and,shaggy,as,an,aurochs,the,mocking,name,that,ser,alliser,thorne,had,hung,on,him,during,training
he,looked,weary,now,though
when,jon,said,as,much,he,nodded
i,heard,their,axes,all,night
couldn’t,sleep,for,all,the,chopping
then,go,sleep,now
i,don’t,need,you,do
i,want,you,rested
go,on,i’m,not,going,to,let,you,sleep,through,the,fight
he,made,himself,smile
you’re,the,only,one,who,can,move,those,bloody,barrels
grenn,went,off,muttering,and,jon,returned,to,the,far,eye,searching,the,wildling,camp
from,time,to,time,an,arrow,would,sail,past,overhead,but,he,had,learned,to,ignore,those
the,range,was,long,and,the,angle,was,bad,the,chances,of,being,hit,were,small
he,still,saw,no,sign,of,mance,rayder,in,the,camp,but,he,spied,tormund,giantsbane,and,two,of,his,sons,around,the,turtle
the,sons,were,struggling,with,the,mammoth,hide,while,tormund,gnawed,on,the,roast,leg,of,a,goat,and,bellowed,orders
elsewhere,he,found,the,wildling,skinchanger,varamyr,sixskins,walking,through,the,trees,with,his,shadowcat,dogging,his,heels
when,he,heard,the,rattle,of,the,winch,chains,and,the,iron,groan,of,the,cage,door,opening,he,knew,it,would,be,hobb,bringing,their,breakfast,as,he,did,every,morning
the,sight,of,mance’s,turtle,had,robbed,jon,of,his,appetite
their,oil,was,all,but,gone,and,the,last,barrel,of,pitch,had,been,rolled,off,the,wall,two,nights,ago
they,would,soon,run,short,of,arrows,as,well,and,there,were,no,fletchers,making,more
and,the,night,before,last,a,raven,had,come,from,the,west,from,ser,denys,mallister
bowen,marsh,had,chased,the,wildlings,all,the,way,to,the,shadow,tower,it,seemed,and,then,farther,down,into,the,gloom,of,the,gorge
at,the,bridge,of,skulls,he,had,met,the,weeper,and,three,hundred,wildlings,and,won,a,bloody,battle
but,the,victory,had,been,a,costly,one
more,than,a,hundred,brothers,slain,among,them,ser,endrew,tarth,and,ser,aladale,wynch
the,old,pomegranate,himself,had,been,carried,back,to,the,shadow,tower,sorely,wounded
maester,mullin,was,tending,him,but,it,would,be,some,time,before,he,was,fit,to,return,to,castle,black
when,he,had,read,that,jon,had,dispatched,zei,to,mole’s,town,on,their,best,horse,to,plead,with,the,villagers,to,help,man,the,wall
she,never,returned
when,he,sent,mully,after,her,he,came,back,to,report,the,whole,village,deserted,even,the,brothel
most,likely,zei,had,followed,them,straight,down,the,kingsroad
maybe,we,should,all,do,the,same,jon,reflected,glumly
he,made,himself,eat,hungry,or,no
bad,enough,he,could,not,sleep,he,could,not,go,on,without,food,as,well
besides,this,might,be,my,last,meal
it,might,be,the,last,meal,for,all,of,us
so,it,was,that,jon,had,a,belly,full,of,bread,bacon,onions,and,cheese,when,he,heard,horse,shout,it’s,coming
no,one,needed,to,ask,what,it,was
nor,did,jon,need,the,maester’s,myrish,eye,to,see,it,creeping,out,from,amongst,the,tents,and,trees
it,doesn’t,really,look,much,like,a,turtle,satin,commented
turtles,don’t,have,fur
most,of,them,don’t,have,wheels,either,said,pyp
sound,the,warhorn,jon,commanded,and,kegs,blew,two,long,blasts,to,wake,grenn,and,the,other,sleepers,who’d,had,the,watch,during,the,night
if,the,wildlings,were,coming,the,wall,would,need,every,man
gods,know,we,have,few,enough
jon,looked,at,pyp,and,kegs,and,satin,horse,and,owen,the,oaf,tim,tangletongue,mully,spare,boot,and,the,rest,and,tried,to,imagine,them,going,belly,to,belly,and,blade,to,blade,against,a,hundred,screaming,wildlings,in,the,freezing,darkness,of,that,tunnel,with,only,a,few,iron,bars,between,them
that,was,what,it,would,come,down,to,unless,they,could,stop,the,turtle,before,the,gate,was,breached
it’s,big,horse,said
pyp,smacked,his,lips

the,jape,was,stillborn
even,pyp,sounded,tired
he,looks,half,dead,thought,jon,but,so,do,we,all
the,king-beyond-the-wall,had,so,many,men,that,he,could,throw,fresh,attackers,at,them,every,time,but,the,same,handful,of,black,brothers,had,to,meet,every,assault,and,it,had,worn,them,ragged
the,men,beneath,the,wood,and,hides,would,be,pulling,hard,jon,knew,putting,their,shoulders,into,it,straining,to,keep,the,wheels,turning,but,once,the,turtle,was,flush,against,the,gate,they,would,exchange,their,ropes,for,axes
at,least,mance,was,not,sending,his,mammoths,today
jon,was,glad,of,that
their,awesome,strength,was,wasted,on,the,wall,and,their,size,only,made,them,easy,targets
the,last,had,been,a,day,and,a,half,in,the,dying,its,mournful,trumpetings,terrible,to,hear
the,turtle,crept,slowly,through,stones,and,stumps,and,brush
the,earlier,attacks,had,cost,the,free,folk,a,hundred,lives,or,more
most,still,lay,where,they,had,fallen
in,the,lulls,the,crows,would,come,and,pay,them,court,but,now,the,birds,fled,screeching
they,liked,the,look,of,that,turtle,no,more,than,he,did
satin,horse,and,the,others,were,looking,to,him,jon,knew,waiting,for,his,orders
he,was,so,tired,he,hardly,knew,any,more
the,wall,is,mine,he,reminded,himself
owen,horse,to,the,catapults
kegs,you,and,spare,boot,on,the,scorpions
the,rest,of,you,string,your,bows
fire,arrows
let’s,see,if,we,can,burn,it
it,was,likely,to,be,a,futile,gesture,jon,knew,but,it,had,to,be,better,than,standing,helpless
cumbersome,and,slow-moving,the,turtle,made,for,an,easy,shot,and,his,archers,and,crossbowmen,soon,turned,it,into,a,lumbering,wooden,hedgehog
but,the,wet,hides,protected,it,just,as,they,had,the,mantlets,and,the,flaming,arrows,guttered,out,almost,as,soon,as,they,struck
jon,cursed,under,his,breath
scorpions,he,commanded
catapults
the,scorpions,bolts,punched,deep,into,the,pelts,but,did,no,more,damage,than,the,fire,arrows
the,rocks,went,bouncing,off,the,turtle’s,roof,leaving,dimples,in,the,thick,layers,of,hides
a,stone,from,one,of,the,trebuchets,might,have,crushed,it,but,the,one,machine,was,still,broken,and,the,wildlings,had,gone,wide,around,the,area,where,the,other,dropped,its,loads
jon,it’s,still,coming,said,owen,the,oaf
he,could,see,that,for,himself
inch,by,inch,yard,by,yard,the,turtle,crept,closer,rolling,rumbling,and,rocking,as,it,crossed,the,killing,ground
once,the,wildlings,got,it,flush,against,the,wall,it,would,give,them,all,the,shelter,they,needed,while,their,axes,crashed,through,the,hastily-repaired,outer,gates
inside,under,the,ice,they,would,clear,the,loose,rubble,from,the,tunnel,in,a,matter,of,hours,and,then,there,would,be,nothing,to,stop,them,but,two,iron,gates,a,few,half-frozen,corpses,and,whatever,brothers,jon,cared,to,throw,in,their,path,to,fight,and,die,down,in,the,dark
to,his,left,the,catapult,made,a,thunk,and,filled,the,air,with,spinning,stones
they,plonked,down,on,the,turtle,like,hail,and,caromed,harmlessly,aside
the,wildling,archers,were,still,loosing,arrows,from,behind,their,mantlets
one,thudded,into,the,face,of,a,straw,man,and,pyp,said,four,for,watt,of,long,lake
we,have,a,tie
the,next,shaft,whistled,past,his,own,ear,however
fie
he,shouted,down
i’m,not,in,the,tourney
the,hides,won’t,burn,jon,said,as,much,to,himself,as,to,the,others
their,only,hope,was,to,try,and,crush,the,turtle,when,it,reached,the,wall
for,that,they,needed,boulders
no,matter,how,stoutly,built,the,turtle,was,a,huge,chunk,of,rock,crashing,straight,down,on,top,of,it,from,seven,hundred,feet,was,bound,to,do,some,damage
grenn,owen,kegs,it’s,time
alongside,the,warming,shed,a,dozen,stout,oaken,barrels,were,lined,up,in,a,row
they,were,full,of,crushed,rock,the,gravel,that,the,black,brothers,customarily,spread,on,the,footpaths,to,give,themselves,better,footing,atop,the,wall
yesterday,after,he’d,seen,the,free,folk,covering,the,turtle,with,sheepskins,jon,told,grenn,to,pour,water,into,the,barrels,as,much,as,they,would,take
the,water,would,seep,down,through,the,crushed,stone,and,overnight,the,whole,thing,would,freeze,solid
it,was,the,nearest,thing,to,a,boulder,they,were,going,to,get
why,do,we,need,to,freeze,it
grenn,had,asked,him
why,don’t,we,just,roll,the,barrels,off,the,way,they,are
jon,answered,if,they,crash,against,the,wall,on,the,way,down,they’ll,burst,and,loose,gravel,will,spray,everywhere
we,don’t,want,to,rain,pebbles,on,the,whoresons
he,put,his,shoulder,to,the,one,barrel,with,grenn,while,kegs,and,owen,were,wrestling,with,another
together,they,rocked,it,back,and,forth,to,break,the,grip,of,the,ice,that,had,formed,around,its,bottom
the,bugger,weighs,a,ton,said,grenn
tip,it,over,and,roll,it,jon,said
careful,if,it,rolls,over,your,foot,you’ll,end,up,like,spare,boot
once,the,barrel,was,on,its,side,jon,grabbed,a,torch,and,waved,it,above,the,surface,of,the,wall,back,and,forth,just,enough,to,melt,the,ice,a,little
the,thin,film,of,water,helped,the,barrel,roll,more,easily
too,easily,in,fact,they,almost,lost,it
but,finally,with,four,of,them,pooling,their,efforts,they,rolled,their,boulder,to,the,edge,and,stood,it,up,again
they,had,four,of,the,big,oak,barrels,lined,up,above,the,gate,by,the,time,pyp,shouted,there’s,a,turtle,at,our,door
jon,braced,his,injured,leg,and,leaned,out,for,a,look
hoardings,marsh,should,have,built,hoardings
so,many,things,they,should,have,done
the,wildlings,were,dragging,the,dead,giants,away,from,the,gate
horse,and,mully,were,dropping,rocks,down,on,them,and,jon,thought,he,saw,one,man,go,down,but,the,stones,were,too,small,to,have,any,effect,on,the,turtle,itself
he,wondered,what,the,free,folk,would,do,about,the,dead,mammoth,in,the,path,but,then,he,saw
the,turtle,was,almost,as,wide,as,a,longhall,so,they,simply,pushed,it,over,the,carcass
his,leg,twitched,but,horse,caught,his,arm,and,drew,him,back,to,safety
you,shouldn’t,lean,out,like,that,the,boy,said
we,should,have,built,hoardings
jon,thought,he,could,hear,the,crash,of,axes,on,wood,but,that,was,probably,just,fear,ringing,in,his,ears
he,looked,to,grenn
do,it
grenn,got,behind,a,barrel,put,his,shoulder,against,it,grunted,and,began,to,push
owen,and,mully,moved,to,help,him
they,shoved,the,barrel,out,a,foot,and,then,another
and,suddenly,it,was,gone
they,heard,the,thump,as,it,struck,the,wall,on,the,way,down,and,then,much,louder,the,crash,and,crack,of,splintering,wood,followed,by,shouts,and,screams
satin,whooped,and,owen,the,oaf,danced,in,circles,while,pyp,leaned,out,and,called,the,turtle,was,stuffed,full,of,rabbits
look,at,them,hop,away
again,jon,barked,and,grenn,and,kegs,slammed,their,shoulders,against,the,next,barrel,and,sent,it,tottering,out,into,empty,air
by,the,time,they,were,done,the,front,of,mance’s,turtle,was,a,crushed,and,splintered,ruin,and,wildlings,were,spilling,out,the,other,end,and,scrambling,for,their,camp
satin,scooped,up,his,crossbow,and,sent,a,few,quarrels,after,them,as,they,ran,to,see,them,off,the,faster
grenn,was,grinning,through,his,beard,pyp,was,making,japes,and,none,of,them,would,die,today
on,the,morrow,though
jon,glanced,toward,the,shed
eight,barrels,of,gravel,remained,where,twelve,had,stood,a,few,moments,before
he,realized,how,tired,he,was,then,and,how,much,his,wound,was,hurting

a,few,hours,at,least
he,could,go,to,maester,aemon,for,some,dreamwine,that,would,help

a,cup,of,dreamwine,did,help,as,it,happened
no,sooner,had,he,stretched,out,on,the,narrow,bed,in,his,cell,than,sleep,took,him
his,dreams,were,strange,and,formless,full,of,strange,voices,shouts,and,cries,and,the,sound,of,a,warhorn,blowing,low,and,loud,a,single,deep,booming,note,that,lingered,in,the,air
when,he,awoke,the,sky,was,black,outside,the,arrow,slit,that,served,him,for,a,window,and,four,men,he,did,not,know,were,standing,over,him
one,held,a,lantern
jon,snow,the,tallest,of,them,said,brusquely,pull,on,your,boots,and,come,with,us
his,first,groggy,thought,was,that,somehow,the,wall,had,fallen,whilst,he,slept,that,mance,rayder,had,sent,more,giants,or,another,turtle,and,broken,through,the,gate
but,when,he,rubbed,his,eyes,he,saw,that,the,strangers,were,all,in,black
they’re,men,of,the,night’s,watch,jon,realized

the,tall,man,gestured,and,two,of,the,others,pulled,jon,from,the,bed

it,was,not,a,life,he’d,ever,dreamed,of,but,it,was,life

he,returned,to,the,city,the,night,before,last,to,put,his,sword,at,my,service
lord,tywin’s,face,was,so,dark,that,for,half,a,heartbeat,tyrion,wondered,if,he’d,drunk,some,poisoned,wine,as,well
he,slammed,his,fist,down,on,the,table,too,angry,to,speak
it,was,mace,tyrell,who,turned,to,tyrion,and,asked,the,question
do,you,have,a,champion,to,defend,your,innocence
he,does,my,lord
prince,oberyn,of,dorne,rose,to,his,feet
the,dwarf,has,quite,convinced,me
the,uproar,was,deafening
tyrion,took,especial,pleasure,in,the,sudden,doubt,he,glimpsed,in,cersei’s,eyes
it,took,a,hundred,gold,cloaks,pounding,the,butts,of,their,spears,against,the,floor,to,quiet,the,throne,room,again
by,then,lord,tywin,lannister,had,recovered,himself
let,the,issue,be,decided,on,the,morrow,he,declared,in,iron,tones
i,wash,my,hands,of,it
he,gave,his,dwarf,son,a,cold,angry,look,then,strode,from,the,hall,out,the,king’s,door,behind,the,iron,throne,his,brother,kevan,at,his,side
later,back,in,his,tower,cell,tyrion,poured,himself,a,cup,of,wine,and,sent,podrick,payne,off,for,cheese,bread,and,olives
he,doubted,whether,he,could,keep,down,anything,heavier,just,now
did,you,think,i,would,go,meekly,father
he,asked,the,shadow,his,candles,etched,upon,the,wall
i,have,too,much,of,you,in,me,for,that
he,felt,strangely,at,peace,now,that,he,had,snatched,the,power,of,life,and,death,from,his,father’s,hands,and,placed,it,in,the,hands,of,the,gods
assuming,there,are,gods,and,they,give,a,mummer’s,fart
if,not,then,i’m,in,dornish,hands
no,matter,what,happened,tyrion,had,the,satisfaction,of,knowing,that,he’d,kicked,lord,tywin’s,plans,to,splinters
if,prince,oberyn,won,it,would,further,inflame,highgarden,against,the,dornish,mace,tyrell,would,see,the,man,who,crippled,his,son,helping,the,dwarf,who,almost,poisoned,his,daughter,to,escape,his,rightful,punishment
and,if,the,mountain,triumphed,doran,martell,might,well,demand,to,know,why,his,brother,had,been,served,with,death,instead,of,the,justice,tyrion,had,promised,him
dorne,might,crown,myrcella,after,all
it,was,almost,worth,dying,to,know,all,the,trouble,he’d,made
will,you,come,to,see,the,end,shae
will,you,stand,there,with,the,rest,watching,as,ser,ilyn,lops,my,ugly,head,off
will,you,miss,your,giant,of,lannister,when,he’s,dead
he,drained,his,wine,flung,the,cup,aside,and,sang,lustily
he,rode,through,the,streets,of,the,city,down,from,his,hill,on,high,o’er,the,wynds,and,the,steps,and,the,cobbles,he,rode,to,a,woman’s,sigh
for,she,was,his,secret,treasure,she,was,his,shame,and,his,bliss
and,a,chain,and,a,keep,are,nothing,compared,to,a,woman’s,kiss
ser,kevan,did,not,visit,him,that,night
he,was,probably,with,lord,tywin,trying,to,placate,the,tyrells
i,have,seen,the,last,of,that,uncle,i,fear
he,poured,another,cup,of,wine
a,pity,he’d,had,symon,silver,tongue,killed,before,learning,all,the,words,of,that,song
it,wasn’t,a,bad,song,if,truth,be,told
especially,compared,to,the,ones,that,would,be,written,about,him,henceforth
for,hands,of,gold,are,always,cold,but,a,woman’s,hands,are,warm,he,sang
perhaps,he,should,write,the,other,verses,himself
if,he,lived,so,long
that,night,surprisingly,tyrion,lannister,slept,long,and,deep
he,rose,at,first,light,well,rested,and,with,a,hearty,appetite,and,broke,his,fast,on,fried,bread,blood,sausage,applecakes,and,a,double,helping,of,eggs,cooked,with,onions,and,fiery,dornish,peppers
then,he,begged,leave,of,his,guards,to,attend,his,champion
ser,addam,gave,his,consent
tyrion,found,prince,oberyn,drinking,a,cup,of,red,wine,as,he,donned,his,armor
he,was,attended,by,four,of,his,younger,dornish,lordlings
good,morrow,to,you,my,lord,the,prince,said
will,you,take,a,cup,of,wine
should,you,be,drinking,before,battle
i,always,drink,before,battle
that,could,get,you,killed
worse,it,could,get,me,killed

only,of,killing,joffrey,tyrion,admitted
i,do,hope,you,know,what,you,are,about,to,face
gregor,clegane,is,large
so,i,have,heard
he,is,almost,eight,feet,tall,and,must,weigh,thirty,stone,all,of,it,muscle
he,fights,with,a,two-handed,greatsword,but,needs,only,one,hand,to,wield,it
he,has,been,known,to,cut,men,in,half,with,a,single,blow
his,armor,is,so,heavy,that,no,lesser,man,could,bear,the,weight,let,alone,move,in,it
prince,oberyn,was,unimpressed
i,have,killed,large,men,before
the,trick,is,to,get,them,off,their,feet
once,they,go,down,they’re,dead
the,dornishman,sounded,so,blithely,confident,that,tyrion,felt,almost,reassured,until,he,turned,and,said,daemon,my,spear
ser,daemon,tossed,it,to,him,and,the,red,viper,snatched,it,from,the,air
you,mean,to,face,the,mountain,with,a,spear
that,made,tyrion,uneasy,all,over,again
in,battle,ranks,of,massed,spears,made,for,a,formidable,front,but,single,combat,against,a,skilled,swordsman,was,a,very,different,matter
we,are,fond,of,spears,in,dorne
besides,it,is,the,only,way,to,counter,his,reach
have,a,look,lord,imp,but,see,you,do,not,touch
the,spear,was,turned,ash,eight,feet,long,the,shaft,smooth,thick,and,heavy
the,last,two,feet,of,that,was,steel,a,slender,leaf-shaped,spearhead,narrowing,to,a,wicked,spike
the,edges,looked,sharp,enough,to,shave,with
when,oberyn,spun,the,haft,between,the,palms,of,his,hand,they,glistened,black
oil
or,poison
tyrion,decided,that,he,would,sooner,not,know
i,hope,you,are,good,with,that,he,said,doubtfully
you,will,have,no,cause,for,complaint
though,ser,gregor,may
however,thick,his,plate,there,will,be,gaps,at,the,joints
inside,the,elbow,and,knee,beneath,the,arms
i,will,find,a,place,to,tickle,him,i,promise,you
he,set,the,spear,aside
it,is,said,that,a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts
perhaps,you,will,return,to,sunspear,with,me,when,the,day’s,bloodletting,is,done
my,brother,doran,would,be,most,pleased,to,meet,the,rightful,heir,to,casterly,rock
especially,if,he,brought,his,lovely,wife,the,lady,of,winterfell
does,the,snake,think,i,have,sansa,squirreled,away,somewhere,like,a,nut,i’m,hoarding,for,winter
if,so,tyrion,was,not,about,to,disabuse,him
a,trip,to,dorne,might,be,very,pleasant,now,that,i,reflect,on,it
plan,on,a,lengthy,visit
prince,oberyn,sipped,his,wine
you,and,doran,have,many,matters,of,mutual,interest,to,discuss
music,trade,history,wine,the,dwarf’s,penny
the,laws,of,inheritance,and,succession
no,doubt,an,uncle’s,counsel,would,be,of,benefit,to,queen,myrcella,in,the,trying,times,ahead
if,varys,had,his,little,birds,listening,oberyn,was,giving,them,a,ripe,earful
i,believe,i,will,have,that,cup,of,wine,said,tyrion
queen,myrcella
it,would,have,been,more,tempting,if,only,he,did,have,sansa,tucked,beneath,his,cloak
if,she,declared,for,myrcella,over,tommen,would,the,north,follow
what,the,red,viper,was,hinting,at,was,treason
could,tyrion,truly,take,up,arms,against,tommen,against,his,own,father
cersei,would,spit,blood
it,might,be,worth,it,for,that,alone
do,you,recall,the,tale,i,told,you,of,our,first,meeting,imp
prince,oberyn,asked,as,the,bastard,of,godsgrace,knelt,before,him,to,fasten,his,greaves
it,was,not,for,your,tail,alone,that,my,sister,and,i,came,to,casterly,rock
we,were,on,a,quest,of,sorts
a,quest,that,took,us,to,starfall,the,arbor,oldtown,the,shield,islands,crakehall,and,finally,casterly,rock
but,our,true,destination,was,marriage
doran,was,betrothed,to,lady,mellario,of,norvos,so,he,had,been,left,behind,as,castellan,of,sunspear
my,sister,and,i,were,yet,unpromised
elia,found,it,all,exciting
she,was,of,that,age,and,her,delicate,health,had,never,permitted,her,much,travel
i,preferred,to,amuse,myself,by,mocking,my,sister’s,suitors
there,was,little,lord,lazyeye,squire,squishlips,one,i,named,the,whale,that,walks,that,sort,of,thing
the,only,one,who,was,even,halfway,presentable,was,young,baelor,hightower
a,pretty,lad,and,my,sister,was,half,in,love,with,him,until,he,had,the,misfortune,to,fart,once,in,our,presence
i,promptly,named,him,baelor,breakwind,and,after,that,elia,couldn’t,look,at,him,without,laughing
i,was,a,monstrous,young,fellow,someone,should,have,sliced,out,my,vile,tongue
yes,tyrion,agreed,silently
baelor,hightower,was,no,longer,young,but,he,remained,lord,leyton’s,heir,wealthy,handsome,and,a,knight,of,splendid,repute
baelor,brightsmile,they,called,him,now
had,elia,wed,him,in,place,of,rhaegar,targaryen,she,might,be,in,oldtown,with,her,children,growing,tall,around,her
he,wondered,how,many,lives,had,been,snuffed,out,by,that,fart
lannisport,was,the,end,of,our,voyage,prince,oberyn,went,on,as,ser,arron,qorgyle,helped,him,into,a,padded,leather,tunic,and,began,lacing,it,up,the,back
were,you,aware,that,our,mothers,knew,each,other,of,old
they,had,been,at,court,together,as,girls,i,seem,to,recall
companions,to,princess,rhaella
just,so
it,was,my,belief,that,the,mothers,had,cooked,up,this,plot,between,them
squire,squishlips,and,his,ilk,and,the,various,pimply,young,maidens,who’d,been,paraded,before,me,were,the,almonds,before,the,feast,meant,only,to,whet,our,appetites
the,main,course,was,to,be,served,at,casterly,rock
cersei,and,jaime
such,a,clever,dwarf
elia,and,i,were,older,to,be,sure
your,brother,and,sister,could,not,have,been,more,than,eight,or,nine
still,a,difference,of,five,or,six,years,is,little,enough
and,there,was,an,empty,cabin,on,our,ship,a,very,nice,cabin,such,as,might,be,kept,for,a,person,of,high,birth
as,if,it,were,intended,that,we,take,someone,back,to,sunspear
a,young,page,perhaps
or,a,companion,for,elia
your,lady,mother,meant,to,betroth,jaime,to,my,sister,or,cersei,to,me
perhaps,both
perhaps,said,tyrion,but,my,father,ruled,the,seven,kingdoms,but,was,ruled,at,home,by,his,lady,wife,or,so,my,mother,always,said
prince,oberyn,raised,his,arms,so,lord,dagos,manwoody,and,the,bastard,of,godsgrace,could,slip,a,chainmail,byrnie,down,over,his,head
at,oldtown,we,learned,of,your,mother’s,death,and,the,monstrous,child,she,had,borne
we,might,have,turned,back,there,but,my,mother,chose,to,sail,on
i,told,you,of,the,welcome,we,found,at,casterly,rock
what,i,did,not,tell,you,was,that,my,mother,waited,as,long,as,was,decent,and,then,broached,your,father,about,our,purpose
years,later,on,her,deathbed,she,told,me,that,lord,tywin,had,refused,us,brusquely
his,daughter,was,meant,for,prince,rhaegar,he,informed,her
and,when,she,asked,for,jaime,to,espouse,elia,he,offered,her,you,instead
which,offer,she,took,for,an,outrage
it,was
even,you,can,see,that,surely
oh,surely
it,all,goes,back,and,back,tyrion,thought,to,our,mothers,and,fathers,and,theirs,before,them
we,are,puppets,dancing,on,the,strings,of,those,who,came,before,us,and,one,day,our,own,children,will,take,up,our,strings,and,dance,on,in,our,steads
well,prince,rhaegar,married,elia,of,dorne,not,cersei,lannister,of,casterly,rock
so,it,would,seem,your,mother,won,that,tilt
she,thought,so,prince,oberyn,agreed,but,your,father,is,not,a,man,to,forget,such,slights
he,taught,that,lesson,to,lord,and,lady,tarbeck,once,and,to,the,reynes,of,castamere
and,at,king’s,landing,he,taught,it,to,my,sister
my,helm,dagos
manwoody,handed,it,to,him,a,high,golden,helm,with,a,copper,disk,mounted,on,the,brow,the,sun,of,dorne
the,visor,had,been,removed,tyrion,saw
elia,and,her,children,have,waited,long,for,justice
prince,oberyn,pulled,on,soft,red,leather,gloves,and,took,up,his,spear,again
but,this,day,they,shall,have,it
the,outer,ward,had,been,chosen,for,the,combat
tyrion,had,to,skip,and,run,to,keep,up,with,prince,oberyn’s,long,strides
the,snake,is,eager,he,thought
let,us,hope,he,is,venomous,as,well
the,day,was,grey,and,windy
the,sun,was,struggling,to,break,through,the,clouds,but,tyrion,could,no,more,have,said,who,was,going,to,win,that,fight,than,the,one,on,which,his,life,depended
it,looked,as,though,a,thousand,people,had,come,to,see,if,he,would,live,or,die
they,lined,the,castle,wallwalks,and,elbowed,one,another,on,the,steps,of,keeps,and,towers
they,watched,from,the,stable,doors,from,windows,and,bridges,from,balconies,and,roofs
and,the,yard,was,packed,with,them,so,many,that,the,gold,cloaks,and,the,knights,of,the,kingsguard,had,to,shove,them,back,to,make,enough,room,for,the,fight
some,had,dragged,out,chairs,to,watch,more,comfortably,while,others,perched,on,barrels
we,should,have,done,this,in,the,dragonpit,tyrion,thought,sourly
we,could,have,charged,a,penny,a,head,and,paid,for,joffrey’s,wedding,and,funeral,both
some,of,the,onlookers,even,had,small,children,sitting,on,their,shoulders,to,get,a,better,view
they,shouted,and,pointed,at,the,sight,of,tyrion
cersei,seemed,half,a,child,herself,beside,ser,gregor
in,his,armor,the,mountain,looked,bigger,than,any,man,had,any,right,to,be
beneath,a,long,yellow,surcoat,bearing,the,three,black,dogs,of,clegane,he,wore,heavy,plate,over,chainmail,dull,grey,steel,dinted,and,scarred,in,battle
beneath,that,would,be,boiled,leather,and,a,layer,of,quilting
a,flat-topped,greathelm,was,bolted,to,his,gorget,with,breaths,around,the,mouth,and,nose,and,a,narrow,slit,for,vision
the,crest,atop,it,was,a,stone,fist
if,ser,gregor,was,suffering,from,wounds,tyrion,could,see,no,sign,of,it,from,across,the,yard
he,looks,as,though,he,was,chiseled,out,of,rock,standing,there
his,greatsword,was,planted,in,the,ground,before,him,six,feet,of,scarred,metal
ser,gregor’s,huge,hands,clad,in,gauntlets,of,lobstered,steel,clasped,the,crosshilt,to,either,side,of,the,grip

you,are,going,to,fight,that
ellaria,sand,said,in,a,hushed,voice
i,am,going,to,kill,that,her,lover,replied,carelessly
tyrion,had,his,own,doubts,now,that,they,stood,on,the,brink
when,he,looked,at,prince,oberyn,he,found,himself,wishing,he,had,bronn,defending,him
or,even,better,jaime
the,red,viper,was,lightly,armored,greaves,vambraces,gorget,spaulder,steel,codpiece
elsewise,oberyn,was,clad,in,supple,leather,and,flowing,silks
over,his,byrnie,he,wore,his,scales,of,gleaming,copper,but,mail,and,scale,together,would,not,give,him,a,quarter,the,protection,of,gregor’s,heavy,plate
with,its,visor,removed,the,prince’s,helm,was,effectively,no,better,than,a,halfhelm,lacking,even,a,nasal
his,round,steel,shield,was,brightly,polished,and,showed,the,sun-and-spear,in,red,gold,yellow,gold,white,gold,and,copper
dance,around,him,until,he’s,so,tired,he,can,hardly,lift,his,arm,then,put,him,on,his,back
the,red,viper,seemed,to,have,the,same,notion,as,bronn
but,the,sellsword,had,been,blunt,about,the,risks,of,such,tactics
i,hope,to,seven,hells,that,you,know,what,you,are,doing,snake
a,platform,had,been,erected,beside,the,tower,of,the,hand,halfway,between,the,two,champions
that,was,where,lord,tywin,sat,with,his,brother,ser,kevan
king,tommen,was,not,in,evidence,for,that,at,least,tyrion,was,grateful
lord,tywin,glanced,briefly,at,his,dwarf,son,then,lifted,his,hand
a,dozen,trumpeters,blew,a,fanfare,to,quiet,the,crowd
the,high,septon,shuffled,forward,in,his,tall,crystal,crown,and,prayed,that,the,father,above,would,help,them,in,this,judgment,and,that,the,warrior,would,lend,his,strength,to,the,arm,of,the,man,whose,cause,was,just
that,would,be,me,tyrion,almost,shouted,but,they,would,only,laugh,and,he,was,sick,unto,death,of,laughter
ser,osmund,kettleblack,brought,clegane,his,shield,a,massive,thing,of,heavy,oak,rimmed,in,black,iron

the,kingsguard,tried,to,keep,them,back,shoving,at,the,gawkers,forcefully,with,their,big,white,shields,but,there,were,hundreds,of,gawkers,and,only,six,of,the,men,in,white,armor

the,mountain,howled,at,the,stableboy’s,scream,and,this,time,he,swung,the,blade,sideways,sending,the,top,half,of,the,lad’s,head,across,the,yard,in,a,spray,of,blood,and,brains
hundreds,of,spectators,suddenly,seemed,to,lose,all,interest,in,the,guilt,or,innocence,of,tyrion,lannister,judging,by,the,way,they,pushed,and,shoved,at,each,other,to,escape,the,yard

and,in,that,moment,the,sun,broke,through,the,low,clouds,that,had,hidden,the,sky,since,dawn
the,sun,of,dorne,tyrion,told,himself,but,it,was,gregor,clegane,who,moved,first,to,put,the,sun,at,his,back
this,is,a,dim,and,brutal,man,but,he,has,a,warrior’s,instincts

a,shaft,of,sunlight,blazed,blindingly,off,polished,gold,and,copper,into,the,narrow,slit,of,his,foe’s,helm

the,mountain,reeled,swayed,then,collapsed,face,first,on,the,ground

he,screamed,as,he,drove,the,spear,down,with,the,whole,weight,of,his,body,behind,it
the,crack,of,the,ashwood,shaft,snapping,was,almost,as,sweet,a,sound,as,cersei’s,wail,of,fury,and,for,an,instant,prince,oberyn,had,wings
the,snake,has,vaulted,over,the,mountain
four,feet,of,broken,spear,jutted,from,clegane’s,belly,as,prince,oberyn,rolled,rose,and,dusted,himself,off
he,tossed,aside,the,splintered,spear,and,claimed,his,foe’s,greatsword
if,you,die,before,you,say,her,name,ser,i,will,hunt,you,through,all,seven,hells,he,promised
ser,gregor,tried,to,rise,the,broken,spear,had,gone,through,him,and,was,pinning,him,to,the,ground
he,wrapped,both,hands,about,the,shaft,grunting,but,could,not,pull,it,out
beneath,him,was,a,spreading,pool,of,red
i,am,feeling,more,innocent,by,the,instant,tyrion,told,ellaria,sand,beside,him
prince,oberyn,moved,closer
say,the,name
he,put,a,foot,on,the,mountain’s,chest,and,raised,the,greatsword,with,both,hands
whether,he,intended,to,hack,off,gregor’s,head,or,shove,the,point,through,his,eyeslit,was,something,tyrion,would,never,know
clegane’s,hand,shot,up,and,grabbed,the,dornishman,behind,the,knee
the,red,viper,brought,down,the,greatsword,in,a,wild,slash,but,he,was,off-balance,and,the,edge,did,no,more,than,put,another,dent,in,the,mountain’s,vambrace
then,the,sword,was,forgotten,as,gregor’s,hand,tightened,and,twisted,yanking,the,dornishman,down,on,top,of,him
they,wrestled,in,the,dust,and,blood,the,broken,spear,wobbling,back,and,forth
tyrion,saw,with,horror,that,the,mountain,had,wrapped,one,huge,arm,around,the,prince,drawing,him,tight,against,his,chest,like,a,lover
elia,of,dorne,they,all,heard,ser,gregor,say,when,they,were,close,enough,to,kiss
his,deep,voice,boomed,within,the,helm
i,killed,her,screaming,whelp
he,thrust,his,free,hand,into,oberyn’s,unprotected,face,pushing,steel,fingers,into,his,eyes
then,i,raped,her
clegane,slammed,his,fist,into,the,dornishman’s,mouth,making,splinters,of,his,teeth
then,i,smashed,her,fucking,head,in
like,this
as,he,drew,back,his,huge,fist,the,blood,on,his,gauntlet,seemed,to,smoke,in,the,cold,dawn,air
there,was,a,sickening,crunch
ellaria,sand,wailed,in,terror,and,tyrion’s,breakfast,came,boiling,back,up
he,found,himself,on,his,knees,retching,bacon,and,sausage,and,applecakes,and,that,double,helping,of,fried,eggs,cooked,up,with,onions,and,fiery,dornish,peppers
he,never,heard,his,father,speak,the,words,that,condemned,him
perhaps,no,words,were,necessary
i,put,my,life,in,the,red,viper’s,hands,and,he,dropped,it
when,he,remembered,too,late,that,snakes,had,no,hands,tyrion,began,to,laugh,hysterically
he,was,halfway,down,the,serpentine,steps,before,he,realized,that,the,gold,cloaks,were,not,taking,him,back,to,his,tower,room
i’ve,been,consigned,to,the,black,cells,he,said
they,did,not,bother,to,answer
why,waste,your,breath,on,the,dead
daenerys,dany,broke,her,fast,under,the,persimmon,tree,that,grew,in,the,terrace,garden,watching,her,dragons,chase,each,other,about,the,apex,of,the,great,pyramid,where,the,huge,bronze,harpy,once,stood
meereen,had,a,score,of,lesser,pyramids,but,none,stood,even,half,as,tall
from,here,she,could,see,the,whole,city,the,narrow,twisty,alleys,and,wide,brick,streets,the,temples,and,granaries,hovels,and,palaces,brothels,and,baths,gardens,and,fountains,the,great,red,circles,of,the,fighting,pits
and,beyond,the,walls,was,the,pewter,sea,the,winding,skahazadhan,the,dry,brown,hills,burnt,orchards,and,blackened,fields
up,here,in,her,garden,dany,sometimes,felt,like,a,god,living,atop,the,highest,mountain,in,the,world
do,all,gods,feel,so,lonely
some,must,surely
missandei,had,told,her,of,the,lord,of,harmony,worshiped,by,the,peaceful,people,of,naath,he,was,the,only,true,god,her,little,scribe,said,the,god,who,always,was,and,always,would,be,who,made,the,moon,and,stars,and,earth,and,all,the,creatures,that,dwelt,upon,them
poor,lord,of,harmony
dany,pitied,him
it,must,be,terrible,to,be,alone,for,all,time,attended,by,hordes,of,butterfly,women,you,could,make,or,unmake,at,a,word
westeros,had,seven,gods,at,least,though,viserys,had,told,her,that,some,septons,said,the,seven,were,only,aspects,of,a,single,god,seven,facets,of,a,single,crystal
that,was,just,confusing
the,red,priests,believed,in,two,gods,she,had,heard,but,two,who,were,eternally,at,war
dany,liked,that,even,less
she,would,not,want,to,be,eternally,at,war
missandei,served,her,duck,eggs,and,dog,sausage,and,half,a,cup,of,sweetened,wine,mixed,with,the,juice,of,a,lime
the,honey,drew,flies,but,a,scented,candle,drove,them,off
the,flies,were,not,so,troublesome,up,here,as,they,were,in,the,rest,of,her,city,she,had,found,something,else,she,liked,about,the,pyramid
i,must,remember,to,do,something,about,the,flies,dany,said
are,there,many,flies,on,naath,missandei
on,naath,there,are,butterflies,the,scribe,responded,in,the,common,tongue
more,wine

dany,had,grown,very,fond,of,missandei
the,little,scribe,with,the,big,golden,eyes,was,wise,beyond,her,years
she,is,brave,as,well
she,had,to,be,to,survive,the,life,she’s,lived
one,day,she,hoped,to,see,this,fabled,isle,of,naath
missandei,said,the,peaceful,people,made,music,instead,of,war
they,did,not,kill,not,even,animals,they,ate,only,fruit,and,never,flesh
the,butterfly,spirits,sacred,to,their,lord,of,harmony,protected,their,isle,against,those,who,would,do,them,harm
many,conquerors,had,sailed,on,naath,to,blood,their,swords,only,to,sicken,and,die
the,butterflies,do,not,help,them,when,the,slave,ships,come,raiding,though
i,am,going,to,take,you,home,one,day,missandei,dany,promised

her,slippers,were,silver,as,well,with,heels,so,high,that,she,was,always,half,afraid,she,was,about,to,topple,over
when,she,was,dressed,missandei,brought,her,a,polished,silver,glass,so,she,could,see,how,she,looked
dany,stared,at,herself,in,silence
is,this,the,face,of,a,conqueror
so,far,as,she,could,tell,she,still,looked,like,a,little,girl
no,one,was,calling,her,daenerys,the,conqueror,yet,but,perhaps,they,would
aegon,the,conqueror,had,won,westeros,with,three,dragons,but,she,had,taken,meereen,with,sewer,rats,and,a,wooden,cock,in,less,than,a,day
poor,groleo
he,still,grieved,for,his,ship,she,knew
if,a,war,galley,could,ram,another,ship,why,not,a,gate
that,had,been,her,thought,when,she,commanded,the,captains,to,drive,their,ships,ashore
their,masts,had,become,her,battering,rams,and,swarms,of,freedmen,had,torn,their,hulls,apart,to,build,mantlets,turtles,catapults,and,ladders

dany,had,wanted,to,lead,the,attack,herself,but,to,a,man,her,captains,said,that,would,be,madness,and,her,captains,never,agreed,on,anything
instead,she,remained,in,the,rear,sitting,atop,her,silver,in,a,long,shirt,of,mail
she,heard,the,city,fall,from,half,a,league,away,though,when,the,defenders’,shouts,of,defiance,changed,to,cries,of,fear
her,dragons,had,roared,as,one,in,that,moment,filling,the,night,with,flame
the,slaves,are,rising,she,knew,at,once
my,sewer,rats,have,gnawed,off,their,chains
when,the,last,resistance,had,been,crushed,by,the,unsullied,and,the,sack,had,run,its,course,dany,entered,her,city
the,dead,were,heaped,so,high,before,the,broken,gate,that,it,took,her,freedmen,near,an,hour,to,make,a,path,for,her,silver
joso’s,cock,and,the,great,wooden,turtle,that,had,protected,it,covered,with,horsehides,lay,abandoned,within
she,rode,past,burned,buildings,and,broken,windows,through,brick,streets,where,the,gutters,were,choked,with,the,stiff,and,swollen,dead
cheering,slaves,lifted,bloodstained,hands,to,her,as,she,went,by,and,called,her,mother
in,the,plaza,before,the,great,pyramid,the,meereenese,huddled,forlorn
the,great,masters,had,looked,anything,but,great,in,the,morning,light

one,hundred,and,sixty-three,she,answered
she,had,them,nailed,to,wooden,posts,around,the,plaza,each,man,pointing,at,the,next
the,anger,was,fierce,and,hot,inside,her,when,she,gave,the,command,it,made,her,feel,like,an,avenging,dragon

dany,put,the,glass,aside,frowning
it,was,just

there,had,been,a,throne,there,a,fantastic,thing,of,carved,and,gilded,wood,in,the,shape,of,a,savage,harpy
she,had,taken,one,long,look,and,commanded,it,be,broken,up,for,firewood
i,will,not,sit,in,the,harpy’s,lap,she,told,them
instead,she,sat,upon,a,simple,ebony,bench
it,served,though,she,had,heard,the,meereenese,muttering,that,it,did,not,befit,a,queen
her,bloodriders,were,waiting,for,her

noble,ghael,said,missandei,in,the,dialect,of,astapor,is,this,the,same,cleon,once,owned,by,grazdan,mo,ullhor

how,noble,of,him,said,dany
i,will,consider,all,you’ve,said,my,lord
she,gave,orders,that,ghael,be,given,chambers,for,the,night,somewhere,lower,in,the,pyramid
all,my,victories,turn,to,dross,in,my,hands,she,thought
whatever,i,do,all,i,make,is,death,and,horror
when,word,of,what,had,befallen,astapor,reached,the,streets,as,it,surely,would,tens,of,thousands,of,newly,freed,meereenese,slaves,would,doubtless,decide,to,follow,her,when,she,went,west,for,fear,of,what,awaited,them,if,they,stayed
yet,it,might,well,be,that,worse,would,await,them,on,the,march
even,if,she,emptied,every,granary,in,the,city,and,left,meereen,to,starve,how,could,she,feed,so,many
the,way,before,her,was,fraught,with,hardship,bloodshed,and,danger
ser,jorah,had,warned,her,of,that
he’d,warned,her,of,so,many,things
he’d
no,i,will,not,think,of,jorah,mormont
let,him,keep,a,little,longer
i,shall,see,this,trader,captain,she,announced
perhaps,he,would,have,some,better,tidings
that,proved,to,be,a,forlorn,hope
the,master,of,the,indigo,star,was,qartheen,so,he,wept,copiously,when,asked,about,astapor
the,city,bleeds
dead,men,rot,unburied,in,the,streets,each,pyramid,is,an,armed,camp,and,the,markets,have,neither,food,nor,slaves,for,sale
and,the,poor,children
king,cleaver’s,thugs,have,seized,every,highborn,boy,in,astapor,to,make,new,unsullied,for,the,trade,though,it,will,be,years,before,they,are,trained
the,thing,that,surprised,dany,most,was,how,unsurprised,she,was
she,found,herself,remembering,eroeh,the,lhazarene,girl,she,had,once,tried,to,protect,and,what,had,happened,to,her
it,will,be,the,same,in,meereen,once,i,march,she,thought
the,slaves,from,the,fighting,pits,bred,and,trained,to,slaughter,were,already,proving,themselves,unruly,and,quarrelsome
they,seemed,to,think,they,owned,the,city,now,and,every,man,and,woman,in,it
two,of,them,had,been,among,the,eight,she’d,hanged
there,is,no,more,i,can,do,she,told,herself
what,do,you,want,of,me,captain
slaves,he,said
my,holds,are,full,to,bursting,with,ivory,ambergris,zorse,hides,and,other,fine,goods
i,would,trade,them,here,for,slaves,to,sell,in,lys,and,volantis
we,have,no,slaves,for,sale,said,dany
my,queen
daario,stepped,forward
the,riverside,is,full,of,meereenese,begging,leave,to,be,allowed,to,sell,themselves,to,this,qartheen
they,are,thicker,than,the,flies
dany,was,shocked
they,want,to,be,slaves
the,ones,who,come,are,well,spoken,and,gently,born,sweet,queen
such,slaves,are,prized
in,the,free,cities,they,will,be,tutors,scribes,bed,slaves,even,healers,and,priests
they,will,sleep,in,soft,beds,eat,rich,foods,and,dwell,in,manses
here,they,have,lost,all,and,live,in,fear,and,squalor
i,see
perhaps,it,was,not,so,shocking,if,these,tales,of,astapor,were,true
dany,thought,a,moment
any,man,who,wishes,to,sell,himself,into,slavery,may,do,so
or,woman
she,raised,a,hand
but,they,may,not,sell,their,children,nor,a,man,his,wife

when,i,sent,you,down,into,the,sewers,part,of,me,hoped,i’d,seen,the,last,of,you
it,seemed,a,fitting,end,for,liars,to,drown,in,slavers’,filth

my,gallant,knights,of,westeros,an,informer,and,a,turncloak

but,that,was,only,to,hide,their,true,purpose
as,the,flaming,ships,drew,the,eyes,of,the,defenders,on,the,walls,a,few,half-mad,swimmers,found,the,sewer,mouths,and,pried,loose,a,rusted,iron,grating
ser,jorah,ser,barristan,strong,belwas,and,twenty,brave,fools,slipped,beneath,the,brown,water,and,up,the,brick,tunnel,a,mixed,force,of,sellswords,unsullied,and,freedmen
dany,had,told,them,to,choose,only,men,who,had,no,families
and,preferably,no,sense,of,smell
they,had,been,lucky,as,well,as,brave
it,had,been,a,moon’s,turn,since,the,last,good,rain,and,the,sewers,were,only,thigh-high
the,oilcloth,they’d,wrapped,around,their,torches,kept,them,dry,so,they,had,light
a,few,of,the,freedmen,were,frightened,of,the,huge,rats,until,strong,belwas,caught,one,and,bit,it,in,two
one,man,was,killed,by,a,great,pale,lizard,that,reared,up,out,of,the,dark,water,to,drag,him,off,by,the,leg,but,when,next,ripples,were,spied,ser,jorah,butchered,the,beast,with,his,blade

and,you,have,served,me,well,in,the,past
ser,barristan,saved,me,from,the,titan’s,bastard,and,from,the,sorrowful,man,in,qarth
ser,jorah,saved,me,from,the,poisoner,in,vaes,dothrak,and,again,from,drogo’s,bloodriders,after,my,sun-and-stars,had,died
so,many,people,wanted,her,dead,sometimes,she,lost,count

you,protected,my,father,for,many,years,fought,beside,my,brother,on,the,trident,but,you,abandoned,viserys,in,his,exile,and,bent,your,knee,to,the,usurper,instead
why
and,tell,it,true
some,truths,are,hard,to,hear
robert,was,a
a,good,knight
chivalrous,brave
he,spared,my,life,and,the,lives,of,many,others
prince,viserys,was,only,a,boy,it,would,have,been,years,before,he,was,fit,to,rule,and
forgive,me,my,queen,but,you,asked,for,truth
even,as,a,child,your,brother,viserys,oft,seemed,to,be,his,father’s,son,in,ways,that,rhaegar,never,did
his,father’s,son
dany,frowned

viserys,did
the,mad,king
the,usurper,called,him,that,the,usurper,and,his,dogs
the,mad,king
it,was,a,lie
why,ask,for,truth,ser,barristan,said,softly,if,you,close,your,ears,to,it
he,hesitated,then,continued
i,told,you,before,that,i,used,a,false,name,so,the,lannisters,would,not,know,that,i’d,joined,you
that,was,less,than,half,of,it,your,grace
the,truth,is,i,wanted,to,watch,you,for,a,time,before,pledging,you,my,sword
to,make,certain,that,you,were,not

my,father’s,daughter
if,she,was,not,her,father’s,daughter,who,was,she

but,every,child,knows,that,the,targaryens,have,always,danced,too,close,to,madness
your,father,was,not,the,first
king,jaehaerys,once,told,me,that,madness,and,greatness,are,two,sides,of,the,same,coin
every,time,a,new,targaryen,is,born,he,said,the,gods,toss,the,coin,in,the,air,and,the,world,holds,its,breath,to,see,how,it,will,land
jaehaerys
this,old,man,knew,my,grandfather
the,thought,gave,her,pause
most,of,what,she,knew,of,westeros,had,come,from,her,brother,and,the,rest,from,ser,jorah
ser,barristan,would,have,forgotten,more,than,the,two,of,them,had,ever,known
this,man,can,tell,me,what,i,came,from
so,i,am,a,coin,in,the,hands,of,some,god,is,that,what,you,are,saying,ser
no,ser,barristan,replied
you,are,the,trueborn,heir,of,westeros
to,the,end,of,my,days,i,shall,remain,your,faithful,knight,should,you,find,me,worthy,to,bear,a,sword,again
if,not,i,am,content,to,serve,strong,belwas,as,his,squire

only,from,the,hand,of,my,queen,will,i,accept,a,sword,again
as,you,wish
dany,took,the,sword,from,brown,ben,and,offered,it,hilt,first
the,old,man,took,it,reverently
now,kneel,she,told,him,and,swear,it,to,my,service
he,went,to,one,knee,and,lay,the,blade,before,her,as,he,said,the,words
dany,scarcely,heard,them

she,saw,him,entering,a,hall,built,of,huge,logs,where,dogs,slept,by,the,hearth,and,the,smell,of,meat,and,mead,hung,thick,in,the,smoky,air
we,are,done,for,now,she,told,her,captains

children’s,stories,if,truth,be,told,too,simple,and,fanciful,to,be,true,history
all,the,heroes,were,tall,and,handsome,and,you,could,tell,the,traitors,by,their,shifty,eyes
yet,she,loved,them,all,the,same
last,night,she,had,been,reading,of,the,three,princesses,in,the,red,tower,locked,away,by,the,king,for,the,crime,of,being,beautiful
when,her,handmaid,brought,the,book,dany,had,no,trouble,finding,the,page,where,she,had,left,off,but,it,was,no,good
she,found,herself,reading,the,same,passage,half,a,dozen,times
ser,jorah,gave,me,this,book,as,a,bride’s,gift,the,day,i,wed,khal,drogo
but,daario,is,right,i,shouldn’t,have,banished,him
i,should,have,kept,him,or,i,should,have,killed,him
she,played,at,being,a,queen,yet,sometimes,she,still,felt,like,a,scared,little,girl

there,was,no,sign,of,viserion,but,when,she,went,to,the,parapet,and,scanned,the,horizon,she,saw,pale,wings,in,the,far,distance,sweeping,above,the,river
he,is,hunting
they,grow,bolder,every,day
yet,it,still,made,her,anxious,when,they,flew,too,far,away
one,day,one,of,them,may,not,return,she,thought
your,grace
she,turned,to,find,ser,barristan,behind,her
what,more,would,you,have,of,me,ser
i,spared,you,i,took,you,into,my,service,now,give,me,some,peace

a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,is,in,the,king’s,presence,day,and,night
for,that,reason,our,vows,require,us,to,protect,his,secrets,as,we,would,his,life
but,your,father’s,secrets,by,rights,belong,to,you,now,along,with,his,throne,and
i,thought,perhaps,you,might,have,questions,for,me
questions
she,had,a,hundred,questions,a,thousand,ten,thousand
why,couldn’t,she,think,of,one
was,my,father,truly,mad
she,blurted,out
why,do,i,ask,that
viserys,said,this,talk,of,madness,was,a,ploy,of,the,usurper’s
viserys,was,a,child,and,the,queen,sheltered,him,as,much,as,she,could
your,father,always,had,a,little,madness,in,him,i,now,believe
yet,he,was,charming,and,generous,as,well,so,his,lapses,were,forgiven
his,reign,began,with,such,promise
but,as,the,years,passed,the,lapses,grew,more,frequent,until
dany,stopped,him
do,i,want,to,hear,this,now
ser,barristan,considered,a,moment
perhaps,not
not,now
not,now,she,agreed
one,day
one,day,you,must,tell,me,all
the,good,and,the,bad
there,is,some,good,to,be,said,of,my,father,surely
there,is,your,grace
of,him,and,those,who,came,before,him
your,grandfather,jaehaerys,and,his,brother,their,father,aegon,your,mother
and,rhaegar
him,most,of,all
i,wish,i,could,have,known,him
her,voice,was,wistful
i,wish,he,could,have,known,you,the,old,knight,said
when,you,are,ready,i,will,tell,you,all
dany,kissed,him,on,the,cheek,and,sent,him,on,his,way
that,night,her,handmaids,brought,her,lamb,with,a,salad,of,raisins,and,carrots,soaked,in,wine,and,a,hot,flaky,bread,dripping,with,honey
she,could,eat,none,of,it
did,rhaegar,ever,grow,so,weary
she,wondered
did,aegon,after,his,conquest
later,when,the,time,came,for,sleep,dany,took,irri,into,bed,with,her,for,the,first,time,since,the,ship
but,even,as,she,shuddered,in,release,and,wound,her,fingers,through,her,handmaid’s,thick,black,hair,she,pretended,it,was,drogo,holding,her
only,somehow,his,face,kept,turning,into,daario’s
if,i,want,daario,i,need,only,say,so
she,lay,with,irri’s,legs,entangled,in,her,own
his,eyes,looked,almost,purple,today
dany’s,dreams,were,dark,that,night,and,she,woke,three,times,from,half-remembered,nightmares
after,the,third,time,she,was,too,restless,to,return,to,sleep
moonlight,streamed,through,the,slanting,windows,silvering,the,marble,floors
a,cool,breeze,was,blowing,through,the,open,terrace,doors
irri,slept,soundly,beside,her,her,lips,slightly,parted,one,dark,brown,nipple,peeping,out,above,the,sleeping,silks
for,a,moment,dany,was,tempted,but,it,was,drogo,she,wanted,or,perhaps,daario
not,irri
the,maid,was,sweet,and,skillful,but,all,her,kisses,tasted,of,duty
she,rose,leaving,irri,asleep,in,the,moonlight

grey,it,was,like,the,dress,beneath,it,and,trimmed,with,white,satin
the,clasp,that,pinned,it,to,her,breast,was,wrought,in,the,shape,of,a,wolf’s,head,with,slitted,opal,eyes
the,girl’s,long,brown,hair,blew,wild,in,the,wind

the,northman,grinned
a,lannister,always,pays,his,debts
always,said,jaime,with,a,last,glance,at,the,girl
he,wondered,if,there,was,much,resemblance
not,that,it,mattered
the,real,arya,stark,was,buried,in,some,unmarked,grave,in,flea,bottom,in,all,likelihood
with,her,brothers,dead,and,both,parents,who,would,dare,name,this,one,a,fraud
good,speed,he,told,steelshanks
nage,raised,his,peace,banner,and,the,northmen,formed,a,column,as,ragged,as,their,fur,cloaks,and,trotted,out,the,castle,gate
the,thin,girl,on,the,grey,mare,looked,small,and,forlorn,in,their,midst
a,few,of,the,horses,still,shied,away,from,the,dark,splotch,on,the,hard-packed,ground,where,the,earth,had,drunk,the,life’s,blood,of,the,stableboy,gregor,clegane,had,killed,so,clumsily
the,sight,of,it,made,jaime,angry,all,over,again
he,had,told,his,kingsguard,to,keep,the,crowd,out,of,the,way,but,that,oaf,ser,boros,had,let,himself,be,distracted,by,the,duel
the,fool,boy,himself,shared,some,of,the,blame,to,be,sure,the,dead,dornishman,as,well
and,clegane,most,of,all
the,blow,that,took,the,boy’s,arm,off,had,been,mischance,but,that,second,cut
well,gregor,is,paying,for,it,now
grand,maester,pycelle,was,tending,to,the,man’s,wounds,but,the,howls,heard,ringing,from,the,maester’s,chambers,suggested,that,the,healing,was,not,going,as,well,as,it,might
the,flesh,mortifies,and,the,wounds,ooze,pus,pycelle,told,the,council
even,maggots,will,not,touch,such,foulness
his,convulsions,are,so,violent,that,i,have,had,to,gag,him,to,prevent,him,from,biting,off,his,tongue
i,have,cut,away,as,much,tissue,as,i,dare,and,treated,the,rot,with,boiling,wine,and,bread,mold,to,no,avail
the,veins,in,his,arm,are,turning,black
when,i,leeched,him,all,the,leeches,died
my,lords,i,must,know,what,malignant,substance,prince,oberyn,used,on,his,spear
let,us,detain,these,other,dornishmen,until,they,are,more,forthcoming
lord,tywin,had,refused,him
there,will,be,trouble,enough,with,sunspear,over,prince,oberyn’s,death
i,do,not,mean,to,make,matters,worse,by,holding,his,companions,captive
then,i,fear,ser,gregor,may,die
undoubtedly
i,swore,as,much,in,the,letter,i,sent,to,prince,doran,with,his,brother’s,body
but,it,must,be,seen,to,be,the,sword,of,the,king’s,justice,that,slays,him,not,a,poisoned,spear
heal,him
grand,maester,pycelle,blinked,in,dismay
my,lord,heal,him,lord,tywin,said,again,vexed
you,are,aware,that,lord,varys,has,sent,fishermen,into,the,waters,around,dragonstone
they,report,that,only,a,token,force,remains,to,defend,the,island
the,lyseni,are,gone,from,the,bay,and,the,great,part,of,lord,stannis’s,strength,with,them
well,and,good,announced,pycelle
let,stannis,rot,in,lys,i,say
we,are,well,rid,of,the,man,and,his,ambitions
did,you,turn,into,an,utter,fool,when,tyrion,shaved,your,beard
this,is,stannis,baratheon
the,man,will,fight,to,the,bitter,end,and,then,some
if,he,is,gone,it,can,only,mean,he,intends,to,resume,the,war
most,likely,he,will,land,at,storm’s,end,and,try,and,rouse,the,storm,lords
if,so,he’s,finished
but,a,bolder,man,might,roll,the,dice,for,dorne
if,he,should,win,sunspear,to,his,cause,he,might,prolong,this,war,for,years
so,we,will,not,offend,the,martells,any,further,for,any,reason
the,dornishmen,are,free,to,go,and,you,will,heal,ser,gregor
and,so,the,mountain,screamed,day,and,night
lord,tywin,lannister,could,cow,even,the,stranger,it,would,seem
as,jaime,climbed,the,winding,steps,of,white,sword,tower,he,could,hear,ser,boros,snoring,in,his,cell
ser,balon’s,door,was,shut,as,well,he,had,the,king,tonight,and,would,sleep,all,day
aside,from,blount’s,snores,the,tower,was,very,quiet
that,suited,jaime,well,enough
i,ought,to,rest,myself
last,night,after,his,dance,with,ser,addam,he’d,been,too,sore,to,sleep
but,when,he,stepped,into,his,bedchamber,he,found,his,sister,waiting,for,him
she,stood,beside,the,open,window,looking,over,the,curtain,walls,and,out,to,sea
the,bay,wind,swirled,around,her,flattening,her,gown,against,her,body,in,a,way,that,quickened,jaime’s,pulse
it,was,white,that,gown,like,the,hangings,on,the,wall,and,the,draperies,on,his,bed
swirls,of,tiny,emeralds,brightened,the,ends,of,her,wide,sleeves,and,spiraled,down,her,bodice
larger,emeralds,were,set,in,the,golden,spiderweb,that,bound,her,golden,hair
the,gown,was,cut,low,to,bare,her,shoulders,and,the,tops,of,her,breasts
she,is,so,beautiful
he,wanted,nothing,more,than,to,take,her,in,his,arms
cersei
he,closed,the,door,softly
why,are,you,here
where,else,could,i,go
when,she,turned,to,him,there,were,tears,in,her,eyes
father’s,made,it,clear,that,i,am,no,longer,wanted,on,the,council
jaime,won’t,you,talk,to,him
jaime,took,off,his,cloak,and,hung,it,from,a,peg,on,the,wall
i,talk,to,lord,tywin,every,day
must,you,be,so,stubborn
all,he,wants

is,to,force,me,from,the,kingsguard,and,send,me,back,to,casterly,rock
that,need,not,be,so,terrible
he,is,sending,me,back,to,casterly,rock,as,well
he,wants,me,far,away,so,he’ll,have,a,free,hand,with,tommen
tommen,is,my,son,not,his
tommen,is,the,king
he,is,a,boy
a,frightened,little,boy,who,saw,his,brother,murdered,at,his,own,wedding
and,now,they,are,telling,him,that,he,must,marry
the,girl,is,twice,his,age,and,twice,a,widow
he,eased,himself,into,a,chair,trying,to,ignore,the,ache,of,bruised,muscles
the,tyrells,are,insisting
i,see,no,harm,in,it
tommen’s,been,lonely,since,myrcella,went,to,dorne
he,likes,having,margaery,and,her,ladies,about
let,them,wed,he,is,your,son
he,is,my,seed
he’s,never,called,me,father
no,more,than,joffrey,ever,did
you,warned,me,a,thousand,times,never,to,show,any,undue,interest,in,them
to,keep,them,safe
you,as,well
how,would,it,have,looked,if,my,brother,had,played,the,father,to,the,king’s,children
even,robert,might,have,grown,suspicious
well,he’s,beyond,suspicion,now
robert’s,death,still,left,a,bitter,taste,in,jaime’s,mouth
it,should,have,been,me,who,killed,him,not,cersei
i,only,wished,he’d,died,at,my,hands
when,i,still,had,two,of,them
if,i’d,let,kingslaying,become,a,habit,as,he,liked,to,say,i,could,have,taken,you,as,my,wife,for,all,the,world,to,see
i’m,not,ashamed,of,loving,you,only,of,the,things,i’ve,done,to,hide,it
that,boy,at,winterfell
did,i,tell,you,to,throw,him,out,the,window
if,you’d,gone,hunting,as,i,begged,you,nothing,would,have,happened
but,no,you,had,to,have,me,you,could,not,wait,until,we,returned,to,the,city
i’d,waited,long,enough
i,hated,watching,robert,stumble,to,your,bed,every,night,always,wondering,if,maybe,this,night,he’d,decide,to,claim,his,rights,as,husband
jaime,suddenly,remembered,something,else,that,troubled,him,about,winterfell
at,riverrun,catelyn,stark,seemed,convinced,i’d,sent,some,footpad,to,slit,her,son’s,throat
that,i’d,given,him,a,dagger
that,she,said,scornfully
tyrion,asked,me,about,that
there,was,a,dagger
the,scars,on,lady,catelyn’s,hands,were,real,enough,she,showed,them,to,me
did,you

oh,don’t,be,absurd
cersei,closed,the,window
yes,i,hoped,the,boy,would,die
so,did,you
even,robert,thought,that,would,have,been,for,the,best
we,kill,our,horses,when,they,break,a,leg,and,our,dogs,when,they,go,blind,but,we,are,too,weak,to,give,the,same,mercy,to,crippled,children,’,he,told,me
he,was,blind,himself,at,the,time,from,drink
robert
jaime,had,guarded,the,king,long,enough,to,know,that,robert,baratheon,said,things,in,his,cups,that,he,would,have,denied,angrily,the,next,day
were,you,alone,when,robert,said,this
you,don’t,think,he,said,it,to,ned,stark,i,hope
of,course,we,were,alone
us,and,the,children
cersei,removed,her,hairnet,and,draped,it,over,a,bedpost,then,shook,out,her,golden,curls
perhaps,myrcella,sent,this,man,with,the,dagger,do,you,think,so
it,was,meant,as,mockery,but,she’d,cut,right,to,the,heart,of,it,jaime,saw,at,once
not,myrcella
joffrey
cersei,frowned
joffrey,had,no,love,for,robb,stark,but,the,younger,boy,was,nothing,to,him
he,was,only,a,child,himself
a,child,hungry,for,a,pat,on,the,head,from,that,sot,you,let,him,believe,was,his,father
he,had,an,uncomfortable,thought
tyrion,almost,died,because,of,this,bloody,dagger
if,he,knew,the,whole,thing,was,joffrey’s,work,that,might,be,why
i,don’t,care,why,cersei,said
